One of the nation’s leading medical institutes said that the specialized center in southwestern Seoul was part of the EUMC’s efforts to sharpen its competitiveness in organ transplants -- one of its key fields of expertise -- before unveiling its second hospital in Seoul in 2018.Headed by director and surgeon Jung Gu-yong, the Organ Transplantation Center has expanded medical staff specializing in carrying out heart and lung transplants.Jung stressed the need for a “comprehensive” system to manage various organ transplants to accumulate expertise and know-how in the transplant sector. “We plan to focus on expanding our medical services into heart (and) lung transplants based on our know-how in kidney and liver transplants,” Jung said. “It is important to successfully conduct an organ transplant surgery through intensive care. But it is also important to make the surgery successful in the long term by closely checking on the state of patients’ health through immune system modulation and nutritive controls,” he said. “We will make the utmost efforts to provide top quality medical services for patients waiting for organ transplants.”Founded in 1887 by an American missionary as the nation’s first women-only hospital, it has run several specialized centers, including the Cancer Center for Women, known for its contribution to treating breast, ovarian and other cancers affecting women.By Ock Hyun-ju(laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","hospital opens organ transplant ,competitiveness in organ transplants ,opens organ transplant center ,opens organ transplant ,opened the organ transplantation","['Ewha Womans University Medical Center', 'the Organ Transplantation Center', 'Seoul', 'the EUMC ’s']",2,"[ 1.          1.          1.         ... -0.3123897   0.29752705

Its embassy in Nepal was damaged in the same month following a massive earthquake in the Himalayan country.The ministry said there is a need to increase security as the threat of ISIL and other terrorist organizations is on the rise, requiring additional precautions to be taken.The extra money will go to the hiring of more security guards, armored vehicles for embassy staff and the relocation of the South Korean Embassy in Iraq to the so-called safe Green Zone within Baghdad.  In addition, more money will allow the hiring of 22 new assistants to support counselor services for Korean nationals abroad.The ministry said that 1.3 billion won has been reserved to charter passenger jets in the event that people have to be evacuated from trouble spots quickly, with a further 150 million won to be used to get security-related consulting.

The ministry allocated a total of 532.2 billion won for all of its research and development projects, including research for cancer, chronic diseases and infectious diseases. Next year’s budget for the specific cause is 7.6 billion won more than the budget this year.Among all projects, research for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer and chronic diseases will receive 131.1 billion won. Research projects that aim to come up with new medical technologies and businesses will be given 172.3 billion won. For research projects for infectious diseases such as MERS, the ministry set aside 52.5 billion won. The government is also to invest 85.4 billion won in building research-focused hospitals.The Health Ministry and its affiliate the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have received much public criticism this year for their handling of a number of public health disasters, including the MERS outbreak, which had 186 confirmed cases and claimed 38 lives here.The outbreak dramatically affected everyday lives of Koreans and the economy, while the country’s overall health care system and hospital culture were questioned. In October, a total of 55 graduate students at Konkuk University collectively developed pneumonia after working at three laboratories in the College of Animal Bioscience and Technology building. It was later revealed the infected students had been exposed to Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula, a bacteria that causes hypersensitivity pneumonitis, an inflammation of the alveoli within the lung triggered by inhaled dust.In September, it was revealed that some 120 infants were exposed to tuberculosis while staying at a postpartum center in Seoul from June 4 to Aug. 18, after one of the nurses had been diagnosed with the disease, but came to work regardless. To better handle infectious diseases in the future, the Health Ministry earlier this year announced that all general hospitals with 300 or more patient beds in Korea would be required to establish negative air pressure rooms to prevent cross-contamination. It also announced plans to hire epidemiologists, who will be the first responders to public health emergencies by investigating disease outbreaks and detecting new microbes.However, the ministry recently revealed that the number of medical professionals who applied for the positions fell short of the number of people needed. The ministry was planning on hiring seven professionals with at least six years of experience as certified physicians as epidemiologists, but less than seven doctors applied for the positions, the ministry said.Critics have pointed out that the particular positions should be regular full-time positions, instead of the current two-year contract posts. And without job security, not many medical professionals would be interested in the positions.Meanwhile, former Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo, who was replaced by President Park Geun-hye for his inept handling of the MERS outbreak, has been controversially nominated to be the head of the state-run National Pension Service. Moon, a former economist whose expertise was in pension reform, has been openly against the main opposition party New Politics Alliance for Democracy’s plan to increase the retirement income replacement rate to 50 percent from the previous 40 percent. Public Pension for All, a nongovernmental organization, held a rally in front of the National Pension Service building in Seoul, protesting against the Health Ministry’s decision to nominate Moon as the head of the state-run agency on Monday.

3,3,Media watchdog restricts foreign language use in TV ads,"South Korea’s state-appointed media monitoring agency said Sunday that it has set out specific guidelines to restrict the use of foreign languages in TV commercials.　According to the guidelines for the nation’s broadcasters by the Korea Communications Standards Commission, TV advertisements are now banned from containing foreign languages or songs for more than 15 seconds -- half of the 30-second time slot. 　The ...","South Korea’s state-appointed media monitoring agency said Sunday that it has set out specific guidelines to restrict the use of foreign languages in TV commercials.According to the guidelines for the nation’s broadcasters by the Korea Communications Standards Commission, TV advertisements are now banned from containing foreign languages or songs for more than 15 seconds -- half of the 30-second time slot. The regulation covers the narrative of product slogans, company names and catchphrases spoken or written in foreign languages. When foreign languages are used, Korean subtitles should be added to offer enough information for local viewers, the agency said. The current broadcasting law states that TV commercials must use a standard language, abide by rules for Korean spelling system and loanword adaptation. It also prohibits unnecessary use of foreign languages. But there has been no specific clause stipulating the time limit for foreign languages in TV ads. “To reflect the growing use of foreign languages in TV commercials and better enforce the law, we specifically set the time limit for foreign language use in TV ads,” the agency said. In February, French cosmetic brand Christian Dior and Japanese clothing brand Uniqlo were cautioned for using all-English narrative of their products -- perfume J’adore and clothes Heattech, respectively -- in their ads that aired on cable-TV channels last year. The KCSC offered recommendations to the companies, addressing the public role of language used on TV. “The society has become more accepting of English and the use of foreign languages reflects the changing social atmosphere. But those who are not familiar with English or having difficulties in reading Korean subtitles can possibly be excluded. And a flood of foreign language use can have an impact on teenagers,” the agency said in its deliberation.According to reports from the National Institute of Korean Language obtained by Jung Jin-hoo of the minor opposition Justice Party, a total of 6,815 TV commercials and programs breached the “correct” language use rule on TV last year. Of them, 31.9 percent were caught after using unnecessary foreign languages, followed by 25. 7 percent having errors in subtitles, 10.9 percent using online words and 10.1 percent using defamatory language. But the guidelines will likely rekindle a long-held debate over the state’s restrictions on commercial freedom of expression. The controversy dates back to 2002 when the then-industry ministry suggested that the media agency allow advertisers to use foreign languages and songs in TV ads to help companies better promote their brands amid globalization. The advertisers’ association campaigned to scrap restrictions on foreign language uses in TV commercials, saying that such a ban stifles freedom of expression and creativity. It also added that the ban discourages multinational companies from promoting their image, fails to live up to global standards and fails to meet consumers’ diversifying tastes.The claims, however, triggered resistance from the Culture Ministry and Korean language advocate groups which voiced concerns over its adverse impact on Korean language and culture.  In a report by the Korea Broadcasting Advertising Corporation published in 2003, the state-run agency claimed that foreign language in TV ads could undermine the development of Korean language, enhance Korean’s perception that foreign languages are more elegant and accelerate westernization of Korean culture, the report said.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","media watchdog restricts foreign ,advertisements are now banned ,languages in tv commercials ,media watchdog restricts ,tv ads south korea","['South Korea ’s', 'the Korea Communications Standards Commission']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.78338093  0.17104673

South Korea, whose population is expected to peak in 2030, has been trying to push up its birthrate to prevent a decline in the national workforce, which could result in more welfare expenses and damage the country's growth potential. The country has one of the lowest birthrates among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development member states.The statistical agency said there were no clear cut reasons for the modest gain.For the first 10 months of 2015, childbirths edged up 0.8 percent vis-a-vis 2014 to about 373,400 babies, according to the report.In 2014, 435,400 babies were born in Asia's fourth-largest economy, down 0.2 percent on-year. The drop also followed a 9.9 percent plunge in the previous year.The latest report also showed about 23,200 couples tied the knot in October, down a sharp 14.4 percent from a year earlier.The number of newlyweds is a good indicator of future childbirths as very few children are born to single-parent families here. The total number of marriages dropped 5.4 percent last year to 305,500, following a 1.3 percent contraction in 2013.For the January-October period, about 243,600 couples got married, down 1.6 percent from the same period last year.The latest findings then showed the number of divorces decreasing 2 percent on-year to about 9,800 in October. In the first 10 months of this year, the number of separations shrank 6.2 percent on-year to about 90,300.The number of deaths, meanwhile, moved up 2.2 percent on-year to some 23,100 during the month. Total deaths in the country hit229,800 as of September this year, an increase of 4 percent from a year earlier.In a separate report, the statistics office said the number of people changing their homes rose 5.9 percent on-year to about 50,000 in November.

For this, the Environment Ministry said it would integrate polution permit systems. Currently, up to 10 types of separate permissions are required to run one pollution-generating facility. The permissions range from air pollution to water quality.The new system will allow companies to submit only one online document for facility approval.“Simplifying the permission system while meticulously running it is the goal of the new rule. (The ministry) will put efforts into helping the environment and economy to coexist by ensuring the environment quality while reducing the businesses’ burden,” said Environment Minister Yoon Sung-kyu. The new move came after industry complaints grew over the complicated approval system that requires several permissions, with up to 73 kinds of paper documents. Organizations that screen the requests also differed depending on types of permission, ranging from the ministry to local-level offices, adding to the industry’s burden. Introduced in 1971, the regulation has been imposed on businesses based on a uniform standard that focuses on limiting the pollution concentration from waste water outlets or factory chimneys, overlooking businesses’ individual characteristics. This has sometimes left loopholes as it allowed some regions to be “legally” over-contaminated as only the pollution concentration levels of water outlets and chimneys were considered. Some areas with few pollution sources, on the other hand, have been overregulated. Considering the technological development and industry transformation, the industry has also voiced the need to adopt more realistic standards. The new rule, enacted Tuesday, will be gradually applied to all pollution facilities from 2017 to 2021. Existing facilities will have to receive the new integrated permit within the next four years. The facilities will be subject to permission reviews every five to eight years, the ministry said. The new scheme is expected to save about 9 billion won ($7.7 million) a year, officials said. Foreign countries have run similar schemes since the 1980s to maximize the effectiveness of the pollution facility control. Germany and the U.K. introduced it in 1980s and the European Union adopted it from the 1990s.The EU countries saved about 200 million euros a year, the EU committee said.In 2006, the OECD recommended for Korea to introduce the integrated pollution control system to raise efficacy.

The famine, which is thought to have killed some 2 million people, was caused by the North’s international isolation following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, along with bungled economic policies and flooding.Underscoring that the North’s simultaneous pursuit of nuclear armament and economic development are incompatible, the institute noted that Pyongyang would seek a way out of the dilemma the two-pronged policy has posed. One of the possible ways to address the dilemma would be to obtain its nuclear-power status, engage in direct negotiations with the U.S. and restore relations with China, its major patron and traditional ally, the institute said.To secure its nuclear-power status, the North could do something to show off technologies for nuclear fusion or uranium enrichment, which would make it difficult for the current nuclear powers states to reject Pyongyang’s claim about its nuclear armament, the institute said.Touching on the North’s seventh congress of the ruling Workers’ Party slated for next May, the institute said North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is likely to use the event to declare the opening of his era that differentiates from his late father, and his vision to enhance people’s livelihoods.On the issue of the U.S.-China rivalry, the institute said that the two major powers may seek to restrain from clashing with each other, although there are possibilities that they could engage in minor confrontations.In the last year of his presidency, U.S. President Barack Obama is unlikely to put forward a strong foreign policy initiative and may focus on practical issues such as the issue of securing congressional ratification for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free trade deal involving 12 Pacific-rim nations, the institute said.China may also refrain from taking confrontational foreign policy moves as it focuses on the domestic economy, it added.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","this year severe droughts ,year severe droughts ,greater dilemma next year ,simultaneously developing nuclear weapons ,severe droughts",['North Korea'],2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.77119106  0.48109034

Both these numbers are down from the 3.3 percent growth reached in 2014.The 60-year-old Yoo, who will also hold the position of deputy prime minister in charge of economic affairs, will be taking over from Choi Kyung-hwan who has held the post for one and a half years, and will be returning to the National Assembly to carry on as a lawmaker for the ruling Saenuri Party.Choi is credited with stabilizing the economy following the Sewol ferry tragedy last year that left more than 300 people dead and the more recent Middle East Respiratory Syndrome by calling for a 11.5 trillion won ($9.7 billion) extra budget.Observers said that Yoo, who graduated from Seoul National University with a bachelor's degree in economics in 1981, has a deep understanding of economic affairs after having worked for Korea Development Institute and the Korea Institute of Public Finance for two decades. He is currently a member of the National Assembly's Science, ICT, Future Planning, Broadcasting and Communications Committee and is viewed as a confidant of President Park Geun-hye.

In contrast, the study that examined official death certificates in 2008 revealed that less than half of suicides in the United States, Canada, Mexico, France, Belgium, the Czech Republic and New Zealand took place outside the home.Numbers for Mexico were the second highest with 46.3 percent of suicides taking place outside a person's home, while they were the lowest in Belgium where corresponding figures stood at 34.5 percent. In the United States, the rate stood at 41.3 percent.Rhee Yong-joo, a professor of public health at Dongduk Women's University in Seoul who took part in the joint study, said that suicides that take place outside the home tend to be more impulsive, while home suicides are more premeditated.She pointed out that there are usually many obstacles to taking one's life outside the home.""There is a need for further research on the connection between suicides and the place of death,"" the scholar said.The findings, which are part of the larger International Place of Death effort, showed that among the eight countries, South Korea had the highest percentage of suicides. Of all deaths in the one-year period, 6.31 percent were due to suicide in South Korea, which is significantly higher than No. 2 France at 2.02 percent. Mexico had the lowest suicide rate at 1.35 percent, with the United States reaching 1.45 percent.Asia's fourth largest economy has consistently ranked highest in its suicide rate in the world.

In 2011, they accounted for 3.8 percent of all Korean victims, but the proportion increased to 5.1 percent last year. This was the first time the Korean government has released a report on male sexual abuse victims.Among victims reported from 2011-2014, 60 percent of them experienced sexual harassment, such as being touched inappropriately or being kissed or held in ways that caused discomfort, while 20 percent of them were raped by the abusers. The victims were abused by both males and females, including a cases of a female boss at work and a male superior while serving military duty. The report also included a case where a cab driver was forcefully and sexually assaulted by a drunk female passenger when he tried to drop her off at her destination. South Korean law currently doesn’t acknowledge same-sex rape or any forms of sexual penetration other than vaginal as rape. Accordingly, same-sex rape is defined as “rape-like” by Korean law and carries lighter penalties.According to a 2013 government survey, 70 percent of male sexual abuse victims who participated in the research said they began to harbor hatred toward random people, while 17.3 percent said they no longer felt safe.Meanwhile, 53 percent of male victims who sought help at a state-run support center said they were depressed, while 26 percent said they were experiencing anger problems.

With the law vocally opposed by an increasing number of sex workers, its efficacy has constantly been questioned. The Korea Herald is publishing a three-part series shedding light on the hidden side of Korea’s sex industry. The following is the second installment. – Ed.When Lucien Lee, a South Korean transgender woman, met her blind date back in 2012, she didn’t think it would turn into her first sex work opportunity. Her date was a man in his 30s who misunderstood their gathering as being for a mutually agreed-upon sex transaction. “He said ‘I thought we’d be going to a motel,’” the 24-year-old told The Korea Herald. “So I asked him how much he was thinking of paying me. He said 100,000 won ($85). I thought it wasn’t a bad deal. I went ahead and did it.”Lee is currently a university student majoring in law and working part-time as a self-employed sex worker while living with her parents. She is also one of many Korean sex workers who are vocally against the nation’s antiprostitution law, which criminalizes both the selling and buying of sex. As a transgender woman who is also a lesbian, Lee said the current law is based on a stereotypical notion that most sex buyers are men while sex workers are women, which does not reflect and grasp the reality of today’s sex industry in Korea where services for women and the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community also exist and are thriving. She also added that the law fails to protect sex worker’s rights, especially when they are abused or exploited by their customers or employers.  Members of a group supporting women’s human rights hold an event to commemorate the 11th anniversary of the antiprostitution law in Jeonju on Sept. 24. South Korean sex workers participated in a rally in central Seoul on Sept. 23 in protest of the antiprostitution law that has criminalized the sex trade since 2004. YonhapLee, who is still legally classified as male, identifies herself as a transgender woman and a lesbian, and most of her clients are male. Some included married couples who wanted to have a threesome. “It makes the work easier for me,” Lee said. “(Having male clients while being a lesbian) eradicates the possibility that I may develop personal feelings for my clients. I would not want that.”In 2013, Lee couldn’t report to the police when she was sexually abused by a male teenager, who threatened to report her to authorities if she did not have sex with him for free. Since receiving hormone replacement therapy in 2012, she has been struggling to find other part-time jobs to support herself as a student. “As long as sex trade is illegal, sex workers cannot rely on government protection,” she said. “How can you report the abuser to the police if doing so can risk your own career and source of income?”Invisible workers and clientsPark Sung-jun (not his real name), 43, has been working as a male sex worker since the 1990s. He now runs his own sex business targeting female clients only, which he claims is one of the biggest in the country.Park’s business mainly offers massage service for women, but often includes sexual intercourse. Reservations are done via KakaoTalk -- he has more than 2,500 client phone numbers saved on four mobile phones -- and the client and her male “therapist” meet at a motel room. Sometimes, clients ask to spend all day with a specific therapist. The “therapist” can get paid for watching a movie with the client or going on a day-trip away from Seoul -- sex is just optional. Clients are from all age groups and types -- married, single, widowed and divorced.“I think women clients feel more comfortable when they pay for sex than having a one-night stand,” Park told The Korea Herald. He said women can be just as sexually curious and adventurous as men. “Many would go, ‘Oh my god, I must be crazy. What am I doing?’ after having sex with a stranger. But there’s something about paying money for sex. It’s just a service you paid for. You don’t’ feel as bad about yourself. And once you become close with the therapist, you want to pay for the emotional intimacy.”Like Lee, Park said the current antiprostitution law fails to grasp the reality of the industry by assuming that all buyers are men and workers are women. He claimed that a significant number of clients in the industry -- about 50 percent -- are couples asking for a threesome. Sometimes the men only choose to watch while his partner has sex with the sex worker. During the interview, he showed a text message inquiring about threesome services. “I want to give something special to my wife on our wedding anniversary,” it said.Park explained there is also an industry that only targets lesbians and gays that is booming behind closed doors. Once, Park had a lesbian client who wanted to try having sex with a man only to confirm her sexual orientation. In person, Park showed how easy it is to find such services online through local search engines by using simple search terms such as “massage for women” and “women only,” which are in fact secret words for sex services for women by female workers. “Most people don’t know these sites are for sex services because ‘massage for women’ doesn’t sound like anything sex-related,” he said. “If the government is really determined to end sex trade in the country, I think the only way to do it is to ban the Internet. But of course, that’s impossible.”Park said male sex workers working for male clients are practically invisible to the authorities, who “simply don’t guess” that men can be involved in sex work targeting gay men or women. “That’s why male sex workers targeting gay men work at off-line brothels -- whereas every other service involving women workers or clients is arranged online and takes place in motels -- because they don’t have to worry about crackdowns,” Park said. “The authorities don’t think there is any sex trade going on when there is no woman in the building.”When approached by The Korea Herald, the Gender Equality Ministry seemed to be unware of the existence of the nation’s sex industry targeting the LGBT community.Lee Jung-ki, a senior inspector at the ministry’s Women’s & Youth’ Rights Promotion Bureau said it’s “hard to imagine” that sex workers targeting gay men exist. “I can imagine gay men dating,” he said. “But it’s hard to imagine that such an industry targeting gay men exists.”Sex work as laborPrior to receiving her hormone replacement therapy, Lucien Lee had worked part-time for a parcel delivery company. As a dock loader, she would take a bus at 6 p.m. to Daejeon, where the distribution center was located, and load thousands of parcels to trucks for delivery. Food was provided by the company, but Lee doesn’t remember having any good meals there. “The bean sprout soup had no bean sprouts in it. It was just water,” she said. The work was hard. She could barely find a moment to sit and rest at work, which usually lasted until 8 a.m. the next day. For about nine hours of labor, she was paid 80,000 won. For her first sex work, which took just a few hours, she was paid 100,000 won. As of this year, Korea’s minimum wage stands at 5,580 won an hour. After receiving hormone replacement therapy, getting a part-time job has become even more difficult for Lee due to her sexual identity. She appears to be and identifies herself as a woman, but she’s still a male according to her legal documents including her ID. Legally changing one’s gender in South Korea can be costly and tedious, as it requires medical operations that are not covered by the national health insurance. Lee hasn’t filed her request to the court yet.According to a 2006 report on human rights conditions on South Korean transgenders, written by local nongovernmental organizations, the vast majority of MTF (male to female) Korean transgender people work in the “entertainment industry” or as temporary or part-time workers.“I think working in the ‘entertainment industry’ practically means working as sex workers,” said Lee. “Even if you work at bars, if you don’t go to the ‘second rounds,’ which means sex service, the chances are you won’t even get paid the minimum wage.”Professor Kim Yong-hwa at Sookmyung Women’s University, who claims the law should be revised so that sex workers should not be punished while sex trade should still be banned, said prostitution ruins a woman’s dignity and sense of morality. In her report submitted to the Women’s Human Rights Commission of Korea, she defined South Korea’s sex industry as a “market serving men.” “The reason prostitution (of women) continues to exist is because the demand from men never goes away,” she wrote in her report. “But prostitution violates women’s human rights and diminishes a society’s moral character.”The Korean government stands firm on its stance that the commercial sex trade cannot be legal. Gender Equality Minister Kim Hee-jung said earlier this year sex was “something that cannot be sold and bought.”Lee said sex work deserve to be recognized as labor. “I think many (Korean) women politicians who claim themselves as feminists grew up in a life of privilege,” she said, adding that sex trade should be legalized with due government regulations. “I don’t know what ruins one’s dignity more -- sex work or living without a job or not being paid minimum wage while being a contract worker. Some say all sex workers are forced to work as sex workers. But when you think about it, who isn’t forced to work? Most people work not because they enjoy it, but because it pays and they need to survive. This applies to every job, not just sex work.”Potential danger According to Park, being a male sex worker isn’t easy. It often requires smashing Viagra pills into powder and mixing it with sports drinks. The drink the concoction before work to make sure they can satisfy the clients. “It’s tough work,” he said. “It’s about being professional -- treating clients with the utmost care and making sure they get what they want from you.”While his business is also illegal according to the current law, Park claimed that by not recognizing women as sex trade clients, the authorities are failing to see potentially more serious crime cases in the industry.“I make sure my workers get tested for STDs every week,” he said. “Once one of them tested positive, I made sure I informed every single client who received services from him. I think that’s the ethical way of doing business. But I’m not sure if other people involved in this business do what I do.”Aside from sexually transmitted diseases, he has also heard of male sex workers taking video footage of the clients’ bodies while giving a back massage. He’s even heard of a case where a sex worker used his client’s personal information for blackmail to get more money.  Park also heard a number of cases where the “therapist” end up raping the client by not controlling his own sex drive, when the client actually only wanted a massage.“The world has changed so much,” he said. “I don’t know why so many government policies are all still so male-oriented.”By Claire Lee and Suk Gee-hyun(dyc@heraldcorp.com) (monicasuk@heraldcorp.com)","loopholes in south korea ,sex trade exploits legal ,women and overseas prostitution ,legal loopholes including sex ,korea enacted its antiprostitution","['South Korea', 'the Korea Herald', 'kore']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48582032 -0.24379742

The difference widened slightly from the 20.8 times more tallied in 2013.  In addition, South Korea's economy advanced 3.3 percent in 2014, compared to 1 percent for North Korea.   On other fronts, as of the end of 2014, South Korea had a total population of 50.42 million compared to the North's 24.66 million, according to the data.  South Korea also continued to greatly outperform the communist North in trade.  In 2014, South Korea's overall trade volume came to a little under $1.1 trillion, 144 times larger than North Korea's $7.6 billion.   South Korea's overall energy output capacity reached 93.21 million kilowatts, 13 times larger than the North's 7.25 million kilowatts, while in the area of rice production the South had a two-to-one advantage. In 2014, Seoul's total rice production reached 4.24 million tons versus 2.15 million tons for Pyongyang. In the mining and manufacturing sector, the South had a seven-fold lead in cement production, while in steel the gap was even greater, with South Korea's output being 59 times larger than that of the North.  The two Koreas also showed significant gaps in social infrastructure.   South Korea's road network totaled 105,673 kilometers compared with the North's 26,164 kilometers.   The statistics office has been publishing general information on the North since 1995 as a way of providing insight into the economic and social conditions of the reclusive country.  The two Koreas technically remain at war, since the 1950-53 Korean War ended with only a ceasefire, not a peace treaty.

So our ministry and Joint Chiefs of Staff plan to advance the joint operations scheme with the U.S.”During the conference, the ministry also floated plans to step up its readiness against Pyongyang’s potential terrorist attacks next year. In a related development, Seoul and Washington plan to launch joint tabletop exercises in 2016 as part of their efforts to bolster their cyber and space warfare capabilities against the communist state. “Our military will maintain a firm readiness posture to deter and adamantly respond to North Korea’s various provocations including its threats of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction,” the ministry said in a statement. “The ministry and the JCS will meanwhile upgrade their integrated regional operational posture in preparation against its simultaneous and complex terror attacks.” During a discussion session, some senior military official raised the need for abolishing the statute of limitations for defense industry-related crimes, calling them “unpatriotic acts” and urging “harsh punishment,” a ministry official said. The military, the Navy in particular, has in recent months been reeling from a string of graft scandals involving former and incumbent commanders, sparking public criticism and calls for sweeping reform.Defense Minister Han Min-koo, for his part, urged the commanders to make utmost efforts to regain public confidence in the face of the ongoing furor over the wrongdoings, a series of shooting rampages and other tragic accidents within barracks. “The static value of our military is to win a war against the enemy under any circumstance,” he was quoted as saying by ministry officials. “We have to make a military that is not only trusted by the people but also respected by them.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","further nuclear missile tests ,missile tests in 2016 ,moranbong band last weekend ,submarine next year ,last weekend in china","['North Korea', 'U.S.', 'North Korea ’s', 'Moranbong Band', 'China', 'Pyongyang']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.20957243  0.63582683

It also lowered the growth estimate for 2015 from 3.8 percent to 3.1 percent, although the Bank of Korea expects Asia's fourth largest economy will grow just 2.7 percent this year.  ""Money to be used in the first half will be used to create more jobs, stabilize the livelihood of lower income households and prop up the country's growth momentum,"" the ministry said.  In addition, the government will allocate some 3.48 trillion won before the start of the 2016 fiscal year, so money can be injected into various projects immediately starting on Jan. 1.  The money set aside in advance will not only make timely spending possible in the new year, but can allow public announcements for new projects to be made in December.   ""Projects that can benefit from this arrangement will be those that have the most impact on the general public, and projects that can help fuel economic growth,"" it said.  The government has been frontloading its annual budget for the past several years in order to boost growth early on and meet calls by the business community for more public spending.

The boat service cancellation rate for Heuksan, located 97 kilometers southwest of the port of Mokpo, stands at around 13 percent per year.The government expects to spend 580.5 billion won ($499.1 million) on building the airport for Ulleung and 183.5 billion won on Heuksan.The ministry said that the airports will both have one 1,200-meter-long, 30-meter-wide runway and will be able to accommodate 50-seat propeller-powered regional passenger planes such as the ATR-42 and Q300. Bidding for the Ulleung airport construction will be completed by the end of this year, while competition to build the Heuksan airport will be held early next year.""Heuksan airport will be opened in 2020, with Ulleung to follow a year later,"" the ministry said.The opening of the airports, meanwhile, is expected to not only help people living on the islands, but promote local tourism. Travelers visiting Ulleung could reach 925,000 in 2030 from 460,000 in 2013, with numbers for Heuksan expected to rise from 360,000 to 883,000 in the same period.The ministry said that because these islands are in key locations in the East and Yellow seas, direct flights can allow the government to keep closer tabs on illegal fishing and facilitate search and rescue operations in the event of accidents.

Along with the budget, the Assembly endorsed five economy-related bills fervently pushed by the government as key to preparing for further economic slowdown.The revised budget is 300 billion won less than the original plan submitted by the government. The budget for publishing state-authored textbooks and subsidies for the panel to investigate the 2014 Sewol sinking remained unchanged from the government’s original plan.Jung Eui-hwa (center), chairman of the National Assembly, Saenuri Party floor leader Won Yu-chul (left), and New Politics Alliance for Democracy floor leader Lee Jong-kul partake in a meeting before the regular parliamentary session at the National Assembly in Seoul on Wednesday. (Yonhap)The ruling Saenuri Party and the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy had wrangled over the government’s budget for state-led child care programs until the later hours in the evening.The rival parties reportedly agreed to earmark some 300 billion won from reserved funds for the child care program known as “Nuri Process” that President Park Geun-hye had promised during her 2012 presidential campaign. The program is estimated to cost over 2 trillion won in total next year to provide free child care service for all children aged 3 to 5.While the NPAD urged the central government to take more, or all, of the financial burdens for the program, Saenuri contended that the provincial education offices should fund the program out of their own pockets, citing the revised relevant laws that place the burden on the respective municipalities.The use of reserved funds instead of directly appropriating a Nuri Process budget is expected to be further opposed by municipalities, which will have to make up for the shortage. The same occurred last year with the government “indirectly” subsidizing the project with some 506.4 billion won from reserved funds. The negotiation of the budget was further complicated by a deal made between the floor leaders of the rival parties late Tuesday night. NPAD floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul and his Saenuri counterpart Rep. Won Yu-chul had agreed to vote on five business-related bills along with the budget in return for a compromise on next year’s financial plan.The five legislative acts include bills that would relax regulations on medical and tourism businesses to boost the economy. The medical-related bills aim to give financial support to South Korea’s medical industry, which is looking to enter markets overseas. The NPAD had criticized the bills as an attempt to privatize the medical industry. The tourism bills allow companies to build hotels near elementary, middle and high schools. The opposition party had also criticized the measure, saying it would only benefit giant hotel chains owned by Korea’s family-owned conglomerates. The overnight arrangement, however, was opposed fervently by NPAD Rep. Lee Sang-min, who heads the Assembly’s Legislative and Judiciary Committee. The committee is the last stop before a bill is presented to be voted on at a plenary session.Lee had said the deal overlooked the legal process, as the bills were not yet handed over to his committee for review. The committee typically has up to five days to review each bill.As Lee continued in his opposition, other relevant standing committees were delayed. The NPAD held a general assembly to discuss the plan as Assembly Speaker Chung Ui-hwa prepared to execute his authority and bypass the legislative committee to present them for plenary votes.The floor leaders, meanwhile, agreed to hold extra sessions to discuss other contentious bills, including counterterrorism bills, North Korea’s human rights bill and labor reform bills. They agreed they will complete their negotiations and vote on them by no later than Dec. 9, when the regular parliamentary session ends.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","trillion won 342 billion ,won 342 billion after ,passes w386 4tr budget ,386 trillion won 342 ,342 billion after days","['the National Assembly', 'Assembly']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51731431  0.25470358

The numbers represent power generated by thermal and nuclear power plants, hydro-electric dams and renewable energy sources.The European Union's combined installed power capacity stood at 9,071GW, with China and the United States ranking second and third with capacitites of 1,505GW and 1,063GW each.South Korea's power capacity and consumption of electricity is roughly on par with its global GDP ranking that stood at 13th last year. On the other hand, the country's reliance on atomic power to meet its energy requirements was high.The country receives 26.8 percent of all power from nuclear reactors, placing it behind France, Armenia and Belgium. France received 48.8 percent of its power from reactors with numbers for Armenia and Belgium standing at 34.3 percent and 30.4 percent, respectively.Other countries like Sweden, Ukraine, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary and the Czech Republic made the top 10 list.Among the world's top 10 producers of electricity, South Korea's reliance on nuclear power is the highest with the exception of France.In contrast to the country's reliance on nuclear power, it gets only 1.9 percent of its power from renewable sources such as solar, wind and hydro power. This placed it 82nd among the 138 countries checked by the report, and way below 43.1 percent for Denmark, the global leader, and even trailed Japan. The island nation gets 3.8 percent of its energy from renewable sources.The report clearly showed that many countries are moving to invest in renewable energy to help cut back on greenhouse gas emissions, although South Korea is not following this trend.""South Korea, because of its heavy-industry oriented industrial structure and relatively large population is a major consumer of electric power,"" a local energy industry source said. He pointed out that the country's heavy reliance on nuclear power and small contribution made by renewable energy sector is not a good way to cut back on greenhouse gas emissions. ""The country needs to strive for a more sustainable 'energy mix' in the future"" he said.

The Seminar on Business Opportunities in Malaysia, held on Nov. 23 to beckon Korean investment, brought high-level government officials and businesspeople from the Southeast Asian country who provided up-to-date information on the country’s economic development and investment opportunities. It was followed by one-on-one meetings for the companies. (From left) Kiswire Limited executive vice president Lee Chang-woo, MIDA CEO Azman Mahmud, Regulatory Reform Committee chairman Ahn Choong-yong, MATRADE CEO Dato Dzulkifli Mahmud and Malaysian Ambassador Rohana Ramli speak at the Seminar on Business Opportunities in Malaysia at Lotte Hotel in Seoul on Nov. 23. Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldAccording to the Central Bank of Malaysia, the country’s economy experienced 4.7 percent growth in the third quarter of this year, and is on track to maintain steady expansion on the back of national stability, investment-friendly policies and a zealous workforce. The country has modernized the bulk of its infrastructure, much of it with the capital and know-how of Korean firms, in its bid to enhance physical, institutional and social connectivity with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. With the Association of Southeast Asian Nations set to launch its Economic Community at the end of this year, Malaysia aims to be a gateway to the integrated 600-million-strong consumer market with a $2.4 trillion combined gross domestic product.“Malaysia welcomes investment in export-oriented, high-income industries, such as advanced new technologies, value-added services and knowledge-based, capital-intensive productions, particularly from the small and medium-sized enterprises,” Mahmud said.According to a World Bank report this year, Malaysia was ranked 18th in the world in economic competitiveness and 10th in ease of doing business. Bloomberg rated Malaysia the world’s fifth-most promising emerging market, marking it as the only ASEAN economy included in its top 10 list. The Malaysian government has initiated structural reforms ― its Government Transformation Program and Economic Transformation Program ― to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of its bureaucracy and economy. The Eleventh Malaysia Plan 2016-2020 targets six strategic development goals: building an inclusive and equitable society, improving people’s welfare, enhancing human capital, pursuing sustainable development, constructing nationwide infrastructure and reengineering growth models for wider prosperity. “Malaysia’s multicultural and multilingual population ― with Malays, Chinese, Indians and others ― speaks English well and is friendly toward foreigners,” said Lee Chang-woo, executive vice president of Kiswire Limited, which operates in Johor state, southern Malaysia, next to Singapore.Korea has invested $179 million in Malaysia, largely covering processed and basic metals, lumber and wooden goods, transportation equipment and chemical products. Since establishing diplomatic ties in February 1960, the trade between Malaysia and Korea reached $18.2 billion last year, and it is expected to grow with the ASEAN-Korea free trade agreement going into effect in September 2009 and the AEC soon to be launched. Korea is Malaysia’s seventh-largest trade partner, and Malaysia is Korea’s third-largest investment partner from ASEAN. Continuing the success of Malaysia’s “Look East Policy” ― launched in 1982 to emulate the nation-building experiences of Japan and Korea ― the government of Prime Minister Najib Razak launched the “second wave” of the policy last year to bolster trade and industrial collaboration with Korea, targeting information and communications technology, green technology, health sciences, automotive technology and research and development.To date, major Korean manufacturing firms such as POSCO, Samsung SDI, Q Cells-Hanhwa, Xener Systems, Henikwon, Elpion, Kiswel and Kiswire have carried out 337 projects worth over $4.6 billion, creating more than 49,000 jobs. Major services providers such as Hyundai Engineering, Hanjin Shipping, Woori Bank, Seoul Garden and Hyosung Corporation also operate in Malaysia. The event was organized by the Malaysian Investment Development Authority and Malaysia External Trade Development Corporation in partnership with the Malaysian embassy in Korea, and sponsored by the Federation of Korean Industries, Korea International Trade Association, Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Small and Medium Business Corporation, Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency and Korea Federation of SMEs.

Most deaths involved people with underlying medical problems like cancer.MERS, first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012, has a fatality rate of over 40 percent, although in South Korea only some 20 percent of people infected died. There are currently no vaccines or treatment for the disease.In addition, the three neighboring countries pledged to expand cooperation with the World Health Organization to strengthen monitoring of health threats and share vital information.At the gathering in the Japanese city, South Korea's Health Minister Chung Chin-youb proposed creating a hotline that can speed up exchanges of disease-related information between Seoul, Tokyo and Beijing.He added that the three countries should set up a consultative body to handle new disease outbreaks.The policymaker then said South Korea plans to share its MERS experience with Japan and China.Besides MERS, top officials from the three countries said population aging and a rise in the number of people struggling with chronic illnesses are putting a burden on social outlays.""The three sides concurred on the need to share policy measures in such areas as dementia, anti-smoking and social services to take care of senior citizens,"" the ministry said.The tripartite gathering was first launched in 2007, at the request of South Korea to deal with the Influenza A scare that swept through the world.

The study found that health expenditures kept increasing throughout the period, from an average annual cost of 1.05 million won ($915) in 2008 to 1.48 million won in 2013.  A patient is resting at a medical facility in South Korea. YonhapSuch medical costs accounted for 6.2 percent of annual household income in 2008, and 7.5 percent in 2012.Lee’s study found that the nation’s low-income earners spend more on health care than those with a high income. Those who belonged to the poorest 20 percent spent 1.86 million won for health care in 2012, while those belonged to the wealthiest 20 percent spent 1.28 million won. Medical expenditures accounted for 15.6 percent of the annual income of those who belonged to the poorest 20 percent, while it made up only 4.2 percent for those who belonged to the wealthiest 20 percent. In some severe cases, health care cost accounted for up to 80 percent of a low-income household’s annual income, especially among families whose member suffers from cancer or heart disease.Meanwhile, the proportion of Korean households who spend more than 10 percent of their annual income on health care has been steadily rising, from 13.4 percent in 2008 to 14.6 percent in 2012.Throughout the five years, 29.7 percent of all Korean households spent more than 10 percent of their income on health care at least once. As some 6.8 million Korean baby boomers (those born 1955 to 1963) are entering their 60s this year, the government predicts that medical costs for the elderly will continue to rise as the boomers’ population grows older, thereby doubling the current elderly demographic to more than 7.2 million. Last year, about one-third of total medical costs -- 19.4 trillion won -- was spent to treat the elderly, who already account for 11.9 percent of the total Korean population. The cost increased by 10.4 percent from the year before, mostly due to the increased number of those aged 75 or older who sought medical help for dementia and cerebrovascular diseases, according to government statistics. “Those with chronic conditions and low income are the most vulnerable to limited health care access,” Lee said. According to another study by Yonsei University published last year, Korea’s public expenditure rate for health care steadily dropped from 2009 to 2011, from 56.7 percent to 55.3 percent. The study also pointed out that although almost 97 percent of the Korean population is covered by the National Health Insurance, medical expenditures accounted for 35.2 percent of all household income here in 2011, which was much higher than the OECD average of 19.6 percent in the same year.“High medical expenditure results in not only reduced ability to pay for basic needs, such as food, but also limits a child’s access to education,” the report said. “Furthermore, many households fall into poverty owing to the high medical costs. In a polarizing social structure, the loss of one’s health signifies much more than a simple temporal loss to those whose labor power relies heavily on good health. Illness represents loss of working ability and, at least in a capitalist society, can mean job loss and lead directly to social poverty.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","korean households increased significantly ,health spending grows 41 ,south korean households increased ,korean households increased ,41 percent from 2008","['south korean', 'Lee Tae - jin', 'Seoul National University']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61099941  0.46409163

Similar reports in South Korea showed that the number of people going abroad to study outpaced those arriving in the country by a factor of 2.5 to 1.   The IMD's 2015 report, on the other hand, showed South Korea's overall ability to train and attract talent standing at 31st place this year, up nine notches compared with 2014.  Among the three main factors checked, the country placed 32nd in both investment-development and appeal, while coming in at 31st place in terms of readiness to attract talent.  Going into details, the IMD gave South Korea relatively high marks in such areas as skilled labor, public spending on education and health-related infrastructure. The country did well in the area of the effective personal income tax rate, which is the percentage of income equal to GDP per capita.  On the down side, South Korea ranked low in such sectors as the cost-of-living index, worker motivation and utilization of the female labor force.  The IMD report, meanwhile, placed Switzerland at the top of the list, unchanged from last year, with Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway and the Netherlands making the top five.  The United States came in at 14th, down two from 2014, with Japan's ranking moving up two notches to 26. China ranked 40th, a gain of three vis-a-vis the year before.

Lee Ju-yeol said in a monthly meeting with economic experts here.  The central bank governor has repeatedly pointed to problems stemming from China's slowing economic growth that has been blamed for a dip in South Korea's own exports.  China is by far the world's single largest importer of South Korean goods, accounting for over 25 percent of South Korea's overall exports last year. South Korea's exports have fallen every single month since the start of the year, plunging 15.8 percent on-year in October.  Lee said problems for South Korean exports coming from China may be more permanent than previously believed.  ""If we say China's slowing economic growth due to sluggish demand is a macroeconomic risk, the narrowing gap between the competitiveness of South Korean and Chinese firms is a micro risk,"" he said at the breakfast meeting.  Growing competition from Chinese companies in the global market has long been an issue for South Korean firms, while further improvements by Chinese competitors will certainly eat into South Korean exports.  The BOK chief urged local companies to boost their investment in research and development to help prevent such cases, while also calling on the local government to create and improve a business environment that promotes investment.  ""India is fast becoming a new growth engine of Asia. And we need to pay attention to the fact that India's recent rise has been made possible by a bold move (by the Indian government) to remove all unnecessary regulations hampering investment not only by local companies but also by foreign investors,"" he said. In a report released Monday, the state-run Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade said South Korean manufacturers currently have an average 3.3-year technological lead over their Chinese counterparts, down from 3.7 years in 2011.

The total number of marriages gained 5.4 percent on-year to some 305,000 in 2014 while that of international marriages dropped 9.5 percent,"" the agency said in a press release.The steady decline in international marriages has been attributed to government efforts to sort out unlicensed and unqualified marriage agencies that had been blamed for later problems in marriage, including domestic violence and fraud.Out of all international marriages last year, 63.6 percent involved South Korean males, marking an on-year drop of 1.8 percentage points. The remaining 26.4 percent involved South Korean females, up 0.8 percentage point from a year earlier.The number of divorces between multi-cultural couples also dropped 4.3 percent on-year to 12,902 last year.

Park holds flowers presented upon her arrival in Manila on Tuesday. (Yonhap)Park’s mention of the Trans-Pacific Partnership comes as her government is testing the waters before deciding to join the Washington-led trade deal. She has already expressed Korea’s interest in joining the TPP during her trip to Washington last month amid widespread criticism of the country’s hesitance to participate in the U.S.-led trade bloc.Park also stressed the importance of sharing the benefits of free trade, urging developing countries and small and medium enterprises to join global value chains -- where the different stages of production are located across numerous countries.“It is important to establish partnerships on technological transfers between advanced and developing countries as well as large and medium-sized companies,” she said.“South Korea has also been supporting developing countries in establishing technological standards and verification processes.”The South Korean leader also urged advanced countries to be cautious in adjusting their monetary policies.“The normalization of monetary policies of advanced countries should be adjusted in a careful and gradual manner by taking into account their impact on the world economy,” Park said.The remarks came amid lingering worries over a potential U.S. Fed rate hike. But her top aide for economic affairs, An Chong-bum, said the issue was not on her mind when she delivered the speech.Park also proposed to build a global financial safety net to stabilize the market during times of difficulties. She asked China to come up with an action plan on her vision by the time the country hosts the annual meeting next year.Before wrapping up the two-day meeting, Park and other world leaders agreed to tackle issues regarding base erosion and profit shifting -- international tax avoidance techniques of high-profile multinationals that weaken a country’s tax base. The move is expected to ensure that the so-called Google tax will be levied against multinationals that try to avoid paying their dues in countries where they make profits.Park also held a separate meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The two leaders praised the efforts made for increasing the number of South Korean carriers connecting cities of India and Seoul. Modi has asked South Korean companies to take a larger role in India’s state-led campaign to revitalize its manufacturing industry, Cheong Wa Dae said.Park arrived Tuesday in the Philippines, where she is set to meet leaders of the Asia-Pacific region on Wednesday for a two-day annual forum.Leaders are expected to exchange their views on building inclusive and sustainable economies for the prosperity of the region. But with the forum taking place amid growing rivalry between Washington and Beijing, the central issue of discussions is widely expected to be the territorial disputes over the South China Sea.By Cho Chung-un and news reports (christory@heraldcorp.com)","trade barriers president park ,revitalize the sluggish economy ,economy recommend the g20 ,reduce trade barriers first ,rapid economic growth park","['Park Geun', 'South Korea', 'Park', 'G20']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65746993  0.54500717

The Seoul Metropolitan Government requested the Defense Ministry and Transport Ministry simplify the approvals process for drone use in cases to be used for monitoring the city’s traffic status, officials said. Under current rules, flying drones over 12 kilograms requires a permit from the Seoul Regional Aviation Administration. Regardless of the weight, taking pictures with drones or flying them in flight-restricted areas also needs approval from the Defense Ministry for each flight. Flying drones over 150 meters high, at night and dropping objects are strictly prohibited. Seoul City has been using drones under 12 kilograms for monitoring and analyzing the traffic status and checking traffic facilities.Because most parts of the capital are flight-restricted areas, the city has to submit an approval request a half month before each use of a drone, the officials said. Flights are prohibited from traveling above most areas in Seoul north of the Hangang River, while flights south of the river are restricted based on occasion. A Defense Ministry official must also be present at the drone-flying site.“The strict drone rule is understandable as it involves public security. Applying the same regulations for private drones to public-purpose drones, however, often delays the project time due to trivial administrative works,” a Seoul City official told The Korea Herald. “If the government grants approval for a certain period, not for each time, it will greatly simplify the work,” he added. Seoul City has been active in utilizing drones in various sectors. In August, the city vowed to adopt drones in search and rescue operations at disaster scenes. It is currently running two drones in the fire and disaster department on a trial basis, authorities said.

Meanwhile, only 14.1 percent of girls had the same health condition.The gender disparity in Korea was significantly high considering the OECD average for childhood obesity was 24.3 percent for boys and 22.1 percent for girls.  YonhapLocal experts pointed out that Korea’s popular culture and social pressure on young girls may play a factor in the statistics. The only country that had a higher gender disparity in obesity than South Korea among the OECD was Poland, where 21.2 percent of male children were obese while only 8.5 percent of their female counterparts were experiencing the same condition. “I think young girls are more conscious about their body image than their male counterparts,” said researcher Kim Min-jeong from the Korea Health Promotion Foundation. “While the number of obese male schoolchildren has been increasing in recent years, the same did not happen among young girls.”While avoiding obesity is important for all teenagers regardless of gender, local studies previously showed that more than 90 percent of Korean bulimia patients were women. According to a 2013 study by the National Health Insurance Service Ilsan Hospital, a total of 1,796 Koreans sought medical help for the eating disorder that year. Among them, 93.9 percent, 1,684 people, were women, while only 6.2 percent were men.About 70 percent of the female bulimia patients were in their 20s and 30s. The study, whose coauthors included a psychiatrist, suggested that the country’s strong emphasis on young women’s personal appearance may be linked to the statistics. Meanwhile, obesity has emerged as a major health threat in Korea in recent years. According to a study released by the National Health Insurance Service in August, the number of obese Koreans -- those with a BMI of 30 or above -- accounted for 4.2 percent of the entire population in 2012, up from 2.5 percent in 2002. One in 17 South Koreans will be obese in 2025 if the current trend continues, the report said.

Overall labor cash earnings, which include overtime and special payments, increased by 0.6 percent and wages adjusted for inflation advanced 0.5 percent.The central bank needs to see higher earnings so Japanese consumers can buy more to help sustain price gains in a nation that has been dogged by two decades of stagnation. Abe is depending on businesses to pour more of their profits into capital spending and salaries as he tries to expand by one-fifth an economy that has recently struggled to grow at all.The government pressure on businesses to raise wages remains strong, contributing to the gains,said Yoshitaka Suda, an economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. Wages will probably continue to rise as corporate profits are improving and supply- demand conditions in the labor market are tight.Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said last week that reducing the tax burden for high-earning companies would boost investment and wages. Some members of Japan Council on Fiscal and Economic Policy propose rewarding companies that raise wages or capital expenditure by giving them a tax break, Reuters has reported.One difficulty in all this is that the idea of businesses paying higher wages clashes with another of Abe goals: for companies to deliver better returns on equity.Bank of Japan board member Yutaka Harada has said that 3 percent wage growth is needed for the BOJ to achieve its 2 percent inflation target.The continued gains in the regular wages are good,?said Atsushi Takeda, an economist at Itochu Corp. in Tokyo. But the growth in wages is low and insufficient to boost consumer spending.Household spending has fallen in seven of the nine months through September this year. The economy contracted by an annualized 1.2 percent in April-June from the first quarter of the year, and economists forecast a drop of 0.3 percent in the three months ended Sept. 30.  --With assistance from Isaac Aquino and Tomoko Sato in Tokyo.

General Assembly resolution that centers on calling for referring North Korea to the International Criminal Court for human rights violations, the draft resolution showed.The proposed resolution, led by the European Union and Japan, was introduced to the General Assembly's Third Committee on Oct. 30. Other co-sponsors included South Korea, the United States, Britain, Australia and Germany, according to the resolution.The nine-page draft is largely similar to the landmark resolution that was adopted at last year's General Assembly with a call for referring the North's human rights situation to the ICC for the first time. Just like last year's resolution, this year's also calls for the ICC referral.""The General Assembly ... encourages the Security Council to continue its consideration of the relevant conclusions and recommendations of the commission of inquiry and take appropriate action to ensure accountability, including through consideration of the referral of the situation in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the International Criminal Court,"" the resolution said. The resolution also calls for ""effective targeted sanctions against those who appear to be most responsible for acts that the commission has said may constitute crimes against humanity"" and encourages the Security Council to continue discussions and active engagement on the issue.The proposed resolution is expected to be put to a vote at the Third Committee later this month, sometime between Nov. 16-20. If approved by the committee, it is expected to be formally adopted at the General Assembly next month.The move to adopt a new resolution is expected to anger North Korea.But chances are not high for the Security Council to actually refer the issue to the ICC because China and Russia, which have friendlier ties with North Korea than any other countries, are expected to veto such a move. Still the resolution played a great role in drawing international attention to the issue.North Korea has long been labeled one of the worst human rights violators. The communist regime does not tolerate dissent, holds hundreds of thousands of people in political prison camps and keeps tight control over outside information.But the North has bristled at such criticism, calling it a U.S.-led attempt to topple its regime.In June, the State Department said in its annual human rights report that the North's human rights record ""remained among the worst in the world"" last year, with public executions, political prison camps, torture and other abuses taking place in the country.

Founded in 1968 in the wake of the Biafra Famine in Nigeria, the organization has marked its presence in all of the world’s major crises since, tackling poverty, epidemics, broken sanitation situations and natural disasters. “Our work is driven by our humanitarian identity and commitment to address extreme poverty,” the Concern Worldwide CEO Dominic MacSorley said at a reception at the Irish ambassador’s residence in Seoul in end-October. “We respond effectively to emergencies to save lives and alleviate suffering, respect people’s dignity and strengthen community-building and community-preparedness against future disasters.” (From left) Concern Worldwide Korea country manager Lee Jun-mo, Concern CEO Dominic MacSorley, Irish Ambassador Aingeal O’ Donoghue, Concern overseas director Paul O’ Brien and the ambassador’s spouse Peter R. Bullen at the ambassador’s residence on Oct. 29. The Irish EmbassyThe Concern operates in 27 of the world’s least developed countries with support from offices in Dublin, London, Belfast, New York, Chicago and now Seoul. Employing over 3,300 workers and spending over $160 million annually, it reached out to more than 7.4 million distressed people around the world last year. At present, the Concern is providing assistance in Turkey, Lebanon, Nepal, Afghanistan, South Sudan and the Central African Republic, as well as North Korea, where it has provided food, water and sanitation services since 1998, with support from the Ministry of Unification. The Concern has also worked in war-torn Syria, typhoon-hit Philippines and Ebola-stricken West Africa. A key part of its mission lies in supporting education, boosting local agricultural production and providing health care and nutrition to women and children. “Famine is ingrained on the Irish nation as we had our own famine in the mid-1800s, where over a million people died and another million emigrated,” MacSorley said. “Those events have remained a key part of being Irish and Concern. We empathize with those who are hungry and respond to their needs.” As both Ireland and Korea have experienced colonization, wars, conflict and poverty, and similarly overcome their hardships through economic development, the two countries should also help others experiencing difficulties, by supporting the aid programs, he added.

China's foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters on Friday that the upcoming talks would have a ""great significance to upholding the tranquility and stability of the relevant waters and consolidating and growing bilateral friendly cooperation."" ""It is hoped that China and the ROK can fairly and properly resolve the overlapping claims of maritime rights and interests through amicable consultations and set a good example for regional countries in addressing similar issues,"" Hua said, without saying the exact date of the talks.In November 2013, China drew concerns by declaring an air defense zone over the East China Sea that overlapped with South Korea's own air defense zone and Ieodo. Ieodo is located 149 kilometers southwest of Korea's southernmost island of Marado and 247 kilometers northeast of the nearest Chinese island Tongdao.","boundary next month beijing ,next month beijing south ,boundaries next month china ,sea boundaries next month ,next month beijing","['South Korea', 'China', 'China', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Park Geun', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping']",2,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -1.11070812  0.51100457

In the 11th Green Climate Fund meeting held in Zambia from Nov. 2 to 5, the climate fund board decided to adopt the Korean proposal on the integrated supply and storage system for renewable energy.Korea’s renewable energy model, with a duration of five years, aims at replacing unsustainable energy with renewable energy in the Peruvian wetlands. The Peruvian energy project, which adopts the Korean energy model, requires an estimated input of about $9.11 million. The GCF will contribute $6.24 million, the Korea International Cooperation Agency $1.8 million and Peru‘s environmental trust fund Profonanpe $1.07 million, the ministry added. The residents of the northwestern Amazon basin region have been generating power with nonrenewable fossil fuels, such as diesel, releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Frequent lumbering for obtaining fruits has also caused damages to the forest, ultimately contributing to the climate change. “Korea’s participation in the GCF’s operations is expected to create synergy effects on Korea’s own climate change activities under the creative economy, as well as on the growing renewable energy industries in the developing economies,” a ministry official said. The renewable energy storage system was one of the four GCF energy models proposed at the ASEAN-Korea Commemorative Summit in December of last year, along with the eco-friendly energy town, electric car and smart farm. In the Zambia board meeting, the GCF board chose eight proposals, with funding estimated at about $168 million. Around two-thirds of the money was intended to fund operations to adapt to climate change impacts, and some three-quarters had been requested in the form of grants.The GCF, headquartered in Songdo, Incheon, aims at routing international funds to developing countries to counter climate change.

Line No. 2, which is a loop going around major districts in the city, annually recorded financial gains, as an average of 1.55 million passengers took the subway every day last year. Seoul City said that the free travel for the elderly appears to have contributed to the deficit, as it would have brought in about 288 billion won had the passengers paid, equal to about 68 percent of last year’s 425 billion won deficit. Those aged 65 or older are entitled to take the subway for free. The city forecast the loss in revenue from fare exemptions will exceed 300 billion won this year, with 259 million free rides, about 14 percent of the total, the city said. From January to July, the city has already seen a deficit of over 160 billion won, it added.The increasing elderly population has become one of the major societal tasks faced by the country with mushrooming welfare costs as well as calls to enhance their life quality. The government’s move to raise the legal age of “senior citizens” from the current 65 to 70 has also become a topic of heated debate in connection to various welfare benefits and labor regulations.The share of Korea’s total population who are senior citizens rose to 13.1 percent this year, jumping by 6 percentage points from 2001. The proportion is anticipated to reach nearly 21 percent by 2026, according to the state-run agency Statistics Korea. In order to close the subway deficit, Seoul City has asked the central government financially support half of the expected deficit -- 168 billon won -- this year, citing that the free travel is a national welfare measures pushed by the government. The Transport Ministry, however, reportedly turned down the request, claiming there was no legal framework that mandates the state compensate for losses from city subway operations. In the case of Korea Railroad, the national train service provider, the state supports around 60 percent of the cost of free travel under the railroad industry law. Last year, the government provided 125 billion won, which made up 62 percent of the deficit caused by discount packages for the elderly and other benefit receivers. Fare dodgers have also been adding to the subway’s financial woes.According to Rep. Noh Woong-rae of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, over 190,000 illegal free riders were caught in the past five years, resulting in about 6.5 billion won in penalty fees. If caught, a violator must pay a penalty that is 30 times the regular subway fare.

As of last year 341 Chinese boats have been caught breaking rules.The latest understanding comes after Seoul took flak for not including an IUU clause in the bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) inked earlier in the year.The two sides have been operating a joint fisheries committee for years and there has been a steady decline in illegal fishing activities by Chinese fishermen operating in South Korea's exclusive economic zone (EEZ), although unauthorized operations have yet to be fully controlled. This has hurt the amount of fish caught by South Korean fishermen.Under the latest deal, South Korean authorities will raise the fines they slap on Chinese fishing vessels that violated rules to 300 million won (US$263,400) from 200 million won, and also have the option to directly confiscate the catch from Chinese fishermen instead of handing the matter over to Chinese authorities.In addition, the country will create a database on repeated offenders and provide it to China so they can take necessary action. The two countries then concurred on the creation of a sea check point through which all fishing vessels must cross after catching fish that will make it easier for officials to check if rules were followed.The Chinese side, moreover, agreed to better regulate fishing boats that operate in North Korean waters near the sea demarcation line with South Korea. Such boats have trespassed into waters controlled by South Korea to catch fish and then flee over the demarcation line if they are found to be operating illegally. ""In the past there was nothing South Korea could do about these boats,"" an official said.Besides these measures, South Korea plans to develop a electronic permit system that can be attached to ships operating in South Korean EEZ that will allow authorities to check their identity without having to see paper documents that can be easily forged.The ministry, meanwhile, said Seoul and Beijing agreed on the annual fishing quota within their respective EEZs for 2016 that is unchanged from this year.Under the deal, 1,600 Chinese boats can enter South Korea's EEZ and catch 60,000 tons of fish, while the same number of South Korean ships can do the same in the Chinese waters. South Korean boats, however, rarely venture into the Chinese zone because of low fish stocks caused by excessive fishing.

Once individuals separate the garbage by type -- ranging from paper, plastic and glass to batteries – the recyclable waste is either reborn as raw materials or turned into other resources. To encourage the sorting of waste, the government has run a volume-rate disposable system that adopted the “pay as you go” system for disposing both general garbage and food waste. The Environment Ministry has particularly paid attention to urging industries to shoulder their share of the responsibility by allocating certain recycling quotas to each field. As a result, Seoul has seen a sharp fall in garbage in the last two decades as the household trash per day dropped by 10,000 tons to around 49,000 tons in 2013 compared to 1994, with the majority of it being recycled in some way. To further boost the resource recycling in an aim to become a zero-waste country, Korea is now turning its eyes to the global trend of “upcycling” -- transforming by-products and waste materials into new products.The upcycling trend has been on the rise in recent years in developed countries such as the U.S. and Germany, especially in the fashion sector. The Korean government joined the upcycling move by changing the main principle of its waste policy from recycling to upcycling in its long-term environment plan released in 2011. The new plan was mapped out based on the idea that waste is a useful resource that can be entirely “circulated.” Municipal offices have also been active in supporting the upcycling industry with diverse measures such as by making it easier to collect resources. The upcycling boom can be spotted in the private sector as conglomerates and start-ups consider it a promising business.Fashion conglomerate Kolon Industries launched an upcycling fashion brand Re;Code in 2012, pioneering the upcycling fashion industry in the country. Cheil Industries also opened a fashion store called Heartist House, where upcycled products are made by rising designers are available. Over 60 small social enterprises and start-ups are currently jumping on the upcycling bandwagon, although many still face business challenges due to the low public awareness and the incipient stage of support from the government. The waste is not only a chance for companies to make profits in a green way, but also provide a breakthrough opportunity for artists. Although the upcycled art is not yet considered an official genre, it is increasingly making inroads into the traditional art industry and thereby contributing to improving public awareness.

Increased movement of people and vehicles has recently been spotted at the Punggye site, along with hints of construction work for a new tunnel, the official said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. No signs of an immediate blast were detected, however, he added. Pyongyang carried out three rounds of underground experiments there ― in 2006, 2009 and 2013. The South Korean government declined to confirm the news, citing intelligence. “We are closely monitoring North Korea’s nuclear activities in cooperation with the U.S. and other related countries,” Unification Ministry spokesperson Jeong Joon-hee said at a press briefing. The new construction activities came as Seoul gears up for its first trilateral summit with China and Japan under President Park Geun-hye on Sunday. South Korea’s Defense Minister Han Min-koo is also scheduled to meet with his U.S. counterpart Ash Carter on Monday for annual security consultations. The four countries are members of the stalled six-party talks aimed at denuclearizing North Korea. Though the possibility of a fourth blast appears low for now, Pyongyang has in recent months threatened to test its long-range missile or “nuclear deterrent” in protest against what it calls the hostile policy of Washington and its allies.

North Korea needs a minimum of 5.4 million tons of food to feed its people.The average food shortage per year has been around 400,000 to 500,000 tons under Kim's regime, he said.His claims are based on the assumption that North Korea's crop production may fall 10 percent in 2015 on-year.Earlier this year, North Korea grappled with what it called its worst drought in 100 years.A decline in an import of crops by the North from China was also cited as the cause for North Korea's bigger food shortage, he said.In the January-September period, North Korea imported around 38,000 tons of crops from China, down 30 percent from a year earlier, amid the long-frayed Pyongyang and Beijing ties.A U.N. report showed in April that about 70 percent of North Korea's 24.6 million people are suffering due to food shortages and 1.8 million, including children and pregnant women, are in need of nutritional food supplies aimed at fighting malnutrition.

The Korea Herald brought together four officials from around the world to explore ways to better implement the Sustainable Development Goals set forward early this year by 193 countries at the U.N. They are Erik Solheim, chair of the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee; Hideaki Domichi, senior vice president at the Japan International Cooperation Agency; Jeroen Verheul, ambassador-at-large for development cooperation at the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and Kim Young-mok, president of the Korea International Cooperation Agency. The roundtable took place on the sidelines of the ninth Seoul ODA International Conference hosted by the state aid agency and the Foreign Ministry for a two-day run. Some 600 policymakers, diplomats and experts took part in the event, themed “Inclusive Partnership in the post-2015 Framework.”In line with the theme of the forum, the participants unanimously voiced the significance of collaboration. Without bringing onboard businesses and civil society, the international community would not be able to cater to enormous demands for infrastructure development, realize the 17 goals and 169 targets and thus plug the gap between the rich and developing worlds, they said. The SDGs are a set of targets on international development agreed upon among the governments for international development. The final document was adopted in September and includes goals to end poverty and hunger and improve health and education, all while fighting climate change and making cities more sustainable.While lauding Korea’s stellar ascent from an aid recipient to a rising donor, they also called on the country to step up its contributions both financially and institutionally, such as by linking assistance, private investment and taxes. The following is an excerpt of the discussion. Participants join a roundtable on the margins of an international development aid conference in Seoul on Tuesday. From left: Hideaki Domichi, senior vice president of the Japan International Cooperation Agency; Erik Solheim, chair of the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee; Kim Young-mok, president of the Korea International Cooperation Agency; and Jeroen Verheul, ambassador at large for development cooperation at the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (Park Hyun-koo/The Korea Herald)The Korea Herald: In shaping the post-2015 development agenda, the role of non-DAC donors was more significant than ever. What is your blueprint for the partnership with these actors?Erik Solheim: When you speak about inclusive partnership, I think there are two dimensions. One is that no nation can do anything on its own. Even the most influential actor, the U.S., cannot solve problems on its own ― we should solve the problems together. Secondly, governments cannot solve the problems on their own. You need to bring in businesses, civil society and the society on the whole so that it is inclusive, with everyone on board, globally. Let me give you one example of a successful partnership where I was personally involved. It was a very successful partnership to conserve rainforests. It was a partnership between the governments of Brazil and Indonesia, which are key rainforest nations, and key global businesses like Unilever and local pharma companies of Indonesia, and big civil society associations like Greenpeace. The companies representing 90 percent of deforestation in Indonesia came together and made a pledge that they would stop their existing practices and make profits from sustainable use of resources of Indonesia. When everyone comes together, you can achieve success. Hideaki Domichi: We expect to see the future where more developing countries will emerge as main players and contribute to world growth. Thereby all the countries will learn from each other the best practices and think together to develop new models of development. But at the same time, we should recognize that we have a huge international gap. Most of the multilateral development banks issued a statement jointly in Addis Ababa that now we should talk about the trillions of dollars of proposals ― public and private, domestic and international, capital and capacity-building. What does this mean? The ODA itself will not be able to cope with all the challenges at least to make it a success. So the key issue here is how to make the ODA sources a catalyst to encourage the participation of the private sector and other stakeholders. KH: In a few generations, Korea has made a remarkable transformation from an ODA recipient to a donor, and now it’s a member of the DAC. What does Korea have to offer to the international development community? Kim Young-mok: Many friends are telling everybody that Korea has already made a kind of miracle, and if it can make a miracle, why not others?So this is one thing we can offer. We do our best in IT sharing, rural development on the Saemaeul model, health care with a universal health system and education among others. Korea’s commitment is a little bit controversial in terms of volume of financial contribution. But in terms of human engagement and people-to-people exchange and working together from the ground up, I think it is a good model because we have quality volunteers and experts who are being welcomed in many countries, along with some interesting Korean cultural wave. Solheim: My encouragement to Korea will be to do more to step up on aid. You’re doing very well on aid, it’s fantastic, but you can do more. You need to provide more money to do more what you are good at. If you go around the world, people know about Korea. Samsung now sells phones around the world. In every European country, you can see people driving Hyundai cars on the street. So you have very strong chain markets and global companies; to link up between aid and these companies is my encouragement for the future. KH: Japan has a long experience as Asia’s traditional donor. Given the role of Korea and China as emerging donors, what do you think the three East Asian countries can do together on development cooperation? Domichi: As Kim said, Korea has something to offer. And we have something to offer. How to combine our resources including knowledge and experiences, this is something we want to push forward. Now the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is in the spotlight today. We also believe that the AIIB has been established to make some contribution to fill the big international gap. We are very much interested in how this organization will work and have global standards. KH: Water management is one of the key areas that the Dutch government is focusing on. What is the Netherlands doing to better manage water and accomplish SDGs in general, and do you have partnership programs with other countries or organizations? Jeroen Verheul: Indeed, access to water and managing water properly is one of the key themes of our policy. It has been for many years, because you have to develop yourself to share with others, and as Eric said, together is a key word. Of course, the Netherlands is a country with a large area below sea level, so climate change is a threat to the Netherlands as a nation. I’m pleased to tell you that we are working together with KOICA to help Indonesia to further develop their strategy to protect Jakarta against water. If nothing happens, in 2020, they will be largely threatened by water, and that is something we want to help them avoid. Kim: As he said, the Netherlands is good at water management, and Korea is a newcomer. … We decided to make a job division and share our experience and technical edge, so that our works do not overlap and can be complimentary. If our job comes off successfully and something can be done to prevent the sinking of land by managing water and preventing the rise of the sea level, it will be very historic and a benchmark in terms of international cooperation. At some point, we would welcome Japan, Britain, Australia and other countries to join and make this project a really good example of international cooperation. Verheul: I think that this kind of cooperation shows that the dividing line between countries and organizations is fading. We talked about traditional donors, emerging, new donors, recipients, etc. But in fact the world economy is moving so fast that you cannot put a black or white label on a country or organization. KH: At the Addis Ababa conference last July, the OECD introduced the concept of total official support for sustainable development to emphasize the partnership between various sources of finance. What’s the significance of TOSSD, and the partnership? Solheim: The main outcome of all this was that we have completely changed the conversation about development finance. We’re working on three legs at the same time ― aid, private investment and tax. There’s no competition between the three, you can use aid to better tax or private investment. The new system is broader than ODA but never to replace ODA. But the main step forward now is to say that if other governments, say Ethiopia or Kenya, need aid in education, for example, you need investment and domestic tax revenues for sure to pay for everything. Domichi: The role of the private sector is key. The real question is how to defuse risks for the private sector. This is crucially important. Now the multilateral development banks including the IMF are addressing the issue. JICA also established a private-sector investment fund. But honestly, we’re still at the stage of proving under what circumstances the public-private partnership will work best. Verheul: He made a valid point in terms of bringing down the risks for the private sector to invest in developing countries. Another part of the story is the business models that the private sector uses. Can those business models be adapted to promote development in countries where they’re working? That’s certainly possible. KH: The refugee crisis that’s unfolding in Europe is posing a great global challenge. What do you think that the DAC and overall international community can do, if anything, to help tackle the situation? Do you see the need for a special fund specifically designed for refugee or similar humanitarian crises around the world? Solheim: The main issue, which is to promote peace in Syria, is beyond what the OECD can do. What we can do is to help develop assistance to be more relevant in the refugee crisis, and support Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, which are the three neighboring countries receiving a huge amount of refugees. They deserve assistance. The European Union has already established a special fund for Syrian refugees and discussed how to do this with Turkish leaders, so that’s moving. What we can do is to mobilize more money for this, but we also need to protect development aid because of the strong calls for European governments to use development aid to refugees at home, which they are allowed to do according to rules but will not be beneficial.I’ll also give advice to Korea to look into this because you are very far from Syria but very close to North Korea. When the time of Korean reunification comes, Korea will need enormous help from outside. The amount is so huge that it cannot be funded by Korea alone ― you need China, the U.S. and the entire world when the time comes. Verheul: We all face the dilemma. As Eric points out, the major victim may be development assistance because of its pressure on one hand, the pain for migrant children and refugees who come to those countries which are eligible for the ODA. It’s also strengthening the expenditure for refugees in the region ― the millions of refugees who are kept in the camps there ― the enormous costs that also come from the ODA, and the support for countries like Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey, it’s also eligible for the ODA.

They are united with their mothers for breast-feeding and other bonding time. The schedule for the mothers, who often seek the service to ensure they can rest for about a week after giving birth, includes facials, body massages, and child care classes. A mother (left) looks at her newborn at a hospital in Seoul. Many young mothers in Korea choose to go to postpartum centers right after they are discharged from hospitals. (File Photo/ The Korea Herald)The Health Ministry said it will now encourage the centers to place mothers and their newborns together, and discourage them to house a large number of babies in the same room all at once. “This system in which many babies are staying with one another in the same room, has been making newborns vulnerable to possible infection,” said the ministry in a statement. “Starting soon, all babies will be required to be kept at least 90 centimeters from each other in the same room.”Health authorities also said that the current system at the centers, in which mothers and babies stay in separate rooms, goes against the World Health Organization’s recommendations on postnatal care of the mother and the newborn. The WHO guidelines specifically mention that the mother and baby “should not be separated and should stay in the same room 24 hours a day,” and mothers “should be counseled on hygiene, especially hand washing.”According to data from the Health Ministry, the number of postnatal centers increased from 488 in 2011 to 602 this year. Meanwhile, the number of newborn children who have developed infectious diseases while staying at such centers has increased dramatically, from 49 in 2013 to 264 so far this year. Three mothers and three caregivers were also infected while staying in such facilities this year.As of this year, 68.8 percent of new Korean mothers opt to stay at postnatal centers instead of home after their deliveries. The centers are especially sought by women whose family members are not available to help with their postpartum care. Yet 122 centers, about 20 percent of all facilities nationwide, were reported to the authorities for hiring unqualified nurses, while 113 of them faced disciplinary action for not educating their staff on infectious disease control and prevention as required, from 2013-2015.The Health Ministry said all staff who work at such centers are now required to receive education on infectious disease control, and must be vaccinated for a total of five infectious viruses that are prevalent in such centers before being hired. The viruses are: hepatitis A, influenza, varicella, Corynebacterium diphtheria and measles. They will also soon be required to wear facial masks all times when working and interacting with babies.All visitors of mothers will be banned from seeing babies, and will be only allowed to meet the parent. Any center that has been affected by an infectious disease outbreak will be shut down permanently if the center is proven to be responsible for the outbreak by not following the rules, the Health Ministry said.

Joel Lee / The Korea Herald“Over the last few months, the world shared grief over the plight of Middle Eastern and North African refugees, particularly the dead 3-year-old Syrian toddler Aylan Kurdi on a Turkish beach,” Yoka Brandt, the UNICEF deputy executive director, told the National Assembly members on Oct. 19. The waves of refugees into Europe, projected to reach 900,000 by next year, are merely the tip of the iceberg, she claimed, as 12 million people are dislocated in and around Syria. Behind these numbers, “people have terrible stories to tell ― witnessing and being victims of unimaginable violence, losing family, starving and being deprived of education,” according to her. As of now, 2 million children in Syria are out of school, as 1 out of 4 schools was destroyed and 50,000 teachers were either killed or displaced. Only 1 in 3 hospitals is still open.“Given the lack of water and basic services,” she added, “the perils of the coming winter will most negatively affect children.”To help relieve the crises, exacerbated by intensifying American and Russian air strikes, UNICEF says it needs $14 million in aid, of which $6.5 million would be used in the next 6 months. Members of UNICEF and Korea’s National Assembly pose at a roundtable meeting at the National Assembly last Monday. Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldThe Korean government, working with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Unification and the Korea International Cooperation Agency, contributed around $25 million separately in 2013 and 2014. The Korean Committee for UNICEF last year raised $88 million from individuals, firms and foundations.Hanna Singer, UNICEF Syria representative, emphasized that the water supply in Syria had halved since the conflict began, and diseases such as polio, hepatitis A and typhoid have resurfaced. “Water is being used as a weapon by armed opposition groups,” she lamented, noting that water was unavailable for 41 straight days in summer to the detriment of 2.1 million people in Aleppo. UNICEF adopts dual approaches to administer water, sanitation and hygiene services, dubbed “WASH.”The first objective aims at trucking 10 million liters of water and disinfectant daily, and the second objective works to enhance resilience by rehabilitating groundwater wells and supply networks. “Our motto is to stay and deliver, despite the mortal dangers,” Singer said, mentioning her late colleague Mohammed Khalaf, who was killed two weeks ago in Raqqa delivering immunization services. “I pay tribute to him through this work.”Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com) Members of UNICEF and Korea’s National Assembly pose at a roundtable meeting at the National Assembly last Monday.

Diplomats, potential investors and policy experts pose at the ASEAN-Korea Partnership for ASEAN Economic Community Building forum at KFI Tower on Thursday. ASEAN-Korea CenterThe ASEAN-Korea Center, in collaboration with the Federation of Korean Industries, held its third annual forum, titled the ASEAN-Korea Partnership for ASEAN Economic Community Building, at KFI Tower on Thursday.Diplomats, potential investors, policy experts and journalists participated in the daylong event, which had presentations on the current situations and challenges in the master plan, financial solutions and individual country projects, followed by one-on-one business meetings. “Connectivity has become a buzzword around the world,” Korea’s Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul said in a speech. “In virtually all regional and interregional forums, such as APEC and ASEM, the debate is on enhancing connectivity.” Physical, financial and informational linkages have accelerated the integration of the 10 member states of ASEAN ― Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam ― whose economies and development levels vary sizably, the vice minister noted.  Korea's Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul. ASEAN-Korea CenterPointing to a symposium held in Kuala Lumpur earlier in October, the ASEAN-Korea Center Secretary-General Kim Young-sun underscored that mobilizing the necessary resources and finding commercially viable projects were critical to achieving the intraregional and interregional connectivity. “ASEAN is committed to the goal of an Economic Community this year, and enhanced connectivity is essential for freer movement of people, goods and services,” said Hasnudin Hamzah, the chair of ASEAN Connectivity Coordinating Committee. “Korea is one of our key partners in construction and infrastructure development related to the connectivity. You have been in our region for a long time, and we hope that your interest and involvement would be revitalized and deeper in the new era after the launch of the economic community,” he added.Hamzah pointed to several projects underway and completed, including the ASEAN Highway Network, Kunming-Singapore Rail Link, Neak Loeung Bridge, ASEAN Roll-on/Roll-off Shipping Network, the West Kalimantan-Sarawak Power Interconnection Project, the ASEAN Power Grid and the Trans-ASEAN Gas Pipelines. The various projects welcome the participation of Korean construction companies, engineering consultancies, technology advisory groups, suppliers, infrastructure builders, financial institutions and insurance firms, he said. “To make the projects bankable, we are investing in due diligence, feasibility studies, political support and predictable regulatory environment.” Hasnudin Hamzah, the chair of ASEAN Connectivity Coordinating Committee. ASEAN-Korea CenterThe Asia Development Bank estimates that Asia needs $8 trillion until 2020 to fund the infrastructure construction, for which countries would need to spend 5 to 6 percent of their GDPs. The new houses, roads, airports, ports and public transportation planned to be added or repaired are estimated to take up 60 percent of global infrastructure spending by 2025, according to the ADB. Since it was launched in 1967, ASEAN has steadily improved its physical, institutional and social linkages, striving to become a rivaling economic powerhouse to those of China, Japan and Korea. Under the banner “unity in diversity,” people-to-people contacts through tourism, education and cultural exchanges have witnessed large expansions within and across the region, abetted by the globalization of Asian culture and commodity. “ASEAN’s connectivity and launch of its community could greatly enhance connections between Southeast and Northeast Asia,” the vice minister said.“Taking a few steps further, we could even imagine far-reaching connectivity across markets in Europe and Asia through the Eurasia Initiative vigorously pursued by the Korean government.”Cho highlighted that once ASEAN and Korea became part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, it would further strengthen economic integration across the Pacific. (From left) Hasnudin Hamzah, the chair of ASEAN Connectivity Coordinating Committee, ASEAN-Korea Center Secretary General Kim Young-sun and National Assembly member Jasmine Lee. ASEAN-Korea CenterSince establishing a dialogue partnership with Korea in 1989, ASEAN has become Korea’s second-largest trade partner, investment destination and construction market, with the bilateral trade reaching $132 billion last year, second only to China.The Korean government, through its official development assistance using the Korea-ASEAN Cooperation Fund and the Korea-Mekong Cooperation Fund, has assisted in various projects aimed at narrowing gaps between the ASEAN states. The Korea International Cooperation Agency has provided support in education, health, institutional governance, rural development, science and technology, and transport and infrastructure. In line with the United Nations’ post 2015 Sustainable Development Goals, the KOICA is developing new strategies to work with ASEAN in these comprehensive areas.Korea has also lent its institutional expertise in rural development through a model of the Saemaul Undong, or New Village Movement, which was presented at the U.N. General Assembly’s 70th session in New York last month. By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com) A forum titled ASEAN-Korea Partnership for ASEAN Economic Community Building, at KFI Tower on Thursday.

Denmark topped the list, followed by other Nordic countries -- Iceland, Switzerland and Finland. Japan came in 26th, a notch higher than Korea. The OECD report assessed various aspects of well-being, including health status to work-life balance, asking OECD populations to rate their lives on a scale of 0-10, from “worst” to “best.” The older Koreans got, the less they were happy with their lives, with those aged between 15 and 29 being the most satisfied with a score of 6.32. South Korea scored the lowest in terms of perceived social network support, meaning that Koreans on average feel lonely and isolated in society without anyone to rely on. Koreans were also the least content with their health status. But Asia’s No. 4 economy saw an increase of 12.3 percent in its household income between 2010 and 2013, the biggest jump in the OECD bloc, with its job security and housing affordability being comparatively high. It also had the lowest long-term unemployment rate in the OECD.","korea ranked 27th among ,south korea ranked 27th ,among lowest in oecd ,lowest in oecd south ,korea ranked 27th","['South Korea', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'the OECD ’s How‘s', 'South Korea', 'OECD', 'OECD', 'Denmark', 'nordic', 'Iceland']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.84732181  0.35257873

It will simplify the procedures for such students to be granted visas to study, get a job and settle down here more easily. Stressing the need to tackle the shortage of labor force, especially in the research and development sectors lacking qualified researchers, the government plans to increase the number of foreign students on the scholarship program from 21,535 in 2014 to 32,646 by 2020. But the government pledged to toughen rules on unskilled workers, selectively allowing them to reside here and inducing them to work here only for a short term. While more than 1.8 million foreign workers live in Korea, most of them are low-skilled workers, with the population continuing to grow, the government pointed out.According to government data released last year, some 825,000 migrant workers are legally working in the country, 71 percent of whom are doing unskilled jobs typically in labor-intensive sectors such as construction, manufacturing and agriculture. Some 208,778 are thought to be residing in the country illegally.Approximately 45 percent of the foreign workers are employed at factories, with 31 percent working at construction sites and 12 percent hired in the service industry under the Employment Permit System. Only 12 percent are white-collar workers.Under the EPS, authorities have allowed unskilled migrants from 15 nations in Central and Southeast Asia to work in Korea for a maximum four years and 11 months.The government plan largely includes measures to avoid granting residency to those “unlikely to integrate into society” and unable to live independently. It will allow only those earning more than a certain amount to live here and demand domestic companies make more efforts to hire local workers before turning to the foreign workforce.The “foreigner management system,” which will be devised by the Justice Ministry by 2017, will set priorities in accepting foreign workers and the number of migrant workers the authorities will accept based on the nation’s birthrate, economic conditions and economically active population. It will take effect in Korea from 2018-2022. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","plan to loosen immigration ,migrant workers the korean ,korea to restrict inflow ,to loosen immigration controls ,loosen immigration controls on","['korean', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36475495  0.19641042

The company already operates Air Busan based out of Gimhae International Airport in the southeastern part of the country, which serves South Korea's second largest city and South Gyeongsang Province.Asiana set up a formal task force in March after it decided to launch a second affiliate airline and settled on Air Seoul as the name in the following month.Industry sources said Asiana had originally wanted to request a license in May, but this was delayed due to an Asiana plane skidding off the runway in Hiroshima on April 14, and the sharp drop in passenger traffic after the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in late May.Insiders said that opposition from other budget carriers also contributed to the request being forwarded now. The new low-cost carrier is expected to compete fiercely with other no-frills airlines for the popular Japan and Southeast Asia routes.""Details regarding flight schedules will be set up in line with permission given by the transport ministry,"" a company source said.The ministry said business permits are usually given within 25 days of a request being received, while an air operation certificate for domestic routes is released in less than 90 days. ""Once it gets the domestic AOC, Air Busan will have to seek similar permits abroad,"" an official said. ""The local permission will be given, based on the ability of the LCC to operate properly, follow safety rules and improve the convenience of users.""Air Seoul is expected to get its first plane airborne in mid-2016, with its pilots to be borrowed from Asiana initially, before it gradually training its own flight crews.

The third-quarter figure, released by China's National Bureau of Statistics, was lower than the second quarter's 7 percent growth and dimmed prospects about China's 2015 growth target of ""around 7 percent."" This year, China's communist government has introduced a series of measures to shore up the falling economy, including cutting interest rates and reducing the value of the yuan.""In the first three quarters of 2015, as the recovery of the world economy was weaker than expected, China was facing increasing downward pressure of domestic economic development,"" the Chinese statistics bureau said in a statement. Despite the Chinese economy weakening faster than expected, the Chinese statistics bureau said the economic growth is still ""within the proper range."" ""As a whole, the good momentum of steady growth did not change in spite of the slight slowdown in the third quarter of 2015,"" it said. ""The national economy was still running within the proper range, structural adjustments were accelerating, and new momentum was building. ""However, we must be aware that internal and external conditions are complicated and downward pressure for economic development still exists,"" it said.Earlier this month, the International Monetary Fund cut its growth forecast for China's economy to 6.8 percent this year and 6.3 percent next year.  China is trying to transform its export-oriented economy into a consumption-led one. A state-run Chinese newspaper reported on Monday that Chinese economists proposed a target of 6.5 percent growth starting in 2016 for five years as part of economic transformation efforts.The idea of slower economic growth is being discussed ahead of an annual meeting of top leaders later this month, the paper reported. ""Some economists even see short periods of 6 percent growth as tolerable,"" the report said.

(Yonhap)In a separate speech later in the afternoon, Park touched on the TPP again, saying South Korea welcomed the landmark deal and praising the trade bloc for potentially stimulating trade liberalization and economic prosperity. “Having already signed trade agreements with 10 of the 12 TPP-member countries, I believe that Korea is a natural partner for the TPP,” Park said in a speech at the Washington-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies.Her repeated remarks seemed to be sending signals to the U.S. to dispel concerns that Seoul is tilting toward Beijing both economically and politically.Local reports added fuel to criticism against the Korean government, alleging that Washington was disappointed with Seoul for not joining the deal but participating in a Beijing-led regional bank earlier this year.South Korean officials have been trying to curb such concern, pledging that they would strive to join the TPP in any form, after analyzing its impact on the national economy.Earlier this month, trade ministers of the U.S., Japan and 10 other nations reached a landmark deal to form the TPP, after more than seven years of negotiations. The trade deal, if endorsed by the legislature, will break down trade barriers of nations that account for about 40 percent of global gross domestic product.Aside from the TPP, Park also vowed to create a fairer and more transparent market environment to promote U.S. investment to Korea. Listing her efforts in overhauling the nation’s four sectors on the public services, labor, financial and education, Park said Asia’s fourth-largest economy is on the course of massive reform to eradicate abnormal market regulations and practices. She also urged the expansion of the bilateral partnership on creative economy, her vision of integrating technology with creative ideas, stressing that the two countries have sufficient capacity to lead the global economy if they work together.Since arriving Tuesday for a four-day visit, Park has been expressing hopes to expand cooperation with the U.S. in the space industry, particularly on Seoul’s plan to develop a homegrown space rocket by 2020. She also called for close cooperation in research and development and engineering, stressing that Seoul is seeking innovation in manufacturing.By Cho Chung-un, Korea Herald correspondent (christory@heraldcorp.com)","tpp would benefit businesses ,partnership if seoul becomes ,korea park washington president ,pacific partnership if seoul ,more benefits to companies","['WASHINGTON', 'Park Geun', 'korean', 'U.S.', 'the Trans - Pacific Partnership', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'EU', 'China', 'TPP', 'the U.S.']",2,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.58456033  0.51066941

Cho is one of the most-wanted conmen in South Korea, having allegedly scammed up to 50,000 people out of an estimated 4 trillion won ($3.5 billion) in a pyramid marketing scheme.Cho Hee-pal (Yonhap)The 58-year-old established a medical equipment supply company and ran 10 leasing branches to lure potential investors with false promises of high returns on their capital between 2004 and 2008. Amid the burgeoning probe into the pyramid scam, Cho and his aides fled to China in 2008. In 2012, the South Korean police announced that he had died of a heart attack while being taken to a hospital from a hotel in Qingdao, China. But doubts have lingered over his death, with victims claiming that Cho faked his own death to dodge the police probe and public scrutiny. Fresh testimony, revealed by a local media outlet Tuesday, raised the possibility that his death was fabricated. A 47-year-old man claiming to have been a key aide to Cho said that he had talked to him over the phone several times, the last time being in late 2013. The man, surnamed Choi, served an eight-month jail term on charges of hiding Cho, but moved to China with the fugitive. According to his testimony, Cho underwent plastic surgery to change his face upon arriving in China. He also allegedly tried to remove his fingerprints, though that was unsuccessful. Cho also reportedly has several girlfriends in Korea delivering money for him to live in China. He allegedly carries a handgun in his pocket at all times and spends most of his time playing golf and drinking alcohol. Cho is claimed to have lived in Yantai, just one and a half hour’s flight from Incheon, disguised as 53-year-old Korean-Chinese Cho Young-bok, or Cao Yongfu, since 2008. His death was backed by several pieces of evidence, such as a death certificate issued by Chinese authorities, medical records written by Chinese doctors and video footage of his funeral service in China. But victims argued that Cho might have bribed Chinese government officials to obtain falsified documents to prove his death. They also questioned the videotape, as it is rare to record funerals in Korea. There have also been speculations that the police hastily announced Cho’s death without confirming the facts at the time to defend senior prosecutors and police officers involved in the fraud case. So far, six senior police officials and prosecutors were convicted of accepting kickbacks from Cho in return for leniency in the investigations into his fraud scheme.With Kang’s return, the prosecution is expected to speed up the probe into whether Cho is still alive, his hidden assets and alleged big-scale collusion between investigators and Cho.Kang Tae-yong, Cho’s No. 2 man in the pyramid scheme, was apprehended by the Chinese police at his residence in Jinangsu Province on Saturday, seven years after he escaped to China. He allegedly took charge of the company’s finances and lobbying investigators.Kang is expected to be extradited to Korea as early as this weekend. As the suspect might keep mum about Cho, the prosecution plans to focus on tracing Cho’s false bank accounts and flow of his assets. It has already found 120 billion won under Cho’s false bank accounts.

""Such poor conditions affected the growth of children and babies as it affected the nutritional levels of young people, which impacted their weight and height.""  Reflecting this, media reports have claimed that as of 2014, the minimum height requirement of new recruits in the North Korean military was lowered to 143 centimeters.  The report also said that with girls and young women between the ages of 15 through 21 expected to bear children in the next five to 15 years, there are rising health risks for newborns.  In the future, humanitarian aid going to North Korea needs to be concentrated on malnutrition and the health of young mothers, it suggested.

The Agency for Defense Development acknowledged that the device disappeared from its office in Moscow last October. The equipment, last used in June 2014, is attached to a fax machine and designed to encode plain text and decipher encrypted messages.  (Yonhap)The Defense Ministry immediately instructed the institute last February to cease the use of the gear across the board, collecting them and changing their passcodes, officials said, adding that there have not been any breaches of crucial data. The Daejeon-based think tank runs its office in three countries and the Moscow unit opened in 2011. “The military has retrieved all units of the same model that had been used overseas and taken steps to alter the cryptographic program and encryption keys,” ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said at a news briefing. “As of now, no encoding gadgets are operating abroad other than those installed at the military attache’s offices, and we plan to reinforce security checks so as to prevent a recurrence of such an incident.” Wary of a possible intelligence breach, the National Intelligence Office, Defense Security Command and Defense Intelligence Agency have launched a probe into the device’s vanishing. The ADD also levied a one-month salary cut on a security manager as a penalty for his lax oversight. Officials said the security manager frequently goes on business trips. But concerns persist as the whereabouts of the machine and mastermind and background of the incident remain in the dark, and no related investigation has been carried out on the spot. “The machine was mobilized only three times over the last three years ― all in 2014 ― and there is absolutely no possibility for a leak because once you open it, a sensor prompts the decryption key to be deleted,” another ministry official said on customary condition of anonymity. “Given the sensitivity of the issue, we had to be cautious not to cause any diplomatic problems.”By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","device missing in russia ,lost fax encryption system ,korean encryption device missing ,missing in russia south ,missing in russia","['South Korea ’s', 'Russia', 'Moscow']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44612622 -0.11354067

The project will be completed by 2021 by Italian construction company Salini Impregilo, and financed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Asian Development Bank and Korea Export-Import Bank. The fund’s advisor is International Financial Corporation. After 35 years of operation, the plant will be handed over to Georgia free of charge. The Georgian Embassy in Korea was actively involved in the project’s negotiation from the beginning, which led to Salini Impregilo being selected in the international tender.

No new cases have been reported since July 4, with the last person to have contracted the illness testing negative for the virus early this month.The MERS outbreak prompted foreign tourists, especially Chinese, to cancel their visits to South Korea in droves, pounding the local tourism and retail sectors.The agency also said the number of Japanese visitors, which is expected to sink 19.2 percent on-year in 2015 due to MERS, will likely recover next year and reach 2.2 million in 2019.Considerably more visitors from Thailand, Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam are expected starting in 2016 thanks to the high popularity of South Korean pop culture in those countries, the KTO said.

Seoul City and Gyeonggi Province had the lowest accumulated precipitation with 572.4 milliliters, making up 43 percent of the average.The public weather agency suspected that worsening El Nino -- prolonged warming in the Pacific Ocean surface temperature -- contributed to the drought. Once El Nino gets serious, it weakens the North Pacific High, which controls the rainfall on the Korean Peninsula, especially, in the summer monsoon season. While the summer showers usually make up 70 percent of the total rainfall of the year in Korea, the rain this summer recorded less than half of the average, officials said. Korea Meteorological Administration forecast that the winter rainfall will be around the average but it doubted whether that would help ease the drought, the authorities said.","korea faces severe drought ,severe drought most regions ,severe drought particularly seoul ,are suffering severe drought ,faces severe drought most","['Seoul City', 'the Korea Meteorological Administration', 'Seoul City', 'Gyeonggi Province']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.98583269 -0.45300898

The president's move sparked a series of contributions, with the fund drawing more than 1.92 billion won from about 50,000 people in the first five days after its launch.

So South Korean companies at the complex are saving water,"" Jeong Joon-hee, ministry spokesman, told a regular press briefing.

The North's border city of Kaesong saw aggregate market size grow by around 16 percent in the cited period.Pyongsong, about 30 kilometers north of Pyongyang, was an exception as the closure of the wholesale market in 2010 decreased the city's market size by 70 percent.The report said that satellite imagery cannot capture whether markets are actually operating, but relevant datasets showed ""policies of market repression have not translated into permanent closures and removals of markets.""It also said aggregate market space per capital is larger in North Korea's southern areas than in the northern parts, indicating that domestic agriculture may also be a major driver of the market economy.The existence of large markets per capita in the western port cities, such as Nampo and Haeju, may be related to trade via sea routes, it said.

(Yonhap)The centerpiece of his foreign policy, the rebalance or ""pivot"" to Asia popularized by Hillary Clinton when she served as secretary of state, is intended to devote more diplomatic, security and economic resources and attention to the continent after a decade monopolized by Middle East crises and costly wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.Monday's agreement ""strengthens our strategic relationships with our partners and allies in a region that will be vital to the 21st century,"" Obama said.China notably is not party to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which brings together 12 countries representing some 40 percent of the global economy.When he arrived in the White House nearly seven years ago, Obama showed his intent to chart a new course.""As America's first Pacific president, I promise you that this Pacific nation will strengthen and sustain our leadership in this vitally important part of the world,"" Obama said in Tokyo in November 2009 as he kicked off his first tour to Asia.""The future of the United States and Asia is inextricably linked,"" he insisted at the time, as he announced Washington's intent to ""strengthen old alliances and build new partnerships"" in the region.For Douglas Paal, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the trade pact sealed in Atlanta, Georgia provides ""real new energy"" to the rebalancing and boosts ""the narrative for US engagement"" in Asia.In previous decades one could argue that Washington was merely ""continuing its post-World War II military engagement"" in the region, whereas now the United States is strengthening its diplomatic efforts to reach the high water mark of the 1990s, said Paal, a former diplomat.Beijing doesn't make the rules Ten days after Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Washington, where tense undercurrents marked his trip, Obama was careful to emphasize the need Monday for a regional counterweight against Beijing.""When more than 95 percent of our potential customers live outside our borders, we can't let countries like China write the rules of the global economy,"" Obama stressed.The remark has obvious domestic political reach. The president knows that getting Congress -- controlled by Republicans who are loathe to hand Obama a clear victory -- to back him on the trade deal will not be easy, and he intends to capitalize on the strong anti-Beijing suspicion that prevails on Capitol Hill in order to sway opponents.The Democratic president faces stiff resistance within his own camp from some lawmakers who fear the accord could lead to US job losses. Republicans are traditionally more supportive of free trade, but this year there is disunity on the issue within their caucus.According to a law passed in June, Congress will have the ability to vote up or down on the accord, but not the chance to amend it.The process will take months, and the White House has refused to provide a timeline.For Paal, if TPP is indeed ""a message to Beijing"" that the United States intends to solidify its influential role in Asia, it should not be interpreted as one of exclusion.""If China is successful in bringing its economic reforms to completion -- that's a big hypothetical -- in two, three or maybe five years, they themselves will want to be part of TPP,"" Paal said, adding that China could view it as a powerful growth engine at a time the Asian giant's economy is flagging.The 12 nations that have reached agreement on the TPP after seven years of negotiations are: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States and Vietnam.

Launched amid a reconciliatory mood between the rival Koreas, the joint factory park posted $14.9 million in production in its first year of operations in 2005 and its annual output grew to more than $100 million in 2007. The yearly production volume has steadily increased every year to amount to $470 million in 2014, except for 2013 when the two Koreas suspended operations due to inter-Korean tensions.The speedy production growth helped the Kaesong Industrial Complex surpass the $1 billion mark in accumulated output in 2010 and the $2 billion level in 2013.  The production volume for the first half of this year stood at $278 million, and if this pace continues, the joint park could post annual production of more than $500 million for all of 2015 for the first time in its 11-year history. Currently, the joint Gaeseong park hosts 124 South Korean companies, a sharp growth from 18 firms in 2005.The number of North Korean workers employed in the complex has also soared from around 6,000 to 54,000 during the same period. Fabric businesses account for 58 percent of the South Korean companies running factories inside the Gaeseong Industrial Complex, while machinery represents 19 percent, followed by electronics and chemical. ""For the future development of the factory park, there should be a complete settlement of wage issues as well as improvement in inter-Korean relations,"" Shin Han-yong, vice chairman of the South Korean management committee for the complex, said.

The cost includeS $310 for accommodation and $128 for food expenses.  Korea Tourism Organization officials welcome Chinese tourists arriving in Seoul for China’s National Day holiday Friday at Incheon International Airport. (Yonhap)The ranking was determined based on the Corporate Travel Index, an annual report released by Business Travel News in the U.S. The average daily travel cost of 100 major cities in the world was $351, down by $17. Seoul’s cost, however, rose by $12. Seoul’s ranking has sharply climbed over the past few years. In 2011, Korea stood at 58th with $332, jumping to 25th with $426 by last year. Of the 100 cities, Caracas in Venezuela topped the ranking with $1,325 this year, followed by London with $576 and Hong Kong with $529. While the rising travel cost drew concerns, Korea has seen a sharp drop in the number of tourists since the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak hit the country in late May. The number of visitors declined by 40 percent in July, and the booking rate for tours also plummeted by over 80 percent in the summer, according to tourism officials. As part of the efforts to draw more tourists, Seoul Metropolitan Government vowed Tuesday to hold a welcome week for foreign visitors in early October, particularly targeting Chinese tourists during China’s National Day holiday. From Oct. 1-10, the city will run various welcoming events in tourist spots such as Myeong-dong, Itaewon and Gangnam. It will open nine temporary tourist information booths in the city to better support the visitors, officials said. The municipality also vowed to compensate tourists on-site if any overcharging cases are confirmed. Over 210,000 Chinese visitors are expected to arrive in Seoul on holiday in October, up about 30 percent year-on, they said. Under the slogan of “The Time is Now,” Seoul City has implemented a wide range of tourism promotion measures over the summer. While injecting 23 billion won ($19.2 million) to the MERS-hit tourism industry, Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon flew to China for a “tourism sales trip.”As of August, the number of tourists recovered to about 74 percent compared to the last year, the city said. During Chuseok, a large number of Chinese visitors also traveled to Jejudo Island, one of the most popular sightseeing regions.From Friday to Monday, about 40,000 foreign tourists visited the island, which is nearly equivalent to half the number of total foreign visitors to the island in July, the Jejudo Island tourism authorities said.

In 1960, when related data started to be compiled, the ratio stood at just 2.9 percent.   The agency expects the percentage to further increase to 15.7 percent in 2020, rise to 24.3 percent in 2030, when the country's population is expected to peak, and soar to 40.1 percent in 2060.  There have been growing fears that South Korea is fast becoming an ""aged society,"" in which more than 14 percent of the population is 65 or older. Asia's fourth-largest economy became an ""aging society"" in 2000, when the ratio topped 7 percent, and is likely to be classified as an aged society in 2017 or 2018 at the latest.  Experts worry that the aging population, coupled with the low birthrate, poses a serious threat to the nation's economy as it could lead to fewer working people and increased spending on health and welfare. The country has one of the lowest birthrates among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development member states.  According to the data, 5.6 working-age people are supporting the livelihood of one senior citizen this year, down from 5.8 to 1 last year. If the current low birthrate continues, the ratio is expected to fall to 4.5 in 2020, plunge to 2.6 in 2030 and 1.2 in 2060.   The decrease in numbers translates into younger people paying more taxes and other outlays to support senior citizens.   Slightly over 31 percent of the seniors were employed in 2014, with 41.9 percent of the men having jobs. This is a slight gain from 30.9 percent reported in 2013. There are no numbers for this year.  As of this year, 61 percent of people between the ages of 55 and 79 wanted to work, the data showed.  ""A majority of them wanted to work because they needed to supplement their retirement benefits, while quite a few said they sought employment because they liked working,"" the statistical office said.   When picking jobs, senior citizens placed the greatest priority on working hours, followed by wage levels and future job security.  The data also showed that 30.6 percent of the country's basic livelihood security benefit recipients were seniors, with 39.6 percent of them getting some sort of state pension.   The average pension received by people aged between 55 and 79 stood at 490,000 won ($411.8), although about half of all senior pensioners got 100,000-250,000 won per month.

In August, the jobless rate for people between the ages of 15 and 29 hit 8 percent, much higher than the headline rate of 3.4 percent.  Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan said the government will make full use of its budget and taxation policies to help create employment opportunities.      ""Creating good, regular jobs for young people is a core policy goal of the government,"" the minister said in a welcoming speech at a youth job fair in Daegu, 302 kilometers southeast of Seoul.  Choi, who doubles as deputy prime minister in charge of economic policies, said the society as a whole must do its part to improve employment for young people.   The minister praised a recent landmark deal on the country's labor reform, expressing hope that it could contribute to creating more jobs down the road.  ""More regular jobs can be created only by fundamentally revamping the labor market, setting up a wage peak system and giving more freedom related to the hiring and firing of workers,"" he said.  Last week, labor, management and government representatives reached the agreement that would make it easier to lay off underperforming workers and give companies greater leeway to change the rules of employment.   At present, the country's labor laws effectively restrict the firing of workers unless the company is facing extreme difficulties.   The wage peak system advocated by the government calls for people nearing retirement age to accept lower wages with the money saved by this arrangement to be used to hire new employees.  Choi said the government will do its part to strengthen the social security net so that people who are laid off from work can find employment in other jobs.  The minister, meanwhile, said nowhere is unemployment among young people a key concern more than in Daegu, which does not have head offices of conglomerates or make big-name manufactured goods like autos and ships.  Since 1995, about 20,000 people have been leaving the city every year to find employment elsewhere, he said, stressing that the city and its inhabitants must join forces to create work for young people to tackle the issue.

Given that Park’s annual remuneration stood at 192 million won last year, her monthly contribution could reach about 3.2 million won.Hwang and other members of the Cabinet and public organizations will follow suit and make donations, Hwang said.The move came a day after Park proposed to establish the fund to help create employment opportunities for the young, as she welcomed the landmark labor reform deal reached by the labor, businesses and government.The decision was seen to sooth the opponents who have criticized the government-initiated measures as favoring the businesses in the name of creating job opportunities for the younger population by loosening employment security of the older demographics.“We held a meeting of Cabinet members to discuss ways to create the fund and how to use it as directly proposed by President Park as noblesse oblige,” Hwang said.Members of the ruling Saenuri Party’s Supreme Council including chairman Rep.

The slight improvement came as students took part-time jobs during the summer break.Meanwhile, Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan said during a separate event that creating full-time jobs for young people is the main goal of an ongoing push to reform South Korea’s labor market.“What has to be done in the future is more important,” Choi said in a speech at a job fair in the port city of Busan. “The ultimate goal of change is to make it possible for companies to hire young people without worrying about more personnel outlays.”The labor reform agreement could make it easier for companies to dismiss underperforming workers and alter the rules of employment. It also outlines measures to tackle the nonregular workers issue and bolster unemployment benefits and the country’s social security net.According to the government and management, greater labor market flexibility can create more openings for young people, who have been hurt by a drop in the number of regular jobs. The deal, which needs to be approved by lawmakers, also aims to promote the government-initiated wage peak system, which calls for workers nearing retirement age to accept salary cuts with the money saved by this arrangement to be used to hire new employees.Choi, who doubles as deputy prime minister in charge of economic affairs, said the National Assembly should support the agreement by passing related laws, with management and labor taking steps to expand employment and labor market flexibility. For its part, the government will invest resources to strengthen the country’s social security net, he said.The finance minister further said that the government is committed to supporting programs that link school studies with practical skills that can help young people secure jobs.From news reports","donate 20 million won ,to donate 20 million ,donate 20 million ,youth jobs fund president ,monthly salary each month","['Park Geun', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Hwang', 'Park']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51728177  0.18457909

Households that belonged to the poorest 20 percent, on the other hand, spent 236,025 won a month.  The Korea Herald file photoThroughout 1998 to 2014, food was the biggest expense for low-earning households in Korea, followed by housing, children’s education and dining or traveling. While they always spent the biggest portion of their income on food during this period, the group has been spending more on housing and less on education since 2010. The lowest-income group of households spent 13.3 percent of their income to educate their children in 2010, but only 11.7 percent last year. The proportion of their income spent on housing, on the other hand, increased from 15.8 percent to 17.1 percent in the same period. Throughout the years, their lowest expenditure went to traveling and dining out. Households in the wealthiest 20 percent, on the other hand, always spent the largest share of their income on their children’s education from 1998 to 2014, followed by dining or traveling, food and housing. The order did not change throughout the years. Last year, they spent the least on housing -- 8.8 percent of their total income -- while spending the largest amount, 15.1 percent, on their children’s education.Education has been regarded as the key to social mobility in Korea, where 80 percent of high school students are estimated to have enrolled in college since 2000. The country is also notorious for its competitive education system. The average Korean high school student studies up to 13 hours a day and sleeps only 5.5 hours a night. Also, the country has the highest reliance on the private education market among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations. While 37.2 percent of the funding for educational institutes came from the private sector in Korea last year, 97 percent of education costs in Sweden and Denmark were paid by government.Researcher Park Jong-seo, who wrote the study, said Korean families, especially the low-earning ones, are burdened by the education cost for their children. “I think this is one of the reasons why the fertility rate is low in the country,” he said. “Most Koreans think it’s the parent’s responsibility to make sure his or her child gets the best education possible, which leads to better life and employment opportunities. Now, people feel burdened by this responsibility and choose not to have children at all.”While most Korean children have access to public education regardless of their socioeconomic status, not every child has access to pricy private education that often leads to better grades and other opportunities, he said. This eventually leads to an increasing economic inequality and decreasing social mobility, he said. “We need two things,” Park said. “One is to reform the current education system, which relies too much on the private education sector. The other is to increase welfare benefits to low-earning households so they have better access to more cultural and social resources for their children.”By Claire Lee(dyc@heraldcorp.com)","income households cut education ,households cut education spending ,korea education is slipping ,the wealthiest 20 percent ,low income households cut","['South Korea', 'the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs', 'korean']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34913674  0.14013028

The agreement was reached after months of tense negotiations.On Monday, a major umbrella labor group approved the deal. ""Though the deal was reached after many challenges, it falls far short of a reform that can tackle youth jobless problems and create a fair and flexible labor market,"" the lobby groups said in a joint statement. The lobbies, including the Federation of Korean Industries and the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry, singled out a term in the deal where they agreed to clarify necessary procedures ""based on current law and legal precedents"" when revising or terminating employment contracts with workers.Currently, companies can terminate employees' contracts only when they are either involved in a corruption or an embezzlement case.

93,93,[Graphic News] Policies fail to boost South Korea’s fertility rate,"South Korea’s demographic policies have failed to boost the nation’s critically low fertility rate despite spending 81 trillion won ($69 billion) to implement the measures since 2006.According to Rep.

Shim Jae-chul of the ruling Saenuri Party, the nation’s fertility rate, which stands at 1.21 children per woman this year, in fact decreased from 2006 -- 1.25 children per woman. The number of newborns also dropped from 448,200 in 2006 to 435,300 this year, according to the lawmaker.The budget for the policies, however, increased significantly over the nine years. The government allocated 14.7 trillion won for its policies to encourage parents to have children this year, which is about seven times larger than the budget of 2.1 trillion won in 2006. The policies implemented since 2006 include child care allowance for all parents with young children up to age of 2 years, more after-school programs for children of double-income households, and encouraging employers to grant maternity leave for their female workers. Some experts have said that one of the biggest reasons behind the policy failure is the lack of programs for young, single Koreans who are forced to put off marriage and having children because of expensive housing and limited job security. Gender inequality in the nation’s labor force has also been also pointed out. According to Rep. Min Hyun-joo of the ruling Saenuri Party, some 260,000 women were fired from their work while taking their maternity leave in the last five years.The government expects that the nation’s military would be short of 84,000 soldiers by 2030, and the health care cost for the elderly would result in a deficit of 47.7 trillion won ($44 billion) in the national health insurance fund in the same year, if the current fertility rate continues. The government is scheduled to announce its revised demographic policies for the next five years -- 2016-2020 -- next month.","demographic policies have failed ,despite spending 81 trillion ,south korea fertility rate ,critically low fertility rate ,decreased from 2006 25","['South Korea ’s', 'Shim Jae - chul', 'Saenuri Party']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.74091142  0.58406299

(Yonhap)Though the government remains determined, citing the time constraint, it also faces a tough road ahead. If ironing out the plan, the government and ruling party are expected to face fierce objection from the opposition lawmakers at the National Assembly for taking unilateral action and ignoring its earlier promise that it would respect the panel’s decision. When Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan announced the government’s plan to legislate labor reforms on Friday, the parliamentary audit session for the Labor Ministry was put on hold due to resistance from opposition lawmakers. “The government’s announcement to unilaterally push for legislating the market reforms is an action that ignores the National Assembly,” said Rep. Kim Young-joo of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy and the head of the parliamentary committee for labor issues. “Without the trilateral agreement, it will be difficult for the bill to pass through the Assembly,” she added.Amid intensifying pressure, the embattled panel resumed the three-way talks at 6 p.m. on Sunday in an attempt to reach a breakthrough. Kim Dae-hwan, the chairman of the trilateral committee, also offered a mediation draft at Saturday’s meeting to draw a compromise, but the top negotiators from each side failed to bridge their differences. The labor circle allegedly suggested that the trilateral committee discuss agreeable items first, leaving the disputed agendas to be negotiated in a separate forum later. But the government maintained that it should map out “clear” administrative guidelines that stipulate the deregulation of dismissals for underperforming workers and companies’ discretion to change company rules without union approval. The issues have remained focal points in the three-way negotiations, prompting the nation’s largest umbrella union group, the Federation of Korean Trade Unions, to walk out of the talks in protest in April.Under the current labor laws, companies cannot fire employees without giving a justifiable reason, allowing them to terminate a contract with employees only when they are involved in either corruption or embezzlement. But such a regulation is too “strict,” which needs to be eased to sharpen companies’ competitiveness and reduce their burden for soaring costs in the face of slowing economy, the government said. Employers also said that the practice of “overly protecting” workers’ employment in the market leads them to avoid recruiting new employees and instead rely on nonregular workers to maintain their competitiveness. The laborers, however, argued that the easing of restrictions would only result in undermining their job security, giving businesses a legal basis to fire workers more easily.  Also high on the agenda has been whether to make it easier for businesses to change employment rules without union content. Currently, employers need a trade union’s agreement when changing company rules. The plan would lay a groundwork for employers to push for changing the employment contracts or salary system even without union approval, which will give a boost to expanding the government-backed peak wage system in the private sector.Under the peak wage system, companies pay senior employees reduced salaries after the workers reach a certain age, generally between 55 and 60, in return for extending the retirement age by a few years. With the official retirement age set to rise by two years to 60 next year, the government has claimed that the revamp in the overall wage system is vital to generating jobs for the young. But the labor bloc has fiercely opposed the plan, viewing it as a scheme to slash their wages for employers to save on labor costs.  The talks among management, labor and government came in line with President Park Geun-hye’s campaign for labor market reforms, a top priority on her policy agendas in the second half of this year. The government has vowed to implement the reforms within this year, even without laborers’ approval, to inject flexibility in what it has called “rigid” labor market. The increased flexibility in the market is key to spurring the nation’s faltering economy and tackling youth unemployment, the government claimed. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","market reforms remained grim ,reform talks in stalemate ,grim over the weekend ,facto ultimatum last week ,reforms remained grim over",['Saenuri Party'],2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63552892  0.43353069

The German term “Energiewende” -- meaning energy transition -- sums up the Teutonic solutions causing tectonic shifts in the direction of sustainable development: dismantling of nuclear power, switching to renewable alternatives and reducing carbon dioxide emissions. As proof, Germany on July 25 set a national record of meeting 78 percent of daily electricity demand through renewables, surpassing the previous record of 74 percent in May last year. A combination of political will, strategic policies, free market competition and grassroots activism foster a fertile ground for a green economy, simultaneously strengthening environmentalism and entrepreneurship.Germany embassy’s deputy head of mission Dr. Rolf Schuster (German embassy)“The idea that a switch to renewable energies would raise Germany’s electricity import and bring about ‘blackouts’ has proved to be wrong,” the German embassy’s deputy head of mission Dr. Rolf Schuster told The Korea Herald in early September. “Germany became a net exporter of electricity and the price has continued to fall. Renewable energy also has a strategic aspect of bolstering energy supply security, crucial particularly for countries reliant on import.”According to the diplomat, the decentralized format of renewable energies also ignites free market competition between companies. Germany’s transition has spurred innovation and research leading to significant productivity gains, he noted. Renewable energies of wind, solar, hydro and biomass power generate on average 28 percent of daily electricity in Germany. In the first half of this year, the country exported 25 terawatt-hours, equivalent to around 8 percent of all electricity generated domestically. The renewables last year collectively produced 403 terawatt-hours with a surplus of 34 terawatt-hours in the trade balance with neighboring countries -- the Netherlands, Austria and Poland -- which have then passed on remaining portions to Belgium, the U.K., Switzerland and the Czech Republic. As Germany aims to shut down all of its nuclear power stations by 2022 and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050, more than 1.5 million renewable power plants have been installed over the last 20 years, and their share in the energy mix is set to double by 2035. In Germany, wind turbines are installed across the gusty northern fields, both offshore and onshore, and solar panels cover the sunny southern regions’ rooftops. Thanks to technological breakthroughs, windmills have become 40 times more powerful over the last 20 years, and coal and gas usage has shrunk by a large margin. “The profit from solar and wind powers, unlike nuclear, gas and coal, is not determined by variable costs, as wind and sun are available free of charge,” Schuster explained. “As technology develops, the cost of investing in these devices will decrease further, as will the average price of electricity.”The wholesale electricity price at base load in Germany has come down to roughly 3 euro cents (3.4 cents) per kilowatt-hour, and is on course to fall continuously, he added. The industry average price per kilowatt-hour is around 8 euro cents, and the household price is around 30 euro cents, comparatively high due to taxes and levies.As households use 25 percent of overall electricity, its relatively high price incentivizes saving energy: Families resort to energy-efficient light bulbs, induction cooking and insulation, and seek renewable solutions such as solar panels on their rooftops.Germany’s renewable transition has also spurred research innovation and industry collaboration benefitting conglomerates as well as small and medium-sized enterprises. As wind and solar powers generate a fluctuating amount of energy depending on weather, smart grids, storage facilities and efficient solutions are constantly improved. Smart grid technology enables transferring electricity produced at the wrong time, place or amount to different locations after it is stored in facilities, thereby balancing demand and supply around the clock. A myriad of software is developed to pinpoint solar and wind forecasting and integrate them into the energy infrastructure. Information and communications technology solutions identify and remove bottlenecks without delay. “Korean companies, which are very strong in all relevant technologies, have vital roles to play by partnering with German firms,” he said. “The technology is there. It’s a matter of implementing and refining.”Samsung SDI, with its innovative energy storage systems, has provided batteries to German renewable power utility companies; Korea’s Hanwha Group bought German photovoltaic solar cell manufacturer Q Cells in 2012, growing it into Europe’s largest solar panel company -- Hanhwa Q Cells.Germany’s “Energiewende” started in the 1970s based on the previous decade’s economic foundations. The German economy that took off in the early 1960s satisfied citizens’ basic needs, allowing them to care about “other dimensions” of the environment, health and well-being, according to Schuster.Germany’s sustainable transition is also tied to European regulations enacted and enforced by the EU commission in Brussels, which are commonly applied across the European market. The 1973 oil crisis, Three Miles Island nuclear meltdown in Pennsylvania in 1979 and the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 have sharpened awareness of the dangers of relying on fossil fuel and nuclear power, leading to the formation of renewable energy institutes and the Green Party throughout the 1970s and ’80s. “The Fukushima nuclear meltdown in Japan has served as a crude wakeup call to phase out nuclear power,” Schuster said. “Shortly after the disaster in 2011, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government made a clear decision to break with nuclear power.”For the first time in German history, a prime minister from the Green Party -- Winfried Kretschmann -- was elected in an economic power state of Baden-Wurttemberg. Kretschmann visited Korea in May 2013.Since Germany has committed to reduce CO2 emissions, increasing the use of fossil fuels as a substitute of nuclear power was not an option, he stressed, citing safety concerns and high long-term costs. “The only way to phase out nuclear power without substituting the energy need with coal or gas was renewable energy.”As nuclear waste emits toxic radiation for hundreds of thousands of years, storing it completely sealed from leakage into the soil, including the ground water, is critical, the diplomat emphasized. The “considerable cost” of decommissioning nuclear plants and storing wastes must also be taken into account when comparing the cost of different energy sources, he added.

Among firefighters, a total of 104 were killed.     Investigations into the Aug. 12 blasts at the Ruihai International Logistics warehouses showed they were located closer to homes than permitted, and stored much more hazardous material than authorized, including 700 tons of highly toxic sodium cyanide.     A series of massive explosions late at night shattered windows and tore facades off buildings for kilometers (miles) around, while launching debris including heavy steel storage canisters into nearby communities with the force of an artillery shell. Disgruntled homeowners have held numerous angry protests demanding the government buy back their apartments, saying they are unlivable.    The disaster has raised questions about corruption and government efficiency, potentially tarnishing the communist government led by President Xi Jinping, who has made those two issues a hallmark of his administration.     Authorities are investigating malfeasance in the issuing of permits and regulation of the company, and have detained 12 of its employees and executives. They include the primary owner, who was on the board of a state-owned company and kept his ownership of Ruihai hidden as a silent partner.     Also detained as part of the investigation are 11 government officials, while the head of the government body in charge of industrial safety, Yang Dongliang, has been placed under investigation for corruption.     Yang had previously worked for 18 years in Tianjin in state industry and local government, rising to executive vice mayor.     Authorities say they have sealed all waterways leading out of the blast zone to curb cyanide contamination as teams in hazmat suits clean up hazardous debris.     According to the Tianjin Environmental Protection Bureau, water samples inside the disaster zone have shown levels of cyanide as high as 20 times above that considered safe. No cyanide has been detected in nearby seawater or areas outside the 3-kilometer (1.8-mile ) radius quarantine zone.

Korea’s post-transfer Gini index -- the income inequality rate after social security transfers have been made -- marked 30.8 percent, ranking 18th among the 30 advanced economies. Notably, Korea’s pre-transfer Gini index marked second lowest among the advanced nations. The post-transfer index is only 2.8 percentage points lower than its pre-transfer index, meaning the nation’s distribution of income is likely to be unequal.  (Yonhap)“Corruption (in Korea) is another area of concern, allowing those with power in various domains to extract rents,” the report said, adding that home and financial ownership in Korea are notably low while social protection, including health care, remains “quite limited.”“By underexploiting this lever, Korea goes from having one of the most equal income distributions before transfer to a much less equal one after transfers and taxes compared with other advanced economies.”Public transfer payments, such as unemployment benefits and social retirement benefits, are made to disproportionately benefit and support those with the lowest incomes. Also, under most tax systems worldwide, those with high incomes pay proportionately higher income taxes than the low-income earners. The system, if it works correctly, narrows the gap between the rich and the poor and reduces income inequality. The rates shown in the WEF report, however, show that Korea’s tax and transfer systems are failing to reduce inequality substantially. For example, the country currently does not run a state-run unemployment assistance program, which makes the unemployed vulnerable to poverty and social isolation. Meanwhile, Norway and Sweden had some of the lowest post-transfer Gini index among the 30 countries. Norway’s post-transfer index was 24.4 percent, significantly lower than its pre-transfer index which stood at 44.8 percent. Sweden’s post-transfer index, at 23.6 percent, was also notably lower than its pre-transfer index at 48 percent, meaning its distribution of income through tax and public transfers is relatively more equal than other countries. “It is imperative to provide opportunities for the poor and vulnerable to access education, health, and other basic services which can improve their human capital,” the report said. Korea also belonged to the most corrupt 20 percent of the 30 advanced countries, with a poverty rate -- the proportion of those who belong to the less than half of the respective median national income -- of 14.6 percent. Its poverty rate was also one of the highest among the 30 nations.

According to a report by the Korean Smokers’ Association submitted to Rep. Yoon Ho-joong of the main opposition New Politics Alliance of Democracy, the number of cigarette packs sold in July stood at just over 350 million, close to the average monthly sales over the past three years, 362 million. (Yonhap)Tobacco sales more than halved to 170 million packs in January, compared to the same period a year earlier, after the government raised tobacco prices by 2,000 won ($1.70) per pack from 2,500 won to 4,500 won on New Year’s Day.The 80 percent price hike came as part of the government’s efforts to lower the nation’s smoking rate amid public health concerns. South Korea has one of the highest male smoking rates among OECD countries at 43.7 percent, according to the Health Ministry.But the figures have gradually bounced back, with sales increasing from 240 million in March to 270 million in May and 350 million in July, the report said.The recovering sales, coupled with the accompanying rise in tax revenues, rekindled a debate over whether the government‘s price hike was to benefit the nation’s health or to collect more taxes. According to the Ministry of Strategy and Finance, the government secured an extra 1.2 trillion won in tax payments in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year. “The government stressed that the price hike was aimed at promoting public health, not at reaping tax revenues, but it only resulted in putting more burden on smokers,” said Rep. Yoon.“The authorities cannot get away from criticism that it raised the cigarette price to make up for the shortfall in last year’s tax revenues,” the lawmaker added. The government has been increasing its antismoking campaigns in recent years, including its push for a bill that makes it obligatory for tobacco-makers to display word and image warnings on cigarette packs. The passage of the antismoking bill finally came earlier this year, after 11 attempts since its first try in 2002. It would deter Koreans from smoking by highlighting the dangers through pictorial warning labels required to cover more than half of the cigarette packs. Lawbreakers could face up to a year in jail or 10 million won in fines, or revocation of the company’s business license. The bill will take effect next December after an 18-month grace period.But the Korean Smokers’ Association opposed the bill, calling it a “gimmick” to cover up the controversy over the tobacco price hike.“The government’s policy turned out to be a failure and it needs to allow smokers to participate in the decision-making process,” it said in a statement in May.Doubts linger over whether the graphic warnings on cigarette packs will help Koreans give up smoking, with no countries having succeeded in lowering the smoking rate through such a measure. Unclear clauses in the new plan, which stipulates that the images on cigarette packs must not be “excessively” repulsive, are also likely to leave room for argument between the authorities and tobacco industry.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","tobacco sales bounce back ,packs sold in july ,price hike despite the ,sales bounce back despite ,in south korea recovered","['South Korea', 'the Korean Smokers ’ Association', 'Yoon Ho - joong', 'New Politics Alliance of Democracy']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61513644  0.36442775

Baek Kun-ki of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy said the incumbent administration is expected to spend some 13.6 trillion won for defense by the time its term ends in late 2017, whereas the next government would bear more than 24.8 trillion won by 2020.For instance, for a project to adopt four units of Airbus’ in-flight refueling tankers by 2019, the Park government is supposed to fund almost 360 billion won and its successor around 1.8 trillion won, the report claimed. The National Defense Acquisition Program Committee announced the result of the bid in late June, and the France-headquartered company is slated to deliver two planes in 2018 and another two the following year.In another case, the government is set to pay the 376.9 billion won balance by 2018 for Surion initiative ― the country’s first indigenously developed military helicopter built by the Korea Aerospace Industries ― though the delivery will be completed in 2017, the retired four-star Army general said. The mismatch appears to reflect Seoul’s struggle to balance its efforts to modernize weapons systems and boost defense capabilities, and needs to plug budget shortfalls and ensure fiscal soundness. While the Defense Ministry has been pressing ahead with ambitious purchase programs, the average defense budget growth rate stands at just about 3.9 percent under Park. “The next administration will face critical problems maintaining a defense posture unless the incumbent allocates a realistic budget starting next year,” Baek said in a statement, calling for a comprehensive overhaul of the midterm defense plan.

(Korea Forest Service)The Korea Forest Service has successfully brought the nation’s advanced expertise in the forest leisure industry and ecological tourism to Indonesia, widening the scope of environmental cooperation between the two nations. KFS, the state agency for afforestation and forest resources, invited around 30 islanders of Lombok, a global vacation venue in Indonesia, to learn Korea’s latest green leisure know-how. The five-day instruction program was held from Aug. 24 to 28, pinning high hopes on maximizing the tourist value of the lush Indonesian island. The tutorial offered a variety of lectures and on-site training for forest tour guides, craftsmen and butterfly breeders. In addition, the program introduced Korea’s historical New Village Movement, an agricultural development plan that aroused the widespread social participation of farming communities. Earlier in the first half of this year, a group of high-profile forest authorities of Indonesia also participated in KFS’ program. The educational program is part of the Korea-Indonesia cooperative agreement signed by the governmental forest agencies in 2013, the 40th anniversary of Korea-Indonesia diplomatic ties. According to the agreement, Korea and Indonesia support the active exchange of expertise on forest-related industries, including forest-healing leisure plans and living-ecology tourism. KFS’ tutorial aims at contributing to Indonesia’s master plan to invigorate the forest-related tourism industries of Lombok. According to the master plan, Indonesia will establish environmentally friendly tourist facilities for forest healing and ecological tourism in Tunac on Lombok Island by 2018.As a nation with mountainous areas taking up more than 70 percent of the entire territory, Korea has accumulated rich experience and knowledge in forest tourism, according to the KFS. “The tutorial programs focus on the sustainable growth of (Lombok’s) local economy, rather than an instant development of a single tourist program,” a KFS official said.

Most of the patients were infected at the hospital’s emergency room, where the 14th confirmed patient, who was considered a “super-spreader,” stayed from May 27-30.In its effort to avoid repeating the same error, the hospital plans to renovate and expand the size of its emergency room by March of next year.  Song Jae-hoon (second from right) speaks during a press conference in Seoul on Wednesday. (Samsung Medical Center)“Once completed, the facility will be 1.6 times bigger and will have six separate units including ones for cancer patients and those with contagious diseases,” said Song Jae-hoon, director of the hospital. Song also said the hospital will house more than 20 negative air pressure rooms that prevent cross-contamination by next year. Of them, 11 rooms will be installed inside the emergency room, the SMC added.The rooms require using a special ventilation system that produces negative pressure to make sure air flows into the isolation room for infected patients, but does not escape from the room. While the system is normally used to quarantine patients with airborne contagious diseases such as tuberculosis, the hospital did not have any such rooms installed prior to the MERS outbreak.The hospital, which is run by the Samsung Group, also announced its plans to donate 41 billion won to the International Vaccine Institute, an initiative of the U.N. Development Program based in Seoul, to help find a vaccine and cure for the MERS virus over the next five years. The SMC also announced that all patients who arrive at the emergency unit will be treated by specialists, instead of resident doctors or interns. In order to prevent the emergency room from getting overcrowded, the hospital is coming up with a new system where each and every patient can receive their emergency treatment in the first 30 minutes upon their arrival, and either get hospitalized for further treatment or released from the facility within six hours.Korea’s current hospital system, in which family members provide basic care normally carried out by nursing staff in other developed nations, has been largely blamed for the MERS spread, which has claimed 36 lives since May. Many Koreans contracted the disease while caring for or visiting their family members at MERS-affected hospitals including the SMC.To tackle the issue, the hospital announced that every inpatient will now only be allowed to be cared for by a single family member during the hospital stay, and all caretakers must be registered before they arrive at the facilities. Non-registered members will be banned from entering the property, the hospital added.The Health Ministry had refused to share the list of MERS-affected hospitals, including the SMC, for more than two weeks after the index case was confirmed in May. The government had been accused of protecting commercial interests of the hospitals by not sharing the information, rather than keeping the general public safe from the possible infection. After public criticism mounted on the SMC, the heir of the Samsung Group, Lee Jae-yong, made a bow of apology on national television on June 23.

""Recently, Korea, the U.S.and Russia cooperated in a search and rescue operation in extreme conditions for a Korean vessel near the Arctic Ocean. Such cooperation for crisis management will continue to grow in importance.""Outlining South Korea's Arctic policy, Yun said he believes it is possible to seize new opportunities emerging from the Arctic while at the same time coping with the challenges of global warming. Yun emphasized that South Korea is firmly committed to tackling climate change.He also said this week's conference will provide momentum for December's U.N. climate change conference in Paris, and urged leading industrialized nations to put forward their commitments to reducing green house gas emissions.In late June, South Korea offered to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 37 percent by 2030 from 850.6 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalents, an amount Seoul says it would reach if it let business run as usual. The ambitious pledge underscores the country's commitment to play a leading role in the fight against climate change.In 2013, South Korea gained permanent observer status at the Arctic Council, a key decision-making group of countries with territory in the resources-rich region, paving the way for the country to have a greater say in how one of the world's last untapped regions should be developed.""Korea is committed to working closely with the Arctic Council in preserving the Arctic's pristine environment and securing its sustainable development,"" Yun said, adding that South Korea is preparing a national report for submission to the council.

Overlooking this problem is no longer an option,” said Vice Education Minister Kim Jae-choon.The criteria for the assessment included academic achievements of students, curriculum, specialization of its majors, student support, employment rate of graduates, and long-term development plans. A total of 32 four-year colleges and universities along with 34 two-year colleges were included in the lower D and E groups, which will be prevented from participating in state-funded research, scholarship and student loan programs. But universities in group D+ ― which scored between 80 and 89 out of 100 ― that are already participating in state-funded program will be able to continue, although they will be banned from applying for additional programs.The ministry’s original plan was to forcibly cut the number of openings for all but group A, and shut down the universities in the lowest group. But as the law that would have given them the legal grounds to pursue such action is still pending at the National Assembly, the ministry said it had no choice but to induce voluntary reform at each university.

The number for this year will likely hit a record high, with 65 having been nabbed by the police as of July. A total of 210 juvenile offenders were caught taking or possessing drugs from 2012 to 2014, with 85 percent of them coming from Seoul and the surrounding Gyeonggi Province and Incheon. During the same period, a total of 20,397 people were arrested for drug-related crimes. The lawmaker Kim called for measures to crack down on drug sales and exchanges online, noting that the Internet has made it easier for the youth to acquire drugs. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","drug abuse almost triples ,taking drugs nearly tripled ,almost triples south korea ,drugs nearly tripled from ,drugs nearly tripled","['South Korea', 'Kim Jang - sil', 'Saenuri Party', 'the National Police Agency']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62904364  0.20946002

Data from 2012 on Austria, Canada, France, Iceland, Ireland, New Zealand, Slovak Republic, Slovenia and the United States was not available in the report.Even after expanding the scope to outside the OECD, only Lithuania ― at 29.5 per 100,000 ― had a higher rate of suicide than Korea.The suicide rate for Asia’s fourth-largest economy has been highest among all OECD countries every year since 2003 when 28.1 people per 100,000 took their own lives. The rate peaked in 2009 at 33.8. While the country’s rate hovered around the OECD average up until 1995 ― marking 12.7 ― the figure jumped to 21.7 in 1998 when the country was hit hard by the Asia financial crisis. After Koreans, Hungarians were most likely to take their own lives ― marking 22 per 100,000 ― followed by Japan at 19.1.The sky-high suicide rate for Koreans was also apparent among students. Separate data revealed by Rep. Kang Eun-hee of Korea’s Saenuri Party showed that 17 students had committed suicide due to stress from school grades as of Aug. 17, accounting for roughly 23 percent of 61 students who took their own lives during the same period this year. The number of suicides from academic-induced stress in the first semester of this year has already surpassed the nine from 2014. South Korean schools operate two semesters a year with the first one starting in March and the second in September.According to 2014 data by Statistics Korea, suicide was the No. 1 cause of death among people aged 10 to 39. While Koreans showed a relatively high tendency to take their lives, they were ranked near the bottom in various criteria in quality of life.According to Korea’s 2015 edition of OECD’s “How’s Life?” biennial report to provide a comprehensive picture of well-being among OECD countries, the country’s health status, work-life balance and subjective assessment of well-being were ranked 33rd, 31st and 29th. Koreans’ spending on health was also lower than the OECD average. The report showed that Koreans spent about 6.9 percent of their gross domestic product on health in 2012, well below the OECD average of 8.9 percent.Korea’s health spending is also heavily dependent on the private sector: Public sources covered only 56 percent of the spending, compared to 73 percent for all OECD countries.

A 5 percent hike is the same level at which the wage has been increased every year so far.""The most pressing issue of the wage cap has been resolved though there is still a long way to go,"" the official said, asking not to be named. ""But the move is expected to support the stable supply of labor and improve business conditions.""The move is expected to raise the total monthly wage by far more than 5 percent when other compensation is included, according to an official at the group of 124 South Korean firms that are running factories in the park. (Yonhap)The agreement came even as military tension has heightened on the divided peninsula following a land mine explosion blamed on the North in the heavily fortified demilitarized zone.The North has denied any role in the blasts, rejecting Seoul's call for apologizing for the incident that seriously wounded two South Korean soldiers.The joint factory park, opened in 2004, is the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation. It has served as a major revenue source for the cash-strapped North, while South Korea has utilized cheap but skilled North Korean laborers.Seoul has rejected Pyongyang's unilateral move to hike the wage, saying that it breaches a 2004 agreement that calls for the two sides to set wages through consultations.In July, the two sides held talks of the joint committee that operates the complex, the first since June last year, but they failed to reach an agreement.The ministry said that the two Koreas plan to hold a meeting of the committee to discuss how to revise labor guidelines.The government official said that the two sides have agreed to continue to set the wage cap through consultations.""By taking into account the grave situation facing inter-Korean ties, the government plans to take measures to develop the complex,"" the official said.The operation of the complex has been highly swayed by the level of tension on the peninsula.

The gradual opening of the legal sector has come since Korea signed a free trade agreement with the EU in July 2011 and with the U.S. in March 2012.  (The Korea Herald file photo)Foreign law firms were allowed to set up representative offices in Korea immediately after the trade pact took effect, but their roles were limited to providing consulting services on international law as the first step.The second stage, which began two years after the agreements, permitted foreign law firms to split fees with Korean partners.Currently, 25 law firms from the U.S. and the U.K. operate in Korea, with most of them focused on offering consulting services for mergers and acquisitions, intellectual property fair trade, initial public offerings and cross-border litigation for mostly Korean and multinational corporate clients. But the government’s deregulation plan still restricts the foreign law offices from representing clients in Korean courtrooms and handling domestic cases related to inheritance, government affairs and intellectual property, among other fields.On top of that, the foreign law firms that wish to establish a joint operation with Korean counterparts are required to retain at least five lawyers with more than five years of experience and have done business for more than three years. The government has also added a clause banning foreign law firms from owning more than a 49 percent stake in the joint venture “to protect the Korean legal market” from being taken over by foreign legal giants. The Korean Bar Association voiced its concerns over the opening of the legal market, but welcomed the measure to prevent foreign firms from taking control of the joint ventures. “The opening of the market is nothing new anyway,” its spokesperson said. The Korean legal circle remains divided over the impact of the market liberalization, with some expressing concerns over the ever-intensifying competition in the market and others hailing it as a chance to sharpen Korean law firms’ competitiveness.“The entry of foreign firms into the local market will lead to economies of scale, which means it will not be as much a threat to large local firms as expected but will take a toll on small ones,” Kim Sang-kyum, a law professor at Dongguk University, told The Korea Herald. “Big-scale joint ventures between foreign firms and local counterparts will end up monopolizing the best-quality domestic lawyers and big corporate clients in the local market, reducing the room for small and medium-sized local firms to grow.” According to sources in the legal community, South Korea’s legal market is estimated to be worth around 3 trillion won ($2.5 billion), though the official figure is not available. But others in the legal industry said that the opening of the market could be an opportunity for Korea’s small and medium-sized law firms to gain a competitive edge to confront the escalating market competition. “The small and medium-sized law firms have long lagged behind large firms in terms of their consulting skills and influence,” an official from a law firm told The Korea Herald, wishing to remain anonymous. “If the small firms enter a joint venture with foreign giants, they could complement their lack of networks, clout and consulting skills.” He also played down the likelihood of foreign firms dominating the Korean legal market. “The final stage of opening the market will still not allow foreign law firms to fully take domestic cases, meaning that the opening will not drastically change the legal landscape,” he said. But he said the competition would inevitably heat up when more foreign firms make headway into the nation on the back of the eased regulations. Foreign law firms have already solidified their position in offering legal advice to big corporate clients since the trade agreement came into force, occupying an estimated half of the legal consulting market. For large local firms, the years-long gradual opening of the market has prepared them to improve their competitiveness by scaling up their size, hiring more English-speaking lawyers and breaking into the foreign market to forge global networks, according to the legal community. “Big Korean law firms now have the capability to survive independently amid the fierce competition,” said the source, who said that his company had no plans to form a joint operation with foreign firms for the very reason.Lee Won-il, a head lawyer at Barun, one of the nation’s big law firms, also believes that the market liberalization will be a chance to upgrade his company and the local legal market as a whole.“It is premature to expect any outcome for now, but the opening will be a stepping stone for us to face off against global law firms to broaden our clout in the local market,” Lee told The Korea Herald. The foreign firms’ entry into the Korean market also seems to heighten expectations for young local lawyers equipped with overseas experience and English fluency. “The Korean law firms seem saturated, creating fewer jobs for young lawyers,” said Choi Jung-min, who newly became a lawyer earlier this year. ”I expect that more jobs will be generated as foreign firms take root here.”Defying concerns over the impact of the foreign law firms’ entry in the local market, however, the U.S. and British law firms here seemed to remain lukewarm on entering into joint ventures with Korean counterparts. “We don’t have a plan to set up a joint venture in Korea or recruit local lawyers for the time being,” a spokesperson for U.S. law firm Ropes & Gray told The Korea Herald. “We are focusing on consulting clients on the U.S., British and Hong Kong law.”As of last December, eight out of 21 foreign law firms confirmed that they were not considering forming a joint practice with Korean partners, according to a survey. Instead, foreign law firms said they would continue to specialize in their role providing consulting services on foreign laws here, downplaying the idea of being heavily engaged with domestic legal cases.  But behind their hesitancy are “tough restrictions” imposed by the government on scope of their work in the domestic market, local sources said. “When the discussion began over the opening of the Korean legal market years ago, foreign firms had expected that they could hire Korean lawyers as well as represent Korean clients in Korean courtrooms,” a source said. Such expectations were quelled when the government presented a revised bill to impose some limits on their business rights. “The restriction might deter foreign firms from advancing into the market due to low profitability as their activities in Korea will be largely limited,” he speculated. The United States Trade Representatives residing in Korea officially raised a complaint about the restrictions mapped out by the government, saying such heavy restrictions are in violation of the free trade pact. The American Chamber of commerce in Korea also expressed disappointment about what it called “excessive” regulations. The Korean government, however, made it clear that the upcoming plan for the opening of the sector is only “partial,” not completely “final,” hinting at additional measures for further opening in tandem with “changes in the legal market.” The law professor Kim said the partial opening would ultimately lead the market to be completely open for foreign firms in phases, whether local players like it or not. “The size of the Korean legal market itself is small and demand for legal services is limited, so Korean law firms, whether big or small, should more actively eye global expansion and strengthen their competitiveness,” Kim noted.

""Compared to the year before, when trade fell 4.8 percent, this year's drop is more pronounced.""  The think tank based its assessment on data provided by the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations and the Korea International Trade Association. North Korea's exports of coal to China declined 1.6 percent in dollar terms, with the number for iron ore nosediving 70.3 percent.   Falling exports and a subsequent drop in earnings were probably felt by Pyongyang, which will have to consider other means of generating hard currency.   Compared to 2013, when the North's exports of coal reached its peak, this year's numbers represent a 24.6 percent drop.  ""The contraction is noteworthy because the North actually diversified the places it shipped coal to in China,"" the KDI said.  In regards to iron ore, exports declined, both in terms of volume and prices, with the weakening of China's steel industry directly impacting trade. Exports stood at 600,000 tons, down from 1.11 million tons, with the value standing at $22.96 million.  The KDI said Pyongyang's No. 1 import item from its neighbor was filament yarn, followed by cargo trucks and petroleum products.

""It is designed to help boost the local tourism industry.""South Korea's tourism industry has been hit hard by the MERS outbreak that has made foreign tourists shun South Korea. The disease has claimed 36 lives and sickened 186 people, the largest outbreak outside Saudi Arabia.In 2014, a record 14.2 million foreigners visited South Korea, up from just under 12.2 million a year earlier, but the number has nosedived since the first MERS case was confirmed on May 20. The new tax code, scheduled to be sent to the National Assembly for approval next month, also calls for allowing foreign shoppers to get more duty-free benefits up front when they purchase products instead of getting a refund as they leave the country.""This change aims to reduce the hassle of lining up to get refunds at airports that can enhance the overall shopping experience and attract more visitors,"" Moon said.In line with the government's all-out efforts to create more jobs for young people, more tax benefits will be given to domestic and foreign companies that increase employment, especially among youths.South Korea has been plagued by high youth joblessness as local companies remain reluctant to hire new workers amid a prolonged economic slump.The country's jobless rate for those aged between 15 and 29 reached 10.2 percent at the end of June, up 0.9 percentage point from the previous month, while its overall unemployment rate inched up from 3.8 percent to 3.9 percent.In addition, the revised tax code calls for adopting an individual savings account for all wage earners to support the accumulation of wealth and give more tax breaks to consumers in a bid to spur private consumption.Persistently weak consumer spending has been a major drag on Asia's fourth-largest economy already struggling with slumping exports mainly because of a slowdown in China and other economies.South Korea's exports, one of its major growth engines, came to $46.61 billion in July, down 3.3 percent from a year earlier and marking the seventh consecutive month of decline.Hit by anemic consumption and sagging exports, the South Korean economy grew 0.3 percent in the April-June period from three months earlier, expanding below 1 percent for five quarters running.Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan said the country may enter a period of low growth unless it acts quickly to revitalize the local economy.""Our economy is currently in a difficult situation due to shocks from the MERS outbreak amid a slump in exports,"" he said in a Seoul meeting of a tax review committee.The minister, who doubles as deputy prime minister for economic affairs, also noted the young people were expected to go through an especially difficult time finding jobs from next year when the maximum retirement age of government and private workers is set to be extended by two years to 60.""The proposed tax code revision seeks to revitalize the local economy while giving hope to our future generation by creating new jobs for the youth,"" he said. ""It also seeks to improve conditions for consumer spending while also providing housing stability to low-income families.""The tax code changes, meanwhile, are expected to allow the government to bring in 1.09 trillion won in more tax revenues annually in the coming years.Under the plan, the government will cut tax breaks for vehicles operated by companies, exclude deductions for credit card purchases made by the rich and streamline the country's value-added tax system.The tax code calls for measures to encourage voluntary corporate restructuring by not slapping capital gains and securities transaction taxes on stocks that are swapped in the reorganization process.

Rivalry for Arctic resources has intensified as shrinking polar ice is opening new opportunities for exploration.Russia was the first to submit its claim in 2002, but the U.N. sent it back for lack of evidence. The ministry said that the resubmitted bid contains new arguments. ""Ample scientific data collected in years of Arctic research are used to back the Russian claim,"" it said. In 2007, Moscow staked a symbolic claim to the Arctic seabed by dropping a canister containing the Russian flag on the ocean floor from a submarine at the North Pole.Amid tensions with the West over Ukraine, the Kremlin also has moved to beef up Russian military forces in the Arctic. The effort has included the restoration of a Soviet-era military base on the New Siberian Islands and other military outposts in the Arctic. Russian officials said the facilities are crucial for protecting shipping routes that link Europe with the Pacific region across the Arctic Ocean. Earlier this year, the military conducted sweeping maneuvers in the Arctic that involved 38,000 servicemen, more than 50 surface ships and submarines and 110 aircraft. As part of the drills, the military demonstrated its capability to quickly beef up its forces on the Arctic Novaya Zemlya and Franz Josef Land archipelagos.","bids for vast arctic ,russia the canada denmark ,russia is claiming million ,russia bids for vast ,canada denmark and norway","['MOSCOW', 'AP', 'Russia', 'the United Nations', 'the Foreign Ministry', 'Russia', 'artic', 'Russia', 'U.S.', 'Canada', 'Denmark', 'Norway']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.94108266  0.3528097

Though the U.S. Forces Korea confirmed that none of them had shown signs of infection and the materials were immediately destroyed, the incident triggered rigorous protests by civic groups and public demands for a thorough fact-finding investigation. The allies have set up a hotline and emergency cooperation mechanism since the mishap.Set to kick off its mission by inspecting the Osan lab later this month, the joint working group consists of officials from two countries’ defense, foreign, health, agriculture and food ministries and other related agencies, as well as private legal and microbiology experts. They will also draw up measures to forestall a future relapse.The working group will be chaired by Maj. Gen. Chang Kyung-soo, director-general for policy planning at Seoul’s Defense Ministry, and Maj. Gen. Robert Hedelund, commander of U.S. Marine Corps Forces Korea, and will operate under the Korea-U.S. Status of Forces Agreement Joint Committee, which is separately scheduled to convene Wednesday to discuss the issue. “We’ve decided to create the working group for a more comprehensive and systematic review,” the ministry said in a statement. “This reflects our common understanding that we should dispel public concerns and safeguard the people’s health and safety by meticulously verifying facts and devising steps to prevent similar delivery accidents.” But the announcement is unlikely to quell mounting calls for a revision of the SOFA, which governs the legal status of some 28,500 U.S. troops stationed across South Korea, given the congressional approval and other lengthy and convoluted legal and administrative steps required for its amendment. On Saturday, some 1,000 members of 40 civic organizations gathered in front of the air base, lambasting the U.S. for the anthrax shipment and Seoul for its failure to acknowledge it and properly respond. They demanded the SOFA regulations to be strengthened, citing the current Article 9 of the agreement stipulating that South Korea does not conduct inspections of U.S. military cargo.“South Korea is not a venue for the U.S.’ bacterial experiments,” they chanted, demanding a halt of Washington’s ongoing bioscience project here and a closure of related facilities within the compound. Better known as the JUPITR program, the Joint U.S. Forces Korea Portal and Integrated Threat Recognition has been underway for two years at U.S. military bases in South Korea as part of Washington’s strategy to advance biosurveillance capabilities on the peninsula while rebalancing military assets toward the Asia-Pacific. May’s laboratory biological defense training, which the USFK said took place for the first time, was designed to boost the allies’ peninsula security capacity by testing existing and new systems that could better identify and detect toxins and pathogens in the environment. “A revision of the SOFA itself or its annexes will be challenging chiefly because it will need to pass U.S. Congress and thus take a long time. But the SOFA committee could manage to come up with certain binding agreements such as an agreed recommendation,” a Foreign Ministry official told The Korea Herald on the customary condition of anonymity. Defense Minister Han Min-koo also said at a parliamentary questioning last month that though further details were to be examined, the issue will be better complemented by an agreed recommendation, rather than an adjustment to SOFA, and reinforced information sharing between the two nations’ militaries. During his recent visit to Osan, he reaffirmed Seoul’s commitment to the joint biochemical initiative, saying “As long as North Korea has chemical warfare capabilities and the threats exist, the JUPITR program should continue to be developed to counter them.” South Korea’s intelligence authorities believe that the communist country has long invested in building clandestine germ arsenals involving anthrax and smallpox. Melissa Hanham, a senior fellow at the Washington-based James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, said last week that a bio-pesticides research institute in Pyongyang appears to be capable of churning out “regular, military-sized batches of biological weapons” including anthrax.

Bermudez Jr., chief analytics officer of AllSource Analysis, said in a report carried by the website 38 North of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies that the North's Ponghwa Chemical Factory would not have been running if Beijing had halted crude exports.Bermudez cited satellite imagery showing the refinery operational.""Numerous reports during 2014-2015 have stated that China, North Korea's largest crude oil supplier, did not sell it crude oil during 2014, a development that would force North Korea's single operating oil refinery into caretaker status,"" Bermudez said in the report.""Satellite imagery from 2014 and 2015, however, reveals that the facility has remained operational, though perhaps at somewhat lower levels than in the immediately preceding years, calling into question media reports of an oil cutoff from China,"" he said.  Imagery indicates activity at the factory's rail loading and unloading facility, and construction activity within the factory, such as the building and maintenance of storage tanks and additions to several buildings, provides another indication that the facility remained operational, the expert said.China has long been the main provider of food and fuel aid to the North.But relations between Pyongyang and Beijing significantly soured after Chinese President Xi Jinping took office in late 2012 and the North carried out its third nuclear test a few months later. Xi is the first Chinese leader to visit South Korea before North Korea.Xi has neither visited the North nor met with its young leader, Kim Jong-un, although he held a series of summit meetings with South Korean President Park Geun-hye.The frayed relations between the North and China prompted speculation that China stopped crude supplies to the North. But widespread views are that even though crude exports could have been halted, Beijing has been providing it in aid.Analyst say that China, which considers North Korea as something of a buffer zone, fears that pushing Pyongyang too hard could lead to its collapse, instability on its border and ultimately the emergence of a pro-U.S. nation next door.

Korea's severe drought seen as having eased: SeoulThe Unification Ministry said Friday that a severe drought that hit North Korea appears to have considerably eased since June as rainfall has almost reached last year's level in many areas.   North Korea has been grappling with what it called the worst drought in 100 years, sparking concerns about food shortages. South Korea earlier predicted that the North's crop production could fall by as much as 20 percent if the lack of rain continues into early July.   The ministry said the dry spell seems to have eased in North Korea though several areas in the northeast and midwest provinces are still suffering from the drought.   ""North Korea had suffered from severe drought across the nation until May. But it seemed that since June, the situation has considerably eased,"" Jeong Joon-hee, ministry spokesman, said in a press briefing.   ""But some provinces such as Hwanghae and Hamgyeong provinces are still grappling with prolonged drought, which warrants a close watch,"" he added.   The ministry said that the average precipitation in May reached 54.5 percent of that recorded a year earlier. But in June, the rainfall increased to hit almost 90 percent of the level recorded in the same period last year.   Seoul earlier said that it is willing to provide support for North Korea in coping with the drought if the country makes a formal request. There has been no request from Pyongyang.   ""Currently, the South government is not considering providing food aid to the North,"" said a ministry official, asking not to be named.   Touching on the joint industrial park, the ministry reiterated that pending issues related to Kaesong Industrial Complex should be resolved through dialogue between the two Koreas.   South and North Korea plan to hold talks on the joint operation of the complex next Thursday to discuss a prolonged dispute over the North's unilateral move to raise wages for its 55,000 workers there.   Pyongyang sent a notice to Seoul saying that it will strengthen its monitoring of South Koreans who move in and out of the complex.   The North is known to have expressed complaints over activities by South Koreans including possession of goods banned in the North such as USBs and newspapers, vowing to take punitive actions if found.   ""The issue should be dealt with in accordance with the two sides' agreement and the related regulations. This is not a matter that one side handles unilaterally,"" Jeong added.

The South Korean firm aims to win approval for its merger plan with Cheil Industries Co., the de facto holding firm of Samsung Group, at the shareholders' meeting slated for July 17.The proposed merger must win approval from shareholders with two-thirds of the voting rights and a third of outstanding shares.The construction and trade arm has secured friendly forces with a combined 19.95 percent stake, including the 5.76 percent interest owned by KCC Corp., which it acquired by purchasing treasury shares from Samsung C&T.;But Samsung C&T; must secure 47 percent support to have the plan pass at the meeting, given that the attendance rate will likely stand at 70 percent for the upcoming meeting, according to market watchers.The plan, however, has been challenged by several investors represented by Elliott Associates, which claims that the merger ratio -- 0.35 Cheil share for 1 C&T; share -- is disadvantageous for Samsung C&T; shareholders. Elliott, led by activist billionaire Paul Singer, has a 7.12 percent stake.The plan can be scrapped if the opposition group obtains more than 23 percent of friendly shares. Ilsung Pharmaceutical, a local drugmaker with a 2.11 percent stake, earlier signaled it will vote against the plan.Market analysts are also on Elliott's side. Corporate advisory firm Glass Lewis & Co., Institutional Shareholder Services, and South Korea's Korea Corporate Governance Service also said in respective reports that the merger undermines the interest of Samsung C&T; shareholders.But a local court said in two separate rulings that the proposed merger is reasonable and legitimate, lending voice to Samsung Group, the leading family-controlled conglomerate of South Korea. Elliott is seeking to appeal the two suits, which ask the court to stop the merger and the KCC from exercising its voting rights in the shareholders' meeting.South Korea's National Pension Service, which holds an 11.21 percent stake in Samsung C&T;, has not yet expressed its stance.

The examination is being conducted in all areas where North Korean laborers are working.The remarks came as the North Korean ruling party and government officials are reported to have sought to defect out of fears over possible executions or punishments due to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s so-called reign of terror.South Korea’s state spy agency earlier said that since taking power in late 2011, Kim has had about 70 senior officials executed in an effort to establish himself.

In June, the algal blooms spread in the Hangang River in Seoul as well, and Seoul Metropolitan Government issued an algal bloom warning on June 30 in the downstream section of the river, spanning from Jamsil Bridge to Haengju Bridge. It was the first such warning in 15 years.  A Seoul City vessel carries out water treatment near Seongsan Bridge on the Hangang River in Seoul. (Yonhap)Green algal blooms are considered harmful as they can block water flow and cause odors, affecting the ecosystem. The blue-green algae even contains toxic substances that can cause respiratory problems or paralysis in humans. The algae warning is issued when the cell count of blue-green algae exceeds 5,000 cells per milliliter and over 25 milligrams per milliliter of chlorophyll A. The blue-green algae level around Seongsan Bridge recorded 27,000 cells, officials said. The toxic substance microcystin-LR was already detected in some spots along the Hangang River exceeding the safety threshold level of 1 microgram per liter, they added.  The continuous drought and high temperatures have contributed to the algae occurrence, experts said. “Algal blooms usually proliferate in the summer when the water temperature goes up and there is enough sunshine. This summer, the spread was made easier as the discharge flow from Paldang Dam decreased due to the drought, leaving the water to remain stagnant in the river,” environment engineering professor Choi Suing-il at Korea University told The Korea Herald.  The discharge flow from Paldang Dam last month plummeted by 56 percent compared to last year, Seoul City said.  The government and municipalities have carried out emergency preventive measures to contain the algae while strengthening monitoring. Despite the efforts, the green tide is still expanding. The algae warning alert on the Hangang River in Seoul was extended to Mapo Bridge and Hangang Bridge on Friday. Public concerns are consequently growing over the algae’s impact on drinking water. The Hangang River and Nakdonggang River are the main water sources for nearby residents. Experts, however, stressed that water was safe unless it had been directly exposed to the green tide, the authorities said. “Major water treatment facilities in the country are equipped with advanced water treatment systems. This system carries ozone and granular activated carbon that completely eliminate all pollutants as well as their odors and bad taste,” Choi added. “There will be no impact on our drinking water.”The government, however, warned the public not to carry out recreational water activities such as fishing or water skiing in river sections where alerts had been issued, as direct exposure to the algae can trigger skin irritation.The government anticipates that the upcoming rain will likely relieve the algae spread as a typhoon is expected to hit the peninsula from Tuesday to Thursday.

What the North claims to be the worst drought in 100 years is further raising concerns about food shortages there.  A ministry official said that there has been ""no request from the North for help,"" and no South Korean civilian groups have expressed intent to provide aid to the North.  Iran's news agency IRNA reported that North Korea has contacted Iran's Red Crescent in search of urgent humanitarian aid.  Speaking to reporters on background, the official pointed out that the North is likely to see its crop production fall by up to 20 percent this year if the dry spell continues through early July. More than 30 percent of rice paddies were parched due to the drought, according to the North's Korean Central News Agency.   The North had more rain in June than in May, but the South will continue to closely monitor the situation to gauge its impact on crop production, added the official.  In May, rainfall in North Korea reached 57 percent of that recorded for the same period last year, according to a report by the ministry. But precipitation increased in June as it reached 85 percent of the rainfall a year earlier.

139,139,More big firms adopt ‘peak wage’ system,"Nearly half of South Korea’s major companies and their affiliates have introduced the controversial “peak wage” system that places a wage ceiling on senior employees, the Ministry of Employment and Labor said Wednesday.　According to a poll by the ministry, 177 companies or 47 percent of the 378 surveyed private and state-run affiliates from the nation’s top 30 conglomerates by total assets have implemented the p...","Nearly half of South Korea’s major companies and their affiliates have introduced the controversial “peak wage” system that places a wage ceiling on senior employees, the Ministry of Employment and Labor said Wednesday.According to a poll by the ministry, 177 companies or 47 percent of the 378 surveyed private and state-run affiliates from the nation’s top 30 conglomerates by total assets have implemented the peak wage system, with most of them planning to further broaden it in phases. (Yonhap)Under the peak wage system, companies pay senior employees reduced salaries after the workers “peak” at a certain age, generally between 55 and 60, in return for extending their retirement age by a few years. The peak wage system is in place at 55 percent of the top 15 conglomerates, including Samsung Group, Hyundai Motors, SK Group, LG Group, POSCO, Lotte Group and GS Group, whereas 25 percent of those ranked from No. 16 to No. 30 had adopted the system. Among the companies implementing the system, 37.5 percent of their employees started to receive slashed salaries at age 56, followed by those aged 58 at 29.2 percent, 57 at 16.7 percent and 59 at 12.5 percent. With the system in effect, those who started to receive reduced pay at age 56 saw a 10 percent decrease in their salaries, while those receiving the cut from age 60 saw their salary drop by 40 percent.With the official retirement age set to rise by two years to 60 next year, the government has pushed for expanding the system into the private sector to curb joblessness for the young despite labor unions’ opposition to the scheme. While the unions claimed that the system will only benefit employers by reducing their labor costs, the government decided it will adopt the peak wage system for 316 state-run organizations starting next year. The peak wage system is a part of the government’s extensive campaign for labor market reforms to overhaul what it called the “rigid” labor market to generate more jobs for the young. “There has been progress in companies adopting the peak wage system, but they should pour more efforts into settling it to tackle youth unemployment,” said an official from the ministry. The authorities set out a first batch of reform plans on June 17, which include the expansion of the peak wage system into the private sector by offering subsidies and consulting to firms willing to adopt the system. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","nation top 30 conglomerates ,top 30 conglomerates by ,top 30 conglomerates ,south korea major companies ,30 conglomerates by total","['South Korea ’s', 'the Ministry of Employment and Labor']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.75258988  0.36411411

He also said South Korea has played a leading role in fighting climate change.  He made the comments after the Cabinet approved the country's commitment in the central city of Sejong.  South Korea plans to submit its contribution to the United Nations Climate Change Secretariat in the German city of Bonn via email later in the day, according to officials.  South Korea's contribution calls for reductions of 25.7 percent from the country's business-as-usual level by 2030 and the other 11.3 percent cut comes in the form of purchase of carbon credits to offset emissions.  South Korea said it is pushing to develop technology to reduce greenhouse gases while considering building more nuclear power plants.  The announcement came more than two weeks after U.S. President Barack Obama asked President Park Geun-hye to set an ambitious goal in cutting greenhouse gases, citing efforts for the success of the U.N. Climate Change Conference to be held in Paris in late November.  The conference is meant to produce a legally binding deal to cut the heat-trapping gases that scientists have said are to blame for global warming.

It proposed to invest about 5 trillion won in constructing its new headquarters and other buildings over the next four years. Earlier this month, the auto-making giant proposed building a 115-story headquarters and a 62-story hotel and convention center with the aim of “strengthening the city competitiveness by creating an international exchange complex.” This proposal is in line with the city’s plan to turn the neighborhood into a hub of international “meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions,” or MICE. The company stressed that the new construction would bring a production inducement effect of 262.6 trillion won and create over 1.3 million jobs over the next two decades. It also offered to pay 1.7 trillion won as a public contribution fee if the city changes the legal use of the land site. This accounts for 36.75 percent of the estimated value of the land. In order to carry out the submitted proposal, the official use of the land site needs to be changed from “general residential” to “general commercial.” The Seoul Metropolitan Government and the company will finalize the ratio of the public contribution fee by the end of this year. The carmaker will likely break ground no later than 2017, after all the administrative process is completed, sources said. The construction plan, however, faces hurdles from Gangnam-gu residents. The city government has planned to spend the public contribution fee on developing the neighboring region into the MICE zone. This region includes areas of KEPCO land and Jamsil Sports Complex,The Gangnam-gu Office, however, opposed the city’s move, claiming that the public contribution fee should be used only on the Gangnam-gu district, as it was earned from the KEPCO land.The KEPCO land site is under the Gangnam-gu Office’s authority while Jamsil Sports Complex is under the Songpa-gu Office’s control. Last month, Gangnam-gu Mayor Shin Yeon-hee threatened to file a lawsuit against Seoul City for ignoring the public opinion of the Gangnam residents, if it continued to go ahead with the original plan. Seoul City, however, flatly denied Gangnam-gu’s argument, saying that it will strictly carry out the plan in accordance with the law.

According to the Korea Association of Travel Agents, about 200,000 foreign visitors booked Korean tour packages for July and August, down 82 percent from a year ago. This is expected to cause a loss of over 100 billion won ($90 million) in sales. By nationality, the number of Japanese tourists declined by 84 percent to about 28,000 and Chinese visitors similarly dropped by 84 percent to some 132,000. The number of tourists from European and East Asian countries and the U.S. also fell by around 70 percent. As part of its efforts to overcome the MERS crisis, the union said it would guarantee a MERS insurance program for all incoming foreign visitors. Under the insurance package, they will receive 5 million won in treatment compensation if infected with MERS. The union will also ensure 100 million won in compensation if travelers die within 20 days of being officially diagnosed with the disease. The travel insurance will automatically be effective for those visiting the country from June 22-Sept. 21 without any registration necessary, the KATA said. Regular visitors, such as green card holders, crewmen or those with a working visa will not qualify. Travelers who visited the Middle East will also be excluded, it said. The measure followed an announcement by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism earlier this month that it would release a similar insurance package in a bid to help the ailing tourism industry. Insurance businesses raised doubts over the efficacy of the program that they deemed “superficial,” as developing new insurance packages requires time and accumulated data, such as risk statistics.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","korea travel packages plummeted ,tour package booking plummets ,august down 82 percent ,200 000 foreign visitors ,travel packages plummeted","['Korea', 'the Korea Association of Travel Agents', 'korean']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53938544  0.49934146

Yun rejected this view. Noting the difficulty erasing the “collective memories” of the past, experts say the leaders of the countries should employ a more “active and creative” diplomacy to minimize their conflicts and maximize cooperation in handling shared challenges such as regional security and demographic changes. Park Geun-hye (left) Shinzo Abe (right) (Yonhap)“There are many areas where the two countries can see a convergence of their strategic interests, including North Korea’s military threats, protection of global commons such as maritime transport routes and maintenance of the regional status quo,” said Nam Chang-hee, an international politics professor at Inha University.“They should strive to frequently hold dialogue to better understand each other, find common ground, and expand their cooperation, which will help ease their historical tensions. That is what diplomacy is all about.”With Washington’s push to bring its key allies of South Korea and Japan together in a Cold War-era campaign against the former Soviet Union, the two sides reached a landmark deal to normalize their relations on June 22, 1965 ― after some 14 years of grueling negotiations.The normalization deal was struck amid intense opposition in Korea, where memories of Japan’s colonial atrocities were still potent.A day after the signing of the deal, then-President Park Chung-hee, the late father of the incumbent president, told his nation, “It is wise to grab the hands of even a onetime foe, like Japan, if it is needed to promote the well-being of our people for today and tomorrow.”Though it failed to settle historical issues, the outcome of the deal reflected the delicate balance between the two sides’ interests. On the back of the deal, Korea, then faltering in the aftermath of the 1950-53 Korean War, laid the foundation for its economic rise, while Japan, criticized for its wartime atrocities and aggressions, was given a chance to restore regional trust. “The deal was, at the time, seen as mutually beneficial. From a pragmatic standpoint, Korean officials viewed the deal as a way to facilitate their country’s industrialization to move beyond the ashes of the war,” said Kim Soung-chul, senior fellow at the local think tank Sejong Institute.“Though historical issues were pushed aside and left unresolved (in the process of the negotiations), the deal was a turning point in the checkered history of the bilateral relations.”Under the “Agreement on the Settlement of Problems Concerning Property and Claims, and on Economic Cooperation between Japan and Republic of Korea,” Tokyo pledged to offer to Seoul $300 million in free grants, $200 million in long-term and low-interest loans and $300 million in commercial loans. The financial assistance to Seoul was offered not in the form of reparations for damages from Japan’s brutal colonization of the peninsula, but as “economic cooperation” and the settlement of property claims.The deal, thus, did not include any apology or words of repentance on the part of Japan for the occupation of its territory, despite Korea’s repeated calls during the negotiations. Experts say this has left the deal “incomplete and unfinished,” although they recognize the agreement was an “inevitable compromise” for a poor Korea whose per-capital gross domestic product was merely around $100 a year at the time.“As Korea’s top priority at the time is to pluck its people out of poverty and push for economic development, it needed technological and financial support from Japan ― a reason why historical issues were put on the back burner,” said Kim Ho-sup, diplomacy professor at Chung-Ang University.“Now, the historical issues are things to be complemented to ‘fully normalize’ the bilateral ties ― a tough task, which was left behind for the next governments.”The different interpretations of the normalization pact have also been a source of tension between the two countries. But Seoul claims the agreement did not settle all issues stemming from Japan’s colonial rule, and that it did not deal with violations of individual human rights such as Japan’s wartime sexual enslavement of Korean women.Cooperation eclipsed by conflictsThe considerable progress in the two sides’ cooperation in various areas has been eclipsed by conflicts over Japan’s distortions of history in school textbooks, repeated claims to the Dokdo islets under Korea’s control and its refusal to explicitly apologize for its wartime sexual slavery.But experts say that in terms of bilateral cooperation, the partnership has fared well, and that the two countries should strive to prevent political and historical tensions from damaging cooperative relations.According to recent data from the Korea International Trade Association, the trade volume between Korea and Japan, which was some $220 million in 1965, rose to around $86 billion last year. Japan is now Korea’s third-largest trading partner after China and the U.S. Korea is also the third-largest trading partner for Japan.“Despite political conflicts between the two nations, the quality of their economic cooperation has improved, though the quality of it has somewhat decreased as Korea’s economic exchanges with a rising China have increased,” said Lee Jung-hwan, Japan expert at Kookmin University.“Still, Korean firms participating in the ‘global value chains’ rely much on Japan for securing their component parts and production facilities to manufacture their final products,” he added, referring to international networks to optimize manufacturers’ production processes.Lee pointed out that amid worsening historical feuds, people in both countries seemed to take their economic cooperation for granted “just as they take air and water for granted.”However, historical tensions appear to have negatively influenced bilateral trade to a certain extent. Two-way trade volume, which rose to a record high of $108 billion in 2011, has fallen over the last four years. Over the course of 50 years, people-to-people exchanges have also dramatically risen. The annual number of Korean and Japanese nationals who traveled between the two countries has soared to more than 5 million from merely around 10,000, including around 5,100 Japanese visitors, in 1965. Experts say the increase in people-to-people exchanges is attributable largely to the two sides’ active economic exchanges, open-door policies toward each other and the pan-Asian popularity of Korean pop culture.Relations deadlocked in history trapSince Prime Minister Shinzo Abe began his second term in December 2012, his rhetoric and action, which critics say reveal his “revisionist” view of history, have worsened diplomatic friction with South Korea.From his remarks in April 2013 on the “ill-defined” definition of an invasion to his visit in December that year to the Yasukuni Shrine honoring the country’s war dead, including 14 Class-A war criminals, Abe’s nationalist moves have called into question his political will to mend ties with Korea.Last June, Tokyo carried out a controversial “review” of the 1993 Kono Statement, in which then-Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono apologized to the victims of sexual slavery. After the review, Tokyo suggested the apology was the product of a political compromise between Seoul and Tokyo, challenging its credibility.The Abe government’s decision to send a senior official to the Feb. 22 “Takeshima Day” celebration to assert its sovereignty claim to Dokdo has further exacerbated the relations. The Japanese prefecture of Shimane has observed the day for Takeshima, the Japanese name for Dokdo.Tokyo has also claimed sovereignty to Dokdo in its diplomatic and defense white papers. The bilateral conflict over Dokdo peaked in August 2012 when former President Lee Myung-bak visited the islets. After the visit, Tokyo made a proposal to Seoul to bring their spat over Dokdo to the International Court of Justice. Seoul rejected it, arguing there is “no dispute whatsoever” over Dokdo.Adding fuel to the historical spats is Japan’s bid to put 23 Meiji Industrial Revolution sites, including those related to Koreans’ colonial-era forced labor, on the UNESCO World Heritage list.Seoul has demanded Tokyo exclude seven of the sites, where nearly 57,900 Koreans were forced to work during the colonial era ― from the application, or to clearly present the facts about forced labor when they are designated as heritage sites.Above all, the thorniest historical issue is that of Japan’s wartime sexual enslavement of Korean women, euphemistically called “comfort women.” Seoul has long called on Tokyo to take “legal” responsibility for the victims and officially apologize to them, stressing that the issue is urgent as there are only 50 surviving victims with many having died. Tokyo claims the issue was already settled under a 1965 normalization agreement.Although their differences over history seemed irreconcilable, all the bilateral efforts to address them have not gone down the drain. In 1998, then Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi expressed “deep remorse and a heartfelt apology” to Korea for Japan’s colonial rule in a joint statement issued at the close of his summit with then Korean President Kim Dae-jung.Seoul also secured the 1993 Kono Statement and 1995 Murayama Statement that expressed Tokyo’s apology for its wartime sexual enslavement of Korean women and its colonization of the peninsula, respectively.Future-oriented partnershipExperts say that Seoul and Tokyo should enhance high-level communication to help them better understand each other, remove misunderstandings and restore bilateral trust.Noting that historical issues can hardly be completely resolved, they also said the two sides should find ways to manage them well, and prevent them from escalating and hurting mutually beneficial cooperation in trade, security and other areas.On the part of national leaders, they should not ride the wave of growing nationalism to improve their political positions, the experts added.“Both countries need to focus on the future and their shared democratic values, respect for rule of law, emphasis on free market economics and the many things they share,” T. J. Pempel, political science professor at the University of California, Berkeley.“Both sets of leaders should agree not to talk about ‘the history issue’ for a decade or more.”Nam suggested that Seoul and Tokyo strive to find shared challenges for which they should step up bilateral cooperation. The challenges include their slowing economies, demographic issues stemming from their aging populations, North Korea’s military threats and an ongoing shift in the regional balance of power caused by the rise of China.Some experts also noted the need to increase exchanges among young people of the two countries who are largely free from the influences of the colonial past and can better understand one another through various high-tech tools, including social networking services.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","history shadow eclipses korea ,century ago south korea ,trade volume nearly 400 ,shadow eclipses korea japan ,shadow eclipses korea","['South Korea', 'Japan']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50296825  0.4392063

(Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)Visitors can ski one day and sunbathe the next, watch the dervishes whirl before going clubbing, and stroll through a centuries-old bazaar before visiting a modern shopping center next door. According to Ali Karakus, the director of the Turkish Embassy’s office of culture and information, Korean tourists have been missing out on the full spectrum of travel options in Turkey. “Perhaps due to the tourism agency’s choices, Koreans have visited limited areas in Turkey ― Istanbul, Cappadocia and Pamukkale. This is only 10 percent of what we have to offer,” Karakus told The Korea Herald at the Korea Travel Fair 2015 at Coex in Seoul on June 11. “If visitors spend extra time touring nearby areas of the hotspots, they will experience the full depth of Turkey’s attractions, including outdoor activities, local food, customs and festivals.”The director recommended western Turkey, particularly the southern province of Antalya, known as the Turkish Riviera.  Lake Egirdir in western Turkey. (Turkish Tourism Ministry)Because of its white sandy beaches, aqua-blue coves, ancient ruins and untouched countryside, the region has been a magnet for international tourists and honeymooners. It is the No. 2 destination in Turkey, attracting 11.5 million tourists last year, especially from Germany, Russia, Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Antalya has 197 beaches that qualified for the Blue Flag international award given to safe and clean beaches, marinas and boats. It has many beach resort towns nearby that are lined with luxury hotels, waterfront bars and restaurants and shopping facilities. Turkey is also an emerging destination for golf tourism. The Belek region in Antalya province has 17 golf clubs and 50 five-star hotels along the coastline. Straddling Asia and Europe both physically and psychologically, Turkey combines diverse ingredients and recipes into its cuisine, making it one of the world’s richest gastronomies, the director said. Food and drinks shape people’s experiences of visiting a place, argued Karakus, while pointing out that both Turkish coffee and Korean kimchi were added to the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage list in recent years.“What I observed from Koreans is that they like to share things and foods with others, like Turks (do). Hospitality comes from sharing things,” he said. “Turks have gathered at cafes to drink coffee and smoke shisha since the mid-16th century, which formed our hospitable culture.”Turkey aims to attract 50 million foreign tourists annually by 2023, which marks the 100th anniversary of the founding of the republic. Thirty-seven million international tourists visited Turkey last year. One unique aspect of Turkey is that many cities are “open air museums” that display heritage as part of the cityscape. Many more heritage areas are undiscovered and awaiting archaeological excavation, he stressed. Tourism makes up 10 percent of Turkey’s annual gross domestic product, and is a major source of income for the service industries. “Turkey welcomes you. Our society is in harmony with the government to promote tourism,” Karakus said, adding that any newcomer to the country would be regarded as a full-fledged member of the community in less than 6 months.

The weak Japanese yen also played a role in discouraging bilateral trade between the two neighboring countries.Japan was once the second largest trade partner for South Korea, but based on the latest data, it is now the fifth largest.Some observers noted that the fall might also have been affected by their strained ties over historic and territorial issues. Relations between the two countries have worsened due largely to Japan's refusal to acknowledge and apologize for its past wrongdoings, such as issues regarding former Korean sex slaves, during its colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula from 1910-45.

Amid union objections, Ministry of Employment and Labor announced the first set of measures to overhaul what it called the “rigid” labor market to make it more flexible but stable enough to create “good” jobs for young people and curb employment uncertainty among irregular workers.“As the soaring youth unemployment rate and growing wage gap pose a threat to the resilience of the Korean economy, we have all agreed that labor market reform is necessary,” Minister of Employment and Labor Lee Ki-kwon said at the ministerial meeting.The government has pushed for labor market reforms as part of President Park Geun-hye administrations’ campaign, which she called “a survival strategy,” not a “choice.”The devised reform plans include expansion of the controversial peak wage system into the private sector, the adoption of ability-based salary systems and incentives to encourage large companies to improve working conditions for their subcontractors, which are often small and medium-sized enterprises. The focal point has been the peak wage system, under which companies pay senior employees reduced salaries after the workers reach a certain age, generally between 55 and 60, in return for extending their retirement age by a few years. With the official retirement age set to rise by two years to 60 next year, the government has claimed that the revamp in the overall wage system is key to generating jobs for the young people here. Labor unions, however, saw the plan as a scheme that only benefits employers by reducing their costs. The government has already decided to implement the peak wage system for 316 state-run organizations starting next year, with its plans to set specific goals by August. Under the government’s new plan, the authorities will offer subsidies and consulting to some 30 private companies and 550 factories in six key industries including shipping, finance, medicine, and automobiles when they adopt the peak wage system and abolish seniority-based salary systems. On top of that, the government will encourage conglomerates to boost “coexistence” with their sub-contractors by providing them with tax benefits and subsidies when they try to improve working conditions for their suppliers. In Korea, many of conglomerates have been accused of exploiting their suppliers by forcing them to slash production costs and bring forward delivery dates, which often leads to poor working conditions at the supplier firms. While the jobless rate among people between 15 and 29 stood at 9.3 percent as of May, the small and medium-sized companies have been suffering from a lack of staff mainly due to their worsening working conditions. The government’s plan also includes a measure to change irregular workers’ status into permanent positions, starting from the public sector. The Korea Employer’s Federation welcomed the government’s decision, but expressed concerns over some rules that might result in stiffening the labor market. “We are glad that the government is taking the lead in adopting the peak wage system and expanding the ability-based salary system,” the employers’ organization said in a press release shortly after the government’s announcement. “But guidelines allowing companies to change employment regulations without unions’ approval need to be more specific,” it said. The government’s reform plan, however, sparked a protest from the nation’s two largest labor organizations ― the Federation of Korean Trade Unions and the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions. “It is nonsense (to say) that we have agreed to the government’s plan for labor market overhaul,” the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions said in a press release. “The government is labeling the peak wage system as a key to enhancing a harmony between employees and employers, but it will only end up reducing our salaries,” accusing the government of exploiting inter-generational rivalry. The KCTU also pointed out the government’s approach to improving conditions for sub-contractors is wrong in the first place. “If the government wants to improve conditions for suppliers, it should include a scheme that grants workers at sub-contractors a right to negotiate with their contractors,” the KCTU said. “The government’s plan is no more than a framework to deprive workers of basic rights and help conglomerates at the cost of laborers.”On Wednesday afternoon, the labor union held a rally to protest against the government’s plan at Gwanghwamun Square, with some 1,000 unionized workers in attendance. It declared all-out war against the authorities to stop it from going ahead with the reform plan.Another trade union, the FKTU, also denounced the government for “excessively interfering in the matters that should be discussed between employers and employees.”“Without considering the reality in which workers are forced to retire in their early 50s, the government is pushing to revamp the wage system, which can lead to discrimination by age and forcible early retirement,” the FKTU said in a press release. “The government’s suggestion to ‘improve’ the labor market will only widen the gap between irregular and regular workers, contractors and sub-contractors,” it added. The FKTU also vowed an all-out strike in July and August in opposition to the government’s plan. The trade union opened a ballot on Monday to gauge the support of its members. The government said that it would announce more detailed measures for reform around August and September after discussing sticking points such as the minimum wage and working hours with laborers, management and lawmakers. Earlier in April, the trilateral negotiations to negotiate employment conditions among laborers, employers and lawmakers collapsed, indicating that the government faces a challenge in gaining labor circles’ support.

The ministry said Wednesday it requested the Finance Ministry to set aside 40.14 trillion won ($36.2 billion) for 2016. Nearly 70 percent of the proposed budget, or 27.76 trillion won, is allocated to raise the salary for enlistees, newly provide them with child support and enhance the living environment at barracks. The figure marks a 5 percent annual hike. Under the plan, 200,000 won will be given every month to active-duty soldiers and full-time reservists with children, while the monthly pay for corporals will rise to 178,800 won from the current154,800 won in line with the ministry’s pledge to double the draftees’ salaries by 2017. The incentives for some frontline troops, such as those stationed at guard posts in the Demilitarized Zone and general outposts in its vicinity, are expected to surge to 45,000 won from 16,500 now. As part of efforts to boost its defense readiness against North Korea, the ministry earmarked 12.38 billion won, up 12.4 percent from this year. The funds are to be spent to establish the Kill Chain and the Korea Air and Missile Defense preemptive strike system, which are scheduled to be completed by the early 2020s, develop and upgrade key military equipment and expand investment in defense research. “2016 is the year in which major projects aimed at countering North Korean threats will kick into high gear, such as for the Kill Chain, KAMD and other essential assets,” the ministry said in a statement.

Among the subjects discussed in the forum was how best to reach the world’s 58 million out-of-school children. These are the children most in need: the poorest, the most vulnerable, the exploited and the abused.  Reaching these children – many of whom are currently beyond the reach of programs, research and budgets – is a challenge. And yet, meeting this challenge will be possible only if we approach the issue head-on. Understandably, financing is central to these discussions. Thankfully, Korean organizations are heeding the call to support education for the world’s most marginalized children. On the sidelines of the World Education Forum, the Korean International Cooperation Agency, the government-funded agency dedicated to granting aid to reduce poverty and improving the quality of life in developing countries, signed a three–year agreement with the Education Above All Foundation. Together, our two organizations have pledged to provide a total of $20,000,000 to support the implementation of education projects around the world, with the aim of accelerating the enrollment and retention of out-of-school children in quality primary education. The financial reasons for achieving universal primary education are clear: every dollar invested in primary education generates $10-$15 in economic returns and one-year increase in the average educational attainment of the population in a developing country can increase annual per capita gross domestic product growth from 2 to 2.5 percent. UNESCO estimates that each additional year of schooling raises a country’s GDP growth by 0.37 percent per annum. However, despite all the incontestable evidence, the funding gap to achieve basic education in low-income countries increased from $16 billion to $26 billion per annum in just three years, according to UNESCO. If we are to reverse this trend and lift a generation of children out of poverty, the global community must commit to accelerating funding to primary education. Appropriate funding and programming that address the barriers inhibiting the enrollment of out-of-school children are two of the key cornerstones to universal primary education which require special efforts. One-size-fit-all solutions as well as administrative overlaps of the way that funding for education is spent can be barriers to education provision. For these reasons it is especially important that innovative approaches are found, and non-governmental organizations such as EAA are at the forefront of testing new methods for funding and implementing education programs. If we are to achieve universal primary education, we must not only maximize our available resources in tailored programs, we must coordinate them in such a way that minimizes administrative and implementation overlap. Korea has demonstrated its leadership in promoting access to universal primary education, as demonstrated by hosting the latest World Education Forum. What is now needed is the participation of the private sector to join in this important effort to close the funding gap.  Children around the globe deserve our commitment and dedication to helping provide them with a better world in which to live.  If we can deliver on this commitment of universal primary education – we can get it right for delivering education to people of all ages.

""The ministry will deliver the recommendation to the KHNP.""Built in 1977, the 580-megawatt light water reactor extended its life by 10 years to 2017, but it has faced growing pressure from residents and civic groups over safety concerns in light of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear crisis in Japan.   If the KHNP accepts the government's recommendation, it will be the first time that South Korea permanently closed a nuclear power plant, presenting a difficult challenge of decommissioning.   The latest move comes as residents and civic groups as well as politicians based in Busan have ratcheted up pressure on the government to block the nuclear plant operator's bid for another life extension.  During the meeting also attended by KHNP CEO Cho Seok, proponents of the continued operation stressed the economic benefit of using the existing facility.   Opponents argued that closing the Kori-1, which accounts for a mere 0.5 percent of the nation's total energy production, would not significantly lower the power generation rate and suggested its closure would pave the way for developing the decommissioning technology.   The ministry expected it would take at least 15 years to demolish the reactor, pledging to make legal frameworks and develop decommissioning technology to dispose nuclear wastes and reprocess spent nuclear fuel to prepare for its closure.  ""The government will establish the nuclear industry infrastructure which covers all cycles ranging from construction, operation, demolition and nuclear waste management,"" Chung Yang-ho, a ministry official in charge of energy policy, said. ""The government will proceed with building new nuclear power plants for stable power supply and communicate with residents to develop the nuclear industry in a way that contributes to the local economy.""  There are 23 nuclear reactors producing about a third of the electrical energy for Asia's fourth-largest economy.   While 11 others are or will soon be under construction, the ministry recently announced a long-term energy plan to build two more nuclear power plants to have 36 plants by 2029 as part of efforts to cut carbon emissions.

A report containing the country's voluntary commitments will be submitted to the United Nations before the end of this month.  The government previously said the report will likely be submitted before the end of September as the ongoing U.N. efforts to set up a new international protocol on climate change, known as the Post 2020 Climate Change Mitigation Commitments, require member states to declare their commitments before the end of December.  ""The ongoing international efforts are asking countries to submit their intended nationally determined contributions as soon as possible,"" the ministry said in a press release.  ""Most of the advanced states, including the United States and the European Union, have already submitted their INDCs in March, and so the country decided to submit its own INDC before the end of June as part of efforts to contribute to the international efforts.""  As the level of the country's own mitigation efforts will be set through public debates, the government offered four options to choose from a range from the minimum 14.7 percent to the maximum 31.3 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the country's BAU level by 2030.  Without any measures to cut greenhouse gas emissions or let business run as usual, the country's overall emissions are expected to grow by an annual average of 1.3 percent over the next 15 years to reach 850.6 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (Co2-e) by 2030, according to a joint government report released by the ministry.  The least aggressive option will require the country to cut its overall emissions by 14.7 percent from its BAU level to 726 million tons of Co2-e by 2030. The figure will represent a 5.5 percent growth from its total emissions in 2012.  The most aggressive option of cutting emissions by 31.3 percent will result in the overall emission of 585 million tons of Co2-e by 2030, also marking a 15 percent cut from 2012.  The two other options call for reductions of 19.2 percent and 25.7 percent from the 2030 BAU level, which will translate into a 0-percent and 8.1 percent reduction from the 2012 level, respectively.  The country is allowed to set its own target, but its reduction target may be subject to verification once it is submitted to the United Nations.  It may also become legally binding once the United Nations successfully launches the envisioned international protocol on climate change.

Song Dae-sub, a professor at Korea University’s College of Pharmacy, sees that the country’s dry and moderate weather provided a better living environment for the virus than much hotter and more humid Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries. “In principle, Korea’s weather conditions make it easier for the virus to survive than Saudi’s,” he told a news briefing hosted last week by the Health Ministry. “The virus gets weak if humidity rises. Even in a dry atmosphere, high temperatures and direct sunlight have a negative impact on its survivability.”  A woman wearing a mask, plastic gloves and a raincoat enters Samsung Medical Center, one of the most heavily MERS-affected hospitals, in Ilwon-dong, southern Seoul, Wednesday. (Yonhap)His assessment could boost hopes for hitting the brakes on the continuing spread, as scorching heat followed by the summer rainy season draws near. Yet the government and other experts warned against forging a hasty bond between the epidemic and the weather, saying more evidence is needed. “I think that the climate has only a limited effect, if any, given that MERS has been proliferating only within the hospitals, rather than on a community basis,” said Kim Woo-joo, a Korea University internal medicine specialist and president of the Korean Society of Infectious Diseases. “It will be safer to understand the spread as a result of the MERS patients’ contact with many other people in enclosed areas.” In line with Kim’s remarks, the hospital environment and culture associated with patient visits have also been pointed to as further crucial contributors. At major Seoul hospitals such as the Samsung Medical Center, which became the biggest source of MERS patients, patients race to make appointments with what they believe to be the best doctors in Korea, often having to wait for months until they receive surgery or other treatments. The institutions’ crammed wards also make it easier for close contact between patients and their caretakers to occur, which is then accelerated by the culture where family members together visit their sick relatives. Margaret Chan, director general of the World Health Organization, and Peter Ben Embarek, chief of the agency’s MERS team in Geneva, have also picked Korea’s culture of family members caring for their loved ones at home and in hospitals as one of the driving forces behind the outbreak. “The country’s unique culture could indeed be one of the factors, including patients awaiting at emergency rooms before formally transferring to a ward, group patient visits and multi-bed rooms at hospitals,” Song added.

In that case, North Korea is believed to be focusing on producing maize as an alternative to rice.  ""This year, the supply of fertilizer is not smooth, compared with last year,"" said the official, asking not to be named.  The North has relied on international handouts since 1995 to help feed its people in the face of chronic food shortages.  A U.N. report showed that about 70 percent of North Korea's 24.6 million people suffer from food shortages and 1.8 million, including children and pregnant women, are in need of nutrition.  Last year, the North suffered from a severe drought in the spring, but managed to produce crops at a level similar to that of 2013 due mainly to the use of preserved water.  The official said that the North's agricultural reforms might have helped it maintain the food production last year, but this year's situation may bode ill, given that fertilizer availability is worse.  In 2012, the North announced the so-called ""6.28 measures"" that centered on allowing farmers to keep 30 percent of their production quota plus any excess over the quota. Last year, it unveiled a new set of reforms that call for raising the farmers' portion to 60 percent.

""But North Korea is not expected to close down the zone just because of the wage issue.""The joint industrial complex, which opened in 2004, is the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation. It has served as a major revenue source for the cash-strapped communist North, while South Korea has utilized cheap but skilled North Korean laborers.The operation of the complex has been highly affected by inter-Korean relations. The Seoul-Pyongyang ties have been strained since 2010, when the South imposed sanctions banning economic and cultural exchanges following the North's torpedoing of a South Korean warship and its shelling of a border island.In April 2013, the North unilaterally shut down the industrial park for about four months, raising concerns about the viability of the factory zone. Four months later, the two Koreas decided to set up a joint committee in charge of running the industrial park.Seoul has rejected Pyongyang's unilateral wage hike, saying it is in breach of a 2004 agreement that calls for the two sides to set wages through consultations. The wage hike cap has been set at 5 percent per year.Touching on the talks on a wage cap, Jeong claimed that the South needs to show ""flexibility"" over the issue although the matter should be resolved through consultations by the two sides.When it comes to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Jeong said North Korea has ""grave"" concerns about the disease.Concerns about the spread of the MERS virus are growing in the South as it has killed six South Koreans so far, while the number of those infected has increased to 87.The communist country has been highly sensitive to the outbreak of contagious diseases due to its weak health care system. Last year, Pyongyang imposed an entry ban on foreign tourists for about five months due to concerns over the deadly Ebola virus.""It is certain that the North has grave fears about the newly-found infectious disease,"" Jeong said, adding that North Korea had asked the South Korean firms at the zone to unveil measures to counter the Ebola virus last year.""But there have been no requests from the North over MERS except for its recent demand for the supply of thermal scanners and masks,"" he added.At the request of the North, South Korea on Monday installed three thermal scanners for those who move in and out of the complex to prevent the spread of the virus in the reclusive country.The communist country still bristled at any criticism of its medical system, saying the South could not even contain the spread of MERS.""Recently in the South, a respiratory infectious disease has been spreading rapidly and pushing people into extreme anxiety and fear,"" said a report carried by the Rodong Sinmun, the mouthpiece of the North's ruling Workers' Party. ""Who are they slandering in such a situation?""The paper also criticized South Korea's National Assembly speaker, Chung Ui-hwa, who cited the North's poor health care in proposing a bill for cross-border exchanges in health and medicine.

May also marked the sixth consecutive month of increase below the 1 percent mark.  Several provincial government and municipalities said they plan to raise water and sewerage processing rates in the coming weeks and months.   Fares for public buses operated in Gyeonggi Province surrounding Seoul will go up 150 won later this month, with the port city of Incheon, west of Seoul, set to decide whether to mark up both bus and subway fares within the week.  Busan, the country's second-largest city, said it plans to raise fees for public funeral homes, crematoriums, exhibition halls and civic centers.  Besides public utility and transportation charges, there has been a gradual rise in fuel prices. The rise in gasoline and diesel fuel comes as prices for crude oil have started to move up after falling sharply last year.  Weak crude prices have been cited as the leading cause of low inflation in recent months.  According to state-run Korea National Oil Corp., the average price for gasoline has risen for six straight weeks and stood at 1,574.4 won per liter last week, up 66.6 won from the last week of April. Data by Statistics Korea also showed prices for farm and fisheries goods rose 2.7 percent on-year in May. Numbers showed rent-related prices rising a relatively high 2.4 percent vis-a-vis the year before last month.  Prices for medical services also increased last month with prices at neighborhood clinics and drug stores rising 3 percent.  ""With household earnings at a standstill, any rise in the prices of basic necessities can have an adverse effect on private consumption,"" a researcher at Hyundai Research Institute said.  The finance ministry, meanwhile, said that it is keeping close tabs on market prices and will take steps to correct any unnecessary or unfair adjustments that can hurt consumers.

Rosario, who chaired the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation senior officials’ meeting prior to coming to Korea, said she observed inquiry and interest from Korean conglomerates and medium-sized companies.  Philippine Ambassador Raul S. Hernandez (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)“The relations between the Philippines and Korea have always been close, as we were brothers in arms against communism since the early 1950s. I grew up around Koreans at American military bases in the Philippines,” Rosario said in a speech. “The Jangchung Gymnasium in central Seoul, which was recently renovated, was built by Filipino workers until 1963. In a happy turnaround of events, many Korean construction companies are undertaking infrastructure projects in the Philippines.”The Philippine department of public works will allow Korean companies to register on equal terms as local companies, she noted, while pointing out to the soon-to-be-integrated ASEAN market by the end of this year. The deputy undersecretary also praised Korea’s cultural diplomacy in the Philippines, which has been so successful that her parliamentarian colleague is learning Korean language and history through soap operas. “The Filipinos are called the people of the diaspora, as we are scattered all over the world. Our families abroad have brought home elements of their local cultures, enriching our own,” she explained. “Multiracial marriages, including between Filipinos and Koreans, have strengthened our ties.”Korean company executives benefit from the country’s new legislation in July last year, which allows full entry of foreign banks into the country, Rosario underscored.

Hernandez said that Korea is well placed to take advantage of the strategic location and burgeoning market of the Philippines, with 120 flights between the two countries every week. As more than 90 percent of Filipinos are Christian and English is an official language, Koreans easily adjust to life on the island, he said. The Philippine economy grew by 7.2 percent in the first quarter of this year, one of the fastest rates in Southeast Asia. It has registered positive growth for 65 consecutive quarters since 1999.The ambassador highlighted investment opportunities in Central Luzon, which is a “growth corridor” north of the capital Manila. “Manila is fast becoming a competitive mega-city due to its size, young population and productivity,” the ambassador said. “Our government has taken steps to root out corruption and establish good governance. Doing business in the Philippines has become easier, faster, more profitable and sustainable, with improved infrastructures.”Foreign investors can enter priority areas of manufacturing, airport and industrial park development, aviation, tourism, leisure, information communication technology, agricultural and agro-industrial sectors, he added. Kim Young-sun, the newly appointed secretary-general of the ASEAN-Korea Center and former Korean Ambassador to Indonesia, said Korean companies can reap benefits of the Southeast Asian market through local production.“The Philippines have emerged as an attractive destination with investment incentives and skilled labor,” he said, while highlighting the leadership of Philippine President Benigno Aquino III that has helped national stability and market dynamism.By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","investing in philippines opens ,investing in philippines ,philippines will lay bridgehead ,investing in the philippines ,product of trillion diplomats","['Philippines', 'ASEAN', 'the Philippine Embassy', 'Seoul', 'ASEAN', 'Philippines', 'Laura del Rosario']",2,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.4118647   0.21078193

Last week, the government identified St. Mary’s Hospital in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, as a MERS-affected hospital after 37 cases of MERS had originated from the facility.“We are revealing the names of hospitals to show that the government is accurately keeping track of confirmed patients. We will continue to disclose hospital names to actively find infected individuals within the hospital and prevent spreading of the disease,” said acting Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan in an emergency briefing at Seoul Government Complex.Choi explained that the government had refrained from revealing the information out of fear that it may spark nationwide panic and create a vacuum in medical treatment in hospitals involved. But the authorities, including President Park Geun-hye, have decided that the benefits of disclosing information outweigh the possible side effects, he added.“(The announcement) represents a shift in the government’s strategy, to pour all of our efforts to end the MERS situation in its early stages,” Choi said. He added, however, that the government is not considering an extra budget, but would spend funds reserved for national emergencies.The government will also step up monitoring system of potential patients, which will include a cellphone tracking system.Choi said the government is not considering upgrading the alert level for MERS from its current “caution” status. He reiterated the infection was still being contained to hospitals and had not yet spread to the general public.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","largest hospitals in seoul ,the five largest hospitals ,patients have visited samsung ,five largest hospitals in ,five largest hospitals","['South Korea', 'Samsung Medical Center', 'Seoul Asan Hospital', 'Seoul']",2,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.55656147  0.40026283

(Yonhap)Chung’s political prospects peaked in 2002 as head of the Korea Football Association, when the South Korean team had its dream run to the semifinals in the 2002 World Cup, its best result in the event’s history.Chung announced his bid for the South Korean presidency in September that year, before withdrawing it in favor of Roh Moo-hyun, who would go on to win the race in December 2002. His political name, however, remained valued among South Korean pollsters who consistently floated his name as a possible conservative candidate in the next presidential run.In 2014, Chung ran for Seoul mayor, a post often viewed as a stepping stone to the presidency here. But his defeat to Park, who took 56.1 percent of the votes, dealt a political blow that he has failed to recover from so far, analysts said.“Chung is different from other lawmakers. He’s not your typical politician,” said Yoon Sung-yi, professor at Kyung Hee University.“He’s at the level where he should be seeking maybe a presidential bid. But things aren’t looking hopeful right now. He’s not in the conservative party’s decision-making bodies. He’s not even in the legislature anymore.”Chung Jin-min, professor of politics at Myongji University, agreed.“I don’t think a person of Chung’s status will score high in any future presidential race as of now,” he said, referring to his family background. The billionaire is the son of Hyundai Motors founder Chung Ju-yung. He is also the de facto owner of major conglomerate Hyundai Heavy Industries Group.“The people here can’t relate to him. He comes from a wealthy background that not many know about.”“I’m sure Chung will be able to win if he runs in Ulsan as a lawmaker in the 2016 parliamentary elections,” he added. “But I don’t think too highly of his chances in a presidential race.”Chung, 63, is a respected figure among sports officials here. Chung served as the KFA’s chief from 1993 to 2009 and played a role in bringing the World Cup to South Korea in 2002. Chung is an honorary chair of the KFA.The politician also holds a doctorate degree in international politics from Johns Hopkins University, and did his undergraduate studies at Seoul National University.

Pyongyang has unilaterally demanded a hike in the monthly minimum wage from $70.35 to $74.The Seoul government sent warning letters to 18 of the 49 firms, into which the authorities have completed their investigation. Other firms that paid higher wages are also to receive warning letters as soon as the government finishes their probe into them.Amid bilateral talks, Seoul has asked the South Korean firms not to offer higher wages to their workers as the North demands.The firms were forced to give the higher minimum wages to their workers who refused to work or threatened to slow down their production activities.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","wages to north korean ,korean workers despite government ,18 south korean firms ,higher wages to north ,north korean workers","['Seoul', 'south korean', 'inter - korean', 'north korean', 'Gaeseong', 'north korean', 'inter - korean']",2,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.7108236   0.17249419

The wage hike cap has been set at 5 percent per year.The ministry immediately told the heads of the 124 South Korean firms there not to follow the communist neighbor's unilateral move. But 49 of them were found to have paid increased March wages to their North Korean employees, apparently succumbing to the North's threats. Seoul first gave stern warnings to 18 firms and is now looking into the remaining violators.""The government's probe into their motives is underway. We will take actions against companies that have not followed the government's guidance,"" the spokesman said at a press briefing.In what could be a temporary relief, North Korea accepted South Korea's tentative offer in late May to pay wages at the current level, allowing the two sides to buy time for talks.An official at the ministry said that the government plans to propose talks in the coming days, as the 10-day period of the wage payment for May will begin next Wednesday.The wage row came as inter-Korean relations have been long strained since the North's torpedo attack on a South Korean warship and the shelling of a border island off the west coast in 2010.The joint industrial park, which opened in 2004, is the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation following a landmark inter-Korean summit in 2000. It has served as a revenue source for the communist country while South Korea has utilized cheap but skilled North Korean labor.Meanwhile, Lim said that North Korea has not beefed up its control over movements at the industrial park due to concerns over the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome that has killed two South Koreans so far.On Wednesday, South Korea confirmed five additional cases of the respiratory disease, raising the total number of those infected with the virus to 30.

This is significantly higher than the 3.9 percent rate for the entire country.""To reduce any fallout, the government is striving to introduce wage peak systems and use the money saved to encourage businesses to hire new people,"" the finance minister said. ""Hiring young people is critical for sustainable growth.""Choi said the government's master plan aims to focus on microeconomic details so it can have a direct bearing on the market.Without going into details, he said that in the short run, every effort will be made to increase hiring where more people are needed. He said measures will be taken to help qualified people find work abroad, and emphasized that government agencies will re-examine all job programs to enhance their efficiency.""The government, moreover, will actively incorporate policy measures that can help create jobs for young people in the 2016 budget,"" the official who doubles as deputy prime minister in charge of economic policy pledged.Choi then said that while the government will do its part, schools must revamp their curricula so students get the kind of education that is needed by society.He stressed that education must become ""demand oriented"" instead of being fueled by established programs that are unable to keep up with the changing times.

The Supreme Court, upholding two previous courts' decisions, ruled in 2012 that the tax agency's levying of the 100 billion transfer income tax is against local tax law and ordered the refund. Challenging the ruling, the tax authorities then levied nearly 100 billion in corporate tax, which again prompted Lone Star to file a lawsuit to cancel the tax.Lone Star claimed that it should be exempted from paying the tax because it was based in Belgium, with which South Korea has a double-taxation avoidance deal.

Of them, only 276 are inhabited. One among them is Jangbyeongdo Island, which is about two hours away from its closest port of Mokpo. There are currently 91 people residents, 26 of them aged 65 or older. Most of them make a living by digging for octopus in the mudflats and seaweed farming.Jangbyeongdo, only about 1.63 square kilometers in size, is also one of the 138 islands of South Jeolla region that have no medical facilities, pharmacies or resident health care workers. For them, seeing a doctor means having to travel to Mokpo, or wait for the “floating hospital” ― a state-run ship that functions as a medical facility ― that visits about five times a year. The island doesn’t even have berths for ships to anchor. When the ship arrives near the island, patients take turns to board a small boat that takes them to the floating vessel in the ocean.The Hospital Ship Jeonnam 512, one of the five hospital ships run by the government that is based in Mokpo, offers dental care, general medicine services and traditional Korean medicine. The ship also houses a little pharmacy and a room for X-ray screenings and simple medical tests. There is one general physician, one dentist, and one traditional Korean medicine doctor. All treatments and prescribed drugs are free.Patients from Jangbyeongdo Island, one of 138 remote Korean islands that do not have any medical facilities, arrive on a state-run hospital ship by boat on May 20. (The Ministry of Health and Welfare)On May 20, some 40 residents of the island ― almost half its entire population ― were on board, waiting for their turn to see the doctors. One of them was Jeong Oh-rae, a 77-year-old diabetic patient. Her doctor, Lee Kyung-ho, seemed concerned about her blood sugar level.It was over 300 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), an extremely high rate considering the normal level is 150 mg/dL. She was experiencing blurry vision, which is one of the typical symptoms of high blood sugar.“You need to take more insulin. I’ll prescribe it for you,” Lee told Jeong. “I can’t see you often enough to check on you regularly. Take the prescribed insulin, and make sure you tell your doctor in Mokpo about your blood sugar level the next time you see him.”Dr. Lee, 31, joined the team of Jeonnam 512 in April, as part of his public medical service that substitutes for his mandatory military duty. Having spent most of his life in Seoul, Lee said he wanted to gain experience in medically underserved communities.“This is a rare opportunity for any doctor,” he told The Korea Herald. “There are only five state-run hospital ships in the country, and each carries only one general physician. It’s meaningful to be somewhere totally different from where I was trained as a doctor and give back what I learned.”For patient Jeong, the floating hospital visits are something she does not want to miss. “I get everything here, including eye drops and pain relief patches,” she said. “They make me feel safe until the ship’s next visit.”The ship’s 15 staff, including three doctors, two nurses and two medical technicians, are onboard more than 180 days a year. South Jeolla Province runs two hospital vessels, including Jeonnam 512, as the region has the highest number of medically underserved islands. Each of the two ships visit about 150 islands annually.A patient from Jangbyeongdo Island, one of 138 remote Korean islands that do not have any medical facilities, talks to a doctor on a state-run hospital ship that visits her island about five times a year. (The Ministry of Health and Welfare)Being on the ship isn’t always easy and sometimes poses unique challenges. For traditional Korean medicine doctor Kim Jin-hoo, the challenge is to practice acupuncture when the ship is pitching on the waves. Since a large number of residents of remote islands are the elderly, acupuncture treatments are especially popular among the patients who suffer from chronic back or nerve pain. And sometimes, the treatment is a little too popular.“I’m getting used to the pitching now, but practicing acupuncture on a floating ship is still a challenge,” the 26-year-old doctor said. “One of the other challenges is that many of the patients don’t want to leave the treatment room mostly because they want to talk more about their condition. But I have to ask them to leave because other patients are waiting in line. Things aren’t as efficient as hospitals in cities, but I don’t always mind because it lets me learn more about the patients at the same time.”Sometimes motion sickness is hard to handle, even for health care professionals. “I just have to lie down sometimes,” said Park Jung-sun, a nurse. “Some days we are lucky, and some days we are not. It really depends on the weather.”The South Jeolla Province spends about 2.9 billion won ($2.6 million) annually to run the two hospital ships. The central government supports 800 million won every year. “The biggest burden is the fuel oil, which costs 1.2 billion won a year,” said Kang Young-koo from the provincial government. “We would appreciate more support from the central government.”To improve medical services in remote regions in the country, the Health Ministry plans to introduce telemedicine, the use of information technology through devices such as smartphones in order to provide clinical health care at a distance. The move has been fiercely opposed by the nation’s largest group of physicians, who claim that it would lower the quality of medical services and jeopardize the operations of small local clinics and regional hospitals.However, Dr. Ryu Jae-kwang, director of Mokpo Hankook Hospital who receives patients from remote islands across South Jeolla, said telemedicine is very much needed in his region, especially during medical emergencies which often require air ambulance services. The Korean government currently only operates four air ambulances, much fewer than other countries such as Japan, which runs 46.“Telemedicine isn’t just between doctors and patients. It is needed between medical staff,” Ryu said. “In emergency situations where the patient is in a critical condition, it is important to make the right diagnosis as soon as possible. Telemedicine between experienced doctors and emergency staff decreases the chances of misdiagnosis and lets the patient receive the best possible care even when he or she is being sent to the right medical facility. “South Korea has the best Wi-Fi system in the world,” he continued. “It makes no sense that telemedicine isn’t already happening.” By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","965 islands 62 percent ,patients mokpo south jeolla ,91 people residents 26 ,home to 965 islands ,korean peninsula south jeolla","['MOKPO', 'South Jeolla Province', 'korean', 'South Jeolla Province', 'Mokpo']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.2834644   0.47866115

At least six other people are missing in floods that have ravaged mountain districts of six provinces and autonomous regions in central and southeastern China. More than a quarter-million people have been moved to temporary shelters, and major damage has been inflicted on buildings and crops.Apart from the two schoolchildren, 42 others have died due to floods and heavy rains, including 16 in the collapse of a nine-story building in the city of Guiyang following a landslide. Eight other people were killed in the central province of Hunan when a bus skidded into a guardrail and overturned.The Guangxi regional government said 21 other kindergarten students were sent to the hospital in the school bus accident on Friday, with three listed in serious condition. The bus was licensed to carry 11 people, but had a total of 26 on board. The driver, teachers and school administrators have been taken into custody, the government said. Overloaded buses have been involved in accidents killing scores of children in recent years as local schools are closed and consolidated into larger campuses farther away from the children's village homes.Seasonal rains cause major flooding around China almost every year. The worst in recent history was in 1998, when 4,150 people died, most of them along the Yangtze River.The massive Three Gorges Dam has largely contained Yangtze flooding, but the problem persists in other parts of the country.","china floods including kids ,dead in china floods ,52 dead in china ,latest round of flooding ,in china floods including","['AP', 'China', 'China']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57135326  0.17337121

The program, launched in 2004, is available to people with a stable source of income and less than 1 billion won (US$917,000) in debt.Court data, however, showed that while there were less people applying for rehabilitation, the total number of people requesting help from the Credit Counseling and Recovery Service remained relatively unchanged. Besides the personal bailout program, the service processes personal bankruptcy, individual workouts and so-called free workout applications in order to support people with debt problems.    There were some 62,601 people that asked for all forms of assistance in the first three months of this year, down just 0.6 percent on-year from 62,949.

Georg Kell, the founder and CEO of the world’s largest corporate sustainability organization, stressed that businesses are increasingly forced to demonstrate corporate social responsibility by embracing UNGC principles: human rights, labor, environment and opposition to corruption. Kell participated in the UNGC Korea Leaders Summit 2015 in Seoul on Tuesday, along with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Columbia University professor Jeffrey Sachs and former Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, among others.  Georg Kell (left), the executive director of United Nations Global Compact, speaks to graduate students of Sogang Business School on Monday. Also shown are UNGC’s head of strategic planning Donna Chung (center) and Sogang University professor Kim Yang-min. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)The UNGC is an international policy initiative to promote responsible commerce, finance and innovation. It has more than 12,000 corporate participants from over 145 countries. “There’s a silent revolution happening in the world. More and more business leaders realize that financial success depends on environmental stewardship and social responsibility,” Kell told graduate students of Sogang Business School, a UNGC participant since 2013.“Business is no longer a resource extractor, but a stakeholder in society. It wants to be part of the future growth and make long-term investment.” Kell said business nowadays has an incentive to invest in vocational training, fight corruption and improve the environment. In today’s transparent world, “it makes sense to disclose rather than hide.”One fundamental trend since the late 1990s has been the globalization of commerce and localization of government. With unregulated markets leading to environmental degradation and social deprivation, popular protests erupted globally to protect diminishing common goods. Foreign direct investment has also changed dramatically, from accessing cheap resources for reprocessing and remanufacturing, to supporting local development. “The ‘global compact’ was born out of these circumstances, as citizens understood power and responsibility cannot be separated,” said the executive director. “Increased transparency has put a premium on disclosure, because not doing so can increase the risk of a financial disaster.”Kell mentioned the German engineering company Siemens, which overhauled its corporate culture following a string of high-profile scandals in 2008 that cost $1.6 billion in legal settlements with U.S. and European authorities. The company now sees sustainability as its core growth strategy. The sweatshop campaign by American colleges in 2000 contributed to human rights and labor improvement, by protecting freedom of association and collective bargaining, while eliminating forced and child labor, he added. “A growing number of companies are realizing that their green portfolio is growing faster than their carbon-intense portfolio, and supporting carbon pricing,” Kell said. “Smart CEOs are stepping forward and saying, ‘We want to break with our old practice of blocking climate action, to tell governments to tax externalities on business.’”Companies that are willing to “internalize” the negative externalities created by their operation will become the industry leaders, claimed Kell. Many companies that were the target of sustainability have now become exemplary models.The finance industry, which tends to pursue short-term profits, is finally coming to grips with the global trend. Ban Ki-moon has promoted responsible investment since 2005, leading to 1,300 asset owners around the world to incorporate nonfinancial issues into investment decisions. “I am confident that commerce connects humanity. Commerce allows technology and solutions to travel fast and wide,” Kell said. “But to channel it in a sustainable way requires a fundamental rethink. We need to internalize spillovers, put a high price tag on carbon emissions, create a circular economy, and reconsider our values and lifestyles.” Kell stressed the importance of accountable leadership, saying, “Business leaders have to be statesmen. They need to understand the interconnection of politics, development and environment.”Answering Sogang University professor Kim Yang-min’s question on finding a job and building a career for the students, Kell gave advice based on his 30-year experience at the U.N. “The most difficult thing in life is finding out what exactly you want,” he pointed out. “Career success does not come from aiming for this organization or company over another, but finding out what exactly it is that you really want to do, then zooming in on it and giving all you got.” Noting that lifetime employment is diminishing in a post-industrial job market, Kell encouraged students to continually reinvent themselves and make learning their lifelong friend.

Without education, there can’t be development,” said South Sudan’s Education Minister John Gai Nyuot Yoh.  John Gai Nyuot Yoh. (Yoon Min-sik/The Korea Herald)In order to achieve this, he said the country would take inspiration from South Korea, a country that transformed itself from one of poorest countries in the world to one of leading economies in Asia in a matter of decadesYoh said South Korea could be the country’s “role model” as it seeks to evaluate and improve the curriculum. “There are two ways to acquire human resources. Either bring in people from outside, or adjust your education to start building such resources,” he said, emphasizing the necessity of education.Unlike Korea, the country has resources. But Yoh said South Sudan needed to teach its future generations the importance of education and not rely on resources, because resources can be used for the country’s benefit at any time. Education, on the other hand, needs to be developed over time. The minister said his preliminary plans covered a time scale of at least 10 to 15 years.“Our biggest goal is to provide quality education that is accessible. As of now, we have a literacy rate of 23 percent. We want to raise it to 60 percent,” he said.South Korea can provide more than just an example. During the World Education Forum 2015, Yoh and South Korean Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea discussed assistance in technical and vocational education, supplying equipment and ICT technology in secondary education.“We have been discussing how we can make use of the Korean curriculum as a basis for enhancing and developing our education,” he said.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","sudan to benchmark korean ,to benchmark korean education ,benchmark korean education ,korean education ,south sudan education minister","['South Sudan', 'South Sudan ’s', 'John Gai Nyu']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3807503   1.09304905

At times, the South's Coast Guard boats accidentally cross the border while chasing Chinese ships.  ""We expressed deep concern about the issue and called on (the Chinese government) to craft strong and effective measures,"" a Foreign Ministry said, briefing the results of twice-a-year bilateral talks on the matter.   The latest round of consultations, represented by deputy director-generals, was held in South Korea's southern port city of Busan.  South Korea demanded China crack down on those fishing ships heading toward the inter-Korean maritime border and warned that unregistered ships will be confiscated if caught, the spokesman said, adding China has pledged to make more efforts to address the issue.  The sides will hold the next round of talks in China in the latter half of this year.

Meanwhile, only 6.1 percent of households that belong to the wealthiest 25 percent did the same. Also, 7.5 percent of the poorest households could not receive necessary medical treatment for financial reasons, while only 0.6 percent of those who belong to the wealthiest 25 percent experienced such difficulties in 2012.The healthy life expectancies ― average number of years that a person can expect to live in “full health” ― of Koreans aged 30 also varied according to their education levels. The rate among those who received higher education was 76.6, compared to 65.8 for those who never finished high school.The study also showed that the poor had less access to cancer screenings. While 80.5 percent of the poorest 25 percent of Korean women received cervical cancer screening in 2012, 90.1 percent of the wealthiest 25 percent had their checkup.Also, only 57.2 percent of Koreans who belong to the poorest 25 percent received colorectal cancer screening in the same year, while 67 percent of the wealthiest group received the examination.The World Health Organization states that social factors including education, employment status, income level, gender and ethnicity have an influence on one’s physical and mental health. The lower a person’s socioeconomic position, the higher their risk of poor health, it says.Kim Dong-jin, who organized the research at KIHASA, said the government should make efforts to combat health inequalities, which he thinks have been deepening in the last few years. “Central and municipal governments should make joint efforts to monitor the situation consistently and archive the information,” he said. “There should be more policies and welfare programs to tackle this issue.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","inequalities deepen in korea ,car accidents and cancer ,higher mortality rate than ,koreans who never attended ,accidents and cancer","['South Koreans', 'the Korea Institute for the Health and Social Affairs']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54987299  0.0242893

The government’s goal is to increase the index to 77 points by 2019.Some of the major reasons behind the statistics include lack of leisure time and hobbies, as well as stress over academic obligations. Korean children were found to be the unhappiest among OECD countries in previous years as well, with 64.3 points in 2009, 65.1 in 2010 and 69.29 in 2012.The ministry plans to tackle the problem by announcing a special charter on “children’s right to play” in the near future, partly inspired by what is already stated in the proclamation in the 1959 Declaration of the Rights of the Child by the United Nations General Assembly. The 1959 declaration reads: “State Parties recognize the right of the child to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities appropriate to the age of the child and to participate freely in cultural life and the arts.” The ministry hasn’t decided when to unveil the charter, which is currently being established. Korea ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1991, which stipulates that all children have the right to play and rest, but it is the first time the government is making an effort to ensure that Korean children enjoy that right.“The government policies on children have been mostly focused on their education and development, not their happiness or leisure time,” said Koo Mi-jeong from the Welfare Ministry.“The newly established charter will be more detailed than what is stated in the U.N. convention, and will try to meet the unique or specific needs of Korean schoolchildren. Once the charter is announced, four ministries ― the ministries of education, gender equality, culture and welfare ― will work together to come up with leisure programs for schoolchildren.”The government is to also decrease the number of children who have no hobbies to 32 percent from the current 54.8 percent, as well as the number of child victims of physical abuse to 280,000 from the current 294,188 by 2019. It also hopes to decrease the number of child victims of sexual violence to 25,000 from the current 26,962, and increase the happiness index of children in poverty to 54 points from the current 46.1 by the same year.

It plans to submit its greenhouse gas emission target to the United Nations soon ahead of the launch of a new climate regime after 2020.""Since the government's emission target is in effect impossible to achieve, it needs to be re-calculated,"" the Federation of Korean Industries said in a press release. The FKI, which represents the nation's family-controlled conglomerates, added that it could hurt Korea's trustworthiness in the world if it sets its reduction target for 2020 based on the short-term objective.According to the lobby group, South Korea emitted 14 million tons more than its annual prediction in 2010. In 2011 and 2012, the greenhouse gas emission surpassed annual forecasts by 31 million tons and 20 million tons, respectively.The FKI also pointed out the government move in January last year to lower the ratio of nuclear power plant facilities and the decision to delay a supply plan for renewable energy, saying that they would make it harder to reduce the overall greenhouse gas emission.Emphasizing that other major countries are pushing to ease their emission targets based on their own economic conditions, the FKI called on the Seoul government to propose a more attainable emission objective.""The reason why a debate is under way for a new climate regime after the Kyoto Protocol fell apart is because countries proposed hard-to-achieve reduction targets,"" an FKI official said.

According to Seoul Metropolitan Government, the self-reliance rate of 25 districts on average plummeted to 31.5 percent this year, reaching the lowest mark since the city started to draft and execute its own budget under an elected mayor in 1995.The self-reliance rate, which is the ratio of district offices’ own revenue sources such as local taxes to overall revenue, indicates the level of fiscal strength of the districts. Since 1995, the overall financial independence has remained over 50 percent but the number started to plummet from 2010. Last year, the average rate dropped to 33.6 percent, the authorities said. The self-reliance level differed by regions. While Gangnam-gu and Seocho-gu in the affluent southern region and Jung-gu in central Seoul remained above 50 percent, most northern residential districts such as Nowon-gu and Dobong-gu recorded less than 20 percent, the city said. The growing burden of public child care services and the basic pension scheme for the elderly have affected financial independence, it added. As part of President Park Geun-hye’s presidential election pledges, the government expanded the existing public child care program to children aged 5 or younger since 2013, and started to provide around 150,000 ($137) to 200,000 won allowance for the elderly aged 65 or older since 2014. “Seoul City and district offices have been asked to share the cost burden way too much by the central government since it introduced the universal welfare schemes ― free child care and basic pension for senior citizens,” city officials said. The districts are currently shouldering 343 billion won a year for the child care scheme, which is more than 30 percent of the total cost. For the elderly basic pension program, local offices are shouldering 218 billion won or 15 percent of the total cost, they said.

The downward trend is seen as being extended into this year, the data showed.The data came as China's relations with North Korea have been strained following the North's third nuclear test in February 2013.But few analysts said that Beijing, North Korea's last-remaining patron, will cut off its economic lifeline to Pyongyang.China made no crude oil shipments to China in the first quarter, following no official oil deliveries in 2014, the data showed.China supplies nearly all of the North's energy needs such as crude oil, diesel and jet fuel, but there have been no reported oil shipments to Pyongyang since last year.But there have been no reports of a serious fuel shortage in the North, which analysts said indicates that China has been providing crude oil to North Korea in the form of grant aid so that such shipments have not been recorded officially.

""The companies have been ordered to refrain from such activities in the future.""Hyundai E&C; was slapped with the largest fine of 36.2 billion won, followed by Hanyang and Samsung C&T.; Keangnam Enterprise Ltd., Dong Ah Construction Industrial Co. and Ssangyong E&C; were not ordered to pay fines because they are struggling to stay afloat or under court receivership.The FTC also said Hyundai Development Co., SK E&C; and Daewoo E&C; were found to have rigged bids for a 61.1-kilometer rail system linking Suseo in southeastern Seoul with Pyeongtaek, 70 kilometers south of the capital. The companies have been slapped with just under 8.08 billion won in finesThe watchdog said the companies rigged the bidding to keep prices at set levels for the railway line that will open later this year. It claimed that the collusion caused the government to pay more for the work.The FTC said its latest move aims to root out long entrenched bid rigging in the construction sector, adding that more effort will be made to keep tabs on other projects to ferret out illegal activities and support free and fair competition.

The North has not responded to Seoul's offer for dialogue, citing the joint exercise between Seoul and Washington.The ministry said it will actively support inter-Korean cultural and sports exchanges at various levels, in which more people-to-people contacts can be expected.The government also plans to push for joint commemorative projects with North Korea in those areas in the landmark year.Last week, the ministry unveiled plans to hold a soccer game and ""ssireum,"" or traditional Korean wrestling matches, with Pyongyang.Other projects being pursued include performances involving musicians from the two Koreas and academic events, as well as an ongoing program to publish a joint dictionary of their language.Seoul will also permit journalists to visit North Korea to cover a variety of events to be pursued by civilian groups, the official said.This year marks the 70th anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule, as well as the division of the two Koreas.It also marks the 15th anniversary of the June 15 joint declaration signed during the first inter-Korean summit between then South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and then North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.The ministry will also allow more private organizations to increase humanitarian assistance to North Korea by easing standards for donor eligibility and expanding the scope of aid.As part of such efforts, Seoul plans to tap more inter-Korean cooperative funds to support people-to-people exchanges.(Yonhap)","boost inter korean exchanges ,seoul to boost inter ,boost inter korean civilian ,to boost inter korean ,seoul to boost","['South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Japan', 'the Ministry of Unification', 'inter - korean']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59280562  0.44027302

The decision will allow the Ace Gyeongam Foundation to shore up agriculture in Sariwon, the capital of North Hwanghae Province, by building an additional 50 greenhouses and providing 15 tons of fertilizers and other construction and farming materials. “...","South Korea on Monday approved a civic group’s plan to provide fertilizers to the North, marking the first authorization of the politically sensitive aid since 2010. The decision will allow the Ace Gyeongam Foundation to shore up agriculture in Sariwon, the capital of North Hwanghae Province, by building an additional 50 greenhouses and providing 15 tons of fertilizers and other construction and farming materials. “They will provide technical support such as for establishing gardens and greenhouses so that the project will proceed smoothly,” Unification Ministry spokesperson Lim Byeong-cheol said at a news briefing. The organization, based in Yeoju, Gyeonggi Province, was set up in 2008 by Ahn Yoo-soo, chairman of furniture maker Ace Bed Co. Ahn, who hails from the region, will deliver the goods worth some 200 million won ($186,000) by land on Tuesday and assess the project’s progress until Saturday together with a team of seven technicians and officials. The announcement marks South Korea’s first fertilizer assistance to the impoverished neighbor since it imposed bilateral sanctions on cross-border trade, investment, travel and other exchanges following the North’s deadly attacks on a corvette and border island in 2010. The last package by a private group was authorized in April the same year. State-level support has not taken place since 2007, although humanitarian aid directed at women and children has continued.Ahn expressed gratitude for the decision, saying his project would provide a “chance to look to the future where our people reconcile and work together.” The foundation has been running a greenhouse farm there since 2009 at a 33,000 square meter area to boost agricultural production and technology transfers. It has since installed 100 greenhouses and is expected to scale it up to 300. Along with cement and heavy equipment, fertilizers and grains such as rice and flour remain sensitive items due to concerns that they can be stored for a relatively long time and thus the communist regime may divert them for military and other unintended uses through resale to other countries. President Park Geun-hye vowed wider humanitarian assistance and proposed a joint agricultural complex in her speech in Dresden, Germany, last March, but her initiative has made little headway amid persistent cross-border tension. “The government will approve humanitarian aid to North Korea such as for those in agricultural and diary sectors, if they are conducted in a transparent way and in the interest of the North Koreans,” a foundation spokesperson said.

An additional 40-strong team comprising public and private rescue and medical workers will be sent shortly for a 10-day mission. The ministry, which pledged $1 million in aid Sunday, is considering donating an extra $1 million, a senior official said.  Oh Young-joo, director general for development cooperation at the Foreign Ministry, speaks during a meeting of senior government officials to discuss measures to support earthquake-stricken Nepal at the ministry’s building in Seoul on Monday. (Yonhap)“We would usually dispatch the advance team first and then the search and rescue staff, but we have decided to send part of them together this time because the situation is changing, in line with the ongoing aftershocks and adding to the already tough conditions, such as the small scale of our embassy and communication interruption,” the official told reporters on customary condition of anonymity. “While carrying out emergency rescue activities, we will make preparations for our upcoming full-fledged mission in tandem, adapting to the situation on the ground and looking into the range and type of activities of follow-up personnel.” The decision was made at an intra-agency meeting designed to discuss the scale, timeframe and other details of the public-private disaster response team. The meeting was led by Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, with the public safety and security and health and welfare ministries also in attendance. Other organizations, including the Korea International Cooperation Agency, also participated.

207,207,‘Ethiopia’s renaissance follows Korean development’,"Korea has been a paragon of progress for Ethiopia, which has developed rapidly since 2000.The Ethiopian economy grew by over 10 percent annually between 2004 and 2009, slowing to nearly 7 percent since 2012, according to the International Monetary Fund.Some political commentators have called Ethiopia the “African Lion,” a term similar to the “Asian Tiger,” which described Korea during its period of speedy develop...","Korea has been a paragon of progress for Ethiopia, which has developed rapidly since 2000.The Ethiopian economy grew by over 10 percent annually between 2004 and 2009, slowing to nearly 7 percent since 2012, according to the International Monetary Fund.Some political commentators have called Ethiopia the “African Lion,” a term similar to the “Asian Tiger,” which described Korea during its period of speedy development.Ethiopian President Mulatu Teshome visited Korea in mid-April to benchmark Korea’s development experience and boost ties in diplomacy, business and education.“Ethiopia is going through a national renaissance, following Korea’s model of development,” Teshome told The Korea Herald in an interview. “Under a strong government guiding the national development, millions have escaped poverty and disease, and now hope for a brighter future.”The Ethiopian government aims to elevate the economy into a middle-income category by 2025 with the help of its five-year Growth and Transformation Plans. Korea also had its own series of seven five-year economic development plans between 1962 and 1996, leading to the “compressed development” of the economy.Ethiopia’s president attributed his country’s success to having a clear vision of advancing leadership; pursuing realistic policies with a rational assessment of realities; and promoting strategic public-private partnerships to remedy market failures.“The general philosophy behind all of this is to have a democratic developmental state,” Teshome said, adding that Ethiopia has a lot to learn from Korea’s Saemaul Undong, a nationwide community movement launched in 1970 to modernize rural towns. Ethiopian President Mulatu Teshome (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)Most recently, the Korea International Cooperation Agency has been providing vocational training and organizational assistance to agricultural projects in Ethiopia.During his weeklong visit, Teshome met Korean President Park Geun-hye and participated in the opening ceremony of the World Water Forum in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province. He was also greeted by business leaders from the Korean Federation of Industries, Daegu Chamber of Commerce and Industries, LG Electronics, CJ Corporation, and agricultural machinery and textile companies.Teshome acknowledged the appreciation of the Korean government and people for Ethiopia’s participation in the Korean War (1950-1953), in which 6,000 Ethiopian troops fought as part of the United Nations’ forces.Ethiopia and Korea established diplomatic relations in 1963. “Our solidarity and fraternity will serve as a springboard for future cooperation,” the president emphasized.After finishing high school in Ethiopia, Teshome won a government scholarship to study in China. Between 1978 and 1982, he obtained an undergraduate degree in the philosophy of political economy at Peking University, where he developed an understanding of Asian cultures.He worked in the Ethiopian government for two years and returned to Peking University for a masters and doctorate in international law. Teshome went on to become the Ethiopian ambassador to China, Japan and Turkey, before becoming the president in 2013.Teshome highlighted investment and construction opportunities in Ethiopia’s water and green energy sectors. In late March, Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan reached a historic agreement to build the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which would generate over 6,000 megawatts of electricity for Ethiopia and its neighbors.The $5 billion project will make it Africa’s largest hydroelectric power plant, part of a long line of mega-sized infrastructure projects aimed at turning Ethiopia into a regional powerhouse.“Building the dam is a matter of existence for Ethiopia,” Teshome said. “Our people must change the state of affairs to which we belong today. We are not willing to continue our same way of life.”The president said the project will lead to trust and integration in the Horn of Africa region. It will also improve water management, create jobs and spur community development in the Nile Basin, he said.In March, Ethiopia met target No. 10 of its Millennium Development Goals to provide safe drinking water and sanitation services to its citizens. The five-year plan places water supply at the core of its objectives.“We will build together and prosper together,” Teshome said. “To build a prosperous nation requires energy, which lies in water in Ethiopia. We will kick-start our industries and forge an industrialized society.”Teshome also called upon Korean educators and researchers to work in Ethiopia, as 10 universities will be added every five years to the current 36 universities in the country.Lee Jang-gyu, a retired professor of electrical engineering from Seoul National University, has been the president of Adama Science and Technology University in Addis Ababa since 2011. He is the first Korean university president in Africa.Korean professionals in the field of information communication technology are welcome at a technopark in Addis Ababa currently under construction, Teshome added.Highlighting the Third International Conference on Financing for Development to be held in Addis Ababa in July, he said, “The importance of the conference is to have a shared vision with the international community about financing development as we jump into the 2015-2020 period’s post-millennium goals for development.”“Ethiopia has marvelous and magnificent projects lined up to protect the environment and shift to renewable energy, all in the interest of the international community. We call on the world to take part in this grand undertaking under the umbrella of financing development.”The president called on the international community to pay attention to poverty, disease and violence in Africa. Without a combined international effort, he said, Africa’s problems will spill over to other regions, as demonstrated by the entry of refugees into Europe.“If the world doesn’t care about Africa,” Teshome warned, “terrorist groups like Boko Haram and Al-Shabaab will multiply, and the Islamic State can extend operations to Africa.“The international community, with the help of African countries, must prevent this from happening. This will be the voice of Ethiopia to the world during the conference.”By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","ethiopia renaissance follows korean ,developed rapidly since 2000 ,renaissance follows korean development ,the ethiopian economy grew ,over 10 percent annually","['Korea', 'Ethiopia', 'ethiopian', 'the International Monetary Fund', 'Ethiopia', 'African Lion', 'Korea']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52224332  0.35310125

The practice effectively blocked new agencies from being designated as aid donors.The new move will allow private groups with no history of assistance to the North to join the drive to help cope with North Korea's severe food shortage and other challenges.The government said it will continue to comprehensively take into account the qualifications of hopeful donors in a transparent manner.Inter-Korean relations have been strained as the North has not responded to Seoul's offer for dialogue, citing the ongoing joint military exercise between Seoul and Washington.Inter-Korean exchanges have also been suspended since 2010 when Seoul imposed the May 24 Measure that bans economic and cultural exchanges with North Korea as a punishment for the North's torpedoing of the South Korean warship Cheonan in March 2010.New Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo told reporters Friday that Seoul will spur efforts to lead more private groups to provide humanitarian aid to North Korea.Meanwhile, Lim said that Seoul plans to provide necessary support to foreign activists who hope to walk across the heavily fortified inter-Korean border if North Korea approves their plan.About 30 female activists from around the world, including U.S. activist Gloria Steinem and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mairead Maguire from Ireland, plan to march from the North to the South across the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that bisects the two Koreas to mark the May 24 International Women's Day for Peace and Disarmament. Crossing the inter-Korean border requires approval from the two Koreas and the United Nations Command.""If the North's nod is confirmed, the Seoul government will offer cooperation on the basis of the truce treaty and precedents,"" Lim said.They said the purpose of the DMZ crossing is to express hope that Korean families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War will be united someday and military tension between the two Koreas can be reduced. They also hope to ultimately end the division and replace the 1953 Armistice Agreement with a permanent peace treaty.Seoul has delivered a letter to an organizer reading that the South Korean government understands the activists' intent, but there should be sufficient considerations to check security, Lim added.

The measures also come as part of the country's efforts to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent from its business-as-usual level in 2020.The government plans to spend an additional 137 billion won this year to help create local niche markets for the clean energy industry while public firms and private companies are expected to invest some 1.26 trillion won for the purpose, the ministry said.The measures also call for efforts to increase the number of electric vehicles operated in the country from the current 3,000 to 47,000 by 2017. To this end, the government will build 575 new fast chargers for plug-in vehicles across the country over the next three years.It will also set up a 100 billion won fund to encourage private investment in the related fields by matching private investment.In addition, the government will work to increase the number of energy-sufficient islands to nine from the current one. Such islands will rely on clean, renewable energy, as well as energy storage systems, to permanently break off from the use of fossil fuel for power.The benefits of developing brand new technologies and clean energy sources will also be extended to other countries, partly through exports but also through the country's official development aid.The government plans to help build at least three energy-independent islands in other countries, the ministry said.

None of the South Korean firms have paid the wages,"" said Yoo Chang-geun, vice president of the group.But the ministry said it's still early to say that the North has extended the deadline.Seoul points out that Pyongyang violated a 2004 agreement that calls for two quasi-government committees from each side to set the wages together. The wage cap has been set at 5 percent per year.The two Koreas have held the talks on the wage dispute twice so far through a quasi-government committee, but they failed to produce a breakthrough.""There is no change in Seoul's stance that the wage dispute should be resolved through consultations,"" Lim Byeong-cheol, spokesman at the unification ministry, said at a press briefing on Monday. ""We plan to come up with measures to minimize any potential damage to South Korean firms, such as providing them with financial compensation.""South Korean firms have been squeezed as the Seoul government has asked them not to accept the North's decision while the North has threatened to collect an arrears charge if they do not pay the higher wages.South Korea is concerned that the wage row could set a precedent for the North to make unilateral decisions on the operations of the industrial park.The Kaesong Industrial Complex opened in the early 2000s, the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation. It has served as a major revenue source for the cash-strapped communist North.

It also plans to deploy unmanned reconnaissance aircraft to division-level units and establish a command and control system, which will provide field units with more visual information to help them enhance situational awareness. The plans are part of the five-year mid-term defense plan that the ministry announced Monday.“The mid-term plan is designed to strengthen our key assets to deter an all-out war and limited attack from North Korea,” said a senior ministry official, declining to be named. “With the plan, we will also enhance our self-defense capabilities.”The ministry set aside 232.5 trillion won for building military capabilities for five years from 2016. Of the total, 115.4 trillion won will be spent on managing military forces, while 77.1 trillion won will be used for enhancing defense capabilities.To establish the Kill Chain preemptive strike system, the ministry earmarked 6 trillion won, an increase of 300 billion won from the previous mid-term plan for 2015-19. With the budget increase, the ministry seeks to build a strike system that can cover all of North Korean targets.For the Kill Chain system, the ministry plans to secure a multi-purpose satellite, high-altitude and mid-altitude reconnaissance drones, long-range air-to-surface guided bombs, mid-range air-to-surface precision bombs and other assets.For the establishment of the Korea Air and Missile Defense system, the ministry plans to spend 2.7 trillion won, an increase of 400 billion won from the previous mid-term plan. South Korea has been working on developing the KAMD, a low-tier multiple-interception system, rather than participating in the U.S.-led missile defense program, as China has accused the U.S. MD program of possibly targeting the country. The KAMD consists of Patriot Advanced Capabili-3, M-SAM interceptors and an early warning radar that work together to shoot down short-range North Korean missiles. For the construction of the Kill Chain and KAMD, the ministry increased the initial budget by 700 billion won, as it has determined that Pyongyang has secured considerable technology to miniaturize a nuclear warhead and put it on long-range ballistic missiles.To strengthen preparedness against North Korean provocations and border defense, the ministry plans to spend 1.8 trillion won. It will increase the number of unmanned aerial vehicles to corps-level units and deploy upgraded radars and fire control systems. The ministry also set aside 12.1 trillion won to secure aerial precision strike capabilities. Seoul plans to purchase F-35A fighter jets, aerial refueling tankers, precision-guided bombs and other assets that would ensure the country’s air capabilities.To strengthen warships’ ability to detect, strike and intercept enemy targets, the ministry plans to spend 11.1 trillion won. A total of 5.4 trillion won has been set aside to purchase large-scale attack helicopters and armored vehicles for enhanced maneuverability. Another 17.9 trillion won has been earmarked for defense research and development.(sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","to invest w9 trillion ,destroy north korea nuclear ,invest w9 trillion ,invest w9 trillion to ,trillion won 31 billion","['N.K.', 'Song Sang - ho', 'the Defense Ministry', 'North Korea ’s']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.05786748  0.23441784

It is part of the ministry's budget plan for the 2016-2020 fiscal period, which calls for 232.5 trillion won in total, a 7 percent increase on average during the cited period compared to its 2015-2019 version. While costs for maintaining troops are set at 155.2 trillion won and the rest will be for the improvement of military capabilities, the government, specifically, is to invest 6 trillion won in building the country's preemptive strike apparatus, the Kill Chain, and 2.7 trillion won into the development of the low-tier air defense program, the Korean Air and Missile Defense (KAMD) system, over the next five years.  The aggregate amount is 700 billion won more than the budget plan stated in the 2015-2019 period, which reflects Seoul's will to ensure a stronger deterrence against the belligerent North.Key assets for the Kill Chain incorporate multi-purpose satellites, Global Hawk unmanned aircraft and Taurus missiles. The KAMD system includes patriot interceptors and mid-range surface-to-air missiles, or M-SAM.As part of efforts to effectively cope with North Korea's local provocations and to prepare for all-out war with the enemy, Seoul plans to spend 1.8 trillion won on acquiring surveillance systems such as unmanned aerial vehicles and detection radars.In the face of the North's growing security threats online, South Korea plans to earmark 100 billion won to build a multi-layer protection system and to create a mock training field.""The mid-term budget plan also focuses on improving circumstances at the barracks and increasing monthly payments to enlistees by more than double,"" a ministry official said.

The abacus was first presented as drawings of circles by Babylonians around B.C. 3000. It was later modified into the shape we know now ― the rectangular wooden frame and beads strung up on metal rods ― by the Chinese in A.D. 1300, who called it “suanpan.” Koreans adopted it in 1400 under the name “jupan.” By visualizing numbers with beads, this analog tool made complex calculations possible for clerks and merchants before the age of digital calculators.Jupan continued to exist as a useful tool in modern times, as it enabled its users to picture the beads in mind and perform quick mental calculations. A “jupan,” or abacus, is a calculating tool that experts claim helps enhance concentration“Becoming familiar with jupan not only improves the right hemisphere of the brain that helps people to think about problems step by step, but also the left side that is related to creativity, as people get to mentally visualize the arrangement of beads as they calculate.” said Lee Young-ha, a professor at the Department of Mathematics Education at Ewha Womans University. “In addition, as the beads on jupan are tiny and easily moved along the wire, one has to pay close attention while moving them, which ultimately leads to the improvement of concentration.” Supported by expert opinions, a recent phenomenon has arisen in South Korea, in which jupan is regaining newfound popularity as an effective means to cultivate the minds of young people, who are over-dependent on digital technology. Kim Soon-hi, the head of the Korea Association Zhoushan’s Gangnam branch, singled out the advanced digital tools of today as the cause behind young children’s lack of concentration, perseverance and arithmetic dexterity. “Digital calculators and computers don’t require thinking. Kids from younger generations are inundated by this on-hand technology. Many of them even fail to learn their home phone numbers by heart,” she said. “In the 1970s and ’80s the ability to calculate with jupan was a prerequisite for anyone who wished for a career in business,” Kim said. “But now, jupan is primarily used as an educational tool.” “Older people do it too as ‘brain sports’ that help prevent dementia.”The number of people paying attention to the benefits of jupan has consistently increased, Kim said. As a result, the once-bimonthly supan certification exam is now carried out every month as of this year.The number of students who took the certification test doubled in February to over 1,000, compared to the 450 in January. Kim, a veteran jupan instructor at Seoul National University of Education, said she hoped for more people to recognize the benefits and potential of jupan.

Seoul's contribution will come from its Economic Development Cooperation Fund launched in 1987 and meant to provide low-interest loans to less-developed countries.The MOU reached during Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan's visit to Washington is expected to help the international development organization push forward projects in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean.Choi, who doubles as deputy prime minister in charge of economic affairs, is in the United States to take part in the G20 ministerial meeting as well as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings.The latest deal comes as South Korea marked its 60th year as a World Bank member, and can lay the foundation for closer ties down the road, the ministry said.Besides the MOU, Choi and World Bank chief Jim Yong Kim touched on ways to generate funding for the Green Climate Fund which aims to cope with global warming. The GCF is headquartered in Songdo, west of Seoul.Choi and Kim concurred on the need to strengthen cooperation between the World Bank and the United Nations climate fund.In talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, the South Korean policymaker agreed that closer cooperation between the two countries is needed in light of recent global economic developments and mounting uncertainties in the financial sector.""The two men concurred on the importance of the bilateral military alliance and reached an understanding on strengthening economic and financial cooperation,"" the ministry said.Choi also met with Inter-American Development Bank President Luis Alberto Moreno and stressed South Korea's desire to expand ties with Latin American economies.The deputy prime minister, who is IDB's rotating chairman this year, said Asia's fourth-largest economy wants to increase its stake in the newly created NewCo, which is being set up by merging various public corporations under the multinational development bank into a single entity. The corporation will manage development projects and other ventures.Since Seoul joined the IDB long after its creation, its stake in the lender and related organizations, which can determine its standing, has remained very small.The ministry said South Korea wants to use the NewCo as a platform to expand its economic cooperation with Latin America.

The two firms signed an agreement to jointly develop the helicopters last month, officials from the Defense Acquisition Program Administration said.“There have been differences between DAPA and KAI over a number issues including the percentage of indigenous components to produce the helicopters,” a DAPA official said, declining to be named. “But we reconciled them through 20 rounds of marathon talks from last August until last month.” Although DAPA and KAI have reached an agreement over the overall technological development, they have yet to conclude their negotiations over the development costs. Their talks over the costs will be finalized later this month, and the two sides are expected to sign a final agreement for the helicopter project in May, DAPA officials said.The project to develop the military helicopter is led by DAPA, while the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy is in charge of developing the civilian helicopter. The LAH project is estimated to cost 692.6 billion won, while the LCH project will cost around 950 billion won.KAI is to develop the LCH based on Airbus Helicopter’s EC-155B1 platform. It will then transform the LCH into the LAH ― a military chopper with defensive and offensive equipment such as antitank missiles and machine guns. The LAH and LCH are to share more than 50 component parts.According to the government plan, while the LCH will be developed in 2020, the LAH is to be developed in 2022.

Countries with a yearly water supply of 1,000 to 2,000 cubic meters per person are considered water-stressed.Amid concerns over Korea’s water resources, the head of Korea’s state-run environment body stressed that going back to the basics is the key to overcoming this problem.“Expanding water reuse and reducing the leakages are the most realistic solutions,” Korea Environment Corporation CEO Lee Si-jin told The Korea Herald. Korea Environment Corporation CEO Lee Si-jin. (Chung Hee-cho/The Korea Herald)“Some claim that developing new water resources can relieve the shortage problem. But considering its high cost, ecological problems and possible conflicts with concerned regions, that’s not viable.” KECO has committed to sustainable growth by connecting the public and private sectors in water management and greenhouse gas emission reductions. Lee, who has been a consultant to KECO and the Environment Ministry for over two decades, took the helm of the company in 2013. Lee stressed that three factors affect Korea’s water use: the limited amount of water, resource waste and the limit of developing water resources.“If we at least reuse a certain amount of water spent at households and industrial facilities, the water shortage problem can be greatly solved,” Lee said. Water reuse includes purifying and treating rainwater, sewage and effluent into industrial and agricultural water, he added. The government is considering a long-term scheme to reuse 2.5 billion tons of water or 12 percent of the total water resource by 2020 based on KECO’s study. “Along with efforts to widen the water reuse, water leakage management should be carried out to conserve resources,” 58-year-old Lee said. As of 2013, Korea recorded 650 million cubic meters of water leakage per year, worth 515 billion won ($470 million), the CEO added. As part of its efforts to minimize the leakage, KECO has launched a special water management project in two regions in Gangwon Province since 2009. This includes improving the waterworks pipes and running a real-time management system. While the project is still underway, the leakage rate in Yeongwol-gun and Jeongseon-gun in the province already dropped by about 10 percent to 37.1 percent, and by 3 percent to 80 percent, respectively, he said.In recognition of its works in water management and other environmental projects, KECO won the Environmental Business International Award for the last four years and Green Apple Awards three years straight. As part of further efforts to find solutions for water issues, KECO is participating in the seventh World Water Forum, the world’s largest water event that kicked off Sunday in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province, in southern Korea. The state-run company will host the World Water Challenge to award those who come up with the most feasible and innovative water solutions. “Countries around the world have participated in the challenge. I’m looking forward to seeing water solutions through creative ideas in the challenge,” Lee said.

The February gain is the biggest for the month since the BOK started compiling the data in October 2003.  The on-month gain marks a sharp surge from the previous month when household loan growth increased by a relatively small 671 billion won due mainly to seasonal factors.  By sector, banks' household loans increased by 3.4 trillion won on-month to 523.4 trillion won while those by non-banking institutions rose 384.3 billion won to 226.8 trillion won.  Of the total, mortgage loans extended by all financial institutions went up 3.8 trillion won to 465.8 trillion won, its monthly gain nearly tripling from 1.4 trillion won in January.  Loans for other purposes, such as living expenses, stayed unchanged at 284.4 trillion won.  ""It seems that loans for other purposes stayed on par as borrowers tend to refrain from getting loans in the beginning of the year,"" said a BOK official.  Demand for household loans has been trending higher as home buyers cash in on low lending rates that have been sliding lower in tandem with the BOK's three rate cuts, in August, October and March, since the second half of last year.  In October, the amount jumped by a record 7.8 trillion won following the second in a series of three rate cuts that was aimed at bolstering growth.  The data comes two days ahead of the central bank's monthly rate-setting meeting. Nineteen out of the 20 analysts and economists surveyed by Yonhap Infomax, the financial news arm of Yonhap News Agency, projected the BOK to stand pat on the record-low 1.75 percent base rate following a surprise rate cut last month.  Some analysts said growing household debt may block the central bank from further cutting the key rate.  ""High household debt is a factor that will make the BOK wary of aggressive policy loosening,"" said Krystal Tan of Capital Economics, a London-based macroeconomic research firm.

Last year the budget deficit in this field reached 29.5 trillion won, up 8.4 trillion won from the year before.  The official said the country's public sector debt, which encompasses general government debt and the balance of non-financial public corporations, expanded by 93.3 trillion won to 1,211.2 trillion won last year, up from 1,117.9 trillion won in 2013.  Public sector debt is used as an indicator for the fiscal soundness of a country's public sector and can be used to assess fiscal risk management.  The settlement of accounts, to be submitted to the National Assembly in late May, also showed net national assets standing at 543.3 trillion won last year, down 5.1 trillion won from 548.4 trillion won.  Total assets reached 1,754.5 trillion won, with debt hitting 1,211.2 trillion won. This includes 643.6 trillion won in debts that the government must pay pensioners in the long run. Pension-related liabilities surged by 47.3 trillion won last year, while the issuance of Treasurys to make up for fiscal shortfalls stood at 38.4 trillion won.  On the country's fiscal soundness, the ministry said that general government debt and public sector debt were well below numbers for other members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.  ""Compared to 2007, the country's national debt increased 7 percentage points as of 2014, while the OECD average in the same period reached 25.2 percentage points,"" the official said.  South Korea's healthy fiscal health has been attributed to less money spent on welfare vis-a-vis other member economies, with such low numbers expected to go up down the road in the face of a rapidly aging society.

Schools need to pay more systematic attention to address the issue,” Kang said.The rise may also be due to an increase in the number of reported cases to the School Safety and Insurance Foundation, ministry officials were quoted as saying.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","most accidents at 39 ,accidents at schools increase ,education 116 527 accidents ,ferry sinking last april ,2014 10 percent increase","['Korea', 'the Ministry of Education']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.09138115  0.21912244

Imported car sales overall increased 14 percent in 2014. One in 7 cars sold in Korea last year were imported, with German brands making up three-quarters. “The Korean market has developed to a great success for German manufacturers. We are here to support our supplier companies by collaborating with Korean partners,” Klaus Braunig, managing director of VDA, told The Korea Herald last Thursday during the motor show, which was held at the Korea International Exhibition Center from April 3-12.“Collaboration between medium-sized firms helps not only the automotive sector, but the entire industry by spurring innovative partnerships.” The German Embassy’s Head of Mission Theodor Schuster (center) speaks beside German Association of Automotive Industry managing director Klaus Braunig (left) and head of press Eckehart Rotter at the Seoul Motor Show 2015 at KINTEX on Thursday. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)A noticeable trend in Korea’s import car market is the dominance of premium vehicles, taking up over 70 percent of the market share. A total of 86 percent of all imported German cars to Korea belong in this category. Newly registered cars with diesel engines, known for power and fuel efficiency, also increased from 25 percent in 2012 to 33 percent in 2014. Two-thirds of German cars sold in Korea in 2012 had diesel engines, with the figure rising to 80 percent in 2014. German exports to Korea rose sharply after the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement came into effect in 2011. The growing popularity of premium cars, the preference for diesel engines, successful marketing, low interest rate and the favorable euro-won exchange rate contributed to the sales, explained Braunig. Theodor Schuster, head of mission at the German Embassy, said German manufacturers buy parts worth billions of dollars from Korean suppliers each year, which are not reflected in Korea’s deficit trade balance of 3.6 billion euros with the European Union. “It is important to take note of positive effects that German manufacturers bring to Korea, including creating high-quality jobs for the ‘creative economy.’”VDA head of press Eckehart Rotter said, “The old mentality of buying domestic brands as ‘patriotic consumers’ is waning. Greater opportunities offered by globalization are more and more appreciated by Korean consumers.”German representatives said the “elaborate” certification required on imported motor-vehicle parts, introduced after the conclusion of FTA, should be redressed as it complicates packaging process.

Currently, students are allowed to attend an eight-hour training session at a base near their school instead. Korean men who complete their mandatory military service must serve for an additional eight years as reservists. The mobilized training program includes shooting drills and combat exercises.The reserve forces were established in 1968, but the government has allowed college students to undergo shorter training periods since 1971 to give them more time to study. The move comes as an effort to ensure fair treatment between those who are subject to the training and those who are not. The ministry said it would also consider obligating public servants to join the annual drill.Nearly 700,000 men, including prosecutors, teachers, police officers, firefighters and senior government officials, were exempt from the training as of January, according to the ministry. “The government designated a group of people, like college students, who can enjoy a waiver for mobilized training if their jobs are considered as serving the national interest,” said Na Seng-Yong, an official from the ministry. “However, things have changed. We need to review the system to see whether it is being fairly operated or could maintain military readiness, given the declining number of reservists,” he said.The number of reservists across the country reached 4 million in the 1970s, but dropped to 2.9 million in recent years.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","government is considering expanding ,training for college students ,military considers expanding reserve ,considers expanding reserve training ,military training for college","['Korea', '“the Defense Ministry']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.12697192 -0.1120512

""It encourages people to repay loans from the beginning and reduced the risk of financial volatility.  Yim said more than 330,000 borrowers have benefited from the fixed-rate loan program.   Most home-backed bank loans are non-amortized loans, requiring debtors to pay back the lump sum principal upon maturity. Such loans are heavily susceptible to changing interest rates.  He said the galloping family debt is one of the biggest risks in the local financial market, and he will do his best to bring it under control.  Household debt has been a pain in the neck for local policymakers as it stunts consumer spending and weighs on the national economy, which has been slowing in recent years.  The pace of gains in household credit has been faster since the government in August eased rules on mortgage loans to stimulate the sagging property market.   The central bank chimed in by lowering its policy rates twice in the second half of last year and once again in March to a record low of 1.75 percent  According to central bank data, South Korea's household loans totaled 1,089 trillion won as of end-December, with mortgage loans reaching 460.6 trillion won, 42 percent of the total.

""A flexible economy and sustainable welfare systems are critical for the country's future.""His comments come amid a government push to abolish the so-called dual labor market. The dual labor system refers to the gap between full-time regular employees who enjoy ""excessive"" job security and good pay vis-a-vis non-regular workers whose employment is tenuous and are usually paid less than their regular employee counterparts.Choi has claimed this system has hurt youth employment, although labor unions have opposed any move to weaken job security.Touching on the overall state of the economy, Choi said that expansionary fiscal policies, advantageous exchange and interest rates and oil prices along with more transactions in the property market are all pointing to an economic recovery.""The government expects the upturn in economic indicators, along with the revival of confidence by consumers and businesses, to lead to more consumer spending and investment,"" he said.Kim In-ho, the co-chairman of the committee, concurred that change is critical at this juncture, making clear that the government alone cannot resolve all outstanding issues.""The country needs to change so the necessary reforms can be pushed forward whenever the need arises,"" said Kim, who also heads the Korea International Trade Association. ""The country must pursue a policy of sustainable and inclusive growth."" He also said South Korea needs to reach consensus on such critical matters as the labor market and employment and that, companies must play a leading role in creating more jobs.

On Tuesday, it selected Korea Aerospace Industries, the country's sole aircraft maker, as the preferred bidder.Codenamed KF-X (Korean Fighter Experimental), the project calls for Seoul to develop its own fighter jet of the F-16 class to replace the aging fleet of F-4s and F-5s.Some 120 jets are to be put into service starting around 2025, with the additional production cost estimated at 9.3 trillion won, according to the Defense Acquisition Program Administration.""It is highly necessary to set up an around 70-member task force involving officials from the DAPA and relevant ministries, air force officers, and experts from home and abroad,"" a senior DAPA official said, requesting anonymity, stressing the need for a massive budget and transfer of cutting-edge technology. The team is tentatively named ""Boramae (hawk) Task Force.""""We expect the task force to be launched in June after signing a final deal with the contractor that will oversee not only the whole development process but secure international cooperation,"" he added.The DAPA aims to wrap up negotiations with KAI over price and technology-related issues by May for a final decision within the first half of this year. KAI joined the project in partnership with the U.S. defense firm Lockheed Martin, as the DAPA required bidders to have foreign technical assistance.While the procurement agency is optimistic about securing ""most of the key technologies,"" concerns have grown over whether the U.S.will provide South Korea with sensitive and sophisticated technologies, partly because the aircraft will be developed jointly with Indonesia.In September last year, South Korea signed an agreement with the U.S. to receive key fighter technologies from 17 sectors in return for buying 40 Lockheed Martin F-35 fighters. The approval process by the U.S. government is under way.South Korea is seeking key technologies including how to integrate the aircraft system with equipment such as radar and radio frequency jammers, according to officials.""It would be far from easy for the U.S. to make a decision on the issue, as its technology would also be transferred to the Islamic state,"" an industry source said. Jakarta agreed with Seoul to cover 20 percent of the development cost. In case the U.S. ""refuses to share part of the key technologies we want, we are reviewing alternatives including seeking separate contracts with foreign assistance firms other than Lockheed in third countries,"" another DAPA official said.

""The largest conglomerates have cut back on affiliate numbers with most of the gains in recent years coming from small to mid-size business groups,"" it said.The latest data then showed the aggregate value of the 61 groups stood at 2,258.4 trillion won, an increase of 52.6 trillion won from the previous year.Samsung accounted for 20.1 trillion won of the gains over the year, with Hyundai Motor Group increasing its assets by 13.2 trillion won.The average debt ratio of the business groups stood at 101.1 percent, down 2.6 percentage points from a year ago, with Hyundai Group's numbers falling the most.The FTC said that assets of big conglomerates have been increasing steadily while the debt ratio has been falling for the last five years.In term of sales, the combined numbers fell 30.5 trillion won over the last year to 1,505.1 trillion won, with net earnings also down 5.7 trillion won to 42.1 trillion won.The drops come after many South Korean companies struggled to generate sales and turn profits in 2014 and so far this year.""Sales have been rising steadily, but they did start contracting after 2013, while net earnings have been falling steadily after 2011,"" the FTC said.The regulator said that by updating the watch list every year, it can keep better tabs on large conglomerates that could distort the free market through internal financial arrangements and loan guarantees.

Situated between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, Denmark has overcome its water challenges using innovative engineering. “Not just Denmark, but the whole world is facing increasingly severe problems related to drinking water,” Brosbol told journalists from Korea, Japan, China, Singapore and India at the ministry building. “From the Danish perspective, it is both a challenge and opportunity because we can use our expertise and experience to solve these problems.”Brosbol will attend the seventh World Water Forum in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province from April 12-17 to promote Danish water technologies and send a political message to the United Nations about the importance of water, she said.  Danish Environment Minister Kirsten Brosbol (left) speaks to reporters from Asian media at the ministry building in Copenhagen last week. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)“The World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland this year identified water as the greatest challenge facing humanity,” the minister stressed. “Denmark’s joint water sectors will urge the U.N. to adhere to the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals currently under negotiation.”Korea, for its part, said it would produce a declaration urging a much-belated international coalition. The Danish Water Forum, which promotes cooperation and knowledge sharing in the water sector, will participate in Korea. Denmark has pursued sustainable development since the 1973-74 oil crisis, and worked to increase environmental awareness among citizens. In the 1970s, the Danish Ministry of Environment instituted a regulatory regime that held companies accountable for environmental effects, while nurturing green technologies, Brosbol pointed out. The country’s current success in the water industry is driven by public-private partnerships, as well as high standards of regulation and innovation. “Danish companies see regulations as an asset, rather than a liability,” emphasized Brosbol, explaining that government intervention helped the industry make technological breakthroughs and reduce its ecological footprint. She added that government oversight had led to companies gaining an edge against international competitors as the global paradigm shifted toward sustainable development.By investing in measures to adapt to climate change, such as coastal protection, flood management, climate resilient buildings and food security, Denmark has used the climate threat to create jobs and raise exports as part of its green growth strategy. Denmark has one of the strictest regulations in the European Union on groundwater protection and wastewater treatment, stressed Brosbol.“Thanks to generational efforts, the Copenhagen Harbor became clean enough to swim in, and people drink water straight from the tap,” she said. “Both large and small and medium-sized companies feed into a cycle of innovation and global business expansion.”The Danish government also provides humanitarian and technical assistance to countries through development cooperation. Expert advisers are sent to Danish embassies around the world to give feedback to companies entering new markets, she added. As a result, the Danish economy has grown by 80 percent since 1980, while energy consumption stayed the same and water consumption dropped by 40 percent. A new national agreement in 2012 aims for a fully functioning green economy by 2050. The key to the Danish success is its integrated approach combining water management, climate change and urbanization, said Tanya Jacobsen, project manager at State of Green, which arranged the press tour.“The water supply in Denmark is decentralized to the local level and water prices are set by the government,” she said. “Despite being relatively expensive compared to other countries, the price reflects costs of taxation, groundwater protection, abstraction, distribution and wastewater treatment.”Preparing for the changing climate, urban drainage capacity has been strengthened by combining canals, lakes and retention basins, and recreational areas and green corridors were added to help cool the city and increase biodiversity.

From groundwater purification to wastewater treatment and academic research to town renewals, water challenges are embodied in Danish life and business.Denmark’s water sector has 300 companies employing 17,000 people and generating $5.2 billion annually. Nonprofit organizations such as State of Green promote Danish green technologies internationally. “The point of departure came in 2011 when a sudden downpour caused damage to Copenhagen costing in the billions (of dollars),” said urban renewal project manager Rene Sommer Lindsay. “The event transformed the city’s political climate, ironically being ‘the best disaster ever’ in arousing consciousness about climate adaptation.”In Copenhagen’s neighborhood of Sankt Kjelds Kvarter, town renewal combines citizen participation and city government assistance. Creative design solutions ― rain gardens, green roofs, water towers, walkways and bike paths ― were incorporated into landscape architecture.Using detailed hydrological maps, 300 projects costing $1.5 billion were also launched, increasing roads, pipelines, retention areas and green spaces to deal with cloudbursts and floods. Wastewater is a valuable resource in Denmark, a country known for energy efficiency. Rather than relying on the city’s centralized system, wastewater is treated locally across rural villages and small-town production facilities. In Denmark’s second-largest city of Aarhus, a wastewater plant functions as a power plant.“The Marselisborg Wastewater Treatment Plant is Denmark’s leading bio-refinery generating excess electricity and heat,” operations manager Flemming Husum said while introducing the plant’s outdoor purification tanks.“We use the newest sludge tanks made by Danfoss Power Electronics for fine bubble aeration. It reduces energy consumption and creates a surplus 3,000 kilowatts of ‘green electricity’ per day.”Grundfos engineer Jose Antonio Gil Linares (right) speaks to reporters at the Herlev Hospital near Copenhagen, where wastewater is treated directly on the hospital premises. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)The phosphorous in the wastewater is used as fertilizer, while the biogas is used to heat water that is pumped to municipal companies for a fee, along with 40 percent of the electricity generated.The Aarhus Water company covers all aspects of the city’s water services: supply, pipeline logistics, storm water management and wastewater treatment. After nitrogen, phosphorous and other organic matters are removed, the purified water is released into streams, he explained. In the small town of Kolt-Hasselager southwest of Aarhus, new residential and industrial buildings have sprouted up in recent years, increasing demand for water. Several new waterworks were built using cutting edge valves made by water equipment company AVK Group.“We remove iron, manganese, ammonium, nitrites and nitrates from water and use automatic sand filters to prevent bacterial growth,” operations manager Allan Jensen said. “Protecting waterworks from burglary and vandalism are our top priorities, and we use video surveillance, safety checks and alarms.”Currently, 15,000 townspeople drink water supplied by AVK, and about 100 attend annual meetings for budget and planning. Denmark has decided to stop hospitals releasing pharmaceutical waste into local watercourses. Recognizing conventional wastewater treatment cannot remove the materials, one company developed a decentralized solution. The Herlev Hospital near Copenhagen uses a $7 million Grundfos Biobooster, which treats wastewater directly on the premises with only five hours of weekly maintenance. Engineer Jose Antonio Gil Linares said the Biobooster treated 90 percent of chemical components, filtering out 99 percent of each one. “Our practice will set a benchmark for European Union and other countries,” he added.At the end of the 15-day process, a charcoal-like waste is created and incinerated. The bacteria-free water is discharged into surrounding watercourses.At the Technical University of Denmark in the city of Kongens Lyngby, north of Copenhagen, researchers are investigating sustainable ways of managing urban water cycles. “We are not only ‘forecasting’ climate change, but ‘nowcasting’ its impact using real-time monitoring,” said professor Barth Smets, head of international research relations. “We combine education, innovation and consultancy in our research agenda to create value for society.” Hwang Yu-hoon, a postdoctoral fellow in DTU’s environmental engineering department, has researched purifying contaminated groundwater using nanoparticles. He received his undergraduate and graduate degrees from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. “The school enables total concentration on research with its horizontal atmosphere,” Hwang said. “Open discussions encourage students to lead initiatives.”Another asset is flexible and family-centered work hours allowing early departure for picking up children from child care centers and telecommuting. In contrast to American engineering schools, which focus on developing new technologies, DTU optimizes solutions for existing technologies, according to Hwang. “We provide solutions wanted by the industries and collaborate with them. Students gain valuable experience.”Studying in Denmark is convenient for Korean students, he said, as most Danes speak English. “But if you don’t speak Danish, making close friends with locals might be difficult.” By Joel Lee, Korea Herald correspondent (joel@heraldcorp.com)","generating billion annually nonprofit ,denmark pioneers water technology ,climate change is political ,billion annually nonprofit organizations ,pioneers water technology copenhagen","['America', 'Denmark', 'danish', 'Denmark', 'State']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.84556484  0.37615463

Minimum wage talks linked to labor market reforms need to be concluded in April.The heart of labor market reform is overhauling the so-called dual market, which refers to the gap between full-time regular employees, who enjoy job security, and non-regular workers, whose employment is tenuous and who are usually paid less.Despite the lack of time, the Economic and Social Development Commission in charge of drawing up the reform plans is deadlocked on many key issues. Both the government and management want to create a flexible labor market to make it easier to hire and fire people, while narrowing the difference among workers in job security, welfare benefits and wages. Observers say that even with an agreement by the tripartite government-labor-management committee, there is no guarantee that companies and workers will follow guidelines.Ryoo Jae-woo, an economics professor at Seoul's Kookmin University, said the ESDC may not represent all interested parties, making it hard for real consensus to be reached.But an agreement can clarify a lot of uncertainties in the labor market, he said.""A meaningful compromise could potentially help employment and investment,"" Ryoo said. But others, such as Park Su-keun, a labor law professor at Hanyang University, are skeptical about the way the government was approaching labor reforms.""The tripartite commission is doing its best, yet they have not really worked out the finer details,"" the scholar argued. He called for a slow and steady approach to build consensus, stressing that the deadline is not important.The government is reworking the government employee pension plan, which has taken flak for giving too much to civil servants at the expense of ordinary taxpayers. ""There has been some progress made between the ruling and opposition parties that may allow an agreement to be reached,"" said a finance ministry source, who declined to be identified.The government is also pushing companies to raise their minimum wages in 2016, hoping that more income would fuel consumption and help reduce debt burden.Employers say that raising their minimum wages will eat into their already thin profits.These three reform measures are important, policymakers say, because they can lay the foundation for changes in the financial and education sectors. The financial sector has taken criticism for being too slow to meet market demand and provide necessary funds, while South Korea's education system has been accused of churning out people that do not have the skills required by companies.Policymakers are also calling for the passage of laws by the parliament over the next couple of weeks to breathe new life into the service sector, tourism and corporate funding, and enable better oversight over financial institutions and subcontracting rules.Government officials fear that without timely action, South Korea's economy could fall into hard times.The Bank of Korea has hinted it may adjust down this year's growth target, which is set at 3.4 percent. The predictions made by the central bank and think tanks are lower than the 3.8 percent target set by the finance ministry, which in recent weeks has started to acknowledge that growth so far is not up to earlier expectations.Policymakers repeat that while the economy is recovering, the pace is slow and inconsistent, with industrial production, consumption, investment and exports all failing to meet prior projections.  There is wide consensus that first-quarter growth will be in the zero percent range, marking the sixth quarter in a row that numbers have stayed under 1 percent.Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan has said on numerous occasions that the next few weeks are absolutely critical, with headway needed to be made on reforms within the month, so tangible gains can be made afterward.He said he wants to create ""effective demand"" in the domestic market that can vitalize the economy, and the way to do this is by reaching consensus on the three reforms.

An agenda item for a shareholders meeting slated for Friday would raise the number of its directors' performance shares from 50,000 to 70,000, which would result in larger bonuses for its executives.Performance shares refer to a stock compensation system in which shares of company stock are given to managers or members of the board of directors if certain corporate performance targets, such as earnings, are met.Hana Financial's move came just a year after it had lowered the ceiling to 50,000 shares after critics pointed out that the salaries of the chief executives of financial institutions were out of line with their performance of their companies.Hana Financial Chairman Kim Jung-tai had received 2.64 billion won in salary in 2013, including an additional 39,580 performance shares worth 1.74 billion won. He returned 30 percent of his salary after fierce criticism and revised down the number of his performance shares.But the group is trying to have the figure return to the original level this year, as the financial sector seems to be outside of social monitoring amid a deepening economic slump.""We are preparing for an imminent merger between Hana Bank and the Foreign Exchange Bank,"" said a Hana Financial official, requesting anonymity.Hana Financial is pushing to integrate its two commercial bank affiliates, but its attempt has been stalled due to strong protests by the KEB's labor union.Market watchers said that financial companies are only focusing on lining the pockets of their managers although the banking industry has failed to improve its profitability in recent years.Local banks posted a combined 6.2 trillion won in net profit in 2014, compared with 15 trillion won in 2007, while insurance firms saw their profit jump to 5.6 trillion won from 3.8 trillion won over the cited period.The South Korean financial groups are highly dependent on their flagship banks in terms of net income and assets. For example, Shinhan Bank is responsible for 64 percent of its holding company's net profit, while Hana Bank accounts for 91 percent of the group's total income. Instead, they laid off hundreds of workers in a bid to reduce labor costs, with Shinhan Bank having 310 employees retire earlier this year.""Raising the salary ceiling is a wage hike,"" said Jeong Seon-seob from Chaebul.com, a Seoul-based market research firm.""They give a salary increase to managers despite a drop in profit and downsizing efforts.""

Some go on to teach Korean to foreign immigrants while others work at regional multicultural or counseling centers that provide psychological aid to foreigners,” he added.In a move to better promote multicultural understanding and boost existing support programs for foreign immigrants, the Justice Ministry currently provides aid to 20 universities ― so-called “Active Brain Towers” ― that are working to push forward multiculturalism and social integration.The ministry also recently enacted a new set of regulations to better oversee and guide the different educational programs geared at nurturing the “multicultural society experts” in the country.In effect since January, the regulations lay out key information to be covered in the courses as well as describe procedures to be followed during the on-site training period, among others.The total number of foreigners residing in Korea, including short and long-term foreign residents, has been steadily rising since 2004, according to data by the Korea Immigration Service. Though there were roughly 750,000 foreign residents in Korea as of 2004, figures quickly rose to 1.06 million in 2007, 1.26 million in 2010, and 1.57 million in 2013, according to the KIS.Since last year, the number of foreign residents in Korea has increased by 13.2 percent to 1.77 million as of January 2015.By Sohn Ji-young (jys@heraldcorp.com)","30 korean universities provide ,30 korean universities ,korean universities provide multicultural ,30 universities in south ,universities in south korea","['South Korea', 'the Ministry of Justice', 'Sun Moon University', 'Chongshin University and Konyang Cyber University']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43837807  0.44833803

The overall jobless rate is the highest level in five years, according to government data.She tried to encourage more companies to hire more people, calling companies that create more jobs ""patriotic companies.""Park also renewed her expectation that a tripartite committee composed of officials of labor, management and the government produce a compromise deal by the end of this month to reform the country's rigid labor market.She said improving the system and practices of the labor market is a must for survival, not a choice.One of the key issues of South Korea's labor market is a divide between regular workers and non-regular workers.Critics say regular workers are being overprotected, a development that causes some companies to shun recruitment and instead rely on non-regular workers that they can fire more easily.

""It was orchestrated by the U.S. out of its sinister intention to hold control of South Korea and Japan, use them as a shock brigade in realizing its ambition for world domination and intensify the moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK after securing justification for an arms buildup in the region."" DPRK is the acronym for the North's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.The accusation came on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the sinking of the 1,200-ton vessel, the Cheonan, which killed 46 sailors. The corvette was on a training mission near the disputed inter-Korean sea border in the Yellow Sea.  Shortly after the sinking, the South's government launched an investigation, joined by international experts. It concluded that the Cheonan was hit by a torpedo from a North Korean submarine.Investigators said the North's responsibility is indisputable, citing evidence including some parts of a torpedo recovered in nearby waters. Seoul slapped a set of economic sanctions on Pyongyang, undoing most of inter-Korean projects created by two summit deals in 2000 and 2007, respectively.""The U.S. scenario to abuse the warship sinking case for laying a siege for international sanctions against the DPRK was executed at an ever more serious phase,"" said the Panmunjom mission of the North's military.It argued that the North had already expressed its willingness to support a ""fair"" probe into the Cheonan case but the U.S. was uncooperative.It called on Washington to admit its wrongdoings and offer an apology, though belatedly.

(Yonhap)According to the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, Seoul ranked 27th among 34 OECD countries in a social conflict management index. The index is based on the effectiveness of a country’s administrative system, regulations, corruption management and government spending. The report showed that the Danish government had the highest capacity to resolve social conflicts, followed by Sweden, Finland, Netherlands and New Zealand. Canada was the sole North American country in the top 10, while the United States was ranked 20th. Mexico finished at the bottom of the list.Researchers also looked at factors that can cause social conflicts, including limited press freedom and access to information, income inequality and social demographics. South Korea’s potential sources of conflict were rated as the fourth-biggest among the 24 countries the researchers could compile data on. Chile, Israel and Turkey made up the top three, while Finland was the country most-free of conflict factors.In a comprehensive “social conflict” index combining both conflict factors and conflict-management competence, South Korea was ranked fifth out of 24 countries. Turkey, Greece, Chile and Italy were ranked highest while Scandinavian trio of Denmark, Finland and Sweden were ranked at the bottom.“Both the social conflict and social conflict-management indices showed a meaningful correlation with economic development, but not conflict factors. This implies that we need to focus more on positive aspects from managing social conflicts,” the report said.

The Chinese-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank has recently gained traction as major Western economies, including Britain, Germany and France, decided to join. South Korea, a close ally of the U.S. in Asia, has said it will make a decision by the end of this month. The end of March is the deadline set by China for interested parties to become members of the AIIB. Many experts see the bank as a counterbalance to the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank which have been dominated by the United States and other Western economies.""We will make an announcement on joining the AIIB sometime this week or early next week,"" said the source, who is in regular contact with Chinese officials over the matter. It has not been decided yet how much of a stake South Korea would have in the AIIB, according to the source. ""Once the announcement is made, we will begin negotiations with member states of the AIIB over our stake,"" the source said. China has offered $50 billion and seeks a reported stake of up to 50 percent in the AIIB, which South Korea views negatively because China could make unilateral decisions in the bank's operations.Details of the AIIB are still sketchy, but the source said European countries would have a combined 25-percent stake in the AIIB. So far, about 30 countries have decided to join the AIIB and they will hold a working-level meeting in Kazakhstan later this month, the source said.On Sunday, Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli dismissed concerns about the governance structure and decision-making process of the AIIB, saying it will follow ""internationally accepted rules.""The U.S. has been negative about the Chinese push, interpreted as an attempt to bolster its economic clout in Asia. The U.S. has called for transparency and high standards of governance as key requirements for such an institution.""The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Silk Road Fund initiated by China are also very important, and they will follow internationally accepted rules in their operations,"" said Zhang, who ranks seventh in China's ruling Communist Party hierarchy, told the China Development Forum in Beijing. ""As you know, many countries have expressed their willingness to participate in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which fully shows how attractive this market is,"" Zhang said.

The country had the highest growth rate within the European Union last year at 4.8 percent, and is well-poised to keep up its performance this year.Brendan Howlin, Irish Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform, visited Korea last week coinciding with the St. Patrick’s Day celebration, to strengthen partnership in government, business and education.Among the things he did ― from engaging with Irish citizens to speaking at Korea University ― the minister expressed hope that the two governments combine their respective strengths in governance and administration, while people bond through culture.  Irish Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform Brendan Howlin (right) poses with Irish Ambassador to Korea Aingeal O’Dognoghue at the embassy in Seoul on March 19. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)“St. Patrick’s Day is a focal point for our government to reach out to the Irish diaspora across the globe,” Howlin told The Korea Herald at the Irish Embassy in Seoul on March 19. “The holiday has also become a platform to present Ireland as a robust trading partner to governments and companies worldwide.” Educational exchanges between Ireland and Korea remain robust, he said. Each year about 2,500 Koreans go to Ireland to learn English, and there are exchange programs and partnerships between Korea University and University College Dublin. Active collaboration across universities, research centers and companies in Ireland gives students employment opportunities and increases their international employability, he added. Howlin said that as a small island in Europe, Ireland has had to rely on the innovation and entrepreneurship of its people, much like Korea.“The so-called ‘Celtic Tiger’ economic model of Ireland has changed dramatically since 2010, from dire straits to the fastest growing economy in Europe,” he said. The unemployment rate in Ireland dropped from 15 to 10 percent between 2011 and this year, and is expected to go down to 5 percent by 2018, according to the minister. Howlin, who took office in March 2011, explained how his ministry branched off from the finance ministry with the aim of cutting spending and boosting efficiency.“Ireland experienced a significant economic shock in 2010 as a consequence of the 2008 global financial crisis,” Howlin said. “As the shock reverberated around the world, the exposure had a profound impact on our financial system, which depended heavily on construction loans and property values.”The financial turmoil led to the collapse of the government and a new coalition of the Fine Gael Party and Labor Party took over. After scrambling to find a way out of the crisis, the two parties agreed to implement major reforms across the public administration. “We realized we needed a reform minister who can control expenditure,” Howlin said. “So our government split the finance ministry into the department of macroeconomic planning and taxation, and the department of public expenditure and reform.” “In essence, we agreed to revamp our bureaucracy to rebuild people’s confidence in the capacity of the state, and serve their interests more effectively,” he added. The minister underlined two major “waves of reforms” initiated by his government ― reducing expenditure and improving service. “We trimmed down our public servants by 10 percent, and reduced pay and pension by 20 percent,” he said. “We also made people work longer by bringing in significant flexibilities, including shared services in payroll and procurement agencies.”The second wave of reforms targeted improving the quality of public service through online delivery and increased transparency. Particularly on the e-government side, Howlin said the Irish government is “catching up” with Korea, widely regarded as the most advanced in the world. The reforms were carried out without fierce opposition by the highly unionized civil servants, he said. “Like a good employer, I opened the book to the unions and explained to them exactly what the financial situation in Ireland was ― that we must cut down expenditure.” Howlin pointed out, “Since public servants themselves depended on education, health, law enforcement and so on, they agreed to the reform plan after six months of negotiation and voting.” The workers also accepted pay cuts, which was a “big request” to them, Howlin said. “It was quite amazing. Most people in Ireland and even in government were skeptical whether we could negotiate such an option, but we did in the end.” Alongside these structural reforms, his government also undertook legislative reforms targeting accountability and performance of officials, freedom of information, register of lobbying and protection of whistleblowers.Thanks to these efforts, trade and investment with Korea, which plunged during the crisis, have recovered to prerecession levels: bilateral trade is one-quarter of a billion euros a year and is balanced.The minister said information communication technology, financial technology, finance, pharmaceutical, medical and nanotechnology sectors have potential for joint venture and research.By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","irish economy remarkable recovery ,the irish economy remarkable ,korea last week coinciding ,economy remarkable recovery ,irish economy remarkable","['irish', 'the European Union', 'Brendan Howlin', 'Irish', 'Korea', 'the St. Patrick ’s Day']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65284079  0.78604209

Some estimates have said size of prospective projects to be pursued by Middle East countries could reach as high as $750 billion won over the long haul.""By forging close ties and meeting specific development demands, South Korea could generate a new growth momentum for itself,"" said the finance ministry, which coordinates economic policies. The foremost plan is for South Korean companies to move up the value added chain in the overseas industrial plant sector with the goal of securing at least $70 billion in fresh orders this year and $80 billion in 2016.Last year, South Korean builders won $66 billion worth of orders abroad with the bulk of the mega projects coming from the Middle East.""Emphasis will be on greatly increasing financial support for local builders so they can engage in so-called investment development projects,"" Deputy Finance Minister Jeong Eun-bo said.Such projects require the builder to become an investor in the project, allowing it to partake in earnings and play a role in management instead of just acting as building contractors.The government will earmark an extra 5 trillion won ($4.43 billion) in funds to help local companies secure such projects. It will get financial institutions to set aside 300 billion won worth of ""joint loan guarantees"" that will mainly go to helping small and medium-sized builders. Lenders will make available 1 trillion won worth of indirect lending to all companies wanting to expand abroad.There will also be larger credit lines and multilateral development bank loans that can be used to win orders.Notable projects include two or more System-integrated Modular Advanced Reactors in Saudi Arabia that would invigorate South Korea's atomic energy exports that have made slow progress in the past few years. The SMART plan could also permit South Korea and the Middle East kingdom to jointly export the reactor to other countries. The reactors have one-tenth the output of conventional commercial power plants, with many countries considering such units.Besides construction and plant exports, the government said it will meet the steadily rising demand for halal foods, whose global market reached $1.08 trillion in 2012 and is expected to grow to $1.62 trillion in 2018, roughly 17.4 percent of the global total.Halal foods refer to products consumed by Muslims under Sharia law that are prepared in a specific way according to Islamic customs.""As of last year, South Korean firms shipped out $680 million worth of halal products, but it aims to increase this by setting up a specialized production complex that can better allow supervision,"" the official said. The goal is to export $1.23 billion worth of halal foods in 2017.The government said it will also hone in on expanding ties in the service sector through at least 150 billion won in funds to support health and medical related projects in the second half of this year. Medical services are promising because Middle East countries have far smaller numbers of doctors per capita than other countries and one-tenth the number of hospital beds compared with South Korea. For cultural contents, a 200 billion won fund will be created to promote joint projects.For foreign investment, the government said the goal for 2015 was to attract at least one service-oriented investment region in the country while drastically slashing existing restrictions to attract more investments. In the past, foreign direct investments have been centered on manufacturing.The government plans to incorporate 14 new service businesses as being eligible for tax breaks.Related to FDI, the finance ministry said the Saemangeum reclamation region in the southeastern part of the country will become a special development project with various incentives to overseas investors.The region, covering 409 square kilometers of land, is idyllically situated across the Yellow Sea to be used as a launching base for companies interested in selling products to or operating in China.""The region will be given favors in the hiring of foreign workers and immigration rules, as well as a host of financial benefits and easing of building and development rules,"" Jeong said.The government will ease requirements for permanent residence visas for foreigners who work in key research and development fields, the official said.At present, such visas are given only if a person resides in the country for five years, but this may be lowered to three.The easing of rules can encourage immigration of highly qualified workers, especially since the country's population growth is slowing down.The government hopes that closer ties with the Middle East will help South Korean nationals find more work abroad. In 2014, some 5,000 workers were sent abroad, with the goal to double the number by 2017.Deputy Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan said after the meeting that dispatching of workers to the Middle East is promising because these countries already rely extensively on outsiders for its industrial sectors.""These countries can become an outlet for South Korean job seekers with skills in nuclear power generation, IT and medical expertise,"" the policymaker said.The industry ministry said it plans to spend some 12.4 trillion won on safety infrastructure projects in 2015, with money going to improving safety standards and into the development of cutting-edge technologies.""Because locally built reactors, as well as other plants, will be going online, such facilities can hire South Korean safety workers, which can help with employment,"" said Park Chung-won, deputy minister of industrial policy.Large local companies will invest some 3 trillion won, or 700 billion won more on-year, in safety technology this year, aiming to export some of the technology and know-how to the Middle East and Southeast Asia.

The minor collision involved a Lamborghini Gallardo, which is priced at over 400 million won on the local market, and Renault Samsung’s large sedan SM7.In the accident, the SM7, driven by a welding technician at a local shipyard, rear-ended the parked Lamborghini. The resulting damage was estimated to cost 140 million won to repair.“The accounts of the drivers of the Lamborghini and the SM7 did not match, and when a former detective and insurance staff looked into the incident, it was revealed that the accident was staged,” an official with Dongbu Insurance Co., SM7 owner’s insurance provider, told the local media.The insurance official also said the two drivers have admitted to staging the accident, and that the company is considering filing charges against them.The police, however, can investigate insurance fraud cases without complaints being filed, and the Geoje police plans to launch an investigation.Despite the authorities’ efforts to clamp down on the related irregularities, insurance fraud has been on the rise in Korea, coming in at more than 500 billion won in 2013. The figure stood at 453.3 billion won in 2012 and at 423.6 billion won in 2011.

Some of the deals have been cited as bad decisions.According to Chaebul.com, a website that tracks activities of large conglomerates, POSCO spent over 7 trillion won in 11 cases of stake investments and M&As; during the five-year period. One of them is Daewoo International that cost the steelmaker 3.4 trillion won for a 60.3 percent stake. Market analysts say the price was about 1 trillion won higher than the stake's face value. Daewoo International has since been a headache for POSCO due to its relatively low profitability. Incumbent chairman Kwon Oh-joon reportedly considered selling the stakes, but the company's circumstances has recently rebounded on successful development of gas fields in Myanmar.Another company under scrutiny is POSCO M-Tech, an affiliate that deals in various metal products and materials development. The company suffered from what has been described as the failed takeover of firms ailing in profitability. The takeover took its toll on POSCO M-Tech, which has logged losses since 2013. During Chung's five-year term, POSCO's operating profit ratio plunged from 17 percent to 5 percent, while its debt ballooned from 9 trillion won to 14 trillion won. Some suspect that Chung's business decisions were motivated to pander to the government's push for the so-called energy diplomacy, a key policy agenda of the then-President Lee Myung-bak to secure natural resources from around the world.""Those M&As; seem to be in line with the stepped-up government-led energy diplomacy. Decisions have been made business-wise, but many of those takeovers appear to have been based on political considerations,"" Kim Yong-jin, an economics professor of Seogang University, told Yonhap.""POSCO should have focused more on its core business, which is steelmaking, not on such resources projects.""But there are reasons why POSCO heeds to politics.Previously state-owned, the steelmaker was privatized in 2000.Appointments of the conglomerate's chairmen are still understood as heavily influenced by the government. The change of management has more to do with the inauguration of new administrations than company business or the term of CEOs. Often, the heads of POSCO were jailed after stepping down on various corruption charges.Experts blame POSCO's business environment as having led to the current prosecution investigation, as well as the group's gloomy financial conditions.They said that the checkered company history will not be fundamentally resolved unless the environment changes.Chung took charge of POSCO with the support of close aides to the then-President Lee in 2009. Many assumed that he would not be free from government pressure in managing the conglomerate. His second-term was cut short after the current Park Geun-hye government was inaugurated in February 2013.On the bright side, the market does not see the ongoing investigation as seriously hurting POSCO's business plans for the future, although there would be some stains on the company's image. ""It could hurt its global image by giving an impression that the company has some kind of connections with politics. Some short-term investors might shun POSCO shares on worries that it could face penalties as a result of the investigation,"" said Jeon Seung-hun, an analyst at KDB Daewoo Securities Co.""But given that POSCO is not seeking to increase its business size but restructure itself, the investigation could rather serve as a impetus that could accelerate the pace of the reform drive.""Last month, POSCO told investors that it will reduce investment and seek to sell assets deemed unnecessary to its core business this year as part of restructuring efforts. POSCO Chairman Kwon Oh-joon said that the company will strengthen its financial soundness by securing some 1 trillion won this year through planned corporate restructuring, such as affiliate sales.

265,265,S.

The seasonally adjusted jobless rate also rose 0.5 percentage point, from 3.4 percent to 3.9 percent.   There were some 1.2 million people without jobs, compared to 988,000 the month before.  The latest rate is the highest since February 2010. The statistical office said seasonal factors usually cause numbers to rise in the month.  ""February is a month when students are on school break and when people graduate, so it invariably affects unemployment numbers,"" said Sim Won-bo, head of the agency's employment statistics division. Unemployment is calculated by the number of people who want jobs but have been unable to find employment.  Sim said that while unemployment has risen, so have the number of jobs and the total number of people with jobs.   The job market had improved unusually for the better in February 2014, adding 835,000 jobs, and the employment rate managed to increase in February this year as well, gaining 376,000 positions, a strong sign of the state of the job market, the official said. Last month's number is higher than the 347,000 jobs created in January.   Sim also pointed out that national employment numbers topped 25.19 million last month, the highest reading for February since the government started keeping monthly employment statistics in July 1982.  The unemployment rate for young people between 15 and 29 measured at 11.1 percent in February, up significantly from 9.2 percent a month earlier. The February figure for the age group represents the highest monthly tally since corresponding data began to be compiled in 2000, and is the 18th consecutive monthly increase.  The labor underutilization indicator hit 12.5 percent last month, the highest reading since the government started checking such data last May.  This indicator is based on guidelines made by the International Labor Organization and reflects the number of people who are ""underemployed"" and those who currently hold part-time jobs but want full-time work.   It also counts unemployed people who have given up looking for work not by choice but due to circumstances, which makes them potential job seekers. A rise in this number is an indication that employment conditions felt by ordinary people are worse than what official jobless figures show.   The agency started to provide the indicator to provide a more accurate picture of the country's labor market situation.  The finance ministry claimed that February showed a rise in both unemployment and the total number of jobs.  ""There is an upward momentum in the job market with manufacturing and services fueling growth and offsetting losses in the farming, fisheries and financial sectors,"" it said.  It argued that even while unemployment did rise, so did the employment rate for all people over 15 that stood at 58.8 percent, a 0.2 percentage point gain from a year earlier.  For the young job seekers, the ministry cited a ""mismatch"" between the large number of college graduates and a relatively lower number of positions available for such well-educated people.  About 70 percent of South Korean youths receive college education and above. This is much higher than 53 percent for Germany and 52 percent for Japan.  The job market is rigid, in part preventing the hiring of young people, and the government will try to push for labor market reforms and introduce hiring schemes that allow students to find work while still at school, the ministry said.  The government has been trying to introduce more flexibility into the job market by reducing the privileges of regular workers, while at the same time correcting low pay and the issue of less job security for non-regular workers.

The communist state continues to blast daily threats and slander against the South's Park Geun-hye government.  South Korea's National Red Cross had offered to send 25 tons of powdered milk for the malnourished children of North Korea last month, but Pyongyang quickly rejected the offer.  North Korea is believed to have suffered a chronic shortage of food since the late 1990s.

Beijing unveiled plans for the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank in October 2013, aiming to shore up the region’s development by financing projects in such sectors as energy, transportation, telecommunication and agriculture. Its establishment was officially announced last October with a 21-country membership and will likely wrap up by the end of this year. While acknowledging the need for more funding for revamping regional infrastructure, Seoul officials have been lukewarm on participation since China offered last year to bring the country on board as a founding member, due chiefly to the bank’s relatively obscure governance structure. Washington also opposes the program, which it sees as a challenge to the regional financial order. Adding to the quandary, the U.K. made a surprise announcement on Thursday to join the AIIB, inviting rare criticism from its longtime ally. It will be the first major Western economy to do so.“We believe any new multilateral institution should incorporate the high standards of the World Bank and the regional development banks,” said U.S. National Security Council spokesman Patrick Ventrell. “Based on many discussions, we have concerns about whether the AIIB will meet these high standards, particularly related to governance, and environmental and social safeguards.”Australia, which initially appeared skeptical about China’s proposal, also hinted at its possible participation following London. “Quite obviously China has improved the governance structure it is proposing for the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank,” Australian Treasurer Joe Hockey said in Sydney on Friday. New Zealand already applied for its own membership early this year. Other participants include India, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Uzbekistan, Pakistan and Vietnam.South Korea will need to make a decision in the coming weeks as China has apparently set the deadline for the end of March. The issue is likely to be on the agenda for talks on Monday with Deputy Foreign Minister Lee Kyung-soo and Beijing’s visiting Assistant Foreign Minister Liu Jianchao. Washington is expected to convey its own transparency concerns regarding the AIIB during a planned visit to Seoul by Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Russel that begins Tuesday. Some experts have criticized Seoul’s approach, saying it should have more actively weighed the pros and cons in line with its national interests rather than waiting to see how the the U.S.-China rivalry would develop. In the wake of the U.K. decision, South Korea’s leverage would inevitably be undercut and China’s say would grow in future negotiations, they point out.“It is extraordinary that the U.K. would join the AIIB without preconditions at a time when Australia and South Korea are engaged in delicate diplomacy with Beijing on their engagement with the bank,” wrote Thomas Wright, director of the project on international order and strategy at the Brookings Institution in Washington. “It puts Asian democracies on the back foot and helps Beijing in these negotiations. It sends a message that China can set the rules unilaterally and Britain will follow.” Yet he also blamed the U.S. for its “confused and contradictory” approach to the AIIB, calling Washington to move beyond obstructionism and figure out a better strategy for dealing with Beijing’s competitive economic diplomacy. “This includes working constructively to shape institutions of Chinese origin and figuring out which institutions really endanger a stable regional order in East Asia,” Wright added.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","bank south korea dilemma ,opposition beijing unveiled plans ,seoul dilemma deepening over ,dilemma deepening over china ,the 50 billion mechanism","['South Korea ’s', 'China', 'U.K.', 'U.S.', 'Beijing', 'the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.11629967  0.30503866

According to the Korea Labor Institute, the net replacement rate of the Korean elderly reached 45.2 percent as of 2011, about 10 percent lower than the average rate of countries in the Organization for Economic Corporation and Development. The net replacement rate is to the level of the post-retirement pension income compared to personal income before retirement. A number of international labor-related organizations have recommended that countries keep the net replacement rate at around 70 to 80 percent to ensure elderly welfare. Among the 34 OECD countries, only four countries had lower rates than Korea: Japan, New Zealand, Ireland and the U.K. Elderly men sit on steps at Tapgol Park in Jongno district, Seoul. (Bloomberg)Korea had the highest elderly poverty rate in the OECD. The proportion of Korean over-65s in poverty was 48.6 percent, double the figure of Switzerland, which was second on the list. Israel and Chile followed next, with 20.6 percent and 20.5 percent, respectively. The report also estimated that 74 percent of elderly Koreans who were in poverty lived alone. As of 2014, Korea had some 6.4 million senior citizens, accounting for 15.1 percent of the population. This is 3.8 percent higher than that of 2012, the institute said.Of these, only about 31 percent or some 2 million were employed, the institute added. At the same time, the increasing growth rate of the elderly population was at the fastest pace with 4.1 percent, along with Germany and the U.S. Japan, Germany and Italy have older populations than Korea with over 20 percent over the age of 65, while Mexico, Turkey and Chile had less than 10 percent, the report added. “When the baby boomers retire soon, the elderly poverty problem will be much more noticeable amid the record-high elderly poverty rate with relatively low pension income,” said a KLI researcher. “A change in the Korean labor market is needed in order to accept those elderly employees.” By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","the least generous pension ,korean elderly reached 45 ,poor by low pension ,low pension payments south ,least generous pension systems","['South Korea', 'the Korea Labor Institute', 'korean', 'the Organization for Economic Corporation and Development']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44025138 -0.09021752

The 678-megawatt reactor had run for commercial use for 30 years before that.Two environmental civic groups including Friends of the Earth Korea said South Korea approved the extension without reevaluating the reactor's safety according to the standards used by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The last evaluation was conducted 33 years ago, the groups said.""The government should re-assess whether to extend the life of the nuclear reactor by considering its safety, public views towards it, and economic viability,"" Suh Kune-yull, a Seoul National University nuclear engineering professor said. ""If the overall assessment is negative, there's no need to re-activate the reactor.""Yang Iwon-young, an environmental activist, said the Wolsong-1 has not passed the stress test as President Park Geun-hye promised during her election campaign.""We will see if the government remembers the lesson from the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011,"" she said.In a controversial decision on Feb. 27, the Nuclear Safety and Security Commission extended the operation of the Wolsong-1 nuclear reactor until 2022, drawing strong opposition from residents and environmental groups over its safety.South Korea has 23 nuclear reactors in operation, from which it currently gets about 30 percent of its electricity supply. The resource-poor country is building several more as its industries rely heavily on imported energy.

This accounts for 47.3 percent of the total direct investment in the capital. While direct investment from China remained about the same at $63 million as in 2013, detour investment via Singapore and Hong Kong played a major role in the surge, officials said. High anticipation over the free trade agreement between the two countries also contributed to the hike, they added.However, there was a decline in investment from other regions, partly due to overseas economic problems, the report said.Direct investment from European countries plummeted to 1.3 billion, down 53.7 percent from 2013. Investment from the U.S. also fell to 1.6 billion won, dropping 8.3 percent on-year. As a result, the overall foreign direct investment in the capital fell to about $5.5 billion, showing a 10.7 percent decrease, the report said.A total of 59 countries made investments in Seoul, with an average of $6.5 million, it said. Among them, the U.S. was the largest contributor with about $955 million, followed by Singapore and Japan, with $951 million and $714 million, respectively.By industry type, 84 percent of the foreign investors flocked to the service sector, which includes the finance, insurance and distribution markets. The rest invested in manufacturing, the city said. While the overall investment in the service sector declined by about 20 percent to $4.5 billion, the financial injection in the manufacturing business sharply grew by about 144 percent to $877 million, it added.

Although no cases of Ebola have been reported in countries near North Korea, the Pyongyang regime had closed its borders to foreign tourists and imposed a strict 21-day quarantine on all people, including diplomats, entering the country, since last October. North Korea's state-run airline, Air Koryo, told Uri Tours that the North's travel restrictions were lifted as of Monday.""We have been informed by Air Koryo that North Korea's borders are now open for travel and the 4-month-long Ebola travel ban was lifted as of Monday, March 2,"" the company said in a statement posted on its website. ""According to Air Koryo, everything is back to normal,"" it said. Uri Tours said it is waiting for further confirmation from its partners in Pyongyang as to when its tour programs to North Korea can resume. North Korea's frantic measures against Ebola appear to highlight concerns that it could pose a direct threat to the regime's survival if the virus crossed into the North, South Korea's spy agency told lawmakers last month. It is not the first time that North Korea has closed its borders because of a deadly disease. In 2003, the North closed its borders for several months due to the spread of the SARS virus.

The massive participation of Korean companies reflects the significance of her trip, which comes when the Gulf nations are attempting to diversify their business portfolio to prepare for the post-oil era, the presidential office said. In the past, the Middle East was a business destination for energy and construction companies, but the region is increasingly opening new markets for a wide range of other industries, including information technology, medical services and renewable energy.“To prepare for the post-oil era, the Gulf nations are building nuclear power plants and (investing) in a wide range of sectors including health, medical and ICT,” she said. “That is what matches well with us.”Park is set to hold summits with leaders of four nations -- Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar -- to expand cooperation in a wide range of fields including business, security and culture.In Kuwait, Park plans to hold a summit with the emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah to discuss ways to increase bilateral cooperation the in energy, construction, railroad, medical and IT sectors.

Such households have to rely on borrowing to make ends meet, which can lead to considerable social and financial risks down the line.  A drop in the number of such households would generally be viewed as positive, but watchers say if this is due to less spending, it would adversely affect economic growth. It also means a deterioration of living standards broadly reflects the aging of the country's population. An older population generally spends less and saves more than younger people.  Last year, South Korea's household disposable income rose 3.5 percent, exceeding the 2.8 percent growth in spending.  ""In effect, people spent less even though they made more money, which can be a sign that they have little confidence in the economy and want to save up to deal with uncertainties,"" a researcher at a local think tank said.  In particular, among the lowest 20 percent of income earners, the ratio of deficit households stood at 46.5 percent. This is still way above the average but represents a sharp 5.2 percentage point improvement from the year before.  Figures showed disposable income for such households rose 7.4 percent last year but spending was down 0.1 percent.  The deficit rate for the second-lowest income-earning households reached 26.1 percent for a 0.6 percentage point improvement. This too is the lowest deficit ratio for the income bracket.  For families in the second-highest income level, the deficit ratio edged down 0.5 percentage point to 12.6 percent, the lowest reached since 12.5 percent in 2005.  On the other hand, the ratio of deficit households for middle income families moved up 2.6 percentage points to 17.1 percent. For the top 20 percent income group, the ratio rose 1.1 percentage points to 7.6 percent.

The country's key policy rate currently stands at a record low of 2 percent.   The Korea Housing Finance Corp. will issue mortgage-backed securities to fund the new loans.  The size and soundness of household borrowing has come under serious question as the amount has ballooned while the country's economy has yet to show definitive signs of picking up. A fourth-quarter tally from the Bank of Korea released on Thursday said household credit, which includes credit purchases and loans from financial institutions, marked its sharpest quarterly gain since the central bank started keeping data in the fourth quarter of 2004.  Outstanding household loans reached 1,029.3 trillion won at the end of December, spiking 27.6 trillion won from the previous quarter and accounting for most of the quarterly increase in household credit. The figure passed the 1,000 trillion won mark for the first time in the third quarter last year.  Of total family loans extended by banks, mortgage-backed loans accounted for 70 percent as of end-December.    The pace of gains in household credit has sped up since August, when the government eased rules on mortgage loans to stimulate the sagging property market. The central bank chipped in by lowering its policy rate twice in the second half of the year.  The prevalent view of policymakers is that while the loans are high in numbers, they have not yet hit a dangerous level.  Experts, however, say they have and that stopgap measures would not solve the problem.  ""The authorities acknowledge that household debt is risky and is a time bomb for the South Korean economy,"" Park Chang-kyun, a professor at Chung-ang University, said. ""But it's just a political metaphor to say that household debt can be controlled.""  ""The government has lifted loan-related regulations and induced people to get more loans beyond their ability to repay. It should have taken actions first to prevent excessive credit,"" said Yeom Myung-bae, professor at Chungnam National University. ""It's more urgent to come up with effective measures to force borrowers to repay the debts.""     The FSC said that the new loan schemes are aimed at changing the structure of mortgage loans and placing the household debts under control.  ""We are supporting households to deal with a possible rate hike in the future at home and abroad, and build an environment for them to pay off debts in the end,"" the FSC said.  Most of the home-backed bank loans are non-amortized loans, requiring debtors to pay back the lump sum principal upon maturity. Such loans are heavily susceptible to changing interest rates.  Earlier, FSC Chairman Shin Je-yoon said restructuring of household debt is a top priority for financial stability in 2015, and he will do his best to improve the quality of household debts.

The figure marks a 52 percent plunge from the record high of 136.4 kg posted in 1970.  South Korea has also liberalized its rice market with tarrification at the beginning of the year, though imports under tarrification are currently subject to a tariff of 513 percent.  The 513 percent tariff rate still requires verification by the World Trade Organization while the country is required to import 408,700 tons of rice each year under a special arrangement with the WTO known as the minimum market access.  All 408,700 tons of imports under MMA are only subject to a tariff rate of 5 percent, keeping their prices significantly lower than those of locally produced crops.  ""Locally produced rice may appear to have little competitiveness in terms of price, especially in the global market, but its quality finds little competition anywhere in the world,"" said Kang Hye-young, head of the ministry's export promotion division.  In 2014, South Korea exported 1,992 tons of rice, worth $4.72 million, to 45 countries throughout the world. The amount marks a 13.6 percent on-year spike from 1,754 tons in 2013.  The country also shipped about $59.5 million worth of rice products, such as rice cake, last year, up 14 percent from a year earlier, according to the ministry.

More than 800 micrograms leads to a yellow dust warning.  People are advised to stay indoors when yellow dust advisories or warnings are in place. When going outside, they are advised to wear protective glasses and yellow-dust masks.  As of 4 a.m., Seoul's atmospheric concentration levels of ""particulate matter (PM)-10"" pollutants soared to 1,044 micrograms per cubic meter. This marks the worst yellow dust that has hit the peninsula during a winter season since Dec. 25, 2009, when the level recorded 963 micrograms.  PM-10 refers to airborne particles 10 micrometers or less in diameter. Epidemiological evidence indicates that exposure to such pollutants causes cardiac and respiratory problems, according to experts.   This also is the fourth highest level since the authorities began filing records for fine dust concentration.  Yellow dust warnings had previously been in place in Seoul five times -- in March 2002, April 2002, April 2006, December 2009 and November 2010.  Monday's yellow dust was the result of the combination of low precipitation and low pressure in the deserts in southern Mongolia and northern China where the dust mainly originates from as well as a strong northwesterly wind, the KMA said.  The weather office forecast that the yellow dust will gradually weaken starting in the afternoon. Light yellow dust is expected to continue in some areas until Tuesday, it added.

High winds whipped through the area. The civil defense officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there were no reports of deaths or injuries. The cause of the fire was not immediately clear.The Marina area is home to dozens of towering apartment blocks and hotels, many of them built over the past decade. The apartments are popular with Dubai's large number of expatriate professionals. Police blocked off areas around the Torch, which still had power. Lights were on in many of the apartments inside and multiple fire trucks and police vehicles were on the scene.Residents of at least one neighboring tower were told to evacuate as a precaution because of strong winds, but they were later allowed back inside. Two residents of the Torch said they were told the fire started around the 52nd floor. Flaming material falling from the initial fire then set a lower part of the building ablaze, they said. One of the residents, Steve Short, 53, of Liverpool, England, praised the work of firefighters who arrived quickly. He said fire alarms alerted residents to the blaze and building management sent workers knocking on doors to ensure residents got out. Resident R.J. Morlock, 33, of Houston, shot video on his phone that showed bright yellow flames reaching what appeared to be several stories on two separate parts of the building.  He said residents were nervous coming out but fire crews were able to bring the situation under control. ""I was really surprised they got it under control pretty quickly,"" he said. ""It looked like it was going to go up.""The Torch opened in 2011 and is one of the world's tallest residential towers, according to developer Select Group.","caught fire early saturday ,in flames dubai united ,residential towers caught fire ,in flames dubai ,district in flames dubai","['DUBAI', 'United Arab Emirates', 'AP', 'Dubai', 'Torch']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.8254838   0.22469003

Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) saying in its latest assessment that the North's food production is estimated at 5.94 million tons in 2014, compared to the 5.93 million tons in 2013-2014.That represents the highest level since the North's economic collapse in the mid-1990s.Experts on North Korea's agricultural sector have said that the increase in the country's food production is attributable to agricultural reform measures that center on allowing farmers to keep at least one third of their harvests.""The FAO assessment of North Korean food production is consistent with anecdotal reports that North Korea has made productivity improvements in recent years and that the North Korean economy is stable if not growing slowly,"" Snyder said in an article on the CFR's website.""This means that North Korea's two-pronged policy of simultaneous economic and nuclear development is showing some modest results on the economic side. The problem is that the nuclear priority remains in place and North Korea's efforts to develop missile and nuclear programs continue to proceed unchecked,"" he said.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has made the so-called ""Byeongjin"" policy one of the country's biggest goals, pledging to rebuild the moribund economy while forging ahead with its nuclear program. South Korea, the United States and other nations have claimed the policy is a nonstarter, saying the North cannot rebuild its economy as long as it holds on to its nuclear ambitions. American officials have often said the North ""can't have its cake and eat it, too.""""North Korea's apparent economic progress is bad news for those who expect increased sanctions to be decisive in driving North Korea to make a strategic choice to give up its nuclear weapons,"" Snyder said. ""Under current circumstances, there is nothing to stop North Korea from having its cake and its yellowcake, too.""  Yellowcake, a type of uranium concentrate powder, is used in the preparation of uranium fuel for nuclear reactors.

""They said they would design my face to look like a South Korean, and help me design a new nose, lips and chin, but (afterwards) when my friends saw my nose they were all shocked. They said it was crooked (and) ugly,"" Chen said.Seoul on Friday announced a crackdown on illegal brokers and unregistered clinics in a bid to protect medical tourists, especially those drawn by the country's huge plastic surgery industry.The country is a cultural powerhouse in Asia -- its soap operas and pop music videos are massively popular in China and often feature cosmetically-enhanced stars.While China's domestic plastic surgery market is worth tens of billions of dollars, persistent safety concerns are driving growing numbers of wealthy consumers abroad.South Korea has pushed hard to foster its so-called ""medical tourism"" industry, which was worth the equivalent of nearly $360 million in 2013, according to official figures.China topped the medical tourist list with more 25,400 visitors, an increase of 70 percent from the previous year, the South Korean health ministry said.Chinese tourists generally pay more than twice as much as locals for cosmetic procedures, Chinese newspaper Southern Weekly reported this month.Dozens of South Korean clinics have Chinese-language websites, some offering surgery alongside sightseeing vacations, with promotions offered during Chinese holidays.One clinic promises to provide ""almond shaped eyes"" and a ""magical V-shaped face"" -- considered the ideal of feminine beauty in much of East Asia, another is seemingly full of glowing testimonials from past patients.While most procedures in South Korea appear to occur without incident, last month attention focused on the industry after a 50-year-old Chinese woman was left in a coma by a clinic in Seoul's up-market Gangnam district.As much as a third of Chinese patients' costs can go towards fees for brokers who act as liaisons for the hospitals, Chen said after making initial enquiries she was contacted ""incessantly"" by an agent and felt cajoled into having the surgery.She spent more than $26,000 dollars on the surgery in 2010 at the Beauty Line clinic in Seoul. One of her procedures involved having cartilage taken from her chest and added to her nose to make it more prominent. But upon returning to China, she began to suffer from nasal infections. Now staying at a clinic in Beijing she says her mental health suffered and she is taking 12 antidepressants each day.""I've lost sleep, I can't meet with friends, and I suffer from depression, because my nose is just too ugly,"" she said.""I feel tricked. I think the industry is protected by (South Korea's) government, because its a key source of revenue,"" she added.Park Ji-Hye, an official at South Korea's health ministry, told AFP that ""activities involving illegal brokers and inflated fees, as well as disputes over malpractice, are sparking complaints from foreign patients"".Hoping to bring the industry into line, authorities last Friday declared owners of unregistered facilities treating foreign patients could be punished with jail sentences.""Some clinics are treating Chinese patients without a state license allowing them to treat foreign patients, because obviously that's where the money is,"" said Cho Soo-Young, spokesman of the association of Korean plastic surgeons.Back in China, an online support group made up of hundreds of victims of alleged botched cosmetic procedures conducted in South Korea, has begun a campaign to highlight the problems.""You start to believe that cosmetic surgery is something magical that can change your life. We have to take some responsibility ourselves, for not understanding the industry, and being too trusting."" said group organiser Jin Weikun.But many women in the group added that clinics had not warned them of potential risks. Winnie Wang, 45, said she was ""devastated, cried and even attempted suicide"" after an operation in 2013 left her with unequally sized eyes.Yu Lijun, a designer, underwent one of the most controversial procedures at Seoul's Faceline clinic -- ""double-jaw"" surgery -- which involves cutting the bone to produce a slimmer jawline. Today her mouth is visibly misaligned, making it hard to eat and prompting her to wear a facemask at all times.Mi Yuanyuan, a Chinese actress, said a 2013 operation at the same clinic left her with regular pain in her nose, as well as numbness and hair-loss on her forehead.""They said there weren't any risks,"" the 38-year-old said. ""They said the surgeon was as famous as the Hermes bag I was carrying.""But Faceline disputed this saying Yu had been through two botched surgeries in China that had left her mouth crooked before coming to them for help fixing it. ""We sent Yu back several times because the risk was too big but eventually decided to treat her after her repeated pleas for weeks,"" the clinic said in a statement, adding that she did not follow post-surgery care instructions.It also said Mi had signed a pre-surgery statement acknowledging potential side effects to her procedures.Beauty Line, which is licensed to treat foreign patients, said it could not locate the file of a patient named Chen Yili, as its records are in Korean and do not contain patients' names in Chinese. The company did not return calls from AFP after being contacted by a reporter with proof of Wang's history at the clinic.   (AFP)","south korea chinese businesswoman ,cosmetic tourists reap regret ,chinese cosmetic tourists reap ,korea booming medical tourism ,chinese cosmetic tourists","['chinese', 'Chen Yili', 'south korean', 'chinese', ""South Korea 's""]",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.71732616  0.45370555

Norway’s out-of-wedlock fertility rate was 55 percent, while Ireland’s was 64.1 percent in the same year. Meanwhile, Japan’s rate was 2.2 percent. “South Korea and Japan are countries where most people do not choose to have children unless they are married,” said researcher Cho Sung-ho from KIHASA.“This is why marriage is a very important factor in the countries’ fertility rates.”The number of Koreans who put off marriage has increased dramatically. According to Statistics Korea, 50.2 percent of Korean men born between 1976 and 1980 were single for the period of 2006 to 2010, while only 13.9 percent of those born between 1956 and 1960 were single when they were the same age.On the other hand, only 5.3 percent of Korean women born from 1956 to 1960 were single in their early 30s, while 29.1 percent of those born from 1976 to 1980 were unmarried at the same age. One of the main reasons many here are delaying their marriage is the high cost of housing and weddings. According to the local wedding consulting firm Duowed, Korean couples spent an average of 238 million won ($216,000) on their wedding ceremonies and housing in the past two years. On average, men shouldered 64 percent of the total cost. Cho mentioned in his report that modern South Korean demographics ― a low fertility rate and an aging society ― are similar to those experienced by Japan. According to Cho, about 20 percent of all Japanese men, and 10 percent of Japanese women, were single as of 2010. “Japan’s two-decade-long period of economic stagnation resulted in a growing number of people who chose to live alone,” he said. “As the South Korean economy is expected to experience slow growth, we may be following in Japan’s footsteps.”According to Cho, Japan tries to help young, single job seekers find jobs as part of its measures to boost its fertility rate. South Korea’s demographic policies, on the other hand, have mostly focused on married couples who do not have children.“It is necessary to support young people so they can experience dating, marriage and childbirth without too many difficulties,” Cho wrote. “In order to do that, creating quality jobs and support programs for job seekers must be introduced as part of measures to tackle the country’s low fertility rate.”South Korea’s birthrate stood at 1.18 children per woman last year ― the lowest among OECD member countries. If the current birth rate remains steady, almost 15 percent of the population will be 65 or older by 2018, and the figure will rise to 50 percent by 2100, according to KIHASA.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","fertility rate south korea ,delayed marriages drag down ,down fertility rate south ,delayed marriages drag ,marriages drag down fertility","['South Korea ’s', 'Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs', 'South Korea', 'Ireland', 'Norway', 'Norway']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.70207614 -0.02643035

Their aggregate quota is set at 1.598 billion tons over the next three years, and involves 84 firms in the petrochemicals sector.According to market insiders, the Korean Petrochemical Industry Association is fine-tuning the class action lawsuit with its members, including LG Chem, Lotte Chemical and Hanwha Chemical.The Environment Ministry, which has the dual task of placating local businesses and pushing for coordination with the international community, is set to take stern countermeasures against the industry backlash.Environment Minister Yoon Seong-kyu was quoted by a news provider as saying that “the business sector has no choice but to bolster its fundamentals if it seeks to put up with global pressure.”Yoon has made it clear that the government would not acknowledge the petitions as they “go against the global standards,” according to the media interview.Petrochemical companies are expressing discontent over the “buy and sell” scheme for CO2 emissions rights, which was set up at the main bourse Korea Exchange. “When any company purchases 1 ton of emission rights for 10,000 won on the trading market, it will have a burden of 260 billion won ($236 million) for three years,” said a business lobby executive.Since the market kicked off on Jan. 12, a business that emits less than the cap is entitled to sell the excess amount on the Korea Exchange, while a higher emitter is allowed to buy the rights.The trading performance has been sluggish so far. Over the past month, deals were carried out only on four trading sessions, and there has been no trading between Jan. 19 and Feb. 10.South Korea, one of the world’s top 15 greenhouse gas emitters, announced in 2009 that it would reduce its emissions by 30 percent by 2020.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","emissions faces major legal ,challenges from local companies ,emissions caps the korean ,government policy to restrict ,over carbon emissions caps","['korean', 'the Ministry of Environment']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4511663   0.68282056

SUV sales rose 12 percent to more than 5.5 million. That was double the pace of the industry as a whole.Strong demand is likely to continue this year, says Jesse Toprak, president of Toprak Consulting Group. SUV sales may not see double-digit growth, since overall sales are expected to slow as the U.S. market nears a peak of 17 million vehicles. But SUVs should still outpace sales of cars, Toprak says.Small SUVs like the Honda CR-V have been the fastest growing segment in the market for the last three years. They appeal to both young families and aging Baby Boomers. Low interest rates, easing credit standards and new versions of popular models like the Jeep Cherokee and Subaru Outback have also fueled demand.More recently, low gas prices helped boost sales of bigger SUVs like the Chevrolet Tahoe and Lincoln Navigator. Last June, when gas prices peaked at $3.76 per gallon, SUV sales made up 33 percent of new vehicle sales, while small cars made up 20 percent, according to Ward’s AutoInfoBank. By December, when gas prices had fallen to $2.63, SUV market share rose to 35 percent, while small cars fell to 16 percent.Here are some of the SUVs debuting at the Chicago show, which opened to the public Saturday.General Motors is unveiling a refreshed Chevrolet Equinox small SUV. It’s the first update to the Equinox since it went on sale in 2010, and it should help the popular SUV compete with newer rivals until it gets an expected redesign in late 2017. The 2016 Equinox will have a larger, handsomer, chrome-accented grille and upgraded projector-beam headlamps; on higher trim levels, the headlamps are LEDs. A rear-view camera will be standard on all models. Blind spot detection and cross-traffic alert are new options. Inside, there’s a new standard 7-inch screen and an updated instrument panel. The Equinox has been a consistently strong seller despite its advancing age. Last year, Equinox sales rose 2 percent to 242,242, making it the fourth-best seller in the crowded small SUV market behind the Honda CR-V, Ford Escape and Toyota RAV4. The 2016 Equinox goes on sale this fall.The Kia Soul meets Jeep with the Trail’ster concept. Kia’s design team says this is a “near-future” look at an off-road version of its Soul wagon. It has a fully retractable canvas roof and integrated roof rack fittings with aluminum cross rails. It sits 2.5 inches higher than a standard Soul, for better off-road performance, and it’s fitted with eye-catching Pirelli snow tires. Under the hood is a turbocharged, 1.6-liter, four-cylinder engine with 185 horsepower and an electric all-wheel-drive system that can be switched on when needed, which helps improve fuel economy over the regular Soul. (AP)","suv sales rose 12 ,booming suv market gets ,booming suv market ,new entries detroit sport ,suv sales rose","['DETROIT', 'Americans', 'Kelley Blue Book']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.84209383  0.23172767

""We have received confirmation from our partners in Pyongyang that the Arirang Mass Games will not be taking place this year,"" Young Pioneer Tours, a China-based travel agency specialized in trips to the isolated North, said in a brief release posted on its website Saturday.The Arirang Mass Games are highly choreographed shows where tens of thousands of performers stage a spectacular display of acrobatics, gymnastics, dances and flip-card mosaic animations. Though the agency did not elaborate on reasons for the cancellation, the decision comes amid the North's strict quarantine measures against the Ebola epidemic. Apparently in a move to prevent the deadly virus from spreading into the country, North Korea has barred foreign tourists from visiting the nation since last October.""We have been working closely with our partners in North Korea in regards to when the current Ebola travel restriction will be lifted and tourism to the DPRK will resume as normal,"" the tour company said in a separate release. DPRK is the acronym of the North's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  Saying that it is expecting the borders ""to reopen very soon within the coming weeks,"" the company said ""other exciting and unique events"" will be held this year in the North such as the Pyongyang Marathon in April and the huge celebrations later this year of the 70th anniversary of Liberation Day and Party Foundation Day.After last taking place in 2013, the Arirang Mass Games were canceled last year without any official reasons, though observers speculate that it may have had to do with renovation work at the event venue the May Day Stadium, in Pyongyang, or possible preparations for new programs. With aims to extol its leaders and the socialist system, Pyongyang staged the extravaganza for the first time in 2002 and the second one in 2005. After canceling it in 2006 due to severe flood damage, the North had held the show on an annual basis since 2007, attracting foreign tourists.

The policy comes in apparent efforts to improve relations with Cuba following a recent breakthrough in the nation’s Cold War standoff with the U.S.Seoul’s Foreign Ministry clinched an agreement with the World Food Program for the three-year project on the sidelines of the agency’s executive board meeting in Rome on Tuesday. The organization made a proposal early last year in line with its “Zero Hunger” initiative. “The latest food security program has significance as our first ever development cooperation project with Cuba at the government level,” the ministry said in a statement.“We expect to make a meaningful contribution to Cuba’s economic and social development by distributing food to the underprivileged while helping the country lay the foundation to secure food self-sufficiency.” Cuba is one of the four countries with which South Korea has no official diplomatic relations, severed since Fidel Castro took power and established a communist government through the 1959 Cuban Revolution. The Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency runs a small office in the capital, currently. The Caribbean island country has instead nurtured a close partnership with Pyongyang. In July 2013, Panamanian authorities intercepted a North Korean vessel carrying arms from Cuba, which constituted a breach of U.N. Security Council resolutions.Yet Seoul has apparently been looking to rewrite the bilateral relationship after Washington made a historic move in December to end more than 50 years of hostility and restore ties with Havana.On Tuesday, Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said at the National Assembly that he will “pursue normalization of the relationship” with Cuba. With a major international book fair set to kick off in Havana this week, the ministry is sending a delegation of officials for the first time, alongside novelists and poets. Kim Dong-ki, director general for cultural affairs at the agency, is scheduled to discuss ways to expand cultural exchanges on Friday with Alfredo Ruiz Roche, director general for external relations at Cuba’s culture ministry. In November, the ministry also supplied $1 million worth of personal protective equipment to Cuban medical workers stationed in Sierra Leone and elsewhere through the World Health Organization to help fight the Ebola spread.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","provide cuba with million ,south korea said wednesday ,cuba following recent breakthrough ,cuba with million billion ,development aid to cuba","['South Korea', 'Cuba', 'central american', 'Cuba', 'the U.S.Seoul ’s', 'Foreign Ministry', 'the World Food Program']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.58424842  0.36366591

It, however, pointed out the productivity is only half as high, while working hours are among the longest in the 34-member group of developed market economies. ""Reforms are needed in part to boost the stocks of inward foreign direct investment, which is the second lowest in the OECD area,"" the report said.Improving the efficiency of the tax codes by relying more on indirect value-added tax (VAT) such as taxes levied for environmental protection and assets would benefit growth, while at the same time ease budgetary pressure associated with rapidly rising social spending, it said. South Korea has the second lowest VAT in the OECD.The organization also pressed for keeping earned income tax rates low and urged for the dismantling of barriers that impede competition.""Phase out entry barriers for large firms from business lines reserved for small and medium enterprises, which are primarily in the service sector,"" it said.The latest findings, based on reviews of reforms measures implemented by all member states from 2013 onwards, claimed the country needs to break down its labor market duality to boost productivity and encourage more female employment. Labor market duality refers to the difference in pay and job security between regular and non-regular workers in the country.Specifically, the OECD argued South Korea needs to lessen protection for regular workers while enhancing rights and benefits for non-regular workers. It said more can be done to improve employment training programs.On greater female economic participation, it suggested encouragement of parental leave and flexible working arrangements, including more part-time jobs.There should be more affordable, high-quality childcare, it said.The international agency also said South Korea should further reduce farm import barriers and scale back the high level of support for the sector.Besides South Korea, the OECD said reforms undertaken by eurozone countries were losing traction, while those outside Europe, North America and Japan, were accelerating to meet various developments of late.It said all countries need to place key importance on improving labor productivity and build up their skills and knowledge-based capital that can lead to greater competitiveness.

While carrying out fund-raising campaigns, his team here will increase efforts to engage with the Korean public, which Ashworth described as having a “very strong sense of social justice and empathy.” “Our concentration in the early years will be to be self-sustaining; engage with the public on our issues and on our humanitarian work, for example, and hoping that we are well supported with people’s generosity,” he said in an email interview with The Korea Herald. Ashworth, who was previously in charge of corporate partnerships at Oxfam, stressed the significance of cooperation with the private sector in promoting good practices and tackling common tasks, yet vowed to remain as a “critical friend.” “We would never exist to serve the interests of multinationals, but engage with the right ones at the right time; those who are open to progressive policies and practice,” he said. “So the future vision for me is one where we bring our experience to bear on relationships. Where we are a critical friend; prepared to represent vulnerable people first, appeal for changes to systems and structures that increase inequality but balance that with practical, innovative partnerships where we work with open-minded and progressive organizations and institutions on common challenges.”The U.K.-headquartered agency was born in 1942 and named after the Oxford Committee for Famine Relief formed by a group of Quaker intellectuals, social activists and University of Oxford academics to support refugees in Nazi-occupied Greece. Oxfam is seeking to play a vital role in the global decision-making system by helping create a level playing field and keeping vested interests in check, while supporting the underprivileged with fundamental needs. “On a day to day basis supporting poor communities with both their practical needs such as access to clean water and education and on a global stage with key institutions is where Oxfam adds most value ― combining two very different approaches of practical and systemic change into a cohesive vision,” Ashworth added. The group’s ties with Korea date back to the 1950-53 Korean War. It began its work in North Korea in 1997, providing food handouts on a yearly basis to poor rural communities and children in orphanages chiefly through its Hong Kong unit. It also supplied fertilizers, hand tractors and diesel fuel for agricultural rehabilitation in the impoverished country. “In 2012, Oxfam redesigned its program in North Korea, hoping to incorporate new elements beyond humanitarian response,” Ashworth said. “In the meantime, North Korean aid programs have recently been resumed by Oxfam Hong Kong.” At last month’s Davos forum in Switzerland, Oxfam drew the limelight by unveiling a report predicting that the richest 1 percent of the world’s population may own more than all the rest by 2016, if the trend goes unchecked. In Asia, longstanding discrimination against women and ethnic minorities has placed the region “at a crossroads,” Ashworth noted. Soaring inequality has also emerged as a hot potato in Korean society. Criticism is widespread over the lopsided relationship between family-owned conglomerates and their contractors. In December, a Korean Air executive, the daughter of the company’s chairman, enraged many Koreans for delaying a flight after being served nuts in a bag, not a bowl. “Asia’s phenomenal economic growth over the past two decades is a remarkable success story in the fight against poverty. However, this growth has also led to a sharp widening of the gap between rich and poor,” he said. “Limited economic opportunities and exclusion from political power can trap such groups at the bottom of the ladder. … I’m sure some of those messages resonate with Korea, to some extent domestically but more widely in the region.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","fighting poverty inequality oxfam ,office in seoul oxfam ,poverty inequality climate change ,new office in seoul ,fight poverty inequality climate","['Seoul', 'Oxfam', 'Chris Ashworth']",2,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.60476089  0.01929346

It is provided to those who file applications with the Korea Environment Corp. after registering their vehicles.The Environment Ministry had been pressured to scale back its spending on subsidies for eco-friendly hybrid vehicles by about 25 percent from its earlier plan, which may lead to a backlash from consumers and automakers.Though the ministry had planned to provide 40,000 retail buyers of hybrid cars with subsidies totaling 40 billion won in 2015, the National Assembly urged it to cut the total provision by 10 billion won to 30 billion won.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","rebound in oil prices ,sales set to surge ,korea saw the sales ,thursday as the global ,buyers will further expand",['the Ministry of Environment'],2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.77184039  0.73699629

The government has opposed such moves because they could adversely affect the business community and nip economic growth in the long run.  ""The government is in the process of meeting pledges on welfare by cutting spending and digging up the underground market whose actors have dodged paying their due,"" the policymaker stated.  He said that while critics view the cutting of various tax credits and relief as raising taxes, the government did not share this perception.   On the drop in corporate tax earnings last year, Choi said big companies such as Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motor Co. struggled at the time, which affected the amount collected.  The official, who doubles as deputy prime minister, defended the latest revision to the income tax rules that raised public furor as people filed year-end tax returns. The new scheme heavily cut tax refunds by eliminating some of the tax break categories. The government said it was designed to have people pay fewer taxes throughout the year and receive a smaller refund at the end of the year.  Choi said a special taskforce will look into all the problems that have cropped up and make any needed changes.   A complete assessment of different earnings brackets will be completed by March so that adjustments can be made, Choi said.  ""The plan is to reform the way withholding taxes are collected and to reduce complications involved in filing tax settlements in the future,"" the policymaker said.

This is the first time that the number of Chinese visitors surpassed that of Japanese. Travelers from the U.S. and Taiwan took the third and fourth spots with 6.5 percent and 6 percent, respectively, the report said. The institute also noted that the number of overall expat tourists has gradually increased over years, with an average annual increase of 12.9 percent. Last year, the figure reached 1.15 million. In terms of tourist destinations, the Myeong-dong shopping district attracted the most tourists with about 73 percent visiting, followed by Dongdaemun market and the National Palace, with 56.6 percent and 39.1 percent, respectively. More than half of shopping tourists went to Myeong-dong. Others shopped at local duty-free shops, Dongdaemun market and department stores, the institute said. Preferred shopping areas differed depending on nationality, it added. While the majority of Japanese tourists preferred to visit Myeong-dong for shopping, Chinese visitors chose duty-free shops. Nearly half of Arabic shoppers preferred Dongdaemun market whereas American, Canadian and Russian travelers picked department stores. On the other hand, Australian, English and German tourists went shopping the least, with around 30 percent from each country saying they did not visit the shopping districts.Meanwhile, neighborhoods around Hongdae, Coex and Gangnam Station saw a gradual rise in the number of foreign visitors, the report added.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","tourists comes from china ,of chinese visitors surpassed ,out of three tourists ,chinese visitors surpassed ,south korea is chinese","['South Korea', 'chinese', 'the Seoul Institute', 'chinese', 'Japanese', 'chinese', 'Japanese']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37163675  0.85747564

The plan is to work together on eco-friendly marine tourism measures with North Korea, and designate uninhabited islands as “Islands of Peace” where they can develop resources together.The ministry established an MOU with the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization and the Ministry of Unification in March, and agreed to support North Korea in cultural and farming developments.Seoul officials also discussed providing official developmental assistance for North Korea’s project on the Daedonggang River, which runs through Pyongyang. The North previously asked to join a Yellow Sea ecosystem preservation project, in which South Korea and China are collaborating.The Maritime Ministry also said that they would establish the third “Dokdo Use Plan for 2016-2020,” and continue their monitoring of the island grounds and research on the marine ecosystem, and support operational expenses on Dokdo ― such as accommodation for residents, management ships, a Dokdo museum and a 3-D promotional animation on the islets.Additionally, the ministry said it plans to submit a draft of the maritime jurisdiction management law at the National Assembly in June in order to systemize marine territory management.They will also carry out a demonstration project regarding phytoplankton, where they plan increase the cultivation facilities from 0.5 ha to 1 ha in order to develop environmentally friendly diesel technology for everyday use.The ministry also laid out plans for stronger safety measures, with plans to publicize the safety situation for accident-prone ships every quarter, and designate the safest ships as priority operators. There are also plans for marine traffic environmental assessment and guidelines for ship operations on major ship and oil tanker passageways. By Park Han-na and Sang Youn-joo(hnpark@heraldcorp.com) (sangyj@heraldcorp.com)","ocean tourism there needs ,fisheries ministry said thursday ,korea to develop marine ,asian tourists the ministry ,to attract asian tourists","['South Korea ’s', 'Maritime Affairs', 'Fisheries Ministry', 'North Korea', 'North Korea ’s', 'asian']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42408442  0.6084007

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (Yonhap)In the 2015 Index of Economic Freedom, released by the U.S.-based Heritage Foundation and the Wall Street Journal, the North was evaluated as the least economically free country in the world. The country ranked 178th ― right below Cuba ― getting a score of 1.3 with 100 being the perfect score. In the evaluation, South Korea ranked 29th with 71.5 points, classified as “mostly (economically) free.” Those with scores of 80 or higher are listed as “free.” Hong Kong with 89.6 points topped the list, followed by Singapore, New Zealand, Australia and Switzerland. The U.S. ranked 12th ― right above the U.K. ― with 76.2 points.Since the index was incepted in 1995, Pyongyang has remained at the bottom of the list. The index evaluates four policy areas affecting economic freedom: rule of law, limited government, regulatory efficiency and open markets. It also looks into 10 areas of freedom such as labor freedom, monetary freedom and trade freedom.In the 2014 Democracy Index released by the Economist Intelligence Unit, the research and analysis wing of the British magazine the Economist, North Korea ranked 167th ― the lowest level ― getting 1.08 points with 10 being the perfect score. The North has been at the bottom of the rankings seven times since 2006.With Asia’s average score being 3.65, far lower than the world’s average of 5.5, Japan ranked first in Asia with 8.08 points, followed by South Korea with 8.06 points. Norway topped the global list with 9.93 points, followed by Sweden, Iceland, New Zealand and Demark. The U.S. ranked 19th with 8.11 points. The Democracy index evaluates five major areas: electoral process and pluralism; civil liberties; the functioning of government; political participation; and political culture. The index categorizes countries into one of four types of regimes: full democracies, flawed democracies, hybrid regimes and authoritarian regimes. North Korea experts largely concur that such negative evaluations may not further raise political pressure on Pyongyang, given that the flow of information from outside is tightly controlled, and the regime has long resisted foreign values and norms.But in the long run, there could be some negative ramifications on the North’s efforts to shore up its moribund economy, as the indices have long underscored the unpredictability and opaque nature of the regime.“These indices are not slapping the North with sanctions or anything like that,” said Chang Yong-seok, senior researcher at the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies of Seoul National University.“But we can’t say that there would be no negative impact, given that these adverse evaluations could get in the way of the North pushing to attract foreign investments and expand development projects with other countries.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","north korea dictatorial ,world least democratic state ,highlighted north korea dictatorial ,north korea dictatorial state ,korea dictatorial state governance","['North Korea ’s', 'Pyongyang']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.7232098   0.43268126

G Market, another online retailer, saw an on-year increase of 56 percent over the last two weeks. Sales of CCTV cameras are surging amid a series of child abuse scandals. (Yonhap)The fad is likely to have been touched off by nationwide concerns about child safety, touched off by a recent incident a day care center in Songdo, Incheon, where a worker beat a 4-year-old for not finishing her food. “It is not uncommon for a social issue to affect sales, but this particular case has even larger ramifications given that it’s related to children’s safety. We are seeing sales increase to not only institutions, but individual customers as well,” said an Auction official.An increasing number of individual consumers purchased surveillance cameras that they could install in their homes and link to their smartphones, which allowed them to keep an eye on their children while at work. Auction said it had sold two to six times more of these “network” surveillance cameras in the past two weeks.According to the Justice Ministry, the number of child abuse cases in Korea has been on the rise. Monthly reported cases went from 1,038 in 2013 to 1,416 in 2014, an increase of over 30 percent.Policymakers held a ministerial-level meeting to discuss possible measures to reduce child abuse, such as toughening requirements for child care workers and ensuring stern punishment for abusers. The meeting was presided over by Hwang Woo-yea, the education minister and deputy prime minister for social affairs.“Child abuse is a serious crime that must be rooted out in our society. Authorities must sternly enforce punishment of perpetrators and the facilities they are affiliated with,” Hwang said at the meeting, also attended by the ministers of justice, welfare, gender equality and family, at the Korea Childcare Promotion Institute. National Police Agency Chief Kang Sin-myeong was also present, as was Yoo Jeong-bok, mayor of Incheon.After the Incheon incident, officials vowed series of measures against child abuse such as a “one strike” system, in which a day care center would be shut down after a single case of child abuse and the head of the facility would be permanently banned from holding similar jobs. The ministers attending Saturday’s meeting agreed on mandatory installation of closed circuit television cameras at all day care centers and pushing for tougher punishment of perpetrators. They also discussed the possibility of holding personality tests for all child care workers and implementing character education courses for future workers, as part of the effort to require higher qualifications for child care workers.Another issue discussed at Saturday’s meeting was the relatively poor working conditions of child care workers, which some experts have said to be an underlying cause of the abuse cases. The average monthly salary for day care center workers in Cheonju, North Chungcheong Province, ranged from 1.1 million won to 1.5 million won ($1,000-$1,400), according to the city government. The legal minimum monthly salary for 2014 was 1.09 million won, based on minimum wage and a 40-hour work week. Minister Hwang said the government must apply tougher job requirements for child care facilities, but at the same time needs to “improve the working conditions (of child care workers) so they can put all their efforts into taking care of children.“Some 20 issues were discussed at the meeting, which will be reviewed at respective ministries. We’ll hold another ministerial-level meeting in early February, where we will announce comprehensive countermeasures (for child abuse).” By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","sees cctv purchases surge ,mall auction showed sunday ,cctv purchases surge amid ,cctv purchases surge ,child abuse outrage sales","['CCTV', 'Auction', 'CCTV', 'G Market']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.14435373  0.10336124

Accordingly to her forecast, tourists would account for about 65 percent, or 15 million, of the expected 23 million visitors in 2020.The proportion of Asian tourists to South Korea increased by 6 percentage points over the past decade, from 50.5 percent in 2005 to 56.5 percent in 2014.Out the of the estimated 23 million visitors in 2020, the number of tourists from developed countries and other emerging nations is projected to reach 7 million and 1 million, respectively, Park added.The institute reiterated that it was necessary for the government to diversify tour products and raise the quality of products in order to increase the rate of return visits.According to a study by a public company, inbound foreign tourists on average spent a record $901 on shopping when visiting Korea last year.The Korea Culture and Tourism Institute has said that the findings are based on surveys of 9,062 visitors in the January-September period.The state-run institute added that cosmetics, clothing and food were the top three items purchased by tourists. Meanwhile, expenditure on accommodation and food dropped because visitors spent an average of 6.1 days in the country in 2014, down from 6.9 days in 2013.In terms of reasons for visiting, business trips fell to 19.6 percent from 23.3 percent, while leisure jumped to 57.9 percent from 47.7 percent.“The weak Japanese yen did not discourage foreigners from coming in droves last year,” said the institute.Around half of inbound tourists were from China, followed by visitors from Japan and the United States.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","percent surpassing 20 million ,surpassing 20 million in ,jump 64 by 2020 ,surpassing 20 million ,23 million in 2020","['South Korea', 'the Hyundai Economic Research Institute', 'Park Da - mi']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.2001631   0.07787544

Its small and medium shipyards that could build such vessels are generally not up to the challenge of making the kind of investment in related R&D.;This shortcoming has made it impossible for the country to make inroads into the market dominated by Italian, Taiwanese and Chinese firms.The ministry said it wants to have a blueprint for such yachts in nine months with related technology and know-how being acquired afterward so a prototype boat can be launched in five years. The technology will then be shared with yards that can use it as reference for their own boats.

Single-person households had the second-highest poverty rate ― 47. 2 percent ― among all groups of people, including children, the employed and single-parent households, in 2013.The statistics are alarming as the number of the elderly, as well as single and two-person households, has increased dramatically here over the last 20 years. Koreans aged 65 or older accounted for 12.6 percent of the total population in 2013, and the proportion of the elderly is forecast to exceed 20 percent by 2026 and 50 percent by 2100.Meanwhile, 48.2 percent of all Korean households in 2010 consisted of one or two people, according to KIHASA. Last year, they made up 49.9 percent of all families in Seoul. The Seoul Metropolitan Government predicts that more than 60 percent of Seoul families will be single or two-person households, including single-parent families, by 2035.Notably, the poverty rate of households with female heads of the family was 32.4 percent in 2013, the third highest among all groups of Koreans, while the rate of single-parent households was the fourth highest at 18.5 percent. “From this research, we found that the elderly, single-person households, households with female heads of the family and single-parent households are the most vulnerable to poverty among all Koreans,” wrote KIHASA researcher Im Wan-seob in the report. “Antipoverty programs are needed for these groups and their specific needs.”According to Statistics Korea, less Koreans think it is one’s responsibility to support one’s aging parents financially.In 1998, almost 90 percent of the country’s population thought family members must take care of and support their aging parents, but only 33.2 percent of the population thought so in 2012.The poverty rate of South Korean children was 7.9 percent in 2013, while the rate for the employed was 7.8 percent the same year.

The respondents said the lack of options was the main reason they would take the nonregular job, with 43.3 percent saying “getting a job at any rate is important” and 41.6 percent saying “there are not enough regular jobs.” “At first I had specific goals, such as to become a producer for a broadcasting station or a journalist. But now I just want to start working,” said Song Min-ho, a 30-year-old graduate of Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. It has been nearly four years since he received his degree in English linguistics, yet he has yet to land a job.In the survey, 39.1 percent said the main thing they were looking for in a nonregular job was whether they could eventually become a regular worker.When asked if they thought it was difficult to become a regular worker, 94.4 percent of the respondents said “Yes.”According to Statistics Korea, it takes young workers ― those from the ages of 15-29 ― an average of 12 months to find their first job after entering the job market.

Eco-tourism in Turkey comes with wildlife and environment protection, the ministry said.Direct flights to Istanbul from Seoul take 12 hours through Turkish Airlines, Korean Air and Asiana Airlines. Daily transfer flights are available through Emirates Airlines, Qatar Airways, Uzbekistan Airways and Etihad Airways.For more information, call the Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism Agency at (02) 336-5337, or visit www.goturkey.com.

Policymakers take credit for reducing debts by 24.4 trillion won ($22.7 billion) for state-managed corporations and agencies by having them boost efficiency, control spending and sell non-core assets. The reduced debt is 4.3 trillion won more than the initial target, according to the ministry.Cho Bong-hwan, director general of the ministry's public institutions innovation office, said the next phase of reform will go into effect in 2016 after the government sets detailed plans and specific targets by the end of this year.The government will inspect some 85 public corporations and institutions that have been cited for maintaining redundant operations, unduly competing with private businesses. Such institutions are in the social overhead capital, culture and arts, and agricultural and fisheries sectors, the ministry said.The government will also promote merit-based wages for most employees of public corporations, Cho said.""The goal is to introduce a 'two-strike regime' that will allow the CEO or top management to fire employees who have performed below standard for two consecutive evaluation sessions,"" said Cho. He claimed that by introducing such a system, the public sector can help push forward country-wide job market reforms.The government has been trying to make the local job market more flexible, making it easier to hire and fire workers.All public institutions will have a wage peak system in place by next year, the ministry said.In addition, the government will revise how bonuses are given to CEOs of public institutions. With the revisions, instead of giving bonuses only during the years in office, CEOs will be rewarded even after leaving the institution if it does well, the director general said. The intent is to reward CEOs for good results that may become apparent later. By the same token, CEOs will only receive 50 percent of the bonus in the first year in office because any good performance by the institution will be considered partly creditable to the previous CEO.Public companies will do more to meet their social responsibility by getting rid of discrimination in hiring based on educational background, the ministry said. State-run institutions will take the lead in giving high-performing temporary workers full-time positions and hiring more people from rural areas to contribute to balanced national growth.

Bonuses paid to the 21 other plaintiffs lacked regularity and thus do not count, it said.A court ruling in favor of the unionists would have cost Hyundai Motor trillions of won. Experts estimate that the ruling, if it takes effect, will reduce the amount to around 11 billion won (US$10.19 million).It also smoothens the path for the automaker to go ahead with its large-scale 81 trillion won investment plan spanning over the next four years to build facilities and develop technologies.Since the two plaintiffs represent 5,700 employees who came from Hyundai Motor Service, which was consolidated with Hyundai Motor Co. back in late 1990s, all of them could be eligible to receive additional pay. The number accounts for just 11 percent of Hyundai Motor's 50,000-strong union.""The ruling is meaningful given that it could provide a benchmark to resolve the earlier controversy surrounding the ordinary wage,"" a Hyundai Motor official said on condition of anonymity. ""Moving away from the ineffective seniority-based pay structure, we need to place our focus on coming up with a globally competitive advanced wage system.""Hyundai Motor's labor union said the court's decision was ""disappointing,"" adding that it will decide whether to appeal the ruling after discussions with its members.Controversy over the ordinary pay issue flared up after the Supreme Court ruled late in 2013 that bonuses should be viewed as part of a worker's standard wages if given on a regular, uniform and periodic basis. The ordinary wage refers to a fixed amount paid regularly to an employee, and it is used as the basis for calculating employee benefits, such as overtime pay, paid annual leave, severance pay and other allowances. The business community has been watching the ruling closely since it could provide a direction for similar debate going on at many other businesses, which could face a sharp increase in salaries that they have to pay their workers. The Federation of Korean Industries, a major business lobby group comprised of large conglomerates, welcomed the court ruling, saying that it provided a clear-cut decision on the issue and would help stop similar lawsuits. It still expressed concerns that the ruling could cause fresh confrontation and conflict among workers since it applices to only some of the workers. Shares of Hyundai Motor closed at 171,000 won, down 2.01 percent from a day earlier, underperforming the benchmark KOSPI's 1.36 percent drop.

The reactor has since been turned off for a review of its safety.The state-run Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety (KINS) in October had completed an inspection of the reactor and concluded that it can operate for another 10 years. On Thursday, a group of minor opposition lawmakers and a coalition of environmental groups staged a protest rally outside the commission's office, demanding an immediate and permanent shutdown of the reactor. They questioned the transparency of the government's inspection.""(The government) should shut down the Wolseong reactor, because its life span expired and safety is not guaranteed,"" they said in a statement issued at a joint press conference in downtown Seoul. ""It is absurd to extend the life span without clearing safety concerns.""South Korea has 23 nuclear reactors in operation, from which it currently gets about 30 percent of its electricity supply, and is building several more. In 2007, the government extended by 10 years the life span of the 580-megawatt Gori No. 1 lightwater reactor that began commercial operations in 1977. The Wolseong No. 1 is the first heavywater reactor under review for a possible extension of its life span.The state power operator, Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power Co. (KHNP), said the life span of the Wolseong reactor should be extended, given the long time and huge money needed to build a new plant.""It is necessary to make use of reactors for a long period considering environmental costs and other burdens, and the country's chronic energy shortages,"" the KHNP said in a statement, adding it hopes for the extension plan to be approved at the next meeting.

Fifty-five of 232 municipalities nationwide do not have any clinics for expectant mothers. This means 1 out of 4 municipalities across the country do not have maternity units.One of the main reasons for this is the nation’s low birthrate, which stood at 1.18 children per women in 2013 ― the lowest among OECD countries. The number of Korean newborns dropped by 9.9 percent in the same year from 2012.A government projection last year even showed that South Koreans could “go extinct” by 2750 if the current trend continued.According to scholar Kim Young-nam at Korea Women’s Development Institute, one of the main reasons for the low fertility rate is the high number of young Koreans who put off dating and marriage due to lack of financial means.

Subsequently, a large number of additional faculty members and classrooms would be needed, the report claimed.A similar problem would occur when the students entered middle school in 2023, and high school in 2026.

""But currently, nothing has been decided over the issue.""South Korea's ministry of food and drug safety has the final say on deciding whether to remove the ban.His remarks come amid growing calls to improve the stagnant bilateral relations that have been beset by Japan's refusal to face up to its wartime history. Seoul and Tokyo are trying to mend ties first in non-political sectors.This year marks the 50th anniversary of the normalization of Seoul-Tokyo ties. Korea was under Japan's colonial rule from 1910-45.Noh Kwang-il, spokesman at the foreign ministry, said that Seoul will decide whether to ease the ban based on scientific evidence and public safety consideration.Touching on China's move to set up an infrastructure development bank, the official said that South Korea is carefully weighing the merits of joining the bank.Since late October, China has clinched preliminary deals with more than 20 countries to establish the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) that will be used to finance massive development projects in Asia.China is seeking to set up the bank as a counterbalance to the Asian Development Bank, led by the United States and Japan. Seoul has been wary of joining the bank so far, saying that details about the governance structure need to be clarified.""If Seoul joins the bank, it may have to chip in about 1 trillion won ($923.7 million). The government is carefully considering whether to join it by gauging what actual benefits we can get,"" the official said.The U.S. remains seen as uncomfortable with Seoul's possible move to join the AIIB as it believes China's move to set up the bank is aimed at raising its economic clout in Asia.South Korea has been explaining to Washington that Seoul could face burdens in doing its diplomacy with other Asian countries if it stays away from the AIIB, given that infrastructure projects in Asia require massive financing.

The Tumen River Area Development Project, which was later renamed the Greater Tumen Initiative, was launched in 1992 as a joint initiative among China, Russia and Japan and the two Koreas following a proposal a year earlier by the U.N. Development Program. But it had made little progress in the face of military tension, lukewarm participation and sluggish investment by private businesses. The paper, published in November in the journal by the country’s Academy of Social Science, also indicated the communist country’s resolve to kick-start an ambitious yet dormant project to lay a natural gas pipeline and railway through North Korea to the South. “The development of the Tumen River and surrounding regions has emerged as a key item for economic cooperation among the countries in Northeast Asia over the some 20 years since the 1990s,” the report reads. “The establishment of an oil and natural gas pipeline and the Trans-Siberian Railroad and the Trans-Korea Railway is another cooperative project that is gaining attention.” The report reflects Pyongyang’s efforts to shore up its faltering economy amid international sanctions imposed over its nuclear tests and missile launches. Other multilateral initiatives such as for a special industrial zone in border regions with China remain languid. Yet it also stressed the need to defuse tension on the peninsula for greater inter-Korean economic cooperation, pointing to international sanctions, U.S. forces in South Korea and the allies’ annual military exercises. “The North and South need to expel external forces of the U.S. from the peninsula, realize a reunification under the ideology of ‘uriminzokkiri (among our people)’ and carry out tasks that would contribute to a unification,” the publication said. Seoul, for its part, has set its sights on regional economic collaboration under President Park Geun-hye’s “Eurasia Initiative” through an integrated Eurasia power grid and a logistics network also covering China, Central Asia and Eastern Europe. But it faces mounting challenges such as lingering tension, economic uncertainty and risks of depending on the recalcitrant North.

(If we don’t proceed with the reform), the current system would require 10 trillion won in government subsidies over 10 years,” Park said, calling on the parties to draw up reform plans by April.“This would likely leave our next generation with 484 trillion won worth of debt, which means a single citizen would have to pay off 9.45 million won 10 years later.”According to the reform proposal submitted by the Ministry of Public Administration last year, all public employees will have to pay 43 percent more in premiums and receive 34 percent less in pension payouts, starting from 2016. The presidential office initially hoped to complete the passage of the reform bill by the end of last year.The Public Administration Ministry predicts some 4.2 trillion won would be saved by the end of the current administration’s term, and 22.1 trillion won would be saved by 2027 upon the implementation of the reform.The proposal triggered intense resistance from the nation’s unionized public workers, who argued that the ruling party’s plan would mainly benefit private insurance firms. According to the workers, the proposal was jointly created by the Saenuri Party and the Korean Pension Association ― a group of pension experts, many of whom are associated with private insurance companies, including Samsung Fire & Marine Insurance. The president also said the government’s plans to halve university tuition fees would be completed within this year.The plan to cut the cost of college tuition was one of Park’s key pledges for the 2012 presidential election. At the time, she pledged to provide students with financial aid according to their family’s income levels, by expanding state-backed scholarship programs. “I will make sure students don’t have to give up on university education because of a lack of financial means,” she said. The Education Ministry increased its budget for scholarship programs by 142.5 billion won this year.The president also said the government would establish a special school that focuses on career education and job training.

In a bid to cater to such needs, Hanyang University’s Graduate School of Technology and Innovation Management said it was seeking to foster talented individuals equipped with a capacity for technological innovation and design for the future.HYMOT claims that since it was founded in 2011, it has been enhancing competence in Korea by cultivating leaders in technology-oriented management who can spark technological innovation. A person uses “Imagine Lab,” a virtual reality simulation system developed by Hanyang University’s Graduate School of Technology and Innovation Management. (Hanyang University)Choi Gyung-hyun, the dean of HYMOT, said the technology created by the institute’s students would create new business opportunities through field such as product design.“Previously, industrial design mostly focused on the shapes and colors of the product but now other factors like functions also need to be considered,” said Choi. “Via interdisciplinary conversion, we will work to ensure that Korean-style technology management will be recognized as a global standard.”He said HYMOT was already cooperating closely with businesses: “As of now, 80 percent of our students in master’s and doctor’s programs have jobs.”The school has a three-tier program for each of its target groups ― there is a program for “chief technology officers” in local enterprises; another course targets those looking to start their own venture companies; and the last one is for “chief design officers,” who create designs combining various technologies so they can have positive effects on the market and people. Choi Gyung-hyun“Especially in the management sector, we need more education to foster entrepreneurship (for students),” Cho said.His determination to apply new technologies to create business opportunities appears timely, since President Park Geun-hye has vowed support for information and communications technology as one of the driving forces of her trademark creative economy initiative.Choi said the key abilities required of the students were creative entrepreneurship, the ability to manage emerging technology and futuristic problem-solving, and analytical capability.For this purpose, the school has set three strategic goals ― establishing a practical education course that caters to the demands of the business world, establishing the necessary educational infrastructure and acquiring faculty members with strong backgrounds in theory and real-life experience.The school appears to have made considerable progress, especially with the latter goal, according to Choi. It has been hiring field experts with abundant experience to work as adjunct professors, and inviting CEOs of business organizations to serve as mentors for its students.Students at HYMOT are also invited to find real-life cases that are relevant to their studies and analyze them.Students are also invited to take part in projects in cooperation with workers at companies to cope with actual problems that have occurred.One such project is the “Imagine Platform,” codeveloped with ParisTech in France. The platform was used to create a virtual reality system named “Imagine Lab” that allows users to explore and interact with objects within an immersive virtual reality environment. According to HYMOT, the school has developed educational content with the Arts et Metiers ParisTech in France. The content stimulates the senses of the user, allowing a virtual experience of Paris-based Musee Des Arts et Metiers.The technology can be used in a variety of other fields, Choi added.“As of now, we are mainly cooperating with the medical industry in developing technology that can help the physically challenged or the elderly ― exercise programs, for example,” Choi said. In addition, virtual reality can help physicians accurately measure patients’ cognitive abilities, rather than having to rely on surveys. Choi said he and his coworkers were planning to expand its application to other fields like law enforcement and national defense.“It can be used on 3-D modeling of a crime scene, a technique already adopted in some countries. This will enable virtual preservation of a crime scene, even if the actual scene is physically tarnished,” he said, adding that virtual reality could be used to create 3-D models of military operations. The researchers at the school are currently working on a mobile version of the Imagine Lab, which theoretically can open doors for virtual experiences in space or underwater.

South Korea's ODA to Bolivia amounted to an estimated $4.64 million in 2014, accounting for 0.22 percent out of the total ODA that Seoul extended that year.Bolivian Foreign Minister David Choquehuanca said that his country is in need of foreign investment, expressing hope that robust technical assistance from Seoul will be helpful for its development.""I hope that bilateral cooperation with South Korea could help achieve Bolivia's national development goals,"" Choquehuanca told a group of reporters in Seoul. ""I'm sure that South Korea's assistance will help us attain a set of goals such as poverty eradication and stable supply of energy and drinking water.""South Korea has become the first country in the world that has transformed into an aid donor country from a recipient nation. Seoul's ODA to underdeveloped countries will rise nearly 5 percent this year to 2.38 trillion won ($2.18 billion).""South Korea and Bolivia have something in common historically as the two nations suffered from foreign powers' aggression in the past,"" Choquehuanca added. ""By further tapping on common grounds, I hope that people from the two countries get closer.""Bolivia is one of the 11-members of an intergovernmental organization that shares socialist ideology and hopes for deeper economic integration in Central and South America such as Cuba and Venezuela, named ""the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America.""Touching on Washington's move to normalize its ties with Cuba, Choquehuanca said he welcomed such a decision.Last month, the U.S. and Cuba agreed to restore their diplomatic ties in about 50 years in a surprise decision.""We respect other countries' diplomatic decision. Bolivia welcomes the agreement between the U.S. and Cuba,"" the foreign minister said, expressing hope that more progress could come between the two nations.His visit to Seoul came on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between South Korea and Bolivia.Choquehuanca, who arrived in Seoul Saturday for a three-day visit, held talks with South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se earlier in the day. It marked the first time since 1996 that a Bolivian foreign minister visited Seoul.He expressed hope that South Korea could join on-going massive infrastructure projects in Bolivia including e-government development and the construction of international airports, according to Seoul's foreign ministry. In return, Yun proposed ways to widen cooperation so that Sucre can share with South Korea's technology and experience in such fields as the petrochemical industry and energy efficiency, it added.Yun also pledged that Seoul will expand necessary supports to Bolivia, one of 26 countries where Seoul has concentrated its ODA provision.Seoul and Sucre have decided to unveil commemorative stamps this year as an event to mark the anniversary, Choquehuanca noted.

The traded volume amounted to 1,190 tons of carbon emissions worth 9.74 million won.The market is only open to companies subject to the emission quota as well as three state-controlled lenders. During the starting stage from 2015 to 2017, companies under the emission target will receive carbon allowances for free.The KRX said it will operate the derivative market for shortened hours before extending them to full operation.""I expect that the carbon trading scheme will help (companies) effectively reduce carbon emissions and help the green industry grow,"" KRX Chairman Choi Kyung-soo said in an opening ceremony held at the Busan headquarters.

Measures are aimed at preventing problems likely to occur around 2018, when the number of college openings is expected to surpass the number of high school graduates.The ministry will evaluate each school based on its efforts to improve its classes, faculty, grading system and scholarships, and the percentage of its graduate who find jobs. By August, colleges will be sorted into five categories. But only those in the top group will be exempted from having to cut the number of new students they can accept.Colleges have already embarked on reforms to help their chances in the government assessment, as a poor result could substantially reduce their profits from students’ tuition fees. Among such efforts have been a series of measures aimed at lowering the number of top grades handed out to students.Students at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies on Dec. 31 stage a protest on the Seoul campus against the school’s decision to expand the curved grading system. (Yonhap)Roughly 90 percent of students in 2013 graduated with an average grade of “B” or higher, according to data provided by Korea Council for University Education. Even top-tier schools like Seoul National University, widely considered the premier higher education institute in Korea, graduated 59.5 percent of its students with an “A” average.Hankuk University of Foreign Studies recently announced it would begin using a curved grading system for all classes, and will retroactively apply the new measure to grades from the second semester of 2014. “Grade inflation has become a social issue that is damaging the credibility of college credits,” HUFS wrote in an email sent to students.Students staged a fierce protest, saying the choice was made unilaterally. They also voiced concerns that the system change could hurt their prospects in the job market. Despite the university’s claims that it was a preset plan, students complained that the university was attempting to shift the burden of college reform to the students. On the evaluation scale, 4 out of 60 points are allocated to grade distribution, which means schools that give out too many top grades will be penalized. “To improve their scores in the government evaluation, the school violated the rights of the faculty as well as the students,” HUFS students said last week at a news conference on the Seoul campus. They also applied for an injunction to a local court, requesting a suspension of the school’s new policy.Other schools have also attempted to curb the number of students scoring top grades. In November, Kyung Hee University sent a notice to faculty members urging them to keep the overall average GPA for all students in their classes below 3.0 (“B”). Some schools are aiming to increase the employment rate for graduates, another major category in the state evaluation. Chung-Ang University has announced plans to close or merge departments, which observers say is an attempt to increase the overall employment rate for its graduates.Ewha Womans University is banning students from postponing graduation without signing up for new semesters, a move widely interpreted as a bid to decrease the number of enrolled students. The number of students per faculty member is also a factor that can affect colleges’ grades in the ministry’s evaluation.As in the case of HUFS, the slew of measures is sparking protests from students. Members of student councils at eight Seoul-based universities held a news conference in front of Korean Educational Development Institute on Monday and urged the Education Ministry to revise its reform plans.“Side effects of the ministry’s forced, half-baked reform plans can be witnessed on several university campuses. The evaluation of the grading system has resulted in (universities) pushing ahead with unilateral changes to school rules, prompting conflicts on campus,” they said.Student discontent is not the only problem hindering education authorities. Although the government has procured the budget for college reform, a bill that will provide it legal grounds ― proposed in April by Rep. Kim Hee-jung of the ruling Saenuri Party ― is still pending at the National Assembly.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","college openings by 2022 ,government initiated college reform ,colleges reforming ahead of ,college reform about to ,initiated college reform about",['the Education Ministry'],2,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.26496851 0.59409636 0.11383783],Yoon Min-sik,Education,1,2015,"college openings by 2022 measures ,government initiated college reform about ,signing up for new semesters ,budget for college reform ,of college openings by 2022","['the Education Ministry', 'Hankuk University of Foreign Studies', 'Seoul', 'Korea Council for University Education', 'Seoul National University', 'Korea', 'Hankuk University of Foreign Studies', 'Seoul', 'Kyung Hee University', 'GPA', 'Chung - Ang University', 'Ewha Womans University', 'HUFS', 'Seoul', 'Korean Educational Development Institute', 'the Education Ministry', 'Kim Hee - jung', 'Saenuri Party', 'the National Assembly', 'Yoon Min - sik']",6,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.26496851 0.59409636 0.11383783]

Korean Air Line Co., South Korea’s largest full-service carrier, last year reported 246 cases of unruly behavior, including smoking, air rage and sexual harassment, compared with 120 in 2013. Smoking, punishable by fines up to 1 million won ($916.5), soared to 190 cases last year from 90 a year earlier.Among 490 passengers who violated aviation safety rules over the past three years, Korean Air handed over 155 to police, with 39 becoming subjects of legal punishment.No. 2 Asiana Airlines Inc. reported 51 cases of unruly passenger problems from January to November, more than triple the figure recorded the previous year, with smoking accounting for the highest ratio of violations.According to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transportation, the number of safety violations by air passengers rose to 187 in 2013, up from 140 in 2010. A total of 190 cases took place in the first seven months of last year. Among 843 cases over the past five years, 81 percent were related to smoking and commotion accounted for 12 percent, followed by physical abuse and sexual harassment with 5 percent and 2 percent, respectively, the ministry said. Unruly behavior of passengers has become a growing concern among local airlines, raising calls for clear regulations to prevent such behavior.On Wednesday, Bobby Kim, a popular R&B; singer in South Korea, was questioned by the U.S. investigators after his alleged sexual harassment of a cabin crew member while intoxicated on a Korean Air flight from Incheon to San Francisco. Korean Air found itself in hot water after its former vice president and the eldest daughter of CEO Cho Yang-ho sparked national uproar after ordering a crewmember to deplane over in-flight service last month. Cho Hyun-ah was indicted Wednesday on charges of obstructing aviation safety after ordering a chief flight attendant to deplane over the way she was served macadamia nuts, in an unopened pack instead of on a plate.

The country is breaking out of years of protectionist legacies to become a safe haven for investment and trade. Millions have moved out of poverty to form a fledgling middle class, ready and willing to splurge on consumer goods. After half a century of bloody armed conflicts with the guerrilla organization FARC, the clouds are finally parting with progress in the peace process.Colombian Foreign Minister Maria Angela Holguin’s recent visit to Korea from Jan. 6-7 reaffirmed both countries’ commitment to increase cooperation after a free trade agreement was signed in February 2013. As the first foreign minister to visit Korea under Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos’ government, Holguin met Korea’s Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, as well as Colombians studying and working in Korea, journalists and Korean business communities. “The purpose of my visit is to invigorate economic cooperation, which is expected to take off after the FTA comes into force this year, and to increase exchanges in educational and cultural areas,” Holguin said in an interview with The Korea Herald at Colombian coffee franchise Juan Valdez Cafe at Dongdaemun Design Plaza in Seoul last Wednesday.Colombian Foreign Minister Maria Angela Holguin (left) and Colombian Ambassador to Korea Tito Saul Pinilla pose after an interview with The Korea Herald in front of Colombian coffee franchise Juan Valdez Cafe at Dongdaemun Design Plaza in Seoul last Wednesday. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)“We are waiting for a constitutional review of the agreement, expected to be completed in a few months. As we are moving toward resolving a six-point agenda with the FARC, Colombia will be politically more stable and economically competitive.”With Korea’s traditional trade partners experiencing a slowdown in growth in recent years, rapidly developing South American economies are prompting a “pivot to South America” for Korean companies.After the free trade agreement was signed, ratification had been delayed as a result of stiff opposition by Colombia’s automobile and electronics sectors; but passed through parliament last year.Cars, automobile parts and synthetic resins make up the bulk of Korea’s exports to Colombia, and following lowered tariffs, exports of heavy construction equipment and materials, pharmaceutical products and medical equipment are expected to increase. The two countries became strategic partners in 2013, and there are currently 36 Korean companies operating in Colombia with cumulative investments of over $70 million.The Colombian government has been at the forefront of attracting foreign investment to steer national development, targeting areas of job creation, infrastructure, energy and environment, among others. The International Monetary Fund forecast Colombia’s economy to grow 4.5 percent this year, maintaining the healthy average 4 percent pace of the last 10 years. “As a country with a large territory facing both the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean, Colombia has huge demands for building its countryside through infrastructure development,” Holguin said. “Korean companies will make a fortune by building roads, airports, harbors, bridges and railways, and can use Colombia’s strategic location as an outpost to other Central and South American countries.”Colombia has rich natural resources of oil, coal, mineral fuel, natural gas and precious stones; and exports large quantities of pulp and paper, coffee, meat, cotton, sugars and other agricultural produce. Bilateral free trade will bring more Colombian fruits, meat and dairy products to Korea, Holguin said.Regarding the peace negotiations with armed rebel group FARC, Holguin said, “We have agreed on three points ― agricultural development, ending drug trafficking and political participation ― of the agenda and are negotiating the other three ― disarmament, compensating the victims and implementation of the peace deal.”The Colombian Embassy in Seoul said, “Colombia respects Korea’s rapid development experience, which it hopes to model its own growth. Latin American countries aspire to combine their natural and human resources with Korea’s expertise in science and technology, to add value to them and export.”By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","trade for korean companies ,america emerging markets colombia ,trade millions have moved ,korean companies eyeing latin ,free trade for korean","['korean', 'Colombia']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48990983  0.6060971

The sectors include laundry, disposal of military waste, operations of post exchanges and maintenance of military equipment.The plan comes amid criticism that assigning soldiers for such peripheral missions was inappropriate when North Korea’s military threats remain high and the number of service members is expected to decrease due to the nation’s low birthrate.By commissioning civilians to manage military supplies and post exchanges, a total of 2,100 troops can be reassigned for combat roles, ministry officials explained.The ministry also plans to gradually replace soldiers in charge of managing military resort facilities with civilians. The basic plan also includes commissioning civilians to take up chores such as cleaning barracks and offices and weeding, so as to ensure draftees have enough leisure time.“We will continue to develop our related policies to effectively use our limited defense resources and troops by actively using civilian resources, with an aim to enhance our combat readiness,” said the ministry in a press release. The ministry also unveiled a plan to purchase civilian products to maintain what have been strictly military supplies. Some 240 billion won ($218 million) in defense spending can be saved by 2019 from the commercialization process, the ministry estimated.“We will unveil our defense supply standards to the civilian firms so that we can obtain good civilian products for military supplies (at good prices),” said the ministry.To save water and energy, the ministry also plans to invite commercial companies to invest in the projects for some 30 military bases to improve lighting, heating and pipe systems. It seeks to save utility costs of around 59 billion won by 2019.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","relieve some 500 troops ,to civilians for 2015 ,combat positions by 2019 ,civilians for 2015 19 ,open some military jobs",['the Defense Ministry'],2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3505955   0.32138759

Seoul plans to send 20 other medical workers to the West African country in the coming months.South Korea has joined global efforts to fight Ebola by sending medical workers and offering a combined US$12.6 million in assistance.

Such mandatory imports are subject to only a 5 percent tariff.   The tariff rate for non-mandatory imports must be agreed upon by members of the World Trade Organization (WTO). South Korean officials say the process may take years, noting such a process for Taiwan took 57 months.   According to South Korea's Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, five countries -- the U.S., China, Australia, Thailand and Vietnam -- have filed a complaint with the WTO, arguing that the offered tariff rate for non-mandatory imports is too high.   South Korean officials said these countries hold a special interest in Seoul's rice market.   ""Of the countries that have raised an objection, four, except Vietnam, had jointly shared a country-specific quota of 200,000 tons per year in rice exports to South Korea under the MMA quota,"" Choi Seok-young, chief of the South Korean mission to Geneva, told reporters.    These four countries oppose South Korea's rice market opening as it has ceased the country-specific quota, meaning South Korea no longer is required to import rice from them.  Choi and the South Korean trade ministry assured that Seoul has no intention of making a concession, saying its tariff rate is more than reasonable when compared to those of Japan and Taiwan that liberalized their local rice markets before South Korea.  South Korea's 513 percent tariff is an ad valorem duty, which is tax based on the price of an article.   Taiwan and Japan, on the other hand, impose a specific tax, which fixes the amount of tax depending on the weight of rice imports.   ""Japan and Taiwan liberalized their rice markets with a specific tax, which at the time of their market opening translated into an ad valorem tax of over 1,000 percent,"" Choi told reporters.  The South Korean trade ministry said Seoul needs to reach an agreement with each and every one of the countries that have objected to the tariff rate before obtaining an official WTO approval.   ""The government will do its utmost to make sure the country's rice import tariff rate is fixed as it is, through negotiations with the countries that have filed a complaint,"" the ministry said.
