He was 73.Kim Yang-gon (Yonhap)The North’s Korea Central News Agency said that Kim, a secretary of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers’ Party and director of the party’s United Front Department, died at 6:15 a.m. on Tuesday following the accident, without elaborating.The demise of the North’s core diplomatic official, seen as a relatively dovish negotiator favoring dialogue, could negatively affect Seoul’s efforts toward inter-Korean cooperation and reconciliation, analysts noted.  “Our comrade, Kim Yang-gon has devotedly fought to realize our party’s policy of independent national reunification,” the KCNA said in a report. “Kim was loved and respected by the party members and people for his ceaseless dedication to the party and revolution, his revolutionary principles and humble character.”Pyongyang decided to hold a state funeral for the deceased party secretary, according to the KCNA. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un will chair the funeral committee. His funeral ceremony will be held on Thursday. North Korea also announced a list of Kim’s funeral committee members, which included Choe Ryong-hae, a senior secretary of the ruling party. Choe, who had been the North Korean leader’s key aide, was sent to a rural farm in November as punishment over the mishandling of a hydroelectric power plant project.Seoul’s Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo sent his condolences to the North by fax. Seoul is considering sending a delegation to attend Kim’s funeral. The late Kim has long led the communist state’s external policy affairs including cross-border issues and those related to China -- a reason why observers say his death would influence Pyongyang’s foreign policy to a certain extent.“As the party secretary who has led inter-Korean affairs died abruptly, it seems inevitable that cross-border talks would be suspended for a long period,” said Cheong Seong-chang, senior research fellow at the local think tank Sejong Institute.“Given that he has also played a role as an acting party secretary in charge of international affairs, the possibility has increased that the improvement in the relations between Pyongyang and Beijing would also be delayed.”Other analysts, however, said that his death would not seriously affect Pyongyang’s external policy, given that the dictatorial ruler calls all the shots when it comes to crucial policy issues.Born in 1942 in Anju, South Pyongan Province, Kim started his party work at the party’s Central Committee, upon his graduation from the foreign language and literature department of the Kim Il-sung University. Since then, he had worked up the ladder of the party hierarchy mostly in the divisions handling foreign affairs and inter-Korean relations. In 2007, he was appointed to lead the United Front Department and led the work of arranging the 2007 inter-Korean summit between then South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun and then North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. At the summit, Kim was the only official who flanked and assisted the North Korean leader.Along with Chang Song-thaek, the executed uncle of the North Korean leader, Kim had led affairs regarding China as well. He is known to have led the preparatory work for late former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il’s trip to China in 2010.Since 1998, he served as a core member of the Supreme People’s Assembly, the North’s rubber-stamp parliament. In 2010, he was appointed as a member of the party’s Central Committee and candidate member of the party’s powerful politburo.After Kim Jong-un took the helm of the country in December 2011 upon his father’s death, Kim Yang-gon continued to lead foreign policy affairs and was later appointed as a member of the politburo.Most recently, the late party secretary received the media spotlight in August as he, along with two other officials from the North, engaged in cross-border negotiations to defuse tensions caused by Pyongyang’s landmine provocation on Aug. 4.

Hah Jae-hun was conducting a patrol mission on the South Korean side of the Demilitarized Zone when landmines buried by North Korea exploded and maimed him and another soldier on Aug. 4.  The landmine attack, followed by North Korean artillery firing on the South, escalated military tensions between the countries in August before they reached the so-called ""Aug. 25"" agreement to ease tensions and facilitate talks.Hah has since undergone surgery and intensive rehabilitation treatments to recover his ability to walk.""I extend my sincere gratitude to the military and medical staff for providing the best treatment and the foundation for a new life,"" Hah said as he was discharged from the state-run VHS Medical Center, standing on his two artificial legs.""Even though I lost my legs, I will do my best to serve the country as a reborn soldier,"" he said. For now, Hah is able to take short walks indoors or go up and down stairs, but he will undergo a final round of treatment at an Army hospital before returning to service, according to the Army. The other injured soldier, Staff Sgt. Kim Jung-won, who had one leg amputated, completed his rehabilitation and returned to his unit in early December with a prosthetic leg.An Army representative said, ""Hah's case needed a more customized treatment system and more efforts on his part because, compared to Kim, it was more difficult for Hah to balance himself on two prosthetic legs."" A task force of medical staff from the rehabilitation, orthopedics, urology, psychiatry and dermatology departments have worked together to treat and help Hah return to his normal life, the Army also said.The VHS Medical Center said it will continue to help Hah carry out everyday activities and military service normally by providing more customized assistance devices down the road.

According to the National Human Rights Commission of Korea, police and prosecutors arrested a Nigerian and detained him for 12 days, ignoring his multiple requests to contact the Nigerian Embassy. Police arrested the man, who was at the time on the wanted list, on a theft charge in November last year. He denied the charge and asked police officers to contact the Nigerian Embassy, but they allegedly refused his request. Police and prosecutors reportedly shifted responsibility onto each other, with police saying they were only in charge of the initial investigation and prosecutors saying the police should have contacted the embassy.“The man’s rights to self-defense was violated as police and prosecutors refused his request to contact his embassy when arresting and detaining him,” said an official from the watchdog.According to the Constitution, the families of those arrested and detained have a right to know the date, place and reason for arrest and detention.When foreign nationals face arrest and detention, police and prosecutors are required to allow suspects to freely contact their embassies in Korea for their self-defense. The law enforcement agencies should notify the embassies of suspects’ status, too. The NHRCK said it had imposed a recommendation for prosecutors and advised police to offer proper job training for officers to cope with such a situation. The man was eventually set free after he was found not guilty and falsely accused, as a fellow Nigerian national had given the man’s name and foreign registration number to avoid arrest when he had been caught stealing items. “The Nigerian was framed, but the arrest and detention were carried out in accordance with the law, so there is no problem in the law enforcement,” the NHRCK official said. The NHRCK, an independent organization monitoring the nation’s human rights issues, sets recommendations for abuse cases, but its advice does not have legally binding force. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","korea police and prosecutors arrested ,watchdog said tuesday that police ,embassy police arrested the man ,police and prosecutors arrested nigerian ,theft charge in november last","['South Korea ’s', 'african', 'the National Human Rights Commission', 'Korea', 'Nigerian', 'the Nigerian Embassy', 'the Nigerian Embassy', 'Korea', 'NHRCK', 'nigerian', 'Nigerian', 'NHRCK', 'NHRCK']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55581164  0.48363835

Police had set a noon deadline for him to surrender himself, warning they would raid the temple if he refuses to come out.  (Yonhap)Han had been on the wanted list since June, for allegedly leading a violent rally on May 1 Labor Day. Another arrest warrant had been pending for him leading a demonstration on May 24 last year and attempting to march near Cheong Wa Dae. He has reportedly been hiding at the KCTU office before making an appearance at the Nov. 14 rally in Gwanghwamun that ended in clashes between pipe-wielding demonstrators and riot police firing back water cannons. Two days after the rally, Han sought refuge at Jogyesa Temple, which has often served as a shelter for political and student activists seeking refuge from police crackdowns in times of authoritarian rule, notably under the military-backed governments of the 1980s. Police have been stationed outside the temple to prevent him from fleeing.A major collision was averted Wednesday, as the police temporarily delayed their raid of the temple to detain Han.Police halted the operation at around 6 p.m. in response to Buddhist monks’ renewed calls for a peaceful resolution to the issue. As tensions intensified around Jogyesa temple, Buddhist monk Ven. Jaseung on behalf of the Jogye Order made a statement in a press briefing at 5 p.m., calling on both the police and the KCTU to end their standoff.Police stationed nearly 1,000 officers inside and outside the temple and cleared the way leading to the room in which Han has been taking refuge by pushing away monks and temple officials who have stood at the entrance to bar the officers from storming into the building. Only Buddhist monks, temple officials and journalists were allowed near the building Han was in to prevent clashes. At the height of the standoff, monks were praying and temple officials held up placards reading “Let’s solve the problem peacefully” and “Opposition to the police force in the temple,” wishing for a peaceful resolution to the issue.Kang Sin-myeong, the chief of the National Police Agency, threatened to raid the temple to execute an overdue arrest warrant unless Han came out of the temple voluntarily by 4 p.m. As the scheduled police raid neared in the afternoon, tensions escalated as several civic groups and lawmakers made their way to the temple to voice their opinions on the police arresting Han. “We want to ask whether the forcible execution of an arrest warrant complies with democratic values and the rule of law at this critical moment of wrangling over the labor market reform bills that can have a huge impact on laborers’ lives continues,” Jo Young-sun, a secretary general of Lawyers for a Democratic Society said, asking the temple to continue to provide Han with protection. On the other side of the road, a conservative civic group comprised of some 100 elderly people held a demonstration to lambast the Jogye Order for hiding Han in the temple. “The government should sternly punish North Korea sympathizers trying to topple our nation and undermine the rule of law,” the elderly group said, holding up placards reading “Immediately arrest Han Sang-kyun, who lead the violent protest.” Conservatives have often likened ultraprogressives with North Korea supporters.Buddhist followers, mostly in their 50s to 80s, gathered outside the temple at around 3 p.m. to condemn the union chief for hiding in the religious venue and undermining the rule of law. “Why have the police failed to arrest him until now? What did they do? Kick him out!” an elderly women told people around her. Others nodded along to her remarks, with some men bluntly shouting in the air, “Come out immediately!” Earlier on Tuesday, Buddhist monks warned that a police raid on the temple would be no different from religious persecution and a crackdown on Korean Buddhism as a whole. The monks have also urged the labor union head to make a “swift decision” to end the cycle of violence. “The Jogye order has strived to solve the issue through conversation, asking the police delay arresting him as we believe that the execution of the arrest warrant would not solve the conflicts, but would only lead to another conflict,” the monk Jaseung told reporters Wednesday. “We will decide what to do about his stay here by noon tomorrow.”  Considering the temple’s request, the police decided to delay arresting him until Thursday at noon. “We planned to execute the arrest warrant, but will delay it to tomorrow afternoon, considering the Buddhist monk Jaseung’s request,” the police said. “But if Han does not voluntarily appear by noon tomorrow, we will sternly execute the court-issued warrant.”At Han’s request, the Jogye Order — the nation’s largest Buddhist sect with several million followers — has played a mediation role between the labor activist and the government since he took refuge there. Meanwhile, the labor union renewed its pledge for an all-out strike upon the police’s forcible arrest of its chief. “The trade unions under the KCTU will stage a strike at the earliest possible moment if the police forces their way into the temple to drag him out. We will step up our fight against the government crackdown and its attempt to reform the labor market,” Park Sung-sik, a spokesperson for the KCTU said in a statement.

The area has been the site of deadly naval clashes between Seoul and Pyongyang for decades.   It was later confirmed that a Chinese patrol boat had been monitoring Chinese ships that poached across the Yellow Sea border, according to the South Korean military.   It was not clear why the Chinese patrol boat did not retreat despite the South Korean Navy's broadcasting of warnings.   However, the state-run Global Times newspaper said in an editorial on Wednesday that the South Korean Navy's action was ""very imprudent behavior,"" defending its patrol ship that violated the Yellow Sea border between the two Koreas.  The Chinese patrol boat might not have received the South Korean Navy's broadcasting of warnings, it said.   Tensions remain high between Seoul and Pyongyang over the Yellow Sea border, known as the Northern Limit Line that was set by U.N.-led forces at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. North Korea does not recognize the de facto sea border.   The Chinese newspaper also raised questions over the legitimacy of the NLL, saying North Korea claims its own Yellow Sea border with South Korea and the NLL is ""not an internationally-recognized border.""

(Yonhap-News)The Navy said that it fired 10 rounds in warning at a Chinese patrol boat that was conducting a crackdown on some Chinese fishermen illegal fishing near a border island in the waters off South Korea‘s west coast. The Chinese patrol boat trespassed across the maritime border, widely known as the Northern Limit Line, in the course of its crackdown.“The vessel retreated northward as we fired off warning shots at it after repeatedly issuing warning messages,” it said.It said that the ship was first presumed to come from North Korea, but it was later confirmed as a Chinese patrol boat.The North’s patrol boats have frequently intruded past the NLL, as it has long demanded that the line be moved farther south.Pyongyang does not acknowledge the NLL, which was drawn unilaterally by the U.S.-led United Nations Command when the 1950-53 Korean War entered into a ceasefire. The two Koreas fought bloody battles in 1999, 2002 and 2009 near the border.Chinese fishing boats often cross into South Korean waters in the Yellow Sea in search of abundant fish stocks, regularly leading to violence by Chinese crews during raids by the South Korean Coast Guard.“The Navy has beefed up its surveillance near the NLL,” a Coast Guard representative said.

It also said that out of the 22 cases of fires that were started by kimchi refrigerators with more than 10 years of use, 20 were made by the defendant. Taking into consideration that the fridge had never gone through safety inspections, the court ordered the manufacturer to compensate the insurance company 50 percent of the amount claimed.

An AH-64 Apache helicopter from the U.S. Army 2nd Infantry Division crashed onto a mountain road late Monday near Wonju, Gangwon Province, some 100 kilometers east of Seoul. The accident took place 20 minutes after the attack helicopter departed from Osan Air Base in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province. The crew members were on their routine night low-fly training mission, the U.S. authorities said. The bodies of the two soldiers were recovered from the helicopter, Wonju firefighters said. The crewmen’s identities have not been disclosed. The investigators suspected that the attack helicopter hit a high-voltage line or a steel tower in the foggy weather. A disconnected line and upper part of a tower were found among the wreckage. “I heard a ‘bang’ sound and saw flames here and there around the road along with the broken line,” a witness resident said, according to a police report. The weather condition was appropriate for flying as the visibility was 8 kilometers with the wind speed at 2 meters per second, Korean military sources said. No further causalities or property damages were reported. The accident site was 500 meters from residential property. The U.S. military investigators collected the black box and the wreckage for closer investigation. The probe will likely take about a month, they said. The traffic around the accident scene was restricted Tuesday. The Apache helicopter, armed with a 30-millimeter M230 chain gun, Hydra 70 rocket pods and 16 hellfire missiles, is one of the most advanced attack helicopters in service. It has day or night or all-weather flight capabilities and can attack tanks or bunkers up to 8 kilometers away.

KAI is South Korea's contractor manufacturer of the program.   With the partnership, Indonesia will be entitled to purchase 50 new planes.   Under the deal signed Sunday, Indonesia will be able to take part in the designing of the airplane, as well as in the production of components for the program.   It will also be entitled to acquire the aviation technology of the project and bring home one experimental airplane, according to KAI.   ""All the specifics have been agreed upon with the Indonesian side, regarding the KF-X development,"" said Jang Sung-sub, director of KAI. The KAI-Indonesia deal will be finalized after KAI signed its final agreement with the South Korean government as the contractor of the project later this year.   The latest deal will help expedite the local project, which has been criticized by the National Assembly, as well as the public.  The program was dealt a major blow after the U.S. Department of State refused in April to approve U.S.-based Lockheed Martin's transfer of four core aviation technologies for the South Korean project.   Speculation had also circulated that Indonesia might take back its offer to form a partnership first committed in 2011.   In addition to the 120 and 50 units to be delivered to the South Korean and Indonesian air forces, respectively, KAI plans to produce up to 600 units of the new airplane to sell them overseas, another KAI official said.

Beijing says the Syrians themselves need to arrive at a political solution.  IS said in its magazine Wednesday that it had killed two hostages it was holding for ransom _ from Norway and China _ after they had been ``abandoned'' by infidel nations.   The Chinese man had been identified as Fan Jinghui, 50, a self-described wanderer from Beijing who once taught grade school and sometimes worked in TV production. China's Foreign Ministry confirmed his killing early Thursday.                                                             Chinese President Xi Jinping (Yonhap)``China strongly condemns the brutality of the killing of Chinese national by the Islamic State extremists,'' the Chinese president said in Manila while attending an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting. He was quoted by China's official Xinhua News Agency. He expressed his condolences to the victim's family. ``Terrorists are the common enemy of humankind,'' Xi said. ``China firmly opposes terrorists of all forms and resolutely cracks down on any crimes that challenge the foundation of human civilization.'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China made all-out efforts to save Fan, but did not specify what actions were taken.  Fan also worked in advertising and TV production and described himself as a free spirit during an interview in 2001 by China National Radio. ``I love reading about the history of science,'' Fan said on the program profiling people without fixed careers. ``And the ancient Greek great philosophers' pure spiritual pursuit of freedom really gave me a jolt. That great spirit can be seen as the powerful motive for me to go after freedom.'' Fan said in the interview that he was born in 1965 and worked as a school teacher for six years after graduating from college. He said he joined an advertising firm in 1994 but left after about a year and later worked odd jobs, including as an off-the-books assistant producer at state TV broadcaster CCTV. In 2002 he registered his own advertising company, Beijing Jingcai Yinsu Advertising Co. Ltd., according to a corporate database run by the Beijing government. However, the license was revoked from September 2003 until at least 2009, and it is unclear if was later renewed.  On Thursday, a police car was parked outside the middle school where his wife works, and the school gatekeeper told a reporter that she had not come to the office. No one answered the door at Fan's apartment in western Beijing, where neighborhood elderly were patrolling the grounds to keep strangers out. China has not dispatched troops, planes or any other assets to take part in fighting in Syria.  However, Beijing in recent years has shown a willingness to use its military to protect its citizens in conflict zones and dispatched planes and a navy frigate to aid in the evacuation of 35,000 Chinese workers from Libya in 2011. More recently, China sent a naval squadron to Yemen this spring to rescue Chinese citizens and other foreign nationals from fighting.  Most Chinese citizens are believed to have already left Syria following four years of civil war.  Beijing also has been stepping-up anti-terrorism cooperation with other nations, including Turkey, from where most ISIS foreign recruits _ allegedly including some from China _ cross the border into Syria.","killing early thursday chinese president ,condemned the killing of chinese ,the killing of chinese hostage ,state extremists the chinese president ,his killing early thursday chinese","['AP', 'China', 'chinese', 'Islamic', 'Xi Jinping', 'China', 'Syria', 'Beijing', 'Syrians', 'Norway', 'China', 'chinese', 'Fan Jinghui', 'Beijing', 'China', 'Foreign Ministry', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'Yonhap)``China', 'chinese', 'Islamic', 'chinese', 'Manila', 'Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation', 'China', 'Xinhua News Agency', 'Xi', 'China', 'Foreign Ministry', 'Hong Lei', 'China', 'China National Radio', 'CCTV', 'Beijing Jingcai Yinsu Advertising Co.

South Korea tends to think the power of China is growing equal to that of the U.S. as the country tries to reposition itself between the two superpowers and pitch itself as a balancer, Shin said.""But the 'balancer' discourse could cause unnecessary misunderstanding,"" the professor said, adding, ""South Korea needs to make it more clear that the central axis of South Korea's security and diplomacy is the South Korea-U.S. alliance. ""China does not have the willingness and the power to replace the U.S. (as the controller of the global system),"" he said. ""South Korea should not be deluded by China's recent charm offensive."" Under this backdrop, Seoul could play its role as a defuser whenever U.S.-China tensions escalate, Shin said, adding that leading the efforts to denuclearize North Korea could be part of the role.

(Yonhap)They agreed to hold another round of talks “at an early date” in line with their leaders’ agreement last week to accelerate the negotiations over the long-festering issue, the major source of bilateral antipathy.Lee Sang-deok, director general of Northeast Asian affairs at the ministry, led the South Korean side while the Japanese side was represented by Kimihiro Ishikane, director general of the Japanese Foreign Ministry’s Asian and Oceanian Affairs Bureau. “We held deep, useful talks. With regard to our differences, we decided to continue our consultations to reach agreement on them at another round of talks to be held at an early date,” a senior Seoul official told reporters on the customary condition of anonymity.”He refused to elaborate on the content of the bilateral talks, but noted that the two sides are moving forward “little by little toward a goal.”Since the first round of the talks in April 2014, Japan has maintained the issue was already settled under a 1965 treaty normalizing bilateral ties. Article II of the treaty states the problem concerning property, rights and interests of the two contracting parties and their nationals has been settled “completely and finally.”However, Seoul claims that the issue was not on the agenda for the negotiations over the treaty at the time, given that it was only in the 1990s that victims and civil society were just starting to raise the issue. It also claims it is a wartime human rights issue that should be dealt with separately from the treaty.Seoul’s First Vice Foreign Minister Lim Sung-nam repeated the government stance on Wednesday.“Our government’s firm stance has been that the issue was not included as part of the agenda for the negotiations for the 1965 treaty,” he said in a radio interview with the local broadcaster TBS.Earlier in the day, Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said nothing has yet to be determined with regard to the solution to the long-festering issue.“No decision has been made yet over the issue,” he told reporters.“As it is true that the comfort women issue has affected the development of bilateral relations, the two sides have repeatedly held director-general-level consultations,” he added, expressing hopes for an early resolution of the issue.There are 47 known surviving Korean victims, who are an average of 89.2 years old.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","talks in seoul on wednesday ,sexual enslavement of korean women ,enslavement of korean women during ,talks in april 2014 japan ,korean women during their 10th","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'Lee Sang - deok', 'northeast asian', 'Kimihiro Ishikane', 'the japanese Foreign Ministry ’s', 'asian', 'yonhap)they', 'Lee Sang - deok', 'northeast asian', 'south korean', 'japanese', 'Kimihiro Ishikane', 'the japanese Foreign Ministry ’s', 'asian', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Lim Sung - nam', 'Japan', 'Yoshihide Suga', 'korean', 'Song Sang - ho']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39733157  0.45890287

He was sentenced to three years imprisonment. Following the incident, the police have mobilized not only the team in charge of hit-and-run cases, but also police officers dealing with general traffic accidents to swiftly respond to such incidents, the police said. Most recently, the police succeeded in apprehending a man within 13 hours last month, as they found white paint at the scene and traced all the 245 white-colored vehicles registered with the city government in Gangjin, South Jeolla Province. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","hit and run murders nationwide ,car accident the total arrest ,monday they had arrested all ,run the police arrested total ,police arrested total of 125","['Gangjin', 'South Jeolla Province']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49645188  0.2743023

40,40,Guidelines issued on sex discrimination in hiring,"The South Korean government said Tuesday that it would send major companies guidelines on how to prevent sexual discrimination in the hiring processes in response to criticism over the lack of efforts to monitor and discipline workplaces against such violations. The Ministry of Employment and Labor said it would introduce a set of discrimination rules to 2,186 conglomerates and 82 major franchises to encourage them ...","The South Korean government said Tuesday that it would send major companies guidelines on how to prevent sexual discrimination in the hiring processes in response to criticism over the lack of efforts to monitor and discipline workplaces against such violations. The Ministry of Employment and Labor said it would introduce a set of discrimination rules to 2,186 conglomerates and 82 major franchises to encourage them to root out sexual discrimination in the hiring process and at workplaces. While the current law on gender equality in employment bans discriminatory recruitment with a penalty of up to 5 million won ($4,400), the implementation has been lackluster due to lax monitoring and punishment by the authorities.Under the rules, the companies should not exclude men or women in job postings without a reasonable cause. The businesses, for example, cannot specify that they want a female secretary or a male worker in their job advertisements. English expressions such as “waiter” and “waitress” that can distinguish a sex cannot be used, either. The guidelines specify companies refrain from giving job seekers different entitlements or job statuses based on gender, asking personal questions like marital status at job interviews or mentioning specific requirements related to appearance and body size in the ads. But the ministry will allow specific jobs, such as a model for male clothes or a guard for male dormitory, to be reserved for specific genders due to the nature of the jobs. The companies will also be allowed to recruit a certain gender with the purpose of easing existing gender inequality at their workplaces. In recent years, there have been widespread complaints that companies still ask female candidates sensitive questions, such as whether they are married or plan to have a baby in the near future during the employment process. “The corporate culture that violates job seekers’ privacy by asking about marital status and appearance is a problem, but what’s more worrisome is that many companies are not aware of the illegality of such practice,” said Labor Ministry official Nah Young-don, who is in charge of youth and women policy. “We will actively promote the relevant law and step up monitoring breach cases to lighten job seekers’ burden.” Under the current law on gender equality in employment, no one should face discrimination due to their marital status, role or gender without appropriate reasons. The law also bans companies from asking questions related to height, weight and appearance. Last year alone, there were an estimated 630 cases in which employers put up discriminative job postings looking for “good-looking” candidates. The government only warned the companies to scrap the postings or correct some phrases without legally punishing them. Defending the claims, another official told The Korea Herald that it is “difficult” practically to take legal actions against businesses violating the law. “Job seekers who experienced discrimination in the hiring process are reluctant to come forward in fear that such complaints might adversely affect their job prospects, which makes it tough for us to crack down on the employers breaking the law,” said Labor Ministry official Lee Young-ki.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","in employment bans discriminatory recruitment ,south korean government said tuesday ,the law also bans companies ,sexual discrimination in the hiring ,law also bans companies from","['south korean', 'the Ministry of Employment and Labor', 'Labor Ministry', 'Nah Young - don', 'the Korea Herald', 'Labor Ministry', 'Lee Young - ki', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.15179875  0.30596703

The government said it is closely monitoring over 850 students and lecturers who have been using the College of Animal Bioscience and Technology building in northeastern Seoul, to check if more have been infected. All the 31 patients are from three laboratories in the university building. Of the patients, 23 were placed in isolation at state-run facilities, while eight others were quarantined at home, with the government still trying to find the cause of the infection.The university also put up posters around campus asking those who visited the bioscience building from Oct. 8-28 and who are showing suspicious symptoms to report to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.SK Group, which used the building Sunday for a test for job applicants, said it would contact the candidates to notify them of the possible infection. The company refused to reveal the number of people who took the exam in the building. Since a 26-year-old female student from the college showed symptoms on Oct. 19, 20 more students working toward their doctoral and master’s degrees at laboratories in the building have contracted the unknown virus. With the growing number of patients, Konkuk University shut down the whole building Wednesday, while the CDC conducted an epidemiologic inspection into the building and disinfected it earlier in the day.  “We assume that the source of infection is inside the building, but don’t know what exactly it is,” an official from the CDC said. “For now, there are no human-to-human infections and the virus hasn’t spread outside the building.”As of Thursday evening, there were no additional cases of infection.The first four graduate students showing symptoms allegedly visited a cattle fair in Gyeonggi Province as well as an animal farm owned by the university in Chungju, North Chungcheong Province, last week, triggering speculations that they might have caught the Brucellosis bacterial infection. Brucellosis, which generally infects animals including cattle, sheep, goats and dogs, can be passed on to human beings when they come in contact with infected animals. But professor Chang Won-joong, who is in charge of managing animals and plants for the university, dismissed the claims, saying the students had not touched cattle placenta. There is little possibility that their visit to the animal farm and cattle fair could be linked to the infection, he added. Some experts suspect Q fever, which can be transmitted by air and is caused by the Coxiella burnetii bacteria found in the droppings of animals. Symptom such as fever, headache and muscle aches appear after a two-week incubation period.The university is now waiting for the results of the inspection by the CDC.

Lee Sun-jin shakes hands with troops at a unit on the country’s frontline island of Yeonpyeongdo on Oct. 9. (Yonhap)The South Korean Navy ship fired five warning shots with a 40 mm-caliber gun. The ship retreated to the North 18 minutes after the shots were fired. No damage was seen on the ship, Seoul authorities said. Pyongyang called the South’s use of the gun a “deliberate military provocation,” warning that the inter-Korean relations could return to the point before the two sides struck a comprehensive deal on Aug. 25 to defuse cross-border tensions.The North’s vessel came some 700 meters into the South Korean waters at around 3:30 p.m., according to Seoul authorities. At the time, the vessel was carrying out a stepped-up clampdown on some 100 Chinese vessels operating near the Northern Limit Line, the de facto sea border.“In the process of (the North) making its retreat, there was no naval clash or anything,” said a military official on condition of anonymity. “We are keeping closer tabs on the North Korean military’s movements and strengthening our readiness posture.”The North’s violation of the NLL raised tensions as the two Koreas were holding reunions of families that have been separated since the 1950-53 Korean War at Mount Geumgangsan on the North’s east coast.The North’s Committee for Peaceful Unification of the Fatherland criticized the South, arguing that Seoul carried out a “military provocation” intentionally targeting its naval vessel.“The South Korean military’s warmongers fired a barrage of shots toward our vessel that was conducting a normal maritime mission,” said the committee’s unnamed spokesperson in an interview with the North’s Korean Central News Agency.“It is a deliberate provocation that is intended to raise military tensions again in the West Sea.”Seoul authorities countered that they fired the warning shots in accordance with “due procedures.”“It was not the first time that the North’s patrol ship has violated the NLL,” a Seoul official told reporters on condition of anonymity. “When a North Korean ship crosses the NLL into the South, the Navy is immediately to make a warning announcement and then fire warning shots.”Since the Aug. 25 agreement, the North has violated the NLL twice. On Aug. 31, a North Korean patrol ship retreated to its waters after the South fired three shots with a 40 mm-caliber naval gun. As of October, the North violated the NLL more than 10 times, according to Seoul authorities.The North has often violated the NLL in what Seoul claims to be a move to turn the waters near the NLL into a disputed area. The North contests the NLL as a maritime border, as it was drawn unilaterally by the then U.S.-led U.N. Command after the end of the Korean War. The North argues the NLL should be redrawn further south.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","korean navy ship fired five ,crackdown on chinese fishing boats ,south on saturday during beefed ,south korean military said sunday ,ship fired five warning shots","['north korean', 'chinese', 'south korean', 'South Korea ’s', 'Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'Lee Sun - jin', 'Yeonpyeongdo', 'south korean', 'Navy', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'inter - korean', 'North ’s', 'south korean', 'Seoul', 'chinese', 'north korean', 'North ’s', 'NLL', 'Koreas', 'North ’s', 'the North ’s Committee for Peaceful Unification of the Fatherland', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'the North ’s Korean Central News Agency', 'NLL', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'NLL', 'Navy', 'NLL', 'north korean', 'NLL', 'Seoul', 'NLL', 'Seoul', 'NLL', 'NLL', 'U.N.

Some 90 families have been temporarily reunited since Saturday for a three-day event. The first round involved another 90 families and ended Thursday.This isn't the first time a North Korean boat has crossed the NLL, with the communist country claiming a line further down south as the maritime border.The most recent transgression took place on Aug. 31, only six days after a landmark deal was reached between the Koreas to diffuse tension. Two more crossings took place earlier in June, with South Korea firing warning shots in all of the incidents. The family reunions that started last week are part of the deal.

German police said the stabbing of a prominent candidate Henriette Reker for Sunday`s mayoral election in Cologne had a ""racist political"" motive linked to the huge numbers of migrants entering the country.(AFP-Yonhap)She has pushed for a fairer distribution of people across the European Union, but the crisis has sorely tested ties between member states and put unprecedented strain on the right to free movement that is at the core of the 28-nation bloc’s values.Slovenia said Saturday it was drafting in the army to help police cope with an expected influx of thousands of migrants arriving after Hungary shut its border with Croatia overnight in its latest hardline move to stop the flow of people.More than 630,000 people fleeing war and misery in the Middle East and Africa have landed on Europe‘s shores this year, with many making risky sea crossings from Turkey to Greece.Highlighting the human cost of the crisis, another 12 people drowned on Saturday when their wooden boat sank off the Turkish coast as they were trying to reach the Greek island of Lesbos, Turkey’s Anatolia news agency reported.Most of the refugees and migrants are trying to get to Germany, Europe‘s economic powerhouse, which has said it expects up to one million asylum seekers this year after saying it would open its doors to Syrian refugees.Merkel’s policy has led to growing tensions in Germany, triggering a backlash from her conservative allies and spawning a growing number of increasingly vocal far-right protests.Reker, an independent close to Merkel‘s ruling Christian Democrats (CDU) responsible for refugee issues in Cologne, was stabbed in the neck at a party information stand in the city. Four other people were also injured, one of them seriously, with regional police chief Wolfgang Albers saying it was a “political act”.The attacker was arrested at the scene and told police he had “a racist motivation for committing this act,” Cologne police official Norbert Wagner said at a news conference.  (AFP)","german police said the stabbing ,seriously wounded on saturday ,tensions in germany triggering backlash ,sunday mayoral election in cologne ,was seriously wounded on saturday","['german', 'Angela Merkel', 'german', 'Cologne', 'Henriette Reker', 'Istanbul', 'turkish', 'Recep Tayyip Erdogan', 'Wolfgang Albers', 'Norbert Wagner', 'Cologne', 'western Germany', 'german', 'Henriette Reker', 'Cologne', 'the European Union', 'Slovenia', 'Hungary', 'Croatia', 'Turkey', 'Greece', 'turkish', 'greek', 'Lesbos', 'Turkey', 'Germany', 'syrian', 'Germany', 'Reker', 'christian Democrats', 'CDU', 'Cologne', 'Wolfgang Albers', 'cologne', 'Norbert Wagner', 'AFP']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51221341  0.56394237

It does not state the statute of limitations for the nullification.In February, a Chinese-Korean man surnamed Yang challenged the clause after he was stripped of his South Korean citizenship in 2013 for falsifying the paperwork during his naturalization. He had become a Korean citizen in December 2002.Yang said allowing the state to revoke citizenship ― albeit obtained via an illegal process ― whenever it wishes infringes upon the freedom to relocate and pursue happiness, and is in violation of the principal of prohibiting over-restriction stipulated in the constitution. “Recognizing the validity (of the citizenship) despite the illegal nature of its acquisition would effectively validate the illegal naturalization,” the court said in its ruling, adding that imposing only administrative punishments upon those who illegally obtained citizenship could not sufficiently fulfill the purpose of the nationality law. “The current law does not stipulate unconditional cancelation of an illegal naturalization, but requires the Justice Minister to consider whether or not to revoke the citizenship after considering the severity of the illegal action, the relationship of the person after being naturalized, the aftermath of the action and the time between the authorization and cancellation.”It also pointed out that a person whose citizenship has been revoked due to his or her wrongdoings is still entitled to one’s rights as a foreign citizen and can reapply to become a Korean citizen, which means it does not violate the principal of minimized infringement in the constitutional law.The case marked the first time the Constitutional Court officially recognized the legitimacy of not having limits to when an illegal naturalization can be revoked.Korea has recently seen an increase of cases involving the naturalization process, as it has become home to more foreign residents and naturalized Koreans than ever before.According to the Ministry of Interior, there were 1.38 million foreigners and 158,064 naturalized Koreans living in the country as of 2015. A total of 92,316 were naturalized through marriage. The number of foreign-born residents has increased each year since the government started tallying and has tripled compared to 530,000 in 2006, the ministry said.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","nullification in february chinese korean ,the illegal naturalization the court ,cancel an illegal naturalization process ,naturalization can be revoked korea ,to cancel an illegal naturalization","['South Korea ’s', 'Constitutional Court', 'chinese - korean', 'Yang', 'south korean', 'korean', 'Justice', 'korean', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Korea', 'Koreans', 'the Ministry of Interior', 'Koreans']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40919155 -0.25443423

According to the police, the 9-year-old boy threw a 1.83-kilogram cement brick from the rooftop of his 18-story apartment building in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province, on Oct. 8 as part of an experiment with two of his friends on how gravity worked.(Yonhap)The brick consequently killed the 55-year-old woman, identified only by her surname Park, and injured a 29-year-old woman, also surnamed Park, who were building a makeshift shelter for street cats in a garden on the first floor at the time.  The elder Park, later nicknamed “Cat Mom,” was rushed to a hospital, but later died. The younger Park, who was helping her, sustained a skull fracture. The boy confessed his crime to the police, who were questioning and searching the homes of some 20 residents who were present at the time of the incident. The National Forensic Service also confirmed that footprints found on the rooftop were his. The police called in the young suspect and his parents for questioning Thursday. His parents were unware that their son killed the woman, as he did not tell them about the incident for fear that he might be scolded, police said. The police concluded that the child had no intention to harm anyone with the brick. Even if he meant to kill the woman, those aged under 14 cannot be punished under the current law. But the victim’s family can file a lawsuit seeking financial compensation. With few clues and no witnesses suggesting a suspect, online users, the police and media initially speculated that the brick was intentionally thrown to harm the woman, as it was later revealed the two victims were regularly feeding stray cats and setting up shelters in the neighborhood.The “Cat Mom” case further shed light on brewing conflicts between cat lovers and their neighbors in Korean society. While pet lovers cite responsibility to protect all animals and take care of street cats in their neighborhood, opponents accuse them of encouraging noisy, unsanitary cats to reproduce. Some netizens went as far as to post messages describing various ways to stop those helping cats. Suggestions included putting rat poison in food offered to the cats or overdosing cats with painkillers. A photo of a warning sign went viral, reading: “Don’t feed cats here. If caught feeding cats, I will cut your wrists.” According to the Seoul government, the number of “Cat Moms” and “Cat Dads” hovers around 3,000, with nearly 250,000 stray cats living in the city.

As the 40-year-old automatically lost his South Korean citizenship when he left the country at the age of four to be adopted, Crapser has always been effectively stateless.Newly released South Korean government data showed that almost 10 percent of 166,138 registered Korean adoptees who left the country since the 1950s may be in Crapser’s shoes. According to the report published by Rep. Nam In-soon of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, some 15,592 Koreans adopted by foreign nationals may be stateless, a vast majority of them estimated to be living in the U.S.The individuals account for 9.3 percent of all Korean adoptees, according to the report.According to the lawmaker, most nations in Europe and Australia have been granting automatic citizenship to foreign-born children who arrived in their countries through international adoption. However, this was not the case in the U.S. until 2001. Prior to 2001, children were required to enter the country on foreign-born adoption visas, sponsored by adoption agencies. Once the adoption visa expires after six months, it was the adoptive parents’ responsibility to file for their children’s American citizenship. Lawmaker Nam said most of the 15,592 Korean adoptees who may be stateless are estimated to be those living in the U.S., who have never been formally naturalized in the country as their adoptive parents did not apply for their citizenship. Of the 166,138 Korean children -- local NGOs estimate that the actual number is 200,000 -- who were sent abroad for international adoption since the 1950s, some 100,000 were adopted to the U.S.In 2000, lawmakers in the U.S. made citizenship automatic for international adoptees. But the law, which took effect in February 2001, excluded adoptees 19 or older at the time. Many, including Crapser (he was already 26 in 2001), did not meet the criteria and fell in a legal loophole.Rep. Nam said the Ministry of Health and Welfare almost made no efforts to tackle the issue, although it had said back in 2012 that it will collaborate with the U.S. government to seek ways to support those in need of citizenship.“The Korean government needs to do more to tackle this issue,” she said.Meanwhile, Crapser’s next hearing is scheduled on Oct. 20 at the federal building in Portland, the U.S. He is currently subject to the U.S. federal immigration law that makes non-citizens with criminal records face deportation.

According to the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, the 43-year-old Chinese diver fainted when a sudden blast took place in the nose of the 6,825-ton ship on Monday evening while he was participating in a propeller-cutting operation. The diver was immediately pulled to the surface by a colleague and moved to the hospital. He is in stable condition, but reportedly suffering from peritonitis and body muscle pain resulting from decompression. The blast is suspected to have occurred due to the combination of sparks and air that was being used for the propeller-cutting job. A consortium led by Chinese state-run company Shanghai Salvage has been leading the ship recovery work since August. Over 100 Chinese divers and workers are currently carrying out preparations for the actual recovery of the ship, with an aim to pull the ferry out of the water no later than June next year.

Hong allegedly needed to secure some 30 million won ($25,000) to invest in opening a restaurant with his friend. According to the police, Hong had planned the crime in advance, stealing a kitchen knife from a local market and researching the indoor shooting range online.The suspect said during police questioning that he had attempted to steal a handgun and bullets at the range on Thursday, but gave up as two male staff were at the scene. On Saturday morning he committed the crime when only the female owner was at the range, with the other male staff member on duty having left to go to the supermarket. Hong received 50 bullets from the store, of which he fired 20 at the range. He then fled with the 45-caliber handgun and 19 bullets after stabbing the owner.The 46-year-old woman was taken to hospital, but is not in a life-threatening condition.Police immediately mobilized all officers in the region and asked the public for help to track him down by releasing CCTV footage of the suspect through media.Investigators acquired his fingerprints from a daily business log at the range, which enabled them to locate the suspect by detecting a signal from his mobile phone.Hong purportedly changed his clothes in the building next to the range and took taxis twice to flee until he was forced out of the taxi and captured by the police at 1:40 p.m. the same day. The police recovered the handgun and 19 bullets on the spot.The incident has unleashed a fresh debate over lax gun regulations at indoor ranges across the nation.During the news briefing on Sunday, a chief of the Busanjin Police Station noted that anyone could access the guns at the range without a key.The relevant law requires indoor ranges to have at least three staff members onsite for safety, but there are no rules allowing punishment of those who break the law. The customers’ identities are not properly checked at most of the ranges, with Hong’s personal information on the business log turning out to be fake. “The loose management at the indoor range caused a casualty, but it will not likely face penalties for its wrongdoing,” a police source said, citing a lack of ordinances on gun control at indoor ranges. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","bullets after stabbing the owner ,stealing handgun and 19 bullets ,after stabbing the owner ,from stealing handgun and 19 ,after stabbing the owner the","['Busan', 'Hong', 'Hong', 'Hong', 'Hong', 'CCTV', 'the Busanjin Police Station', 'Hong']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36534536  0.0459176

Those killed in the accident also included some 200 high school students on a school excursion.The 15 surviving crew members of the ferry have been handed down prison terms ranging from five to 30 years while the ship's 68-year-old captain Lee Joon-seok has been sentenced to 36 years in prison.So far, 47.2 billion won has been paid in compensation to the victims' families or those injured in the accident.The amount also includes compensation for residents and fishermen from the areas close to the accident site who had been forced to give up their daily work to make way for search and rescue operations that lasted nearly seven months until mid-November.A fresh search operation is now under way, this time to recover the ship and the bodies of nine victims who remain missing.

According to the studies, which monitored a total of nine TV channels and their daily news shows from Aug. 1-8, male hosts were four times more likely to open the shows by delivering the first news segment of the programs compared to their female counterparts. Also, male anchors in general were significantly older -- on average by 10 to 20 years -- than female anchors. Among the 18 male anchors working for the news shows for the nine channels, including KBS, MBC and YTN, four of them were in their 30s, eight in their 40s and six in their 50s. None were in their 20s.  A news program by MBC (MBC)However, eight female hosts hired by the nine broadcasters were in their 20s, the second largest number of any age group. Nine of them were in their 30s while only one of them was in her 40s. None of the women were in their 50s.“The age difference gives the male anchors more authority as they have more experience and more expertise,” said a researcher at the Korean Institute of Gender Equality Promotion and Education, the think tank that released the studies. “We never see a female anchor in her 50s paired up with a male anchor in his 20s. The age difference between male and female anchors gives an impression that women hosts are only doing supportive, complementary roles while their male counterparts are the ones who are delivering the ‘important’ news.”The studies also discovered that male TV reporters in general appeared more on shows than their female counterparts. Among a total of 966 TV news reports aired by the nine channels, 64 percent were reported by male reporters. The studies also found that while most male reporters were in charge of covering politics, economy and social affairs, many female reporters were placed to cover life or cultural events.Also, among some 1,141 individuals interviewed for the TV news programs, 30 percent of them were women. In particular, women only accounted for about 10 percent of the interviewees considered as experts, such as lawyers, university professors or scientists.The think tank also monitored a total of six daily newspapers, including the Chosun Ilbo, JoongAng Ilbo and the Kyunghyang Shinmun, in August. The study found that among a total of 1,209 stories published by the papers, only 7.8 percent of them were about women’s issues. Also, among a total of 66 contributing writers for the papers, only 15.2 percent were women.“Some of the reasons why there is so little coverage on women’s issues while there are still so few women who work as contributing writers have to do with the general social perception that does not value women’s experiences and their expertise,” said Kim Ha-ing, president of the KIGEPE, through a statement. “And in order to bring changes to this general perception, the role of the media is crucial. We need equal coverage on the experiences of both genders.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","male tv reporters in general ,mbc however eight female hosts ,10 percent of the interviewees ,most male reporters ,20 years than female anchors","['South Korea', 'KBS', 'MBC', 'YTN', 'MBC', 'MBC)However', 'the Korean Institute of Gender Equality Promotion and Education', 'Chosun Ilbo', 'JoongAng Ilbo', 'Kim Ha - ing', 'KIGEPE', 'Claire Lee']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.92758101  0.8928923

The $110 million agreement was clinched between the Korea Aerospace Industries and the Thai government in Seoul. The supersonic aircraft, built with technical assistance from the American defense giant Lockheed Martin, is scheduled to be delivered by March 2018. The Thai Air Force has been pushing to replace its L39 jets manufactured in the former Czechoslovakia and used for more than 30 years. Its cabinet approved 3.7 billion baht ($103 million) for the project late last year. The country’s sole aircraft maker vied with those from the U.S., Russia, China and Italy. The Sacheon, South Gyeongsang Province-headquartered company and its Chinese competitor had been seen as the most likely winners. “The decision by the Thai Air Force, which has long purchased cutting-edge weapons systems made by aerospace powerhouses, will provide a chance for its long-term partnership with KAI,” the firm said in a press statement. “The T-50 is the best alternative for the force’s drive to modernize its military and cultivate fourth-generation combat pilots.” The latest agreement may pave the way for additional sales of the T-50 as Thailand is reportedly seeking to bring in as many as 24 more trainer jets in the coming months. If KAI wins the contract, the sum is likely to near $800 million, the largest package for the model’s exports. KAI is also setting sights on the U.S. Air Force’s $10 billion program called T-X to adopt new two-seat, faster jet trainers to replace the Northrop T-38 Talon. The winner is expected to be announced in the second half of 2017, company officials said. On the industry front, the deal highlights South Korea’s efforts to shore up its charges into the global warplane market.  KAI sealed a $420 million contract with the Philippines last year to sell 12 light attack FA-50 fighters, the T-50’s armed version, a $1.1 billion deal with Iraq in 2013 to supply 24 FA-50s and a $400 million bid with Indonesia in 2011 to provide 16 T-50s. In 2013, Thailand signed its largest-ever naval procurement agreement worth 14.6 billion baht to purchase a multipurpose frigate from South Korea’s Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering, with its delivery slated for 2018.

Security Council resolutions if it forges ahead with its plans to launch a satellite using ballistic missile technology.State Department spokesman John Kirby made the remark after the North's space agency strongly suggested that the country may launch a satellite aboard a long-range rocket around next month's 70th anniversary of the foundation of the ruling Workers' Party.""There are multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions that require North Korea to suspend all activity related to their ballistic missile program, and establish a moratorium on missile launches, stop conducting any launches using ballistic missile technology and abandon its ballistic missile program in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner,"" Kirby said.""So any satellite launch using ballistic missile technology is a clear violation"" of U.N. resolutions, he said.Speculation has persisted that the North could launch a long-range rocket to mark the anniversary after a recent upgrade enabled the launch site to handle bigger rockets. Monday's statement from the North's National Aerospace Development Administration was Pyongyang's first official acknowledgment of the possibility.""The world will clearly see a series of satellites of (North) Korea soaring into the sky at the times and locations determined by the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea,"" the KCNA reported in an English statement, without elaborating.The North also claimed it has the right to launch rockets for peaceful purposes.Pyongyang has long been accused of using long-range rocket launches as a pretext for test-firing intercontinental ballistic missiles. Experts say long-range rockets and ICBMs are basically the same with differences only in payloads.The North is believed to have honed advanced ballistic missile technologies through a series of test launches, including a 2012 launch that succeeded in putting a satellite into orbit. That test is considered the most successful so far.The test also sparked fears that the North has moved closer to ultimately developing nuclear-tipped missiles that could potentially reach the United States mainland. The country has so far conducted three underground nuclear tests: in 2006, 2009 and 2013.

Park’s son was thrown back into the spotlight after a local broadcaster reported that a lawsuit filed by a group of 1,000 citizens remains pending against the son, who they claimed allegedly submitted someone else’s X-rays photos to get exempted. The son had faced a similar lawsuit in 2013 but was acquitted.“Our decision on (Park’s son) is lawful. I can tell you for sure,” said Park Chang-myung, commissioner of the Military Manpower Administration. He also confirmed that the Magnetic Resonance Imaging films are those of Park’s son. Seoul city mayor Park Won-soon. Yonhap.Lawmakers also clashed over the allegation. The ruling Saenuri Party urged Park’s son to testify before a court to clear the charges, while the main opposition New Political Alliance for Democracy labeled the call as a smear campaign to tarnish Park, who leads the polls among opposition presidential hopefuls.Seoul City authorities described the news report as biased and filed a lawsuit against the broadcaster. A Seoul City senior official said in a news conference that the program intentionally left out the prosecutors’ decision to acquit Park’s son of the allegation that he violated the military service law.Park, for his part, vowed to fight back against the accusation and urged the public to support his claim. “I can exercise tolerance toward whom I can protect,” said Park on his Facebook account. “Authorities have already confirmed that the allegation is unfounded.

YonhapThe budget for the labor reform was to be submitted later Friday. The government will start work on the bill with the ruling Saenuri Party next week, Choi said.Seoul had set Thursday as the deadline for the tripartite committee to see eye to eye on labor market reform, negotiations over which resumed late last month after collapsing in April.Issues to be covered in the government-Saenuri bill include raising unemployment benefits, reducing working hours and expanding the compensation for workers injured while commuting.The Labor Ministry also plans to iron out administrative guidelines that will make it easier for companies to lay off underperforming workers and introduce policies that penalize workers for poor performance. These have been among the most contentious issues in the three-way talks.Labor Minister Lee Ki-kweon said while the workers should back down on the lay-offs issue, the corporations should make compromises by hiring more workers.

In the still-available clip, Banks, an African-American TV personality, claims that the surgery that the 25-year-old Korean-American named Liz received was an attempt to “look more Caucasian” by Asian women. “You and I are the same,” Banks tells Liz, pointing her own artificially straightened hair. Her voice is firm and even intimidating.“I know I’m not going to look white with a hair weave. But it’s still one step closer to (looking white). And your eyelid is one step closer. Do you understand?”Are women like Liz really trying to “look white” by undergoing the procedure that creates a permanent crease on upper eyelids without even realizing it? In today’s Korea, where 20 percent of the female population has had plastic surgery at least once in their lives, the public rarely associates its ever-booming cosmetic surgery industry with race or the nation’s turbulent modern history. “I would get serious complaints if I performed the procedure and the Korean patient gets a crease like the one of a Caucasian person. What people want is a natural crease that is suited to Asian faces,” said Seoul-based plastic surgeon Na Min-hwa, who has been performing the procedure for the past 15 years. “The whole idea that undergoing this surgery is an attempt to look white is absurd.”A number of studies, however, have suggested that the introduction of the double-eyelid surgery to the Korean Peninsula in the 1950s was closely related to racism and the U.S. military agenda, and that legacy still carries a significance today.Most popular plastic surgery in the worldWith or without Tyra Banks’ rant, the double-eyelid operation has evolved into an even more popular procedure in Asia and the rest of the world in recent years. According to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, the procedure was the most-performed plastic surgery worldwide last year. Some 1.43 million individuals underwent the procedure, including Asian-Americans, accounting for 14.8 percent of all cosmetic surgery performed across the globe in 2014. South Korea, meanwhile, performed the fourth-most cosmetic surgical procedures in the world last year.Among the well-known Korean figures who have had the procedure are former President Roh Moo-hyun and veteran singer Patti Kim.The surgery was first developed and performed in Korea by Dr. D. Ralph Millard, an American military plastic surgeon who was stationed in the country during the Korean War (1950-53). Among the very first Koreans who received the particular procedure were Korean war brides who married American soldiers. It is estimated that 50 percent of Asians have naturally creased eyes. However, the preference for double eyelids among Asians today is not “inherent, natural or random,” according to scholar Taeyon Kim. “This preference has an historical development that is shaped by the motives of the American Cold War that produced the Asian as an ambivalent threat that needed to be contained and domesticated,” Kim wrote in her 2005 Ph.D. dissertation submitted to Bowling Green State University. 'Superior palpebral fold'Although it is believed that double eyelid surgery was first introduced in late 19th-century Japan, it was during the Korean War that the operation became popular in Asia, according to Kim’s research. According to Kim, Millard was stationed in Korea during the war as part of an American public relations campaign to show “American’s benevolent face to the Koreans.” On top of developing and performing double eyelid surgery ― which was the alteration of “Oriental” features to “Occidental” ― he was also committed to serving those who were severely injured on the battlefield and in need of surgical reconstruction. During the war, Korean eyes without the crease ― referred to as the superior palpebral fold in American medical texts ― were dubbed “slanted,” and were seen as a mark of inscrutability and deviance. In her text, Kim argued that it was significant that Millard, who is one of the pioneers of Asian double eyelid surgery, was a military surgeon whose experience of Asian bodies was firmly rooted in Cold War ideologies and discourses. “Surgically altering the ‘slanted’ eyes became a mark of a ‘good’ and trustworthy Asian, one whose modification of the face provided a comforting illustration of the pliable Asian, and served as evidence of the U.S. as the model and Asia as the mimic,” Kim wrote. The scholar pointed out that the legacy of such notions can be found even in the popular advertisements in Korea in the 2000s. The perceived enlargement of the eyes by undergoing the procedure is described in ways that suggest a “broadening of the mind, a brightening of the soul, and confidence in the spirit” in modern Korean ads, according to the scholar. In 1964, Millard wrote why the Koreans without the fold are problematic. “The absence of the palpebral fold produces a passive expression which seems to epitomize the stoical and unemotional manner of the oriental,” he wrote. Korean military brides to AmericaAlthough the War Brides Act in 1945 enabled American soldiers stationed overseas to bring home wives of a different race, interracial marriages were illegal in parts of the U.S. until the early 1960s. In such a political climate, Korean military brides were considered both cultural and racial threats to the U.S., which influenced many Korean women, especially those who wished to marry American soldiers, to alter their eyes in the 1950s.“It is felt that this deorientalizing problem may well come home to the American plastic surgeon, for there have been well over 10,000 Japanese war brides as well as many post-war marriages with Korean girls,” wrote the American surgeon Millard in 1955.According to Yuh Ji-yeon’s 2002 study on Korean military brides, the women who were brought to American families at the time were strictly pressured to nurture their children as future Americans and provide their husbands with an American lifestyle: “Their fear was that, unless properly Americanized, the women would ‘foreignize’ their husbands and children.”David Palumbo-Liu’s book, “Asian American: Historical Crossings of a Racial Frontier” talks about how cosmetic surgery reduced such American anxieties by demonstrating the “shaping power of the U.S.” and the “malleability of Asia.” By altering their eyes, the Korean brides became less threatening racially, while their “passive, compliant” nature would make them easily assimilate, according to the studies. “While it is primarily beauty that motivates (today’s women’s) desire to alter their eyes, this beauty is built on a legacy of a history of Western science and race that privileged the white body as the normal, beautiful body,” Kim wrote in her study.Unconscious legacy Song Ji-hye, a Seoul native, underwent double eyelid surgery in 2005, at age of 19. The 29-year-old said she just wanted to have a more “defined look,” and had no desire to look white.“I’ve never had anyone asking me if I underwent the surgery in order to look more white,” she said. “I’ve never seen anyone who underwent the procedure for that reason, either. It sounds absurd to me. Caucasians are not the only racial group of people who have double eyelids. If anything, I think those who undergo the procedure want to look like fellow Asians who have naturally creased eyes.”Culture critic Lee Moon-won said most Koreans are unconscious of the Western influence on the country’s beauty standards, partly because they are not often exposed to ethnic or racial diversity. “Most people don’t think they want to look white, and that may be true,” he said. “But when you think about it, what the society collectively considers as beautiful ― big eyes, a small face, and perked nose ― are things that many Koreans can’t achieve naturally. The (Western) influence is there, but people don’t question it because the society has very narrowly defined notions of beauty. When everyone wants to look the same way, you think that’s the normal way regardless of its history or meaning.”Millard in 1955 predicted that the double-eyelid surgery would be useful in the U.S. to assimilate the children of military brides from Asia. “Especially in the products of the second generation, the plastic surgeon may be called upon to help them blend with their surroundings,” he wrote.Some 60 years have passed, and South Korea has evolved into the world’s plastic surgery-capital. A total of 440,582 surgical operations were performed in Korea last year alone, accounting for 4.6 percent of all procedures performed in the world. Double-eyelid surgery is one of the most common procedures being performed here. In the U.S., plastic surgery is on the rise among Asian-Americans overall, with 44 percent of them opting to receive double-eyelid surgery. And women continue to be shamed in both countries. Song Ji-hye was once called a “seonggwei,” meaning “plastic surgery monster” by a male colleague at a drinking party.“You get shamed no matter what,” Song said. “If you don’t get it, you are made fun of your looks, and once you get the procedure, you are shamed for having done it or not being naturally beautiful. I think it’s better to at least look good if you are going to be shamed anyway.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","war marriages with korean girls ,double eyelid surgery went viral ,attacking young korean american woman ,korean military brides to americaalthough ,ever booming cosmetic surgery industry","['Tyra Banks', 'korean', 'Banks', 'african - american', 'korean - American', 'Liz', 'caucasian', 'asian', 'bank', 'Liz', 'Liz', 'Korea', 'korean', 'caucasian', 'asian', 'Seoul', 'Na Min - hwa', 'U.S.', 'the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery', 'Asian - Americans', 'South Korea', 'korean', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Patti Kim', 'Korea', 'D.

A 27-year-old sergeant surnamed Kim who was giving guidelines in the same trench was immediately hospitalized to treat shrapnel wounds all over his body but died at 12:53 p.m., officials said. The blast also severed Sohn’s right wrist. He underwent surgery at Kyungpook National University Hospital. Another 27-year-old sergeant surnamed Park, who was about 1 meter away from the recruit, also suffered injuries to his left leg, said Maj. Gen. Koo Hong-mo, head of operations at the Joint Chiefs of Staff.“The grenade detonated in the trainee’s hand just when he was about to hurl it,” Koo said during a parliamentary audit later in the day. Police enter an Army training center in Daegu where a grenade blast killed one instructor and injured two soldiers on Friday. (Yonhap)Some other 200 soldiers were at the site for their fourth week of training, but no one else was hurt, he noted. The military has launched an investigation to examine if the device was faulty and how the incident happened. The K413 is an upgrade to the Korean-made K400 fragmentation grenade, which went off at a boot camp last September in Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province, killing three. Yet the new model showed poor performance during a regular ammunition test conducted in April 2014 by the Army as six out of 30 units exploded before the three-second threshold, according to Rep. Kim Kwang-jin of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, citing documents submitted by the Army and the Defense Agency for Technology and Quality. Though the DTaQ determined that the premature blast resulted from manufacturing defects after a seven-month-long analysis, the military recalled only 60,000 units produced in 2011. About 1 million K413s have been delivered since 2010, with the current inventory standing at around 250,000, the lawmaker said. “Given the discovery of the flaws, the military should halt the use of the grenade and consider retracting all existing ones at least until the exact cause of the incident comes to light,” Kim said. The explosion in Daegu is the latest in a string of military accidents involving firearms, land mines and other weapons. In November 2008, a blast occurred within a guard post in Cheorwon County, Gyeonggi Province, after a private broke the return rule and threw a grenade in a barrack where 16 other servicemen were asleep. The incident wounded five.

Lee No-keun of the ruling Saenuri Party, over 40 cases in violation of the aviation safety regulations were caught last year, which was triple the figure of 2013. In-flight smoking was the most common violation, accounting for 80 percent. Most of them were caught while smoking in the restroom, the report said. By law, anyone smoking in the airplane can be fined up to 5 million won ($4,200). A total of 12 cases were related to affrays, while six other cases were sexual crimes, including sexually harassing flight attendants or masturbating in the seats. Meanwhile, another report by Rep. Kang Seok-ho of the same party showed that crime occurrences surged not only in the flights, but also at the airport.About 1,000 violations were caught at Incheon International Airport over the last three years, with theft accounting for 30 percent of the total.Thefts continue to rise, with over 60 cases already being reported this year, double that of 2010, Kang said. The apprehension rate for theft, however, remained around 40 percent over the past six years, the lawmaker added.The number of lost items also rose every year, with the return rate staying under 50 percent. The number of lost belongings reached around 30,000 last year. Of them, only about 40 percent were returned to owners.As part of the efforts to raise the collection rate, the airport police has recently expanded the lost-and-found office and started to offer delivery of lost items through a parcel service.

Byun Jae-il ahead of the annual parliamentary audit of the government.   The lawmaker's office said that Incheon International Airport scored an average of 76.93 points among the nine categories checked, way below Gimpo International Airport in western Seoul, which got 96.37 points. Jeju International Airport, on the southernmost resort island of Jeju, came in second with 88.80 points, with Gimhae International Airport in the second-largest city of Busan trailing at 85.72.Incheon International Airport, one of the largest and busiest airports in Northeast Asia, is located 48 kilometers west of Seoul.""Incheon's score was mostly affected by high food prices at the airport,"" the office said. ""The airport got low marks in terms of accessibility from major urban hubs, expensive parking fees and courteousness of employees.""The low score comes as a surprise because Incheon International Airport, the main gateway to South Korea, has been rated as one of the best airports in the world by Airports Council International as well as being viewed as one of the world's finest transit hubs by Skytrax since 2005.ACI is the only global trade representative of the world's airports, while Skytrax provides consultancy on airlines and airports as well as conducting customer reviews.Rep. Byun of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy pointed out that the practice of engaging in competitive bidding when renting out its shopping spaces and facilities has led to record profits for the airport authority, but such gains have not translated into better service for local users.""With users' complaints growing, there is a need to rethink the airport's operating process,"" the lawmaker argued.

(Yonhap)The doctor had come under media attention after the Seoul city government and Mayor Park Won-soon accused him of putting the lives of nearly 1,500 people in danger by continuing to attend social gatherings and treat his patients even after becoming aware of his possible exposure to the potentially deadly disease.The doctor, whose identity has been withheld for privacy reasons, has dismissed the accusation.Since the country reported its first MERS case on May 20, the disease has infected 186 people, killing 36 of them.No additional cases or fatalities have been reported since early July. An official declaration of the end of the MERS outbreak can be made 28 days after every person ever diagnosed with MERS completely recovers from the disease.MERS is a viral disease that is still fairly new to humans. No vaccine or treatment is currently available for the disease, apparently a reason for the high fatality rate of around 36 percent globally.In South Korea, the fatality rate of the disease remains at 19.4 percent.

The 9.77-ton boat called the Dolgorae, or Dolphin, was found about 6:25 a.m. Sunday near Chuja Island, north of the southern resort island of Jeju, the maritime security agency said. The boat lost contact with another chartered fishing boat around 7:38 p.m.Saturday, about half an hour after it left Chuja for Haenam, South Jeolla Province, it said.Originally, the fishing boat was chartered for two days and was scheduled to return to Chuja late Sunday.In the operations, 25 coast guard vessels, seven naval vessels, another three from the local government in addition to nearly 40 private fishing boats were dispatched to the site of the accident, according to the Ministry of Public Safety and Security. More than 20 divers were mobilized, including special forces from the coast guard, for underwater search operations. The coast guard is carrying out search operations in a large circle around Seosaengi Island, where the survivors were found and 500 kilometers from the northeast part of Chuja Island, the last known location of the ill-fated boat.As the waves are expected to be about two to three meters high with winds of up to 14 meters per second until tomorrow, the operations face potential difficulties. The coast guard said it has started an investigation into the boat's sinking. It said based on the testimony of survivors, the tragedy may have been caused by high waves or by the fishing vessel getting snarled in a rope of some kind.Related to the tragedy, observers said that there were critical lapses in the reporting process that delayed rescue operations.While it was around 7:40 a.m. that the boat last identified its location, it wasn't until 8:30 p.m., when the captain of another fishing boat that accompanied the Dolgorae reported the situation to authorities, that the vessel traffic service or the coast guard became aware of the accident, coast guard officials said.It took another 23 minutes before the Chuja safety center radioed the coast guard about the missing boat. Coast guard officials said that after being notified of the boat's possible distress, the safety center could not get a fix on the boat and it wasted precious time trying to contact those on board by mobile phone. All such developments affected the time it took for rescuers to reach the stricken boat and the survivors.Even after the coast guard was notified, it may have misjudged where the ship was, and sent ships and planes to the wrong area, observers said.

Only three were saved by a passing boat 11 hours after the incident. A probe is underway, but high waves are suspected to be the cause, the authorities said.Family members of those missing from the capsized boat wait for news at a makeshift station set up at a gymnasium in Haenam, South Jeolla Province, Sunday afternoon. (Yonhap)The maritime police said the initial response to the accident was delayed largely because of a false report by a man who was supposed to be on board but was not.The police said the first distress call was received by the Chuja Safety Center at 8:40 p.m. by another fishing boat, which safely completed its route. The time was about an hour after the Dolgorae is presumed to have capsized. The captain of the other boat reported that the captain of Dolgorae did not respond to his call. The safety center immediately called all the passengers based on the passenger list. While no one onboard responded, one man whose information was withheld replied to a call saying the boat was sailing well, the police said.Later, however, it was found that the man had lied, concerned that he might get punished for not boarding the boat, although he had put his name on the list, the police said.Worried about the passengers’ safety, the man later told the truth to the safety center, after he discovered that no one was responding to his calls. Right after the Korea Coast Guard received the report from the man around 9 p.m., it dispatched three patrol ships to an area where the capsized boat was likely to have drifted. The Coast Guard estimated the probable site with its “drift prediction system,” which projects possible locations of the drifting ship based on calculations of wind and water flow. The ships searched the east side of where the boat’s last positioning signal was detected. The boat, however, was found in the southwestern area 11 hours after it capsized. “The system didn’t seem to reflect real-time weather updates,” the Jeju Coast Guard officials said. The drift prediction system, launched in 2009 with an injection of over 14 billion won ($11.6 million), was introduced to the Korea Coast Guard in 2012. Poor management of the passenger list was also deemed to have aggravated the rescue efforts.It took hours for the authorities to confirm the exact number of passengers, since four of the 22 names on the list were found not to have taken the vessel. Three unregistered passengers were found to have boarded the boat in their stead. Of the three, one survived and two were found dead.Authorities later confirmed that a total of 21 passengers were on board.While commercial fishing boats usually submit the passenger list before sailing, there are no regulations to force cross-checking of the listed people and the actual passengers. Lax safety measures onboard were also dubbed a reason for the casualties, as many of the passengers were reportedly not wearing life jackets that were soaked from rain.The Coast Guard began an underwater search Monday as part of the efforts to find the missing. Relatives of the missing also urged the government to clearly investigate the accident. The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy condemned the authorities, calling it a smaller version of the “Sewol” tragedy, referring to the sinking of a large ferry that claimed the lives of 295 last year. They vowed to grill those responsible during the parliamentary audit session.The ruling Saenuri Party pledged to review the fishing boat safety laws and come up with countermeasures to better ensure the safety of fishermen and prevent similar accidents. It also vowed to pass a fishing law that has been pending in the National Assembly. The law would require all boat passengers to wear life jackets while fishing. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Public Safety and Security vowed to take stern action against groundless rumors over the accident. Rumors were spreading online that the Coast Guard deliberately ignored the rescue requests of the survivors at sea. Anyone spreading falsehoods can be sentenced to up to five years in jail or fined up to 15 million won.

Lee said that four people who were originally listed as having been passengers were not on the boat, while three that were not registered did get on the vessel. Originally, the fishing boat was chartered for two days and was scheduled to return to Chuja late Sunday.The official said that Kim Cheol-soo, the 46-year-old captain of the boat, was among the dead.

She expressed gratitude to Xi for the constructive role Beijing has played in defusing tension.   The North's committee for the peaceful reunification of Korea said that South Korea should refrain from making comments that could dampen inter-Korean ties.   ""If the South's leader has basic political perspectives, (she) should be careful of making comments that can hamper inter-Korean relations at a sensitive time,"" the committee said in a statement, carried by the North's Korean Central News Agency.   ""Currently, inter-Korean ties are like standing on thin ice that can be easily broken,"" it said, adding that whether the bilateral relations can be improved hinges on Seoul's attitude.   Just one day before, the North denied Seoul's claims that its recent expression of regret over the land mine explosion near the inter-Korean border in early August is equal to an apology.   Last week long-strained Seoul-Pyongyang ties took a dramatic twist as the two sides reached a landmark deal on easing military tension and resuming a much-awaited reunion of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War.   The North expressed ""regret"" over the land mine explosion that left two South Korean soldiers seriously injured as part of the deal.

The incident took place at 11:46 a.m. on Sunday in Yeoncheon, Gyeonggi Province, during a scouting mission around an area where the Army intentionally planted mines to deter a possible intrusion by North Korean troops. The staff sergeant, who was wearing galoshes and other protective gear, suffered a slight fracture in his left heel, military officials said.  (Defense Ministry)Following a probe, the Joint Chiefs of Staff concluded that the detonated device was the South’s antipersonnel M-14, citing plastic remnants found near the scene, the testimonies of other team members and the way the mine inflicted wounds. “The mine zone was set up as a means to hamper the enemy’s incursion, and the injured officer apparently strayed from the narrow pathway while handling communications devices,” a JCS official told reporters on customary condition of anonymity. “He underwent surgery yesterday at the Armed Forces Capital Hospital (in Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province) and is expected to fully recover in two to three months.”Military officials were cautious about the disclosure of the incident and its timing. It took place while high-level inter-Korean talks were underway, as the sides locked horns over the Aug. 4 land mine blast in the DMZ. While the South pointed to the North as the culprit, the North denied responsibility, though it later conceded and displayed regret in a joint statement.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","wounded in an explosion last ,in an explosion last weekend ,army intentionally planted mines to ,an explosion last weekend ,explosion last weekend of land","['Army', 'south korean', 'the Demilitarized Zone', 'Yeoncheon , Gyeonggi Province', 'Army', 'north korean', 'defense', 'the Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'JCS', 'the Armed Forces Capital Hospital', 'Seongnam', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'inter - korean', 'DMZ', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",3,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.64279503 -0.25605351

The move came after a series of false conscription text messages and rumors were massively circulated after the North fired artillery across the border last Thursday. A 23-year-old college student surnamed Kim was arrested Thursday for spreading massive draft texts. The message said “discharged men aged between 21 and 33 will be drafted once the war is imminent,” adding that all should check their designated military camp’s website on the ministry’s homepage once the war declaration is confirmed. The message was sent under the name of the Defense Ministry. Kim reportedly claimed that it was a prank.  Earlier this month, another rumor was circulated saying that the recent landmine attack by the North in the Demilitarized Zone seriously injuring two South Korean soldiers was manipulated by the South. The police said such false messages are commonly spread when inter-Korean tensions are high.Most of the false rumor spreaders were found to be college students or office workers in their 20s, the authorities added.The police warned that those spreading false draft rumors can be punished with up to five years in prison or a fine of up to 10 million won ($8,400) for interfering with the Defense Ministry’s operations, officials said. Investigators also vowed that they would consider such an act as an attempt to benefit the enemy and sternly punish the spreaders in accordance with law. The police added that they would conduct online monitoring around the clock and promptly launch probes if any similarly groundless rumors are found.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","arrested thursday for spreading massive ,south korean police vowed sunday ,korean police vowed sunday ,was arrested thursday for spreading ,thursday for spreading massive draft","['south korean', 'Koreas', 'Kim', 'the Defense Ministry', 'Kim', 'Demilitarized Zone', 'south korean', 'inter - korean', 'the Defense Ministry ’s', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.04594849  0.42172983

Witnesses told local TV that the jet appeared to have crashed when it failed to pull out of a loop maneuver. West Sussex Police said seven people died at the scene and one patient with life-threatening injuries was taken to the hospital. Another 14 people were treated for minor injuries.News video and photographs showed a fireball erupting near trees and huge plumes of thick black smoke rising. A witness, Stephen Jones, told the BBC that the pilot had just begun his display. An explosion at the Shoreham Air Show, in Sussex, Britain, Aug. 22, after a fighter jet crashed. The 1950s Hawker Hunter crashed into several cars on a nearby road exploding in a huge fireball. Although the pilot was pulled alive from the wreckage, seven others have been confirmed dead. (Yonhap)“He’d gone up into a loop and as he was coming out of the loop I just thought, you’re too low, you’re too low, pull up. And he flew straight into the ground either on or very close to the A27, which runs past the airport,” Jones said.The force said all the deaths were believed to have occurred on the road, and no one on the airfield was believed injured. It was not known whether the pilot was able to eject.The road was closed in both directions Saturday.Crashes at British airshows are rare, but in 2007 the pilot of a World War II Hurricane died at the Shoreham Airshow after performing an unplanned barrel-roll.“We mustn’t rush to knee jerk reactions about the safety of airshows,” said Tim Loughton, a member of Britain’s parliament who represents Shoreham. “This is an airshow that’s been going for 26 years, only the second time there’s been any serious accident, and the first time that spectators and people on the ground have been affected, bad though that is.” (AP)","road saturday killing seven people ,british airshow crashed into busy ,saturday killing seven people and ,saturday killing seven people ,killing seven people and injuring","['british', 'Hawker Hunter', 'Brighton', 'England', 'West Sussex Police', 'Stephen Jones', 'BBC', 'Sussex', 'Britain', 'Hawker Hunter', 'Jones', 'crash', 'british', 'Tim Loughton', 'Britain', 'AP']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.19322783  0.62918925

YonhapThe list includes about 200 residents in Yeoncheon County, Gyeonggi Province, where artillery shells fired by North Korea fell Thursday afternoon. Last October, North Korea fired artillery at Yeoncheon to shoot down balloons carrying propaganda leaflets across the border. South Korea also returned fire.

It was the first shutdown since North Korea’s shelling of Yeonpyeongdo Island in 2010. Concerns also grew over the safety of 924 South Korean citizens visiting or working in North Korean territory.The Ministry of Unification said 840 people were staying at the North’s border town of Gaeseong and 83 people were in Pyongyang to attend an international soccer match.

Song Ji-yeon, a 31-year-old office worker in southern Seoul, said that the fear is much stronger this time because it was an artillery attack striking South Korean soil. “Compared to the previous attack by North Korea on Yeonpyeongdo Island, I think the latest artillery shelling seem to be much more threatening.

Shortly after detection, the Army discharged a 155-milimeter self-propelled gun at 5:04 p.m. The Army reported no damage. Casualties in the North were not immediately known.Coincidentally with the exchange of fire, Pyongyang sent two separate letters to the South, calling for a withdrawal of the loudspeakers and threatening military action.In the letter sent from the General Staff of the North Korean People’s Army to South Korea’s Defense Ministry through a border telephone channel at around 4:50 p.m., Pyongyang warned that it would initiate “military action” unless Seoul stops the propaganda broadcasts within 48 hours from 5 p.m.In a separate letter by Kim Yang-gon, director of the United Front Department in charge of cross-border affairs, to National Security Office chief Kim Kwan-jin, Pyongyang said the broadcasts constitute a “declaration of war” but it is willing to resolve the current situation and “open a way out for the improvement of the relationship.” Seoul said it has no plan to dismantle the speakers at this point. “The letter, which coincided with the provocation against us, was most likely to be intended to cover up the fact that the aggravated situation resulted from North Korea’s land mine provocation,” the Unification Ministry said in a statement. “We will solidly take measures under the principle that the government sternly responds to North Korea’s wrong behavior.”This undated image shows South Korean soldiers conducting live fire drills. (Yonhap)President Park Geun-hye convened an emergency meeting of the presidential National Security Council to examine the incident and formulate follow-up steps. The government also released an evacuation order for some residents of Yeoncheon, Paju, Ganghwado Island and other border areas.The North’s anti-aircraft gun ammunition appeared to have hit an uninhabited hill located several kilometers away from a loudspeaker set, an official at Seoul’s Defense Ministry said. Yet the North did not appear to have aimed at the equipment, he noted, without elaborating. “We detected signs that the North Korean military staged two rounds of firearm provocation in the southern part of the Military Demarcation Line, and fired dozens of rounds of a 155-millimeter self-propelled gun as warning shots,” Joint Chief of Staff spokesman Col. Jeon Ha-kyu said at a news briefing. “Our military immediately raised our security posture to the top-notch, while closely monitoring the North Korean military’s movement and maintaining full readiness to respond robustly and firmly to any further provocation.” Last week, the South Korean military restarted the broadcasts in the Demilitarized Zone, closing an 11-year hiatus, after the JCS found that the North was behind the Aug. 4 explosion of land mines that inflicted serious wounds on two soldiers. Flatly denying its responsibility, the North Korean military urged to remove the loudspeakers in its “public warning” last Saturday, threatening “indiscriminate strikes” if its demand was not met.The North, for its part, has resumed its own propaganda program in the area and tightened vigilance against the South. The Rodong Sinmun, the North’s ruling Workers’ Party’s mouthpiece, called the border broadcasts and anti-Pyongyang leaflet sprayings a “prelude to war” and “most explicit plot for psychological warfare.”Pyongyang has also been churning out military threats against the ongoing Ulchi Freedom Guardian, a major annual drill by South Korea and the U.S. “This year’s UFG exercise implies a stringency that cannot be overlooked in light of various unusual signs that have recently emerged around the Military Demarcation Line,” the paper said Tuesday. Yet tension is set to flare up across the border as Defense Minister Han Min-koo vowed to expand the broadcasts “to full-scale.” During a parliamentary session last week, he said that the program was airing at four spots, and anti-Pyongyang leaflets and propaganda electronic boards are other options being considered as next retaliatory steps. The minister has also raised the possibility of another major provocation timed for the anniversary of the founding of the Workers’ Party in October.The loudspeakers were taken down in 2004 as a result of inter-Korean military dialogue. They were reinstalled at 11 places along the MDL following the North’s 2010 fatal attack on the corvette Cheonan, which led Pyongyang to threaten to shoot them down, but had since been idle. With the absolute majority of North Koreans remaining isolated from the outside world, the broadcasts have proved to be a rare source for news of the execution and purge of elite military executives and other power struggles within the top echelons, information about free democracy and other regional and global issues, along with weather forecasts and music. Many defectors resettled in South Korea have testified that they had come to hear first about the South through the broadcasts, which can travel as far as 10 kilometers.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","koreas traded fire on thursday ,traded fire on thursday ,traded fire on thursday after ,public warning last saturday threatening ,korean soldiers conducting live fire","['Koreas', 'Yeoncheon County', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'the Demilitarized Zone', 'Army', 'Army', 'Pyongyang', 'the north korean People ’s Army', 'South Korea ’s', 'Defense Ministry', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Kim Yang - gon', 'the United Front Department', 'National Security Office', 'Kim Kwan - jin', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'North Korea ’s', 'the Unification Ministry', 'North Korea ’s', 'south korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'National Security Council', 'Yeoncheon , Paju', 'Ganghwado Island', 'Seoul ’s Defense Ministry', 'north korean', 'the Military Demarcation Line', 'Jeon Ha - kyu', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'the Demilitarized Zone', 'JCS', 'north korean', 'the Rodong Sinmun', 'North ’s', 'Workers ’ Party ’s', 'anti - pyongyang', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'UFG', 'the Military Demarcation Line', 'Defense', 'Han Min - koo', 'anti - pyongyang', 'the Workers ’ Party', 'inter - korean', 'MDL', 'Pyongyang', 'North Koreans', 'South Korea', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",8,"[ 1.          3.          1.         ... -0.4313232   0.62402779

The postings included those who claimed the U.S. Embassy in China had warned people to avoid exposure to the rain as sodium cyanide has leaked into the air. On Sunday, Beijing news outlets reported that Chinese officials had discovered about 700 tons of sodium cyanide was stored at the explosion site, stoking public concerns over the possible leak due to the explosions. Water-soluble solid sodium cyanide forms hydrogen cyanide if treated with acid. The exposure to hydrogen cyanide can cause burns, dermatitis, headaches and even death. The sudden issuance of the ultrafine dust alert over the weekend in Korea added fuel to the rumors that the country would be hit by the toxic chemicals from China. On Sunday morning, the ultrafine dust advisory was raised in Seoul and Incheon for over six hours as the hourly average ultrafine dust concentration exceeded 120 micrograms per cubic meter for more than two hours. The alert was lifted later in the afternoon. The Environment Ministry, however, said the sodium cyanide spreading to Korea is geographically nearly impossible. “Tianjin is 800 kilometers away from Seoul, which is too far to be affected,” said the ministry. Experts also played down the concerns, citing the characteristics of the toxic substance. “Sodium cyanide is naturally heavier than air. Therefore, it’s nearly impossible to spread through the wind over hundreds of kilometers,” chemistry professor Lee Chong-soon at Yeungnam University told The Korea Herald. The weather data of the blast day also showed little chance of it spreading. “On Aug. 12, the wind of the concerned region headed from south to southwest, according to the data. This indicates that the wind actually blew in the opposite direction of the peninsula,” said Korea Meteorological Agency officials. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Public Safety and Security vowed to carry out an emergency safety inspection on a number of factories and ports that deal with harmful chemical substances as part of its efforts to prevent similar accidents and alleviate public concerns. The safety inspections will be conducted with municipal firefighting departments and four ministries, including the Environment Ministry and Labor and Employment Ministry, the authorities said. It will also hold a group meeting Thursday to review the preventive measures and accident response manuals, they added.

The injury left him paralyzed from the waist down. “The supervisor at the workplace should have been aware of the danger that the truck could damage a person,” the court said, citing the Korean supervisor‘s “negligence of duty.”But the South Korean government should compensate the victim on behalf of the boss, hired by the U.S. military, in accordance with the Status of Forces Agreement signed between South Korea and the U.S. in 1966, it said.The court also acknowledged the victim’s negligence, too, saying that the government doesn‘t have to fully compensate the victim. The authorities were ordered to pay 75 percent of the money the man initially claimed.The verdict is the latest addition to a series of rulings that held the South Korean government accountable for the misdeeds or violations of domestic law by U.S. soldiers. Earlier in July, the court ruled that the government should compensate a Korean citizen injured in a traffic accident caused by a U.S. corporal driving a five-ton army truck in Suwon in 2011.SOFA stipulates that South Korea is responsible for compensating third parties who suffer damages caused by U.S troops stationed here.

Over 1.2 million are being raised in the two-hectare fish farm in the coastal city. The dead fish were reported four days after the National Fisheries Research and Development Institute issued a red tide warning in the coast around Geoje and Goheung-gun in South Jeolla Province. This was the first red tide warning issued across the country this year. The red tide, which is a type of algal bloom, produces natural toxins and depletes dissolved oxygen, killing the fish. It commonly occurs in coastal areas. A warning is raised when the red tide occurs with a radius of over 5 kilometers and the concentration of cochlodinium exceeding 1,000 cells per milliliter. The government issues a red tide advisory when readings over 300 cells per milliliter are detected with a radius of 2 to 5 kilometers. Chochlodinium, the culprit of the red tide, is known to proliferate in the sea at temperatures over 25 degrees Celsius. The rising water temperature contributed to the red tide growth, the NFRD said. According to the organization, the average water temperature of the Korean coast has risen by 1.29 degrees Celsius over the past four decades. The warning was also raised in the coastal city of Yeosu, South Jeolla Province on Thursday last week. About 5.5 million fish are being raised in a 197-hectare fish farm in Yeosu, which is equivalent to 170 billion won ($144 million) of property. Last year, over 43,000 fish in Yeosu died to red tide, causing 70 million won in losses, officials said. “The level of the red tide is falling thanks to the cloudy weather, but it can go up again once the sun gets stronger,” the Yeosu City Government said. Red tide concerns have been escalating as it has been seen expanding to the East Sea. On Saturday, the NFRD issued a red tide advisory in the coastal areas of Gyeongju and Pohang in North Gyeongsang Province. As part of efforts to eliminate the algal bloom, municipalities have been spraying red clay in coastal waters with hundreds of ships. The red clay is known to soak up the minerals and minute plankton, thereby sinking the red tide algae toward the bottom of the sea. They have also used the propellers of fishing boats to deconcentrate the red tide.

Kim Jung-hoon of the ruling Saenuri Party released the report based on data submitted to the National Assembly by the Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs.  A total of 133 suits were filed by descendants of pro-Japan collaborators against the state as of July 2015, according to the data. Of the total, 119 cases were won by the government.   The courts ruled in favor of the descendants in 14 other cases as the real estate in question had already been sold to third parties.  The struggle over this still-delicate chapter of modern history was first settled under the former Roh Moo-hyun administration, which passed a law in 2005 that allowed the seizure of the property in question.  The special law on the state ownership of property owned by pro-Japanese collaborators stipulates that the government can seize assets acquired by or given to Koreans who supported Japan during the colonial period and their descendents.  In 2011, the Constitutional Court ruled that the law is constitutional, saying it is necessary to clear away remnants of the bitter period.  The largest piece of real estate confiscated by the state was inherited by descendents of former Korean politician Min Byung-suk, according to the data. Min received a title of nobility from Japan for his contribution to the country's annexation of Korea in 1910.  The Supreme Court in 2013 ruled in favor of the state, saying that the assets were a reward for his collaboration and that the Constitutional Court also ruled that the law is constitutional.

113,113,Tensions flare again between two Koreas,"Inter-Korean relations are deteriorating with a recent series of setbacks including last week’s land mine incident that injured two South Korean soldiers and Pyongyang’s repeated rejection of Seoul’s overtures for dialogue.The South Korea-U.S. military exercise, slated for next week, is likely to further strain cross-border relations and dampen reconciliatory mood, which was expected to emerge as the two Koreas ma...","Inter-Korean relations are deteriorating with a recent series of setbacks including last week’s land mine incident that injured two South Korean soldiers and Pyongyang’s repeated rejection of Seoul’s overtures for dialogue.The South Korea-U.S. military exercise, slated for next week, is likely to further strain cross-border relations and dampen reconciliatory mood, which was expected to emerge as the two Koreas mark the 70th anniversary this Saturday of their liberation from Japan’s colonial rule.Seoul views Pyongyang’s placement of three wooden-boxed land mines in the Demilitarized Zone as a “deliberate provocation” that violated the Armistice Agreement. It also warned that the North would “pay dearly” for the provocation.But Pyongyang is likely to call it an accident and deny its responsibility, Seoul officials said.Seoul officials believe that the “land mine provocation” appears to be Pyongyang’s retaliation against a South Korean civic group, which floated balloons carrying 100,000 anti-North Korea leaflets toward the North from Cheolwon, Gangwon Province, on July 31.The leaflets listed names of North Korean officials “to be executed after reunification,” which included North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, his wife Lee Sol-ju and Hwang Pyong-so, the director of the North Korean military’s General Political Bureau.In response to the dissemination of the leaflets, the North warned of “merciless physical response” and criticized the Seoul government for not preventing civic activists from conducting what it calls a “grave provocation” against it.The upcoming Ulchi Freedom Guardian military drills between South Korea and the U.S. are also likely to infuriate the communist regime, which sees the drills as a “rehearsal for a nuclear war of invasion” against it.As if to highlight its unwillingness to mend fences with the South, Pyongyang has repeatedly rejected Seoul’s calls for government talks.Last Wednesday, Seoul’s Unification Ministry made an offer of official talks to discuss “issues of mutual concern,” but the North refused. The ministry expressed regret over the North’s rejection.“We delivered our intention for talks and gave enough time for the North to consider our offer. But the North did not even receive the offer. We express our regret over the fact that the North did not show even a basic level of courtesy to the South by not accepting the request,” said ministry spokesperson Jeong Joon-hee.“This (the North’s rejection) calls into question the North’s will to deal with inter-Korean issues through dialogue and improve cross-border ties.”The North also spurned the request by Lee Hee-ho, the widow of former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, to meet with North Korean leader Kim during her four-day trip to Pyongyang last week.A spike in inter-Korean tensions came as Pyongyang is expected to engage in provocative acts such as a long-range rocket launch around Oct. 10, the 70th anniversary of the foundation of its Workers’ Party. The North was spotted completing a construction project to enhance the missile launch pad in the North’s northwestern town of Dongchang-ri. Seoul officials have been closely watching the site though there are not yet any clear signs of an imminent missile launch.Disregarding Seoul’s concerns over its missile launch, the North said last week that its launch of a “satellite” is a “matter of sovereignty.” During a news conference on the sidelines of ASEAN-related meetings in Malaysia, the North’s delegation also threatened to carry out additional nuclear tests depending on the “U.S.’ attitude.”The news conference was arranged as Seoul’s Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se stepped up diplomacy during the ASEAN forums to bring global attention to the problem of North Korea’s possible provocations and its nuclear development.Spurning Seoul’s calls for dialogue, the North appears to be not in desperate need of outside assistance. The latest report of the U.S.’ Congressional Research Service on North Korea noted that the reclusive state’s economic conditions appear to be improving. It said that since early 2015, reports have come in about “modest economic growth” in the North.It also pointed out that the reforms that appear to apply market principles to some sectors of North Korean business and agriculture, have created opportunities for economic growth in the impoverished state.

114,114,N.

The explosion severed the legs of two staff sergeants.  North Korean wooden-box mines were the cause of the blast, said Army Brig. Gen. Ahn Young-ho, who headed a joint probe into the incident, referring to mine debris found in the site.   ""It is clear the enemy has deliberately laid the mines with an intention to inflict harm on our operational forces,"" Ahn said. ""The explosives are clearly wooden-box mines that the North Korean army is using.""  The design and types of the wood cases, three spring parts and the Trinitrotoluene explosive material, or TNT, found at the explosion site were cited as evidence supporting the conclusion.  The North Korean plot may be intended to derail the upcoming Ulchi Freedom Guardian, the annual war simulation exercise scheduled to take place next week between South Korea and the U.S. to prepare for a potential incursion by North Korea, an official at the Joint Chiefs of Staff said.  ""It seems to be aimed at interrupting the scheduled implementation of UFG by obscuring who did the provocation and spurring discord inside South Korea over it,"" the JCS official said.  The Paju border area is also where the two Koreas exchanged machine gun rounds last October after South Korean activists launched anti-Pyongyang propaganda leaflets into the North Korean side.   He likened the latest blast to the North's deadly torpedoing of the South Korean Navy Corvette Cheonan in March 2010. North Korea has not yet accepted responsibility for the torpedo attack, despite much evidence showing otherwise.  A couple of North Korean soldiers may have secretly crossed the military demarcation line and come 440 meters further south to bury the mines around a South Korea Army-guarded gate that opens to the DMZ, possibly between July 26 and Aug. 1, the Army brigade general said.  The JCS vowed to retaliate against the North Korean provocation, saying in its statement that ""Our military will make North Korea pay the equally pitiless penalty for their provocations.""   On Monday, the United Nations Command also released the conclusion of its special investigation, blaming the North for the mine explosion.   ""The UNC condemns these violations of the Armistice Agreement, and will call for a general officer level-dialogue with the Korean People's Army,"" the UNC said in a statement without elaborating on when the proposal will be made.The DMZ is a four kilometer-wide arms-free buffer running between the two countries which have been under a ceasefire since the 1950-53 Korean War. In actuality, the width is less than 4 km as the countries' troops moved closer to the demarcation line which bisects the DMZ as part of tighter vigilance operations.   The accident site had previously been a mine-free zone where South Korean troops conduct regular search missions and there's no possibility of the North Korean mines being washed up there, the army official said, backing up the conclusion of the probe.  The suspected mine laying by North Koreans, however, was not detected during the South Korean military's regular surveillance operations possibly due to heavy fog seen in the area recently as well as heavy forest blocking the view during the summer, he said.  Following the explosion, the JCS has ordered heightened war-readiness positions among the servicemen and issued caution over the possibility of more mines being buried than the three that went off last week, military sources said.  In his capacity as the commander of the United Nations Command, the U.S. Forces Korea Commander Gen. Curtis M. Scaparrotti has also endorsed the recent conclusion during a recent telephone call with JCS Chairman Adm. Choi Yoon-hee, the sources said.  It was the first explosion by North Korea-laid explosives within the heavily-fortified DMZ since similar incidents took place in the mid-1960s, possibly a violation of the armistice which prohibits military action in the buffer zone.

Located at Jamsil, the 5-meter-deep lake is artificially made with its lakebed composed of well-drained silty sand.  The lake leak coincided with the construction around the region, and the isotope probe also showed that the lake water was highly similar to the leaked underground water from the Lotte World Tower and Subway Line No. 9, officials said. The water flow also changed direction to those two sites after the construction began, they added. The city, however, projected that the water level will rise again once the construction of the Lotte skyscraper and the subway wraps up. Several sinkholes in Jamsil were found to be not related with the lake leak, they added. As part of its efforts to prevent further lake leakage, the city vowed to run a lake monitoring team and obligate construction workers to report it immediately should an underground water leak be spotted, the authorities said.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","further lake leakage the city ,the lake leak that recently ,capital seoul officials said thursday ,silty sand the lake leak ,lake leak that recently","['Seoul', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Lotte World Tower', 'Songpa', 'Jamsil', 'Lotte', 'Jamsil', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49871704  0.58133298

It showed a 7.3 percentage point jump compared to the week before. Only one related death was reported a year before. A pedestrian keeps out of the sun with a plastic fan as she passes by a sunflower in Daegu, Tuesday. (Yonhap)The sunstroke figure includes anyone who visited the emergency room due to heat exhaustion, heatstroke or heat convulsions. The elderly accounted for 60 percent of those hospitalized. Men took up 74 percent of the total. More than 80 percent of the sunstroke cases took place outdoors.On Tuesday, heat wave warnings were raised in the southern part of the country and Gangwon Province with temperatures in the region reaching as high as 35 degrees Celsius. The heat wave advisory was also issued in some cities in Gyeonggi Province and the Chungcheong region as the temperature hit 33 degrees Celsius. The Korea Meteorological Agency said the heat wave would continue throughout the week along with tropical nights. Seoul’s daytime temperature may reach 33 degrees Celsius by the end of the week, with a possibility of a heat wave advisory issuance, it said.In a separate report, Incheon was found to be the most vulnerable city to the sweltering heat.The National Institute of Meteorological Research said in its study that Incheon started to report deaths from sunstroke at the lowest temperature among the regions, followed by Seoul and Daejeon. The death toll from heatstroke started to rise as the temperatures started to reach 28 degrees Celsius on average in the cities.Southern areas such as Busan and Daegu, on the other hand, reported deaths from sunstroke when the temperature reached 30 degrees Celsius on average.Cities with lower temperatures in general are more vulnerable to heat waves, the report said.“For Daegu, the city surrounded by mountains experiences high temperatures more frequently than other cities. Daegu seems to have socially and culturally adapted more to the heat,” the institute said. The study analyzed city’s heat wave adaptation level between 1991 and 2010 based on various factors such as the death toll, population composition, medical service quality and economic and environmental factors. The heat has also been affecting livestock as the farmers reported increasing deaths.According to insurance company NongHyup Property and Causality Insurance Co., over 1.23 million livestock were killed by the high temperature between June 28 and Aug. 2. Of the dead, chickens took the largest share with about 1.2 million, followed by ducks and pigs, with some 23,000 and 420, respectively. The compensation cost is expected to reach a record high of around 3.2 billion won ($2.7 million) this year since the company introduced heat wave insurance in 2012, the firm said.

She went into the memorial and protested the banner, slapping the 44-year-old father of one of the victims in the process.According to a local news report, the woman also destroyed a model of the Sewol ferry at the memorial, saying that the death of the students was “their fate.”On April 16, 2014, the ferry capsized off the coast of South Korea’s southwestern island of Jindo. The accident left 304 dead or missing, 250 of whom were students of Danwon High School in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province.The government was severely criticized by the public for the lackluster rescue operations, which led to the disbandment of the Coast Guard and reshuffling of the government’s safety-related branches.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","last year ferry sinking police ,wednesday for assaulting bereaved father ,ferry sinking police said the ,the woman also destroyed model ,custody wednesday for assaulting bereaved","['Park', 'Gwanghwamun', 'Seoul', 'Ansan Danwon Police Station', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'South Korea ’s', 'Jindo', 'Danwon High School', 'Ansan', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'the Coast Guard']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.79280597 -0.15559655

Their marriage, however, reportedly was not permitted according to the tradition of their country as they came from two different tribes. Both sides of their families began to threaten them, to a degree at which the couple were forced to go in hiding, the reports said.One of the couple, who had been residing in Korea for job opportunities, eventually filed for refugee status in 2012, saying they could be murdered by their families if they returned home, and that the Pakistani government could not provide them any protection.But the immigration office turned down the request the following year, saying there was not enough basis to deem that the couple was suffering from fear on grounds that they could be subject to persecution based on the refugee convention, and that their problem involved family objections.The 1951 Refugee Convention states that a refugee is someone who, “owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.”The court also sided with immigration, saying that the couple’s case did not fulfill the refugee conditions and the Pakistani system had due process against crimes.","court wednesday denied refugee status ,court wednesday denied refugee ,family objections the 1951 refugee ,said the seoul authorities denial ,wednesday denied refugee status for","['south korean', 'pakistani', 'the Seoul High Court', 'Seoul', 'the Seoul Immigration Office', 'Korea', 'pakistani', 'pakistani']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41716716  0.21774571

In the lawsuit filed with the Supreme Court of the State of New York on Thursday, Korean Air purser Park Chang-jin sought compensation for emotional and physical damages against former vice president Cho Hyun-ah for last year's in-flight commotion widely known as the nut rage incident, according to the sources. On Dec. 5, Cho forced Park to disembark from an Incheon-bound flight in New York, and after she reportedly threw a fit over some macadamia nuts that were not served to her liking.The latest litigation comes several months after Kim Do-hee, another flight attendant from the incident, filed a similar suit against both Cho and Korean Air at the New York court. Cho's legal representatives have asked the U.S. court to dismiss Kim's suit for the sake of efficiency, arguing that the case will be better handled at a South Korean court for practical reasons, and also said they are planning to take similar action against Park's lawsuit. Last month, the Seoul High Court sentenced Cho to 10 months in prison but suspended the term for two years for changing the aircraft's flight route at the time when she forced off Park the plane. Prosecutors said they have submitted an appeal to have the court's decision reversed.

128,128,Beach sexual harassment remains tricky to tackle,"In 2013, police arrested a high school student for taking intrusive pictures of a woman’s body from a distance using his smartphone. The 17-year-old had been hiding under a large parasol on a beach in Boryeong, South Chungcheong Province, and took pictures of the woman swimming in the ocean wearing a swimsuit using his phone’s zoom feature. 　The teen was caught by one of the police officers on patrol at the time. ...","In 2013, police arrested a high school student for taking intrusive pictures of a woman’s body from a distance using his smartphone. The 17-year-old had been hiding under a large parasol on a beach in Boryeong, South Chungcheong Province, and took pictures of the woman swimming in the ocean wearing a swimsuit using his phone’s zoom feature. The teen was caught by one of the police officers on patrol at the time. But the victim, an 18-year-old student, had no idea that she had been observed and photographed without her consent. Among some 940 crimes that have occurred on beaches in the summer over the last three years, sex crimes, including filming or taking pictures of someone’s body without their consent, were the third most frequent category, following physical assaults and thefts.It is also linked to increasing criminal cases that involve using smart devices in South Korea. The number of reported sexual harassment cases using smartphones has increased dramatically since 2009, from about 800 to 4,800 in 2013. Among some 940 crime cases that have occurred on beaches in the summer over the last three years, sex crimes, including filming or taking pictures of someone’s body parts without consent, were the third most frequent violation, following physical assaults and thefts. (Yonhap)To tackle the issue that has raised serious concerns, the National Police Agency and the Gender Equality Ministry have hired 1,400 public servants and police officers to monitor the public and launch crackdowns on the specific crime on 93 beaches nationwide starting this month. “Sexual harassment cases using smartphones can happen anywhere, especially in public places including the subway trains,” said Choi Su-yeong, deputy director of the women’s rights division at Gender Equality Ministry. “But it’s especially common on beaches in the summer because many wear swimsuits in such crowded places.”Not all cases of sexual harassment at summer beaches involve smartphones, according to Choi. Many of the reported cases involve an offender touching someone’s body part without consent in the water, pretending he or she is swimming. A number of people have been arrested for luring tourists to illegal brothels and bars that offer sexual services near the beaches.Under the current Korean law, taking pictures of another person’s body parts which “may cause any sexual stimulus or shame, against the latter’s will by using a camera or other similar mechanism” can be punished by imprisonment of a maximum period of five years or a fine up to 10 million won ($8,600). Those who sell, distribute, lease or openly screen such pictures can also face the same punishment.Yet the specific crime is difficult to crack down on, mostly because it’s a form of voyeurism where the subject of the violation is very often unaware of being harassed, said Choi Jeong-sook, a police officer who currently serves in Busan in charge of monitoring the Haeundae beach. Many smartphone applications, including those that enable the users to take pictures without a shutter sound, also make it easier for voyeurs to commit their crime. “The police are doing the best we can to monitor all visitors and find potential offenders,” she told The Korea Herald. “But I’m sure (the police crackdown) has its limits. And many cases end up not being reported because victims just don’t’ know that they have been harassed at all.”The current definition of the particular crime also needs to be more specific, another police officer who wanted to remain anonymous said. “What does it really mean by ‘body parts which may cause any sexual stimulus or shame’? That can be different for everyone,” she said. “And it’s easy for offenders to get away with the crime by saying, ‘I was just taking pictures of the beach and this person just happened to be in it.’”South Korea is one of the world’s most wired countries, with 80 percent of its population owning smartphones as of last year.

""It was a mistake on my part. But there is nothing to be worried about over any of my actions.""  Lim also apologized to his colleagues and added, ""I hope (the leadership) will manage the NIS so that all the employees can carry out their operations without hesitation.""  The will was written on three sheets of legal paper. The contents pertaining to the NIS were written on one page. The other two pages were mostly Lim's apologies to his family, and his relatives refused to make those parts public, according to police.  Investigators said there was a piece of burnt coal inside Lim's car, but there were no signs of forced entry or any suspicious marks on his body, making it likely that the 45-year-old took his own life. An autopsy on Lim will be performed Sunday.  The apparent suicide and the note are expected to further stoke the controversy surrounding where and how the NIS used the hacking program it bought from an Italian company in 2012.  The NIS has so far said the program, which uses Remote Control System technology, allows hackers to manipulate and track smartphones and computers by installing spyware.  It said the system can hack 20 mobile phones simultaneously, making it ideal for eavesdropping.  The NIS emphasized that it used the program for the purpose of strengthening cyber warfare capabilities against Pyongyang and only against people living outside the country that have ties with the reclusive, communist country.  Such explanations, however, have been met with skepticism by many in the country, and in particular, the main opposition party, which believes the NIS has also spied on South Korean civilians.  The spy agency countered that while the information about the hacking is classified, it will show the usage records of the controversial hacking program to lawmakers to alleviate concerns that clandestine operations were carried out on locals.   After Lim's will was disclosed, ruling party lawmakers said the information deleted by the late employee can be recovered in its entirety.  In a press briefing, Saenuri Party's Lee Chul-woo and Park Min-shik, both members of the National Assembly's intelligence committee, said the NIS told them that the lost data can be restored using digital forensic techniques.  According to the lawmakers, the NIS said Lim must have feared that information regarding counter-terrorism and operations on North Korea would cause a major stir and must have deleted it while momentarily forgetting that the data could be recovered.  The lawmakers said Lim, because he was deeply involved with the hacking program, appeared to have felt burdened when the program sparked a political controversy.  An NIS official said once the deleted files are revived, they will be shared with the members of the intelligence committee.  ""We don't know the details of the deleted data, but we're in the process of finding out,"" the official told Yonhap News Agency on the condition of anonymity. ""When the lawmakers serving on the intelligence committee visit our headquarters, we will disclose the information to them.""  The official noted that the committee members are trying to schedule their visit to the NIS and added, ""We hope their visit comes fairly soon.""  A government source said the NIS has informed some members of the committee that the files should be restored in their entirety by the end of July at the latest.  ""By law, the NIS won't be able to disclose such information to the general public,"" the source added. ""Yet since there is such a major controversy over this matter, no one will believe (the NIS) unless the intelligence committee members find out the details. I understand the NIS will reveal its data at least to the committee.""

They ran across the doomed vessel in a desperate attempt to get as many students to safety as they could. It was the last time they were seen alive, as the two teachers were among 304 killed when the Sewol ferry capsized on that fateful day.Earlier this week, the Ministry of Personnel Management said the two could not be subject to the screening process to be considered “killed in the line of duty.” The reason was that they were temporary teachers. This effectively barred their families from being compensated in the same way as those of the nine other teachers who died in the accident.“I cannot accept that my daughter is being discriminated in her death. I urge the people to help me so my daughter’s honor can be restored,” Kim Seok-woo, the father of late Kim Cho-won, said Tuesday at a press conference in front of Seoul Government Complex. He and Lee Jong-rak, father of Lee Ji-hye, visited the government officials and submitted a petition to reconsider their decision, signed by 120,000 teachers across the country.  Kim Seok-woo (center), father of the late Kim Cho-won, wipes away his tears while submitting a petition at the Ministry of Personnel Management in Seoul on Tuesday (Yonhap)The incident was a reminder of the discrimination temporary teachers in the country still face, even the ones who had perished in what is widely considered a heroic death.In Korea, one wishing to acquire a permanent teaching job at elementary, middle and high schools must receive a teacher‘s credentials from certified colleges or universities. Then they must pass a state-commissioned test and be appointed by the government to receive the status of “education civil servant.” Those who were college-certified but did not pass the state test can only get temporary jobs, which deprives them of many benefits other teachers are entitled to. This includes job security, joining the civil servant pension program, and providing financial compensation to government officials who are killed on the job. Temporary teachers say they often fall victim to discrimination at work, both from the school administration and their coworkers. “My students received an award from a state-sponsored competition, so I filed a report on it. But then I learned that temporary workers cannot claim credit for their contribution, so I had to fill in the forms under the name of another teacher who held a permanent post,” said a 31-year-old temporary teacher at a Seoul-based middle school. Temporary teachers are also the first in line for doing remedial classes, he added. Some faculty members, like the principal, even ask them to run personal errands.In 2012, the local court ordered schools to pay bonuses to the temporary teachers. The case is currently pending decision by the Supreme Court. Whether or not the temporary teachers should be considered education civil servants has sparked controversy here. The Personnel Ministry stated that Kim and Lee could not receive benefits for education civil servants, as they had different working conditions and did not contribute to the civil servants pension program.But a study by the National Assembly Research Service ― commissioned by Rep. Jeong Jin-hoo of the minor Justice Party ― found that the current law implies that temporary workers should be subject to the education civil servant law.Clause 32 of the education civil servant law states that those appointed as temporary teachers are considered “education workers,” and clause 2 of the same law stipulates that education workers working at an educational institute are considered education civil servants. Last month, 69 lawmakers including Jeong proposed a joint resolution that urged the government to recognize Kim and Lee as education civil servants killed on the job.Local teachers’ groups have also voiced complaints about the temporary teachers not being entitled to privileges. “Teachers exist for students. And a teacher trying to protect lives of students should be respected above all, whether one is a temporary teacher or not,” said Kim Dong-seok, the spokesperson for the Korea Federation of Teacher’s Associations. He said that compensating the deceased teachers as education civil servants can contribute to boosting the morale of all temporary teachers, since it delivers a message that the government respects teachers who are willing to sacrifice themselves for students. The Korea Teachers and Education Workers’ Union on Tuesday submitted a petition ― signed by 90,000 citizens ― urging the government to compensate all teachers equally.“Both Kim and Lee tried their best even though they were treated unfairly. But now they are being discriminated in their death,” said the KTU. “We will continue fighting with the families (Kim and Lee) until our demands are accepted by the government.” While Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea has expressed hopes for the two teachers’ recognition, the ministry’s efforts have been limited. “In principle, we hope that it will happen. But there isn’t much we can do since it is really not up to us,” said a high-ranking ministry official Wednesday, denying earlier reports that the education and personnel ministries had agreed to pursue policies to compensate the two teachers as education civil servants.Kim Seong-wook told local media that he would not give up until his daughter receives what he believes is the proper treatment as a teacher at Danwon. “Her students came up to me and asked why she was discriminated (in the government compensation). To them, she was their teacher. They don’t care if she held a temporary job or a permanent one,” he said.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","killed when the sewol ferry ,nine other teachers who died ,danwon high school rushed downstairs ,the sewol ferry capsized on ,teachers were among 304 killed","['Kim Cho - won', 'Lee Ji - hye', 'Danwon High School', 'the Ministry of Personnel Management', 'Kim Seok - woo', 'Kim Cho - won', 'Lee Jong - rak', 'Lee Ji - hye', 'Kim Seok - woo', 'Kim Cho - won', 'the Ministry of Personnel Management', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'the Supreme Court', 'the Personnel Ministry', 'Kim', 'Lee', 'the National Assembly Research Service', 'Jeong Jin - hoo', 'Justice Party', 'Jeong', 'Kim', 'Lee', 'Kim Dong - seok', 'the Korea Federation', 'the Korea Teachers and Education Workers ’ Union', 'Kim', 'Lee', 'KTU', 'Kim', 'Lee', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'Kim Seong - wook', 'Danwon']",7,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.00320728 0.21597227 0.66584677]

(AP-Yonhap)The North Korean soldiers crossed the Military Demarcation Line near Cheorwon, Gangwon Province, between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m., prompting the South to send calls for a withdrawal and then fire warning shots, an Army official said, adding that the North Koreans did not fire back, though they were armed. The incident marked the South Korean military’s first discharge of warning shots against North Korean servicemen this year. Last October, the two Koreas briefly traded fire after the North Korean soldiers approached the MDL in Paju, Gyeonggi Province. No casualties occurred that time. Pyongyang is believed to have been tightening border controls and reconnaissance activities in recent years as part of its efforts to stem the defector outflow, while beefing up training for surprise attacks and ambush infiltrations into the Demilitarized Zone and its surrounding regions. Nearly 1,300 wooden or concrete markers have been set up every 200-300 meters along the heavily fortified frontier. Adm. Choi Yun-hee, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also visited a general outpost last month in the middle part of the eastern line near a guard post through which a North Korean soldier expressed his desire to defect to the South. He warned that the North was “deliberately fostering tension” surrounding the maritime and territorial borders and raising the possibility for an “unpredicted provocation.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","sunday north korean soldiers leave ,said sunday north korean soldiers ,sunday north korean soldiers ,south korean military said sunday ,military said sunday north korean","['north korean', 'inter - korean', 'southern', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'Kim Il - sing', 'Kim Jong - il', 'AP', 'north korean', 'Cheorwon', 'Gangwon Province', 'Army', 'the North Koreans', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'Koreas', 'north korean', 'MDL', 'Paju', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Pyongyang', 'Choi Yun - hee', 'the Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'north korean']",8,"[ 0.          6.          0.         ... -0.501984    0.74188334

(Yonhap)The blast occurred at around 9:19 a.m. during welding work on a storage tank to expand a wastewater disposal facility at its plant in Ulsan, the company said in a statement on Friday. The Ulsan plant mainly produces polyvinyl chloride, a plastic used in a wide range of products. It is the second-biggest chemical factory operated by Hanwha Chemical, an affiliate of Hanwha Group. The cause is yet to be determined, but the company officials suspect that the explosion was triggered by a gas leak. They said the project manager did not measure the levels of gas inside the storage unit before allowing laborers to do the welding work. The police already raided the offices of safety-related teams at Hanwha Chemical’s factory in Ulsan and Hyundai Environment’s office in Busan on Friday and seized job sheets, safety inspection reports and a floor plan for the factory. More raids could follow if necessary, the police said. It also conducted an autopsy to determine the cause of death of six workers killed in the blast. The result will be released in three to four days, the police said. The Ulsan branch of the Employment and Labor Ministry is questioning witnesses and reenacting the events that led up to the explosion as part of efforts to find the cause of the accident. If Hanwha Chemical or Hyundai Environment were found to have neglected their duty to prevent such an explosion from happening, the Labor Ministry will punish the companies for violating occupation safety and health acts, it said. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","forensic officials inspect an explosion ,explosion that killed six workers ,inspect an explosion site sunday ,deadly explosion that killed six ,explosion site sunday at facility","['korean', 'Hanwha Chemical Corp.', 'Ulsan', 'Hanwha Chemical', 'Hyundai Environment', 'Hanwha Chemical Co.', 'Ulsan', 'Ulsan', 'Hanwha Chemical', 'Hanwha Group', 'Hanwha Chemical ’s', 'Ulsan', 'Hyundai Environment ’s', 'Busan', 'Ulsan', 'the Employment and Labor Ministry', 'Hanwha Chemical', 'Hyundai', 'the Labor Ministry']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22130866  0.08385535

The drivers were demanding a 7.29 percent rise and additional welfare benefits while bus owners sought to freeze wages. The drivers’ union had threatened to stage a strike from Saturday unless their demands were accepted. Over 90 percent of the union members on Wednesday voted for the walkout. The compromise, however, invited criticism that the drivers held public transportation hostage for personal gain, citing a rise in bus fares going into effect from Saturday.Earlier this month, Seoul Metropolitan Government said it would increase public transportation fares to address a budget deficit and service improvement. The bus fares will jump by 150 won ($0.14) to 1,200 won. Some claimed that the majority of the extra revenue from the fare hike will be used to cover the drivers’ wage increases. Since July 2004, Seoul City has introduced a quasi-public operation system for buses. Under this system, a joint group manages the revenue of the bus companies while the city covers the deficit in exchange of holding the authority to determine the bus routes. The city has annually covered about 300 billion won in losses while the wages of drivers were hiked by over 160 percent since it adopted the new operation system, sources said. “Causing concerns over the bus strike ahead of the fare hike suggests that the drivers and the employers only considered their own interests important, particularly when the public at the moment is in confusion over the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak,” said an official from civic group Wirae in the eastern capital. In May 2012, bus drivers threatened to stage a strike over the wage hike but canceled it after the raise was agreed.

The government began receiving bids one month ago on May 23. Out of the seven consortia, five were led by foreign companies while the rest were headed by local firms.There were a total of six foreign companies, including two from the United States and two from China. The other two are from Denmark and the Netherlands, the ministry said.The ministry said it will begin evaluating the bids early next month, while a preferred bidder or bidders is expected to be named later in that month.It earlier said the bidders will be evaluated on a 100-point scale, with technological capabilities accounting for 90 percent of the evaluation.The bidding price will account for the remaining 10 percent of the score.The weight on technical possibility, instead of price, comes as the country seeks to hoist the sunken ship out of water without any significant damage so as to prevent the possible loss of any bodies believed to be inside.The ship sank on April 16 last year while en route to the country's southern resort island of Jeju. So far, 304 people, mostly high school students on a school excursion, have been confirmed dead. Nine people remain missing to date.

Cleaning and preservation treatments were skipped. The sealed corpse was immediately sent to a cremation facility and turned to ash in just a few hours. Looking at the flames in the distance, the bereaved families remained lethargic.The whole process, rushed and hushed, only seemed to amplify the sudden tragedy that hit the family, to whom Middle East respiratory syndrome was something of a faraway land until less than a month ago.Under the government orders for fear of further infection, the corpses of MERS victims are mandated to be cremated within 24 hours of death. No funeral ceremonies are allowed. “It’s so sad that the families cannot say goodbye to them. Bereaved families cannot even check the faces of their beloved before the cremation, because of virus concerns,” funeral worker Lee Sang-jae told The Korea Herald. He managed the cremation process of five MERS victims this week in Seoul.  A medical staff member in protective clothing stands in the quarantine room at a hospital in Seoul, Sunday. (Yonhap)As of Wednesday afternoon, the contagious virus outbreak had claimed 20 deaths in the country since late last month. “The dead can be cremated only in the late afternoon after the other uninfected bodies are done first. Until then, the bereaved families can do nothing but wait,” he added. Only a limited number of bereaved family members are allowed to go to the designated cremation facilities, wearing mandated protective clothing. Some family members who are infected or in quarantine cannot even visit. Most painfully, the patient is usually not able to share the last moment with the loved ones. While the government says that the families can spend the moment with the patients upon discussion, it is usually technically difficult as family members tend to be placed in quarantine, thereby not allowed to go out.This often leads to a sense of guilt for the remaining family members, as many feel as if they did not fulfill their duties, experts said. “The Korean culture of the three-day funeral service actually helps the bereaved families express and release their sorrow and be comforted by others. But since the MERS victims’ families are asked to finish everything in 24 hours, they are likely to be under much more stress,” said psychiatrist Hwang Jae-uk at Soonchunhyang University Hospital. Worsening their mental stress is the prejudice of others, Hwang noted.“They become stigmatized as many people try to shun them over worries that they might expose the virus. Knowing that, the bereaved families will also attempt to conceal the MERS history and refrain from expressing their emotions or stress,” Hwang added. As part of the efforts to relieve the mental stress of the bereaved families, the government Tuesday pledged to provide psychological support. The MERS response headquarters said that the five public hospitals and a few municipal health centers will offer counseling. Experts, however, stress that the most basic, yet best solution can be made by the public.“The attitude in which the public attempts to avoid them over virus concerns can leave them in social isolation. Offering thoughtful words and care can make a big difference to them,” said psychologist Kwak Keum-joo at Seoul National University.

Gangnam Severance took samples of the patient’s sputum and isolated the patient at a separate treatment facility. But the patient reportedly threw a fit saying “If I have MERS I will spread it all around,” the officials said. Three other doctors who were nearby have since been put on isolated watch as a result of the incident.The patient then refused to wait until the results came, broke the lock, took a taxi and returned home, according to reports. The patient was confirmed of MERS in the first round of testing.After repeated phone calls to the patient and the patient’s family members, the person was finally admitted to Seoul Medical Center the next day, and the patient was again confirmed of MERS.Health center officials said they are looking at closed circuit television footage and tracing the patient’s route. While the patient has testified to missing work after suffering from the symptoms, they are also looking into whether that is true, they said.(khnews@heraldcorp.com)","fled hospital while waiting for ,respiratory syndrome outbreak fled hospital ,cough and sputum from june ,outbreak fled hospital while waiting ,samsung medical center on may","['Gangnam Community Health Center', 'Samsung Medical Center', 'Gangnam Severance Hospital', 'Gangnam Severance', 'Seoul Medical Center']",7,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.03912364 0.17929344 0.21560179]

Seventy art pieces of painting, wood sculpture and stonework by artist Kim Yun-shin are displayed at the Hanwon Museum of Art in Seoul from June 11-July 8. Kim, a former professor at the Sangmyung University in Seoul, immigrated to Argentina in 1984, after a trip enchanted her.Intense sun, pristine forests, vast meadows, idle cattle and free-spirited Argentines beckoned her, along with abundant stones and woods, which were rare materials for a Korean artist. Kim devoted her next 30 years to the singular pursuit of art, and in 2008, opened her own museum ― Museo Kim Yun Shin ― in Buenos Aires. Former Vice President of Argentina Julio Cobos, Mayor of Buenos Aires Mauricio Macri and former Korean Ambassador to Argentina Hwang Eui-seung visited the museum.  Korean-Argentine artist Kim Yun-shin (left) poses with Argentine Ambassador Jorge Roballo at the opening of her exhibition at the Hanwon Museum of Art in Seoul on Thursday. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)At the opening of the exhibition on Thursday, which was attended by over two hundred guests, performance artists from KimBokHee Dance Company staged a live show with music. The venue is Kim’s 33rd exhibition, her 10th in Korea since 1988.“Madam Kim Yun-shin, who is Korean by birth but Argentine by residence, will introduce interesting ways to bond our cultures,” Argentine Ambassador Jorge Roballo said in a speech. “This year marks the 50th anniversary of Korean immigration to Argentina, and Koreans have demonstrated assiduous work ethics and harmonious assimilation with not only Argentines, but other immigrant communities.”Kim said that she felt enthralled and elated to meet her former students again, who are now well into their 50s and 60s. Following the biblical story of ancient people, Kim plans to live and work until 125, she told The Korea Herald. “I can move vigorously even at this age, because I have got used to the rigorous work regime every day,” Kim noted. “I have to move heavy stones, saw and sandpaper logs all day. This balances my life. If I didn’t do anything, I will forget about everything.” Kim’s paintings have bright colors and leaf patterns. Her wood sculptures possess simple and crude forms, resembling aboriginal symbols. Her stonework cuts through the rock’s layers to expose compacted sedimentary patterns.  Performance artists from KimBokHee Dance Company display a live show at the exhibition opening at the Hanwon Museum of Art in Seoul on Thursday. (Joel Lee / The Korea Herald)Unlike her former days, when she used to preconceive a design before cutting, these days, she relies on her “spiritual inspiration from the bottom of her heart,” the artist explained. “My paintings are colorful and powerful, because I draw the inner forces underneath a Latin American society,” Kim highlighted. “I am not just drawing the European landscape of Argentina. I have tried to bring to light the aboriginal culture and spirit, which existed before the European immigration.”Having lived in Argentina for 30 years, Kim said that she discovered the essence of Korean culture and identity on a foreign land. As Koreans have historically lived in tight-knit communities, they have become zealous together, and no other people are as indefatigable as Koreans, Kim stressed. “Koreans in Korea have taken our culture for granted,” she said. “We should not lose sight of our culture, which is important and precious. We should learn to embrace our imperfect circumstances gracefully.” Argentines, by contrast, blessed with vast lands, food and resources, have developed a more leisurely lifestyle and attitude, according to Kim. In the mid-1980s, a family of 6 people could live comfortably off a hundred dollars, she recalled. Some 30,000 Koreans in Argentina now have established themselves socially and economically, with the second generations branching off from the small businesses of their parents, to succeed in their white-collar professions. Koreans came to Argentina largely before the Asian financial crisis of 1997, and the number dropped by half until 2003. Many first generations engaged in textile and clothing businesses. “Koreans don’t come to Argentina as immigrants anymore,” Kim pointed out, adding that Argentina became a stopover country for transnational immigration. “Most immigrants come to Argentina with capital, to make more money, and move onto America, Canada or Australia. I stay in touch with Koreans weekly through the Catholic church.”By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","korean argentine woman artist opened ,old korean argentine woman artist ,year old korean argentine woman ,korean argentine woman artist ,old korean argentine woman","['korean - argentine', 'Seoul', 'Kim Yun - shin', 'the Hanwon Museum of Art', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'the Sangmyung University', 'Seoul', 'Argentina', 'Argentines', 'korean', 'Kim', 'Museo Kim', 'Yun Shin', 'Buenos Aires', 'Argentina', 'Julio Cobos', 'Buenos', 'Mauricio Macri', 'korean', 'Argentina', 'Hwang Eui - seung', 'korean - argentine', 'Kim Yun - shin', 'argentine', 'Jorge Roballo', 'the Hanwon Museum of Art', 'Seoul', 'Joel Lee', 'KimBokHee Dance Company', 'Kim', 'Korea', 'Kim Yun - shin', 'korean', 'argentine', 'argentine', 'Jorge Roballo', 'korean', 'Argentina', 'Koreans', 'Argentines', 'Kim', 'the Korea Herald', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'KimBokHee Dance Company', 'the Hanwon Museum of Art', 'Seoul', 'Joel Lee', 'Korea', 'latin american', 'Kim', 'european', 'Argentina', 'european', 'Argentina', 'Kim', 'korean', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'Kim', 'Koreans', 'Korea', 'Kim', 'Koreans', 'Argentina', 'Koreans', 'Argentina', 'asian', 'Koreans', 'Argentina', 'Kim', 'Argentina', 'Argentina', 'America', 'Canada', 'Australia', 'Koreans', 'catholic', 'Joel Lee']",12,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4131223   0.45135298

The five face charges of business obstruction and libel.Two of the eight are provincial civil servants who allegedly made public a list of suspected MERS cases without consent.The remaining one is charged with spreading false rumors while posing as a reporter.The police received a total of 44 reports of such cases and will continue to investigate the remaining 36, they said. Most reported victims are hospitals, schools or private education facilities.Rumors were distributed rampantly early after MERS first broke out on May 20, before the government released the list of MERS-affected hospitals on June 7.The government had vowed stern measures against those who spread false rumors thereby worsening public fears over the disease.“Even after the government announcement of the list of (MERS-hit) hospitals, distribution of false information about medical facilities and other privately owned businesses seems to continue,” the police said.The suspects will face criminal charges if their distributed information is found to have defamed or obstructed business, it added.From news reports (khnews@heraldcorp.com)","virus that has killed nine ,police said wednesday eight people ,has killed nine and infected ,killed nine and infected more ,killed nine and infected","['South Korea', 'the National Police Agency']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47793329  0.56736791

A member of staff at a community health center will give you a call,” the text message read. “Nearly an hour passed, but my mother’s phone did not ring. I had to phone the hospital to find out the situation,” Yoo, who has been under quarantine at home since Sunday, told The Korea Herald. A day after her mother visited the hospital, the 25-year-old office worker learned that the 76th confirmed MERS patient stayed at the hospital’s emergency room until Saturday morning, the same day Yoo’s mother had surgery for a fracture. A government official from her local ward office finally contacted them Monday, but only asked Yoo’s mother to quarantine herself at home. The official did not ask any further questions, and so failed to find out that Yoo and her father also visited the emergency room to take care of her. Yoo and her father were quarantined only after they reported themselves to the authorities. Receptionists at Seoul Asan Hospital in western Seoul wear masks after the hospital saw its first MERS infected patient Tuesday. The patient had been working as a security guard at the emergency center where the sixth patient was admitted on May 26. (Yonhap)As of Tuesday afternoon, some 2,892 people were under quarantine. The government reported the seventh death from MERS and confirmed eight more cases of the disease, pushing the number of confirmed patients to 95. Three confirmed patients were discharged after recovery. “The government appears unprepared to cope with the MERS outbreak,” Yoo said, pointing to gaps in the authorities’ efforts to trace all contacts of infected people and place them under quarantine. “It seems like the government totally depends on the medical records provided by hospitals, meaning that it is unrealistic to trace all those possibly exposed to the virus,” she said. Although Yoo understands the government’s difficulty in monitoring everyone under quarantine, she doubts whether it can combat the spread of MERS this way.“The official assigned to our family checks whether we are at home and have symptoms for MERS by phone twice a day,” Yoo said. “If we don’t answer our phone, there is no way he can track us.” Despite the government’s stepped-up efforts to contain the deadly virus, concerns are growing that the authorities’ lax management of those quarantined could lead to transmission of the disease outside of hospitals. Local news outlets are reporting increasing numbers of cases in which patients suspected of having MERS are wandering around hospitals for treatment, potentially exposing unspecified crowds to the virus. Four days on since Yoo’s family was placed in isolation, they are still suffering from a lack of food and heaps of rubbish at home. “When I asked how we can feed ourselves and deal with the garbage without stepping outside, the government official kept saying ‘We cannot help it,’” Yoo said, berating the government for not providing enough instructions for those abruptly placed under quarantine. “They should offer us more than a mask, disinfectants and a simple brochure with measures to prevent MERS,” she said, calling on the government to give more detailed instructions and create a bearable environment for those quarantined. With food running out, Yoo ordered groceries through an online shopping mall to have them delivered in front of her door, preparing for the days to come under quarantine. Given MERS has an incubation period of two to 14 days, the family needs to be in isolation for 10 more days. Meanwhile, some others placed in isolation said that the fast-circulating rumors in the community about their possible infection made them feel even more isolated. “Even after our family is released from quarantine, I am not sure we can continue to live in this neighborhood with such a stigma,” said a doctor, who has been quarantined for nearly two weeks.While Yoo’s family was considered “lucky” to be informed by the hospital of their possible infection, many others showing symptoms are having difficulties in receiving medical check-ups to confirm whether they are infected. As part of efforts to prevent the virus from further spreading, the government set up a hotline for those suspected of MERS to report themselves to the authorities. But the lines are always busy, a 31-year-old Seoul citizen said, adding that the parties in charge of protecting citizens appear to be trying to shift responsibility onto each other. “When I managed to contact a counsellor, she said that I should go to a hospital first. When I went to a hospital, the doctor said that I should go to a community health clinic,” he said.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","mother had surgery for fracture ,family into panic sunday evening ,first mers infected patient tuesday ,quarantine at home since sunday ,infected patient tuesday the patient","['Seoul', 'Yoo Hye - ji ’s', 'Yoo', 'the Korea Herald', 'Yoo ’s', 'Yoo', 'Seoul Asan Hospital', 'Seoul', 'Yonhap)As', 'Yoo', 'Yoo', 'Yoo', 'Yoo', 'Yoo', 'Yoo', 'Seoul', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.30184937  0.22678407

The defendant had stopped providing for the two after confessing to his wife about the affair late in the year.The woman sued him, demanding he pay 40 million won ($35,746) for child support along with 5 million won in alimony, claiming the two were in a common-law marriage. The defendant responded by filing a lawsuit for the child’s custody.“Considering that the plaintiff is currently raising the child in the Philippines and the fact that the child’s existence caused rift among the defendant’s family, it is appropriate to grant the custody to the plaintiff,” the court said in its ruling.It, however, turned down the woman’s request to get paid up-front, ordering the defendant instead pay her 300,000 won per month until the child reaches adulthood. It also struck down her request for alimony, pointing out that their relationship cannot be defined as a common-law marriage given that the man already had a spouse.Kopino, a combination of Korean and Filipino, refers to children born to a Korean father and a Filipino mother who have been abandoned. While authorities provide no official tally on how many Kopinos there are, the figure is estimated to range between 10,000 and 30,000.The number has been rapidly climbing in recent years, with over a million Korean tourists visiting the Philippines annually.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","korean father and filipino mother ,korean father to pay child ,his estranged half filipino child ,filipino woman who filed lawsuit ,korean tourists visiting the philippines","['Seoul', 'korean', 'the Seoul Family Court', 'Philippines', 'Philippines', 'Korean', 'korean', 'Filipino', 'Kopinos', 'korean', 'Philippines', 'Yoon Min - sik']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35059345  0.09350071

So far, 87 South Koreans have tested positive for MERS, of whom six have died.  She also called on officials and experts to thoroughly monitor whether people suspected of being infected with MERS remain in self-quarantine, the key measure to stop the spread of the virus.  The government said the number of people quarantined from the disease has jumped to 2,508, while 583 people were recently released from quarantine.  She also instructed officials to come up with measures to try to minimize the negative impact the disease could have on the economy.  The comment came hours after Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan said that his ministry is considering providing support for tourism, retail and other sectors hit hard by the MERS outbreak, noting the outbreak could hurt consumption and business investment.  Park only plans to hold an essential meeting this week to focus all her attention on containing the MERS virus.  The disease has put Park's key agenda items, including labor reform and the nomination for a new justice minister, on the back burner.  ""All tasks of Cheong Wa Dae are now focused on MERS for the time being.

The ramped-up crackdown came as part of the government’s nationwide campaign against graffiti that has increasingly daubed the walls of buildings and public transport across the nation.

The Korean-American photographer, who entered Korea to find his biological parents, stated that the graffiti was intended to “leave a trace” in Korea. Last month, another foreigner, a 31-year-old Korean-German only identified by her surname Kim, was caught red-handed printing a heart-shaped image and Roman alphabet letters on the wall of a building in downtown Seoul calling for world peace. Three foreigners respectively from Romania, Spain and Latvia were also apprehended in the same month, accused of painting graffiti on the exterior walls of subways running through Seoul, Incheon and Ansan from 2013 to April.Police also nabbed a group of Korean men after they daubed some 70 walls of private residences and parking lot gates in southern Seoul with graffiti. The authorities vowed to step up patrols in factory sites and train and bus depots to better deter graffiti.

According to local news reports, she was hospitalized on May 25 after experiencing shortness of breath. She died six days after.Earlier on the day, Seoul said it was monitoring 682 people, a massive expansion from its watch list of 64 people announced last month, for possible infection of Middle East respiratory syndrome, after confirming the country’s 18th case.  Travelers arrive at Incheon International Airport wearing masks Monday as fears of MERS infection continue to spread. (Yonhap)Those on the watch list have also been banned indefinitely from leaving the country, the government said. The announcement came shortly after Seoul’s recent failure to prevent the 10th MERS patient from going overseas to China on May 26. This left 165 passengers and crew members on board the same plane at potential risk of infection.“We will put forth our best efforts to prevent any potential MERS patients from going overseas,” said Kwon Jun-wook, who leads the government’s special task force tackling MERS. Among the 18 confirmed patients, five of them are in unstable condition, meaning they either have to rely on a ventilator to breathe or are experiencing kidney or other organ failures. A 71-year-old, who became the sixth confirmed MERS patient on May 28, is particularly at risk, as he had been suffering from a chronic kidney disease prior to being diagnosed with MERS, officials said. The first confirmed patient, quarantined since he was diagnosed on May 20, had visited four medical clinics and hospitals over the course of 10 days prior to his diagnosis. He is currently believed to be the sole spreader of MERS in Korea. The 682 people to be watched include all health care workers and patients who were present when the first MERS patient either stayed or visited the four facilities. Among the 682, about 35 percent are considered to be the most vulnerable -- those who are aged 50 or older and those who have chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart or kidney diseases. Kwon said about 150 beds were currently available nationwide for patients who needed to be isolated. “We can, of course, increase the number of hospital beds (with the right equipment),” he said.Last month, the Health Ministry’s monitoring list omitted patients who did not share a ward with the first three confirmed patients but stayed in the same hospital, claiming MERS was less contagious than many other infectious diseases. The list then only contained close family members of the three patients, as well as health care workers who treated them. Almost half of those infected by the first patient were not even included in the government’s initial monitoring list. Among the 17 patients who are believed to be infected by “patient zero,” 15 were at the same facility as the 68-year-old, who was being treated there as an inpatient from May 15-17. Out of the 15, nine were staying there as inpatients. The facility, which has since been temporarily shut down, is the second of the four hospitals he visited or stayed at before being quarantined.The remaining two patients are health care professionals who treated the first patient prior to his diagnosis, each at different medical clinics, on May 15 and 17, respectively. The incubation period of MERS is considered to be from two to 14 days, and all those infected by the first patient were in contact with him from May 15-17. As the first patient visited different clinics before his diagnosis between May 17 and 20, more people may be diagnosed this week, as the incubation period of those who may have been infected at the clinic lasts until Thursday.As the nation continues to grapple with the spread of MERS, members of the government and the ruling party gathered for an emergency countermeasures meeting.“This week is a crucial turning point in which the situation can either get better or worse,” said Rep. Won Yoo-chul, senior policymaker of the ruling Saenuri Party. “The government must do everything it can this week to prevent a further spread of the disease, while making sure false rumors about the disease that make the public unnecessarily anxious don’t go viral.”The party and the government also discussed the incident involving a live anthrax sample that was mistakenly sent to an American military base in Korea from the U.S.“We are considering legal and institutional ways to regulate all potentially dangerous substances that arrive in Korea,” Won said. “We’ll be discussing this issue at the Status of Forces Agreement meeting scheduled in July.” By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","breath she died six days ,respiratory failure on monday evening ,she died six days after ,of breath she died six ,of respiratory failure on monday","['Korea', 'the Health Ministry', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Kwon Jun - wook', 'Korea', 'Kwon', 'the Health Ministry ’s', 'Won Yoo', 'Saenuri Party', 'american', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Won', 'the Status of Forces Agreement', 'Claire Lee']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51883727  0.20489718

Violent clashes broke out later that night as authorities sealed off downtown Seoul with police buses. They were blocking demonstrators who tried to march to the presidential office to demand a more thorough investigation into the cause of the sinking.Kim confessed that he burned the flag as he was angry about the government authority and it was not premeditated, officials said.  Police claimed that burning the national flag in a public place is a serious crime and the suspect should be held in detention during the investigation considering that he discarded the clothes and shoes he wore during the rally in an attempt to hide evidence.

The object flies into the sky with a loud blast after being ejected from underwater in what looks like a test-firing of a ballistic missile.The footage contains a caption that states North Korea's successful launch of an SLBM will nullify the Seoul-Washington alliance and the U.S. nuclear umbrella. The North also claimed that Seoul will be engulfed with chaos with just one or two SLBMs.It is not confirmed whether the North's footage is authentic or not.The first 10 seconds of the clip appears to be an edited version of a YouTube video that features the launch of a U.S.ballistic missile, the Trident I.The transition into the latter half, which shows the airborne missile, also appears abrupt, suggesting the second half may have been taken from a different video.The news came as North Korea said last week that it has already made nuclear warheads small enough to fit on missiles.Experts have raised concerns over Pyongyang's move, since it is seen as part of efforts to equip its missiles with miniaturized nuclear bombs.South Korea has said the North's test-firing was more of a test for an ejection rather than a firing, since the missile is assumed to have only made it about 100 meters after coming out of the water.But some analysts said if the North's claim is confirmed, the move will add a fresh threat to security on the Korean Peninsula as it is hard to detect where the SLBMs will be launched.

The victims’ families and activists from Asian Citizen’s Center for Environment and Health said they are consulting with a British law firm to file a lawsuit in a British court, accusing Reckitt Benckiser of dodging responsibility. The announcement came about three weeks after a woman who had used the product since 2001 died of a lung disease last week, pushing the death toll to 142. Reckitt Benckiser’s humidifier disinfectants have been blamed for claiming 142 lives in Korea for its harmful substance that caused serious lung disease. The Korean government confirmed in April that it found a significant association between the disease and the use of humidifier disinfectant. “We met with Reckitt Benckiser (officials) three times when we went to England, but the company neither offered a sincere apology nor showed willingness to take responsibility,” the families and activists said at the news conference held in front of the company’s Korean office in Yeouido on Friday afternoon. “We asked Reckitt Benckiser to create a committee involving victims, the manufacturer and civic organizations (to solve the issue), but it did not accept our suggestion,” they said, lamenting that the British company only shifted responsibility to its Korean office. Earlier in the month, seven victims’ families and activists including Kang Chan-ho, the father of an 8-year-old girl who now struggles with lung damage after using a similar Danish product called Cefu, visited the headquarters of the British company in London for a protest. They also held demonstrations at major tourist sites like Trafalgar Square and Westminster City Council, calling for an apology. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","lung disease last week pushing ,died of lung disease last ,of lung disease last week ,lung disease last week ,on wednesday the victims families","['Reckitt Benckiser', 'british', 'Asian Citizen ’s Center for Environment and Health', 'british', 'british', 'Reckitt Benckiser', 'Reckitt Benckiser ’s', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Reckitt Benckiser', 'England', 'korean', 'Yeouido', 'Reckitt Benckiser', 'british', 'korean', 'Kang Chan - ho', 'danish', 'Cefu', 'british', 'London', 'Westminster City Council']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62651497  0.83538419

At the time, authorities said the suspects were linked to IS.Although Sunni extremists attacked Westerners and government targets in Saudi Arabia between 2003 and 2007, the Al-Dalwa shootings were the first major militant assault against Shiites.The IS group, which considers Shiites heretics, has declared a ""caliphate"" in seized parts of Iraq and Syria. It has claimed numerous atrocities including the beheading of foreign hostages.Saudi Arabia and its Sunni Gulf neighbours last year joined a US-led military coalition bombing IS in Syria, raising concerns about possible retaliation in the kingdom.Since late March the kingdom has also led a coalition bombing Iran-backed Shiite rebels who seized large parts of Yemen and have sent deadly shell fire into Saudi Arabia.In its statement claiming responsibility for the Qatif attack, IS vowed ""dark days ahead"" for Shiites until militants ""chase them from the Arabian Peninsula"".Political and religious leaders in the kingdom, and its media, were unanimous in denouncing the mosque bombing.""No room for discord... the people are united,"" said the Al-Watan daily. The interior ministry said the attack against ""honourable citizens was carried out by tools controlled by foreign forces that aim to divide the unity of society and pull it into sectarian strife"".But widespread condemnation by Saudi society ""sends the message to them that their endeavours have failed,"" the ministry said.Saudi Arabia's top cleric, Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdul Aziz al-Sheikh, called it a ""criminal act"" which targeted national unity.The United Nations Security Council and Saudi Arabia's regional Shiite rival Iran condemned the mosque attack.Most of the kingdom's Shiites live in the east, where the vast majority of the kingdom's oil reserves lie but where Shiites have long complained of marginalisation.The Qatif attack occurred despite the arrest since December of nearly 100 jihadists, most of them allegedly linked to IS.The interior ministry said five members of the suicide bomber's 26-member cell were involved in the May 8 shooting of a policeman on patrol in southern Riyadh.""They had confessed to their crime and set fire to his body,"" the ministry said.Investigators recovered two Kalashnikov rifles used in the policeman's murder, 17 other firearms, and 230 kilograms (507 pounds) of chemicals used for making explosives.The other 21 detained suspects included two 15-year-olds and one who was 16, the ministry said.It added that all 21 ""had adopted the ideology of the terrorist Daesh,"" and recruited followers especially among young people.Frederic Wehrey, a Gulf analyst at the US-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, has written that the kingdom's vows to counter the Islamic State group and its sectarianism expose a paradox.""In its own domestic policies, the Saudi government has institutionalised sectarianism in virtually every aspect of political, social, and economic life,"" Wehrey wrote in a December article for Foreign Policy.","suicide bomber who killed 21 ,bomber who killed 21 worshippers ,november gunmen killed seven shiites ,saturday confirmed the suicide bomber ,gunmen killed seven shiites","['RIYADH', 'AFP', 'Saudi Arabia', 'shiite', 'Islamic', 'State', 'Sunni', 'jihadist', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Salih bin Abdulrahman', 'Salih al - Ghishaami', 'saudi', 'Saudi Press Agency', 'arabic', 'Eastern Province', 'Abu Amer al - Najdi', 'saudi', 'shiite', 'Qatif', 'Shiites', 'Shiites', 'Eastern Province', 'Al - Dalwa', 'sunni', 'Westerners', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Shiites', 'Shiites', 'Iraq', 'Syria', 'Saudi Arabia', 'US', 'Syria', 'Iran', 'shiite', 'Yemen', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Qatif', 'Shiites', 'arabian', 'the Al - Watan', 'saudi', ""Saudi Arabia 's"", 'Abdul Aziz al - Sheikh', 'the United Nations Security Council', ""Saudi Arabia 's"", 'shiite', 'Iran', 'Shiites', 'Shiites', 'Qatif', 'Riyadh', 'Kalashnikov', 'Frederic Wehrey', 'US', 'Carnegie Endowment for International Peace', 'Islamic', 'State', 'saudi']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.72692353  1.07421529

The site’s bedrock has a high water-retaining capacity and functions as a natural filter, according to the information posted on the Ramsar website.The website also said the Hanbando Wetland consists of various types of riffles and pools that maintain a rich biodiversity and provide habitats for numerous species, including a number of endemic and nationally threatened species.

The 68-year-old is currently reported to be in a stable condition.The man stayed in Bahrain from April 18 to May 3 and was engaged in a farming-related business there, according to the Health Ministry. He returned to Korea via Incheon International Airport. Prior to his arrival, he had a layover in Qatar.The patient had been asymptomatic until May 11, seven days after his arrival to Korea. He was eventually hospitalized on May 12 for symptoms including high fever and coughing. The Korea National Institute of Health on Wednesday confirmed that he was infected by MERS. Since the diagnosis, the patient has been quarantined at a government-certified medical facility, the ministry said.Although camels are suspected to be the primary source of MERS infection in humans, the exact transmission routes remain unknown. Since it was first reported in 2012, some 1,142 people from 23 countries have been infected by the virus. Among them, 465 died. Also among the infected, 97.8 percent were lived in the Middle East, especially Saudi Arabia and UAE. In Asia, MERS cases were confirmed in the Philippines and Malaysia prior to the one in Seoul. Although the Korean patient was diagnosed with the infection after staying in Bahrain, no case someone contracting MERS within Korea has been reported by the health authorities.Symptoms of the virus include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. It has been shown to spread between people who are in close contact, most probably through droplets when an infected person coughs. There is no known cure and no vaccine to prevent the virus.However, Kim Young-taek, an official from the Health Ministry, said MERS isn’t impossible to treat. “There are ways to ease the symptoms which eventually would help one’s immune system fight the virus,” he said. “One of the most important things is to prevent any complications that may follow, including kidney failure and pneumonia.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","korea health ministry on wednesday ,the korean patient was diagnosed ,seoul earlier this month ,to seoul earlier this month ,health ministry on wednesday confirmed","['South Korea ’s', 'Health Ministry', 'Bahrain', 'Seoul', 'Bahrain', 'the Health Ministry', 'Korea', 'Incheon International Airport', 'Qatar', 'Korea', 'the Korea National Institute of Health', 'Saudi Arabia', 'UAE', 'Philippines', 'Malaysia', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'Bahrain', 'Korea', 'Kim Young - taek', 'the Health Ministry', 'Claire Lee']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.16785218  1.03548014

Fortunately, they've not gone as far as their clever video editors and spinmeisters would have us believe,"" Adm. James A. Winnefeld Jr., vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said during a discussion at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.  ""They are many years away from developing this capability,"" he said.  The North claimed earlier this month that leader Kim Jong-un oversaw a successful underwater test-launch of a ""strategic submarine ballistic missile."" The test, if confirmed, would represent a significant step forward in the North's missile technology.  But last week, Joseph Bermudez, a top North Korea military expert, claimed that the North is believed to have test-fired the missile from a submerged barge, not from a submarine, and that the North appears to have ""photoshopped"" images of the test to exaggerate progress.  South Korean officials said they believe the North's imagery was not manipulated.  Winnefeld stressed a North Koren SLBM, if fully developed, would be a serious threat.  Should North Korea eventually develop the capability, it will present a hard-to-detect danger for Japan, South Korea as well as our servicemembers stationed in the region. This only reinforces the importance of regional ballistic missile defense,"" he said.  Winnefeld said the U.S. is interested in using the THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) missile defense system to help defend South Korea from North Korean threats, but emphasized that it is up to the host nation to decide whether to accept the system.  ""Of course, we are interested in the potential for using this system to augment the defense of this important ally, including our own troops who are there to help defend the ROK from attack from the North. It's a good system. It will not pose a threat to any other nation in the region,"" the admiral said.  He stressed that the two countries have not yet engaged in formal negotiations or discussions about the possibility of a THAAD deployment and the U.S. is ""respectful of our host nation's concerns"" and won't put the system there unless Seoul wants the system.  ""So, I'll leave it to the diplomats and the negotiators and the like, but I just want to emphasize one more time, we have not opened up any kind of discussion formally with South Korea on this particular topic,"" Winnefeld said.  ""When it's ripe I'm sure we'll get into that, but we're approaching this very cautiously because we have such great respect for our partners,"" he said.  In Seoul, South Korean military officials dismissed speculation that the imagery of the North's SLBM test was bogus.  ""South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities agree that North Korea succeeded in the shoot-out test of SLBM itself,"" a Defense Ministry official said. ""It has been confirmed to be true that an SLBM was fired from a submarine and soared out of the water to fly around 150 meters."" The remarks by the U.S. admiral seem to emphasize that the North's SLBM technology still falls short of what it wanted to show off.  ""It seems like what he meant is that North Korea's SLBM capability is not at a worrisome level yet,"" the official said, requesting anonymity.

The wage cap has been set at 5 percent per year.   The group of South Korean businessmen with factories in the complex returned home after making a visit to the park earlier in the day to help resolve the prolonged dispute following two previous visits.Seoul had requested its companies not to send out March paychecks, vowing to punish violators. Despite the warning, 49 out of 124 South Korean companies have paid March wages to the North's workers apparently after threats from the North.   The 10-day period of the wage payment for April began Sunday, signaling more tension between the two Koreas. The Ministry of Unification said that there has been a reported work slowdown at the complex.   ""We delivered our difficulties to the North,"" Chung Ki-sup, who led the group, told reporters in Paju, north of Seoul.   He said the group had requested the North accept the current agreement on paychecks based on $70.35 per month. He suggested to the North if the two Koreas produce a breakthrough on their talks on the wage hike, the firms will offer retroactive pay.   The two quasi-state committees from each side have not held talks on the wage dispute since April 20.   ""I could not sense any signs of North Korean workers refusing to come to work,"" Chung said.   The North's committee claimed Wednesday that the South Korean government has violated Pyongyang's sovereignty, threatening to make its workers refuse to work.   ""It is none of the South's business as the industrial park is a special economic zone being operated by the North and South Korean companies,"" the committee said. ""It is wrong for the South to block our move to raise an insignificant amount of wage.""   In return, Seoul called on Pyongyang to rescind its unilateral move and to return to the talks for the resolution of the drawn-out dispute.   The joint factory park, which opened in 2004, is the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation. It has served as a major revenue source for the cash-strapped communist North, while South Korea has utilized cheap but skilled North Korean laborers.

The ministry will review plans to install surveillance cameras at shooting ranges and bulletproof screens between firing lines.  Reservists check their targets at an Army shooting range in Daejeon on Friday. (Yonhap)The military said it would consider providing the instructors with firearms, reinforced helmets and bulletproof jackets during shooting practices. It would also consider giving live ammunition to controllers ― a group of officers who supervise shooting trainings ― to control contingency. Alongside those measures, the ministry said it would suspend shooting practices at the 210th regiment under the 52nd division ― the unit where the shooting incident occurred. In-class marksmanship training will be held instead. Other reserve training camps, however, will proceed with shooting training as scheduled. Instead, the military will seek other safety options, such as putting instructors on every firing line and bringing in available personnel to assist with reserve training, officials said.The measure was announced after a 23-year-old reservist opened fire at his colleagues and turned the gun on himself during a shooting session on Wednesday morning. The reservist, surnamed Choi, had deliberately planned the attack and sent mobile messages hinting at suicide to a friend, the Army said in its interim reports on Thursday.The incident sparked controversy over military safety, as a safety hook was reportedly not fixed properly at that time, allowing the gunman to turn around and shoot colleagues close to him.Nine personnel were working as instructors at the site, but none of them stopped the shooting. The three officers and six enlisted soldiers are said to have hidden when the gunman opened fire. In the meantime, Rep. Yoo Seung-min, floor leader of ruling Saenuri Party, criticized the military for lacking discipline and asked them to halt reserve training and overhaul the training system. “I am shocked that those nine soldiers just ran away while the gunmen was firing point-blank,” Yoo said. “The military should immediately halt reserve trainings and undertake complete overhaul to address such incidents.”The military, however, said that an immediate suspension would be difficult to manage, saying that mobilized reserve training is crucial as the number of reserve forces is dwindling.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","measures following deadly shooting rampage ,reservists shooting drills to enhance ,during shooting session on wednesday ,following deadly shooting rampage ,following deadly shooting rampage that","['the Defense Ministry', 'reservist', 'Army', 'Daejeon', 'Choi', 'Army', 'Yoo Seung - min', 'Saenuri Party', 'Yoo', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26595569 -0.02444252

The man fired seven shots with his rifle at around 10:44 a.m. during a shooting drill at the 52nd division under Army Capital Defense Command, located in Seocho-gu, southern Seoul. The 23-year-old gunman was only identified with his surname Choi, according to reports. The man fired a K-2 rifle toward other reservists who were calibrating their rifles for “zeroing training,” a process of adjusting a rifle sight. He shot once at the target and suddenly turned around and started shooting at others, Army officials said.A military ambulance leaves a training camp in Naegok-dong, southern Seoul, where a reservist went on a shooting spree, killing one and wounding three, before turning the gun on himself, Wednesday. (Yonhap)The wounded were transported to a military hospital in Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province, and other civilian hospitals near the site. But one died during medical treatment and another was reportedly in a critical condition. The remaining two are said to be stable, according to reports in the afternoon.Defense Minister Han Min-koo apologized to the victims and vowed to conduct a thorough investigation into the incident. Follow-up measures to prevent such incidents would be also taken, he said. “The military will do its utmost to make sure such incidents do not happen again,” the minister was quoted by his spokesperson Kim Min-seok. “(The minister) extended his sincere condolence to those who lost their lives. He wished those injured a speedy recovery,” Kim added. Army Chief of Staff Gen. Kim Yo-hwan, who was visiting the Philippines, canceled the trip and returned home to lead the investigation, officials said.The cause of the incident still remains unclear.But initial reports showed that the gunman was one of soldiers “requiring special attention.” He was rated as class-B with A being the worst. During his service, Choi was sent from one unit to another as he failed to adapt to military life. He also had a medical record of depression, reports added.The military said all victims are reservists. Some 600 reservists were participating in the shooting practice as part of a three-day training session that started on Tuesday. Among the reservists was South Korean singer Psy, who left the site 20 minutes before the incident, reports said. At the incident site, nine active-duty soldiers ― three captains and six enlisted ― were positioned to ensure the safety of 20 firing lines, said the Army.

His position was the second highest in the North’s 1.19 million-strong military after Hwang Pyong-so, the director of the General Political Bureau of the military.Hyon, who served in the Army for nearly five decades, has been regarded as one of the most prominent generals in the military-centric country over the last five years.Hyon Yong-chol. (Yonhap)He was promoted to four-star general in September 2010 when he was serving as the commander of the 8th Army Corps, which is in charge of guarding the communist state’s northwestern areas including those near the border with China.Two years later, Hyon was promoted to vice marshal and took up the post of the general staff chief, which is equivalent to Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman. He replaced Ri Yong-ho, who was then regarded as the No. 1 man in the armed forces. Despite his stellar rise up the military ladder, he also had his own share of tribulations. Just a few months after he was promoted to vice marshal, he got demoted to four-star general. In May 2013, he also lost his position as the chief of the Army’s general staff to Kim Kyok-sik, another prominent military figure. He was then demoted again to three-star general and posted to the 5th Corps in charge of the central frontline in the North’s Gangwon Province. But last June, he reemerged to prominence and took the post of the chief of the People’s Armed Forces. He also became a member of the powerful National Defense Commission.Since then, Hyon was seen frequently accompanying Kim when the leader was conducting on-site inspections of military installations and joining special military or national events. Any member of Kim’s entourage is regarded as being in his inner circles.Last July, Hyon was with Kim when the leader paid his respect to the late national founder Kim Il-sung during a ceremony to mark the 20th anniversary of his death at the Geumsusan Palace of Sun. He was also seen accompanying Kim who oversaw military drills at frontline units.The dead general was noticed leading North Korea’s military delegation to Russia to attend a forum on international security last month. On April 25, he was spotted paying his respect to the late leaders Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il at the Geumsusan Palace to mark the 83th anniversary of the founding of the armed forces.Hyon was last seen watching a musical performance in a photo released by the North Korean media late last month.

Corp. in Seoul, was indicted in March 2013 on charges that he conspired to export U.S. aircraft parts without the required export licenses to intermediaries in China and Korea and ultimately customers in Iran.The aircraft parts, known as ""accelerators,"" can be used in missile navigation systems.Part of the evidence used in the indictment was a laptop computer that a special Homeland Security Department agent seized from Kim when he was departing the U.S. from Los Angeles International Airport in December 2012.In March this year, Kim filed a motion to suppress the evidence, saying the airport search of the laptop violated his privacy. Kim's case is pending at the U.S. District Court for Washington D.C., and Kim is out on bail after an arrest in late 2014.The court accepted Kim's argument.""There was little or no reason to suspect that criminal activity was afoot at the time Kim was about to cross the border, and there was little about this search -- neither its location nor its scope and duration -- that resembled a routine search at the border,"" Judge Amy Berman Jackson said in a decision announced Friday.The government had argued that a laptop computer was simply a ""container"" examined pursuant to its authority to conduct warrantless searches at the border, and its unfettered right to search cargo at the border is aimed at protecting the country.But the judge pointed out that the search of Kim's laptop began well after Kim had already departed, and it was conducted approximately 150 miles away from the airport. She also said that the government also engaged in an extensive examination of the entire contents of Kim's hard drive after it had already been secured and it accorded itself unlimited time to do so.""The fundamental inquiry required under the Fourth Amendment is whether the invasion of the defendant's right to privacy in his papers and effects was reasonable under the totality of the circumstances,"" the judge said.

Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency booked the local drug firm, whose name was not revealed, and its CEO without detention on charges of violating the Pharmaceutical Affairs Act. Police also booked 10 doctors without detention on charges of breaching the Medical Law in a case that allegedly involves hundreds of other medical professionals. The drug company’s CEO, surnamed Kim, is suspected of creating a slush fund and offering kickbacks to doctors, asking them to prescribe the company’s drugs to their patients between 2010 and 2014. The doctors were found to have received rebates worth up to millions of won. Police have searched the pharmaceutical company and seized its accounts and computer files in January. Apart from its involvement in the rebate scandal, the company is also under suspicion of bribing a tax officer to sway a tax investigation in its favor. Pharmaceutical companies in Korea have a long history of issuing rebates to doctors as part of their sales strategy. Most recently, DongWha Pharmacy, the country’s oldest pharmaceutical company, was caught providing more than 5 billion won worth of rebates to 923 hospitals and clinics nationwide last December.

It also specifies the setup of the committee, such as its subcommittees and their respective roles.The ordinance will come into effect after receiving President Park Geun-hye’s approval.The controversial ordinance has raised eyebrows among its opponents, namely the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy and families of Sewol victims. Bereaved families of victims in last year’s deadly ferry sinking hold a rally Wednesday against the ordinance for the investigation into the accident in Gwanghwamun Square, Seoul. (Yonhap)Under the ordinance, government officials will participate as key members of the committee, which the opposition and the bereaved families suspect is the government’s attempt to dictate the overall direction of the investigation.Critics of the ordinance point out that government officials should not play a prominent role in the probe when the network of corruption between maritime safety regulators and Sewol operators is pinpointed as one of the causes behind the ship’s sinking. Subsequent investigations into the ferry’s founder ascertained that the vessel had been carrying more cargo and less ballast water than regulated by law.“It is very regretful that the government decided to push ahead (with the ordinance) despite protests by the bereaved families, special investigative committee, and the opposition. The president and the government are responsible for all incidents that occur due to this decision,” said NPAD chief Rep. Moon Jae-in at a party supreme council meeting. He added that the current ordinance “hampers any attempts to uncover the truth behind Sewol’s sinking,” and vowed to demand the ruling Saenuri Party join the NPAD’s calls to revise the ordinance.But Yoo Kyung-keun, who represents the families of Sewol victims, also blamed the opposition for failing to stop the ordinance from being passed. He told reporters that families cannot accept it and will “resist the government decision to the end.”Another source of complaint is the high percentage of civil servants in the 90-member investigative committee. Of the 85 nonpermanent members, 36 are government officials.The special investigative committee on Sewol held a press conference in the afternoon and said it will immediately demand a revision to the ordinance. Its leader Lee Seok-tae said the committee will not be held back by the ordinance and would set up its own rules to conduct the probe. In one of South Korea’s worst maritime disasters ever, the ferry sank off the southwest coast on April 16, 2014, and left 304 people dead or missing. Most of its victims were students from Danwon High School in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province, headed toward the resort island of Jejudo. The incident sparked immense criticism of the government after it was revealed that its botched initial rescue operation failed to rescue most of the passengers onboard, although the ship lay on its side for over an hour before capsizing completely.Last month, the government confirmed the salvage plans for the sunken ship. The operation, expected to cost at least 1,000 billion won ($92.5 million), is expected to commence as early as September.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","ferry sinking hold rally wednesday ,deadly ferry sinking hold rally ,rally wednesday against the ordinance ,last year deadly ferry sinking ,sinking hold rally wednesday against","['Park Geun', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Seoul', 'sewol', 'NPAD', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Saenuri Party', 'Yoo Kyung - keun', 'Lee Seok - tae', 'South Korea ’s', 'Danwon High School', 'Ansan', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Yoon Min - sik']",3,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.00641889 0.05401325 0.30015963]

The company, known for its signature health goods made of Chinese traditional medicine Cynanchum wilfordii, used a cheaper toxic ingredient, Cynanchum auriculatum Royal, to make its products, the ministry said. Cynanchum wilfordii and Cynanchum auriculatum Royal are hardly different in their appearance, but the latter is strictly banned from use for human consumption by the Korean government due to safety concerns. The health product manufacturers appeared to have used Cynanchum auriculatum Royal, which requires less time to farm and is cheaper than Cynanchum wilfordii. Cynanchum wilfordii, called “baeksuho” in Korean, has enjoyed popularity among the middle-aged in recent years, for its purported medicinal effects. The herb has been widely known to treat various geriatric diseases, strengthen the immune system and improve blood circulation. It has also been traded on the global online shopping mall eBay. The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety has examined 300 manufacturers whose health products claim to use Cynanchum wilfordii after the Korea Consumer Agency found that Natural Endotech had not used the medicinal plant in its products.The results of the investigation are yet to be revealed, but the ministry confirmed that 13 products, including those by Natural Endotech, have been found to include the illegal herb. But Oriental medicine doctors said that consuming Cynanchum auriculatum Royal would not be as harmful as expected. “In theory, Cynanchum auriculatum Royal can also be used for medicine, though it could be dangerous to use the ingredient as a replacement for Cynanchum wilfordii,” said an official from the Korean Medical Association.

The stricken area in Badakhshan province is cut off from the rest of the country, covered in snow and is only accessible from the air, significantly hampering any rescue efforts, said Shah Waliullah Adeeb, the provincial governor.Badakhshan is one of the poorest and least-developed regions of Afghanistan. It regularly suffers huge landslides when snow begins to melt in the spring.Tuesday's landslide struck early in the morning in the province's Khawahan district, near Afghanistan's border with Tajikistan. The isolated area is located about 200 kilometers (124 miles) from the provincial capital, Faizabad. There are no roads leading to it and ""the only way to reach it is by helicopter,"" Adeeb said. ""We won't be able to get there today. We are preparing to go to the area and are waiting for the choppers to take us there.""The deputy head of Afghanistan's National Disaster Management Authority, Mohammad Islam Sayas, said initial reports suggest the avalanche struck only one village but it was likely to have been completely wiped out.""Our emergency team is trying to get to the scene, and have requested the Defense Ministry to provide us with choppers as that is the only way to get there,"" Sayas said. Badakhshan is in the Hindu Kush and Pamir mountain ranges. Unchecked environmental degradation and deforestation across large parts of Afghanistan contribute to a growing problem of landslides when winter snows melt and seasonal rains begin.Afghanistan has suffered through some three decades of war since the Soviet invasion in 1979. But natural disasters such as landslides, floods and avalanches have taken a toll on a country with little infrastructure or development outside of its major cities.In May 2014, a massive landslide in Badakhshan province killed some 350 people in a remote region there. Another Afghan landslide in 2012 killed 71 people.","afghan landslide in 2012 killed ,landslide in badakhshan province killed ,kabul afghanistan ap massive landslide ,massive landslide in remote province ,landslide in 2012 killed 71","['KABUL', 'Afghanistan', 'AP', 'Afghanistan', 'Badakhshan province', 'Shah Waliullah Adeeb', 'Badakhshan', 'Afghanistan', 'Khawahan', 'Afghanistan', 'Tajikistan', 'Faizabad', 'Afghanistan', 'National Disaster Management Authority', 'Mohammad Islam Sayas', 'the Defense Ministry', 'Badakhshan', 'Pamir', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'soviet', 'Badakhshan province', 'afghan']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.05599711  0.34376737

The main part of the recovery will involve divers who will link scores of chains around the hull to two cranes to pull the vessel out of the sea, the ministry noted. Up to 150 billion won (US$139 million) will likely be required for the recovery, although the cost could increase further if the project is delayed or any unexpected technical issues arise. Still, the retrieval also has safety risks and uncertainties, including the possible destruction of the 20-year-old vessel, typhoons in the summer, and a strong current in the shipwreck's location, Park said. ""The government will spend its utmost efforts to salvage the ferry Sewol successfully through the related bodies' full preparations for the work,"" Park said. Oceans Minister Yoo Ki-june  said  his ministry will lead the salvage project, adding it  will start the process soon by selecting salvage firms from home and abroad before coming up with a comprehensive salvage scheme.""The retrieval will be carried out with our full efforts and in a way that does not create collateral safety accidents,"" Yoo said, pledging the government's endeavor to help the victims and their bereaved families. The bereaved families welcomed the decision on the salvage of the ship.They had long called for a speedy retrieval of the hull in hopes to find the bodies of those who are still missing.""We welcome the official announcement of the recovery plans,""Yoo Kyung-keun, the spokesman for the families' group, said.

District Court delivered the verdict earlier this month, bringing the total amount of damages North Korea has to pay as results of a series of lawsuits in the U.S. so far to about $777 million, according to diplomatic sources.Rev. Kim Jong-shik was taken by a North Korean kidnapping squad in 2000 from Yanbian in northeastern China, apparently due to his support for North Korean defectors in China. Kim is believed to have died the following year.Kim's family in the U.S. filed the lawsuit in 2009.""This is an important human rights decision that will be utilized in all political abduction cases going forward,"" said the Israel Law Center, known as Shurat HaDin, in a statement. The Israeli civic group filed the suit on behalf of Kim's family.Few expect North Korea to comply with the verdict and pay the damages, but Shurat HaDin is seeking to seize North Korean assets the U.S. government has frozen as part of a series of financial sanctions over Pyongyang's weapons of mass destruction development and other bad behavior.There has been a series of similar verdicts that found the North liable for damages in the U.S.In 2010, Pyongyang was ordered to pay US$370 million in compensation to families of victims for helping the Japanese Red Army and Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine carry out the 1972 Lod Airport massacre in Israel.But it has not been known whether such victims were awarded the compensation.Diplomatic sources say such verdicts are meaningful in that courts clearly determined North Korea's responsibility in terrorism and other bad behavior, but it is legally unclear how frozen North Korean assets can be used to pay such damages.

About 5,100 troops were dispatched halfway around the world to help fight the North's invasion, of which 213 were killed and 448 wounded.About 1,000 veterans are believed to still be alive.The 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, leaving the two Koreas technically in a state of war.""Once again, I deeply appreciate your sacrifices and courage,"" Park in a meeting with about 180 surviving veterans and family members of the war dead at a hotel.High-profile participants included Colombian Navy Commander Admiral Hernando Wills Velez whose father served in the Korean War, and Francisco M. Caicedo, an 85-year-old veteran, who met Park in 1975 when he was invited to Seoul along with other veterans. At that time, Park served as a stand-in first lady because her mother had been killed in a failed assassination attempt on her father, then President Park Chung-hee.Also Saturday, Park met with more than a dozen people from the Korean community in an effort to motivate them to work hard.Later in the day, Park left for Lima for a four-day state visit aimed at further strengthening economic and other relations between the two countries.Park said South Korea and Peru should expand the sphere of cooperation to a much broader range of areas, including healthcare and renewable energy, according to an interview published Friday in Peruvian newspaper Gestion.South Korea and Peru implemented their free trade pact in 2011.Peru is the second stop on Park's four-nation swing to South America. The trip will also take her to Chile and Brazil for separate talks with her counterparts on deepening bilateral relations.On Friday, Park met with her Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, and called for a quick ratification of a free trade agreement to further boost bilateral trade.The sides clinched an FTA in February 2013, but opposition mainly from the automobile sector in Colombia has delayed the domestic ratification process.Colombia's Constitutional Court has yet to approve the deal, while South Korea's parliament has completed its ratification.

President Park visited Jindo Harbor, widely referred to by its old name Paengmok Harbor. She vowed to “seriously consider” salvaging Sewol from the seabed. She fell short of an official promise to initiate operations.  A victim’s family member cries while laying a flower at a memorial held in Incheon to mark the first anniversary of the Sewol ferry disaster on Thursday. (Yonhap)The ship lies some 40 meters below the surface near Jindo Island, South Jeolla Province, where it sank on April 16 last year. The tragedy left 304 dead, with nine bodies still missing. Families say the bodies are likely inside the shipwreck.But families of the missing, who have camped in makeshift homes at Jindo Harbor since the accident, vacated the spot upon hearing of the president’s planned visit, in an apparent show of protest.Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo and Saenuri Party chair Rep. Kim Moo-sung also made separate visits to a memorial altar at Ansan, Gyeonggi Province, where the pictures of 273 victims are displayed, most of them former students at Danwon High School in Ansan.But bereaved families there turned their backs on the prime minister, asking that he leave the memorial.“We do not want to hear that you will do your best (to salvage the ship), prime minister, we want an outright commitment that the government will start salvage operations,” said Jeon Myeong-seon, a spokesman for the victims’ relatives.Relatives also urged the government to repeal an enforcement decree that formed a special committee to investigate the sinking. The decree puts investigators under the watch of the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries and the presidential office. The relatives oppose government officials sitting on the probe panel. The government should be a subject of the probe, not a member of it, they said.A brawl between the bereaved and Saenuri Party officials broke out at the memorial altar when Kim visited later Thursday. Kim was unable to pay his respects due to the families’ opposition to his visit, a witness said. Police broke up the scrum, before he left the scene under police protection.The victims’ families eventually canceled the memorial service at the Ansan altar, saying that the government had failed to heed their demands to salvage the ship and repeal the decree on future probes.“We listened to President Park’s speech today,” Yoo Gyoung-geun, a family spokesman and a father of a victim, said. “But everything she said was absolutely meaningless.”Thursday’s visits by Saenuri officials came after an earlier attempted visit to Jindo Harbor by Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min on Wednesday.Yoo had stopped by the harbor to attend a memorial service but left when families of the student victims booed and demanded he leave.Meanwhile, lawmakers at the National Assembly passed a resolution earlier Thursday, urging the Park administration to salvage the Sewol. The bipartisan resolution passed 161 to 2, with two legislators abstaining.Lawmakers wore black at the plenary meeting Thursday, and held a moment of silence before the vote.South Koreans throughout the country held separate memorial services to commemorate the disaster. Local government offices in Ansan, Jeju Province and Incheon ― areas most affected by the tragedy ― held separate memorial services.In Ansan, a siren rang throughout the industrial city of 760,000 at 10 a.m. signaling a moment of silence.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","salvage the sunken ferry president ,ferry disaster on thursday yonhap ,party and park criticizing their ,victims killed in deadly ferry ,presidential office the relatives oppose","['south korean', 'Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park', 'Park', 'Incheon', 'South Jeolla Province', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Ansan , Gyeonggi Province', 'Danwon High School', 'Ansan', 'Jeon Myeong - seon', 'the Ministry of Oceans', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Ansan', 'Yoo Gyoung - geun', 'Saenuri', 'Saenuri Party', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Yoo', 'the National Assembly', 'South Koreans', 'Ansan , Jeju Province', 'Incheon', 'Ansan', 'Jeong Hunny']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57959241  0.38370195

A group of armed gunmen fired 40 shots from a machine gun while driving past the embassy early on Sunday, killing two Libyan guards and wounding another. The Tripoli chapter of the Islamic State militant group claimed responsibility via Twitter, saying it had “removed” two guards. The Foreign Ministry convened an intra-agency meeting to assess the situation in the region hit by the rise of IS, while exploring ways to ensure the safety of its staff and some 35 Koreans remaining in the conflict-laden country. Chaired by Lee Key-cheol, ambassador for overseas Koreans and consular affairs, the session was attended by director-general-level officials from Cheong Wa Dae, the National Intelligence Service, police and the defense and other four ministries. The embassy was relocated to Tunisia last July due to soaring security concerns. Two diplomats have since been shuttling between the two countries for alternate two-week stints to continue political affairs and consular services, aided by local administrative officers. The focal point will be whether the incident was explicitly directed at the embassy, officials say. News reports suggested that the assailants aimed at the guards given differences in the patterns of the organization’s previous attacks on other embassies and facilities. Unlike the past, they did not attempt to break in and open fire on those inside the building. Yonhap News quoted an unnamed source as saying that a police probe was underway, as signs had emerged that the officers were “implicated in some argument.” “We held a meeting Sunday led by a vice foreign minister to look into the possibility for a complete transfer of the embassy to Tunisia and decided to individually contact all remaining citizens in Libya to recommend to pull out,” Lee said at the outset of the session. “Today we’ve gathered to examine whether the IS did indeed carry out the attack and its background, and share views on future measures to protect our citizens there.” The Foreign Ministry issued a statement condemning the attack, saying “no attack or violence against a foreign diplomatic mission can be justified.” The U.S. and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also displayed strong condemnation and offered condolences to the families of the victims. “The ongoing escalation of violence in Libya against civilians and its critical institutions further widens a conflict that is fundamentally political, which in turn makes Libya and its citizens vulnerable to extremist actors,” a U.S. State Department spokesperson said in a statement. Safety concerns persist in Libya as the battle drags out between rival governments and strong militias jockeying for control following the 2011 death of longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi. Currently, only 18 countries maintain diplomatic missions there, 10 of which are African nations. Alongside Turkey and Ukraine, six Asian states continue to operate missions, including North Korea, India, Pakistan, the Philippines and Bangladesh. Seoul has also imposed a travel ban in the North African country, as well as in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan and Somalia.

The incident took place at around 1:20 a.m. Libyan time when the assailants fired some 40 shots from a machine gun as they drove by the embassy, an official said. The Islamic State militant group claimed responsibility about two hours later on Twitter, saying it had “removed” two guards at the facility. The three officers who were affiliated with Libya’s Interior Ministry were sent to a nearby hospital by local residents, but two later died. The ministry temporarily relocated its embassy to Tunis last year due to growing security concerns. Two Korean diplomats, who are assigned to move between the two cities for two weeks in turn, and one assistant serving at the embassy were unharmed, the official said, adding it is considering a complete withdrawal from the conflict-ridden country. The compound is protected by about 20 special security forces, in line with the embassy’s request. “We do not know if those in the vehicle targeted the embassy or the police officers there, but other than on the exterior walls, there is no damage inside, including to our diplomats and administrative officer,” he told reporters on condition of anonymity. “The local police immediately opened a probe, which is still underway. Embassy officials phoned the police chief to call for a thorough and swift investigation, as well as an increase in security personnel.” The unprecedented attack is set to heighten further safety concerns in the Middle East that prompted Seoul to impose a travel ban in five countries ― Libya, Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Afghanistan. With infighting stoking instability since the 2011 death of longtime ruler Muammar Gaddafi, the diplomatic missions of other countries in the region have also been attacked by armed gunmen in recent years, including those of the U.S., the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. In January, a Korean teenager went missing in Turkey after taking a route that locals say is typically chosen by aspiring IS jihadists to sneak into Syria. The National Intelligence Service said in February that the 18-year-old man was training to become a member of the extremist group.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","sunday killing two libyan guards ,gunmen attacked the south korean ,on sunday killing two libyan ,tripoli on sunday killing two ,sunday killing two libyan","['south korean', 'Tripoli', 'libyan', 'Foreign Ministry', 'libyan', 'Islamic', 'Libya', 'Interior Ministry', 'Tunis', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'Libya', 'Syria', 'Iraq', 'Yemen', 'Afghanistan', 'Muammar Gaddafi', 'U.S.', 'the United Arab Emirates', 'Egypt', 'korean', 'Turkey', 'Syria', 'the National Intelligence Service', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.19578934  0.91071945

The project could easily last up to 18 months depending on weather conditions.The country's conservative groups are opposed to spending large amounts of taxpayers' money to salvage the sunken ferry. The government earlier said it has already spent some 185 billion won, mostly on search and rescue operations that lasted nearly seven months after the tragic sinking of the ship.It said at least an additional 250 billion won will be needed to compensate the victims, as well as residents and fishermen near the accident site who were forced to halt their daily jobs due to the prolonged search and rescue operation.The ministry official said other methods of recovery considered included using only offshore cranes, which will likely cost less than using both cranes and a floating dock. However, other methods may be excluded from the shortlist of available technologies as they may prove to be extremely dangerous, if not impossible, due to strong currents in the accident area.The ministry said it will work to publish a final report of the feasibility study before the end of the month and submit it to the central disaster control center, which will then make a final decision on whether to salvage the ship.Such a decision is expected to take at least a few months as Maritime Minister Yoo Ki-june has said it should be based on public consensus.

The court held its first public hearing Thursday.The antiprostitution law was enacted in 2004 to protect human rights, partly prompted by fire that killed 14 sex workers who were locked in a brothel in Gunsan, North Jeolla Province, in 2002. The law stipulates that both purchasing and selling of sex carry a penalty of up to one year in prison or a fine of up to 3 million won ($2,747). It gives exemption to people forced into prostitution, leaving only voluntary sex workers ― many of whom oppose the law ― subject to the punishment.A 41-year-old woman accused of selling sex for 130,000 won filed for a constitutional review of the law in 2012. The woman argued that punishing voluntary prostitution, especially when the sex worker has no other means of income, was a violation of fundamental human rights. Activists hold a rally to demand a repeal of the anti-sex trade law in front of the Constitutional Court on Thursday. (Yonhap)“Are we (sex workers) doing something that is worse than stealing? Is what we do worse than murder?” the woman said back in 2012.Her request for a review was granted by the Seoul Northern District Court and eventually by the Constitutional Court. Police crackdowns on brothels have also had damaging outcomes in recent years. Last year, a prostitute in Tongyeong, South Gyeongsang Province, jumped from a motel during a raid and died. A police officer had reportedly approached her while pretending to be a client.Those who are against the antiprostitution law claim there is little evidence that punishing sex workers is effective in curbing the sex trade. According to government data, the number of female sex workers increased by 3.8 percent from 2010 to 2013, in spite of the law.According to a study last year by the Gender Equality Ministry, almost 80 percent of female sex workers were in their 20s and 30s as of 2013. Also, 86.6 percent of the surveyed women grew up in broken homes, while 13.4 percent suffered from poverty and domestic abuse before turning to prostitution. Sixty percent of them began working as sex workers as teenagers after running away from home. The Gender Equality Ministry, which regularly conducts a joint crackdown against sex workers with police, said the current law was necessary to protect women’s rights, especially teenagers. “The idea that it’s necessary to scrap the antiprostitution law is irresponsible and dangerous,” said an official from the Korean Women Lawyers Association, which has a member representing the government during the review.“What we need is in fact stricter punishment of the sex trade to protect our young children.”Kim Hye-sook, a philosophy professor at Ewha Womans University also thinks the current law needs to be kept. “I would be willing to consider legalization of prostitution in a positive light if Korea was a more just and fair society,” she said.“Yet there is still a lot of discrimination (against women) at workplaces and the glass ceiling is still pervasive. We need to examine what pushes the women into prostitution first before considering giving them freedom to choose (sex work) as their job.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","killed 14 sex workers who ,court police crackdowns on brothels ,that killed 14 sex workers ,killed 14 sex workers ,fire that killed 14 sex","['South Korea', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Gunsan', 'North Jeolla Province', 'the Constitutional Court', 'the Seoul Northern District Court', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Tongyeong', 'South Gyeongsang Province', 'the Gender Equality Ministry', 'the Gender Equality Ministry', 'the korean Women Lawyers Association', 'Ewha Womans University', 'Korea', 'Claire Lee']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57151568  0.1480999

The body of Sung Woan-jong, former chairman of Keangnam Enterprises, was found hanging from a tree some 300 meters from a ticket booth in Mount Bukhansan. A suicide note was found at his home.Sung’s death comes just days after prosecutors charged him of embezzling 80 billion won ($73 million) in government subsidies obtained by inflating accounting records. Officials also accused Sung of swindling those funds. He had denied the charges at a teary news conference on Wednesday.Sung’s death is expected to impede prosecutorial probes into alleged scandals surrounding the former Lee Myung-bak government’s policy of investing trillions in tax money in energy development projects abroad in early 2010.(Yonhap)Prosecutors had hoped Sung’s extensive networks in both business and politics would provide evidence linking the Korea Resources Corporation, Korea National Oil Corporation, and Korea Gas Corporation to alleged bribery violations and influence peddling scandals.Former President Lee’s resource policy had aimed to lessen energy-poor Korea’s dependence on natural resource imports by increasing investments in overseas energy projects. But prosecutors are looking into long-held suspicions that some Lee administration officials had swindled public money in backroom deals with foreign companies under the guise of the energy policy.The National Assembly is also conducting its own probe into the Lee administration’s energy policy. Opposition lawmakers have demanded President Lee testify at the legislature, while some governing Saenuri Party lawmakers criticized the probe as being politically motivated.Sung, a former Saenuri Party lawmaker, had called the investigations a politically-charged witch hunt.“Many other companies had participated in resource development projects (under the Lee administration) at the time,” he added. “I do not understand why only we are being targeted.”Sung was last seen at his home at 5:10 a.m. on Thursday. His driver and son notified police after finding the suicide note. Sung also did not appear for a court hearing later in the morning. Judges were to decide if prosecutors could detain Sung on related charges. Earlier Thursday, about 1,300 officers, police dogs, military personnel, and helicopters were deployed to Pyeongchang-dong, a district in northwestern Seoul, and its surrounding areas, as Sung’s phone was last reported in the area, according to telecommunications signals, police said.Police also found closed-circuit television camera footage showing Sung hiking up the mountain near the Pyeongchang-dong police office a few hours after he was reported missing.Prosecutors expressed regret over Sung’s death and sent words of condolence to his bereaved family.Sung was a businessman-turned politician. Born into poverty in the midst of the Korean War in 1951, Sung was an elementary school drop-out and a self-made entrepreneur. He earned a seat in the Assembly in the 2012 parliamentary elections. He lost his seat last June when the Supreme Court fined him 5 million won for violating election laws.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","police after finding the suicide ,peddling scandals former president lee ,police on thursday afternoon found ,lost his seat last june ,him of embezzling 80 billion","['Sung Woan - jong', 'Keangnam Enterprises', 'Mount Bukhansan', 'Sung', 'Sung ’s', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Sung ’s', 'the Korea Resources Corporation', 'Korea National Oil Corporation', 'Korea Gas Corporation', 'Lee', 'Korea', 'Lee', 'the National Assembly', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Saenuri Party', 'Sung', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee', 'Sung', 'Sung', 'Pyeongchang - dong', 'Seoul', 'Sung ’s', 'Sung', 'Pyeongchang', 'Sung ’s', 'Sung', 'Sung', 'Assembly', 'the Supreme Court', 'Jeong Hunny']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50246453  0.62815607

Those measures included the dissolution of the Coast Guard and the establishment of a new government ministry tasked with overseeing disaster control.  Critics have questioned the effectiveness of such measures.  Some experts claim, however, that part of the problem lies in an excessive reliance on the government.

Critics have argued that the government's bungled initial response to the disaster contributed to the high death toll.""I express my deep condolences to the families of the missing and the bereaved families who have lived with pain in their hearts,"" Park said during a meeting with her senior secretaries at her office, Cheong Wa Dae.She said a technical review is under way to determine whether the ship can be salvaged.""If a conclusion is reached that (the ship's) recovery is technically feasible, (we) will gather the opinions of the families of the missing and experts, as well as public opinion and actively consider raising the hull.""The recovery process has been estimated to cost 620 billion won ($560 million).The government officially terminated the search for the missing in early November, citing inclement weather and safety risks for divers.

Last year, a 45-year-old Chinese captain of a ship was killed while resisting a similar raid.

Most of the victims were high school students on a field trip to the southern island of Jeju.  The government will provide more than 1.1 million won to each family, consisting of four members, or about 270,000 won per person, for a duration of six months to financially help them weather the accident.  Students younger than college-age in the families will also be given free tuition for two years while college-level students will receive two semesters of free tuition.   Mental counseling and rehabilitation programs will also be offered to the victims' families to help their rehabilitation.  The committee of nine vice ministers and other private experts, chaired by Choo Kyung-ho, the policy coordinating minister at the Prime Minister's Office, plans to meet again in mid-April to approve further support measures.   ""The opinions of the victims and bereaved families should be considered foremost in deciding the support measures and commemoration events,"" Choo said during the meeting.  The prospect of the compensation package being accepted by the bereaved families remained murky, however, as the mainstream group of victims' families stepped up their protest against the government's handling of the tragic accident partly attributed to lax supervision and failed state rescue measures.  A group of victims' families held a head-shaving protest in central Seoul a day earlier, demanding the withdrawal of the government process to hand out compensations. They claimed the bodies of the nine people who remained unaccounted for should be retrieved first before the compensations are made.

Relatives of the victims of the Sewol ferry disaster shave their heads in Gwanghwamun Square in downtown Seoul, Thursday. (Yonhap)“All we ask is that the ferry be towed out from the sea, so that those still missing can be found and that officials fully investigate the cause of the disaster,” Yoo added.The 6,800-ton passenger ferryboat Sewol sank in waters off southwestern Korea last April, killing 304. Nine are still missing. Most of those killed were students of Danwon High School at Ansan, Gyeonggi Province, an industrial town south of Seoul.The Oceans Ministry announced Wednesday that the government would pay about 720 million won ($657,000) to every family that lost a child in the disaster. The costs were tallied by taking into account the foregone wages of the teenagers who had not lived to be adults.Families said Thursday’s conference was organized to express their “utter disgust” at such plans.“Do you think it’s just going to be OK if you throw money at us?” one mother yelled in anger. “Why do we have to be the ones suffering on the streets? What have we done to deserve this?”Most of the fathers remained silent, their eyes closed, with looks of both despair and determination.Supporters of the families shaved the heads of about 50 parents. Some of the mothers started weeping as their long wavy hair slowly fell to the gray asphalt streets of downtown Seoul. The families also demanded the government give more authority to a special investigative committee formed earlier this year to investigate the disaster’s causes. The committee was formed after the bereaved families refused to accept the results of earlier prosecutorial and parliamentary probes, saying they were insufficient.The committee’s mandate, written by the government last month, would put investigators under the close watch of the Oceans Ministry, which some families accuse of avoiding responsibility for the accident. It comes into effect next Monday. Some of the families, and 10 of the 17 members on the probe committee have strongly urged the government to revise the mandate.“I will not give up,” one mother said, her voice quivering as tears rolled down her cheeks. “I will not allow myself to see my son in heaven and tell him that I’m sorry.”“I will make sure I’m able to look him in the eyes and tell him that I did my part.”By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","students killed in ferry accident ,school students killed in ferry ,korea last april killing 304 ,seoul the parents shaved their ,the high school students killed","['Seoul', 'Yoo Gyoung - geun', 'Seoul', 'Yoo', 'Korea', 'Danwon High School', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Seoul', 'the Oceans Ministry', 'family', 'Seoul', 'the Oceans Ministry', '”“I', 'Jeong Hunny']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45723012  0.58171833

Lee's body has been lying in state in parliament since Wednesday after he died on Monday at the age of 91.The city-state has a population of 5.5 million, but only 3.34 million are citizens. The rest are guest workers, expatriates and their families.Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in a Facebook post Friday he was ""deeply moved by the overwhelming response"" of people wanting to pay respects to his father's lying in state.But as many might not be able to do so because of the long queues, the government has set up a YouTube link (https://youtu.be/u7fvd6ndZkc) for people to follow the events live, he said.Lee, who died after a long illness, is credited with the rise of the former British colony into one of the world's wealthiest societies after he served as prime minister for 31 years, followed by another 20 years as cabinet adviser.There has been a widespread show of grief -- accompanied by tributes from world leaders -- over the passing of the patriarch who governed Singapore with an iron fist, sidelining political opponents, muzzling the media and restricting political freedoms as he steered the economy to prosperity.Lee is to be given full state honours before being cremated Sunday, including a 21-gun salute and a flypast by fighter jets.

Otherwise, local authorities would have had to ask the USFK to turn him over, according to the Status of Forces Agreement, which gives U.S. military personnel immunity from South Korean law.""The USFK appears to have considered the diplomatic implications of keeping him employed,"" a police official said, asking not to be identified.The suspect reportedly told officers that he was looking for a hospital to refill his prescription for heart disease and doesn't remember the details because he was suffering from heartburn at the time.Closed-circuit TV footage, however, shows his brake lights coming on, suggesting he noticed the officer in front of him. A woman who was with him said she told him to stop the car but he refused to listen.A doctor who diagnosed him said memory loss was not related to heartburn. The suspect also did not have heart disease, he added.Authorities said the accident, therefore, appeared intentional.Only about 0.55 percent, or 385, of all USFK personnel, including civilian employees, faced trial from 2013 to 2014, according to the USFK spokesman. Of them, 144 were convicted. He did not mention the number of personnel who were charged with crimes during that time.There are about 28,000 U.S. soldiers stationed in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean, which left the two Koreas divided and technically still at war.

(Yonhap)The Cheonan case was one of the biggest turning points in inter-Korean relations.The Lee government imposed a package of tough economic sanctions on Pyongyang, effectively suspending all inter-Korean joint projects except for the Kaesong Industrial Complex. The current Park Geun-hye administration maintains that the North should first take a responsible measure in connection with the Cheonan incident if it wants to see the sanctions, dubbed the May 24th Measure, lifted.The South has been putting more pressure on the North as it marks the fifth anniversary of the March 26 tragedy this week.The North's commission, however, argued that the South ""cooked up"" the Cheonan story in a bid to nullify the two inter-Korean summit deals in 2000 and 2007.""The warship sinking case and the 'May 24 step' taken by them in its wake were a vivid manifestation of the anti-reunification acts,"" said the policy department of the organ directly headed by leader Kim Jong-un.It urged the South to immediately lift the sanctions, saying they are ""based on the fictitious story about the North's 'involvement' in the sinking.""""If the South Korean authorities truly wish for the improvement of the North-South relations, they should bear in mind that they have to move first to lift the measure,"" it added.The commission also demanded a re-investigation into the Cheonan sinking, calling on the South to reveal all related evidence associated with it.The South dismissed the North's statement and urged it to stop ""distorting"" relevant facts.""It was clearly found through an international probe that the Cheonan sinking was done by North Korea,"" a unification ministry official told reporters, saying it's the government's formal position.It's regrettable that Pyongyang is still condemning the South by distorting what actually happened, he added.The official made it clear that the North should take a sincere step to address the Cheonan issue in order for the May 24th Measure to be lifted.

Five people, including three children, were killed, while two were injured after a fire engulfed a 16-square-meter tent on Ganghwa Island in Incheon. Two families were sleeping in the tent, police said. Investigators said the electric panel used for heating in the tent appears to have sparked the blaze, which engulfed the tent made from combustible material in about three minutes. Fire extinguishers at the campsite also did not work, they added.  Police investigating Sunday’s deadly campsite fire confiscate items found at the scene, located near a beach on Ganghwado Island, Incheon, Monday. (Yonhap)Police are reportedly considering charging the head, manager and actual owner of the campsite for negligence resulting in death and sought an overseas travel ban against them. If the court issues the ban, their status will change to suspects, police said. “They appear to be responsible for causing the deaths by establishing a facility vulnerable to fire,” investigators said. Earlier in the day, authorities raided the campsite owner’s office and seized license-related documents, following questioning on Sunday over whether the site was properly equipped with fire equipment, they said. The tragic fire prompted calls to fortify the blind spot around safety regulations on increasing the number of outdoor camping facilities nationwide.Under accommodation law, lodgings are required to register their business to authorities and have appropriate safety equipment. Outdoor campsites, however, have not been considered as accommodation facilities, although they operate as quasi-lodgings equipped with various electrical home appliances and heating devices. The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism ordered outdoor accommodation owners to register their businesses in January with a grace period of five months until May. The campsite where the fire broke out was not registered.According to the ministry, 90 percent of some 1,800 campsites in the country remain unregistered.When the National Disaster Management Institute conducted a random safety inspection in 2013, about 80 percent of 430 campsites across the country received the lowest grade of “E” in safety. Only 17 of them acquired the “A” grade. As the number of people camping soared to nearly 4.8 million as of 2012, the number of accidents at outdoor accommodations also drastically increased to 4,300, jumping 15-fold since 2010, data from the NongHyup Economic Research Institute showed. As part of the efforts to prevent reoccurrence, the government and ruling Saenuri Party said they would draft up a set of measures on Tuesday. The Seoul city government also conducted an emergency safety inspection at a dozen local outdoor camping sites, officials said.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","investigating sunday deadly campsite fire ,police investigating sunday deadly campsite ,sunday deadly campsite fire confiscate ,sunday deadly campsite fire ,fire that claimed five lives","['Incheon', 'Ganghwado Island', 'Incheon', 'the Ministry of Culture , Sports', 'the National Disaster Management Institute', 'the NongHyup Economic Research Institute', 'Saenuri Party', 'Seoul', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32654396 -0.04071049

Whether safety policies are being implemented well on-site and how the policies could further be improved will be focus of the forthcoming inspections, the ministry noted.

Investigators confiscated computer hard disks, financial statements and other documents at their offices.Fresh allegations continued after the 10 billion won ($9.9 million) slush fund scandal involving POSCO E&C; in Vietnam hit the market last week. POSCO’s offices in southern Seoul. (Yonhap)Investigators are reportedly looking into additional allegations that POSCO E&C;’s parent group POSCO had created a slush fund via its operations at home and abroad as well as its construction unit in Vietnam.According to insiders at the Prosecutors’ Office on Tuesday, the steel producer is suspected of creating a slush fund of 10 billion won in Indonesia by inflating outsourcing costs during its construction of a steel mill.It is alleged that the conglomerate signed an exclusive contract with a Korean builder, which has close relations with then-POSCO chairman Chung Joon-yang, who was in office from 2009 to 2014.The prosecution speculates that about 1 billion won from this amount was handed over to a POSCO senior executive.In addition, the conglomerate is suspected of rigging the financial statements of some units in the local market in an attempt to secure funds for politicians.There is widespread speculation that the business group enjoyed close relations with the government of former President Lee Myung-bak, namely the members of a “Yeongpo (Yeongil & Pohang) Line,” a private group of Lee’s closest allies.The prosecution is reviewing its records after summoning some former and incumbent POSCO executives to determine whether to seek arrest warrants for them. It is also fine-tuning the timing of a summons for ex-head Chung.Meanwhile, the investigative authority is widening its net and has reportedly launched a low-key investigation into other business groups including SK, Shinsegae and Dongbu over their slush fund allegations.Like the POSCO case, observers say that the probe could include irregular bookkeeping for embezzlement or tax evasion.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","on tuesday raided three subcontractors ,tuesday raided three subcontractors ,investigators on tuesday raided three ,tuesday raided three subcontractors of ,investigators on tuesday raided","['POSCO Engineering & Construction', 'Vietnam', 'Busan', 'Heungwoo', 'POSCO E&C', 'Vietnam', 'Seoul', 'POSCO E&C', 'POSCO', 'Vietnam', 'the Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Indonesia', 'korean', 'Chung Joon - yang', 'POSCO', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Lee ’s', 'posco', 'Chung', 'Shinsegae', 'Dongbu', 'POSCO', 'Kim Yon - se']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.0226796   0.56684506

The ship was delivered to the Navy the previous year after passing an operational capability test.  Looking into the case, the state audit agency, the Board of Audit and Inspection, asked the defense ministry in December to take punitive action against Hwang over the alleged corruption.  Two weeks later, Hwang offered to step down as chief of Naval Operations, and his resignation was accepted last month.  In 2012, South Korea launched the project to build the country's first home-grown next-generation salvage ship with a budget of 160 billion won ($154 million) in the wake of the sinking of its warship Cheonan by North Korea in 2010. It aimed to enable the military to effectively carry out rescue operations and tow away damaged vessels.  After the military lowered the requirements by postponing the installation of two faulty parts -- a remotely operated vehicle and hull mounted sonar, the Tongyeong was again put into service at the end of last year.

Kim began serving the prison term in July and is scheduled to be released in August.  Supporters of Kim have claimed that the information Kim passed to the reporter is not highly sensitive or based on concrete intelligence, but just common-sense information that anyone could discern.   On the other hand, Petraeus was accused of giving classified materials to Paula Broadwell, his mistress and biographer, while he held the top job at the CIA, but the Justice Department decided to permit him to plead guilty to a misdemeanor.  Petraeus was also charged with giving Broadwell several notebooks that contained highly classified information he had compiled during his time as a top general, including the identities of covert officers, war strategy and intelligence capabilities.  The Justice Department announced that Petraeus had signed a plea agreement that would allow him to avoid a trial and potential jail time by entering a guilty plea. Petraeus and the Justice Department jointly requested a sentence of two years' probation and a $40,000 fine.  ""The decision ... demonstrates more clearly than ever the profound double standard that applies when prosecuting so-called 'leakers' and those accused of disclosing classified information for their own purposes,"" the lawyer said in a letter to the department.  Lower-level employees like Kim are prosecuted because they are ""easy targets and lack the resources and political connections to fight back,"" while high-level officials leak classified information to forward their own agendas with virtual impunity, he said.  The lawyer emphasized that the infractions involving Kim and Petraeus are basically the same. Though the department cited Kim's motive and lying to the FBI as reasons to deny him a misdemeanor, Petraeus has also admitted to lying about his conduct to the FBI, he said.  ""It is too late for us to undo the plea and seek the misdemeanor that Mr. Kim should have been offered,"" Abbe said. ""However, some justice and fairness can occur, even at this late date, by our at least joining to end his incarceration now.""  Kim's case was viewed as a test of the Barack Obama administration's handling of espionage issues. Critics argued that severe punishment against Kim will damage press freedom, claiming that the leaked information was not directly associated with national security or the well-being of Americans.  Before going to prison, Kim said in an interview with Yonhap News Agency last summer that four years of legal battles with the state devastated his life. Kim said he exhausted the life savings of his parents, his sister and his own, and the case dealt a critical blow to his reputation and did deep social and personal damage to his family.

Embassy officials said they were ""eager"" to help but are waiting for a response from the U.S. government, according to authorities.The questioning is intended more as a formality than a necessity, as officials already have obtained details from witnesses, they said.Lippert was taken unawares by a knife-wielding man on Thursday morning when he was preparing for a speech at a performance arts hall in downtown Seoul.The 55-year-old assailant, Kim Ki-jong, was arrested at the scene and has been detained on various charges, including attempted murder. Kim said he wanted to alert the U.S. to the ""damage"" it was causing to inter-Korean reconciliation.South Korea remains technically at war with rival North Korea after the Korean War in the 1950s ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty. The U.S. stations more than 28,000 troops here to deter provocations from the North, but hardcore nationalists argue that their presence hurts more than helps the mood for Korean unification.A special law enforcement task force has been assembled since the attack to uncover whether Kim had ties to North Korea. The team comprised of more than 100 law enforcement officials is also interested in his motive.Kim was recovering from a broken ankle at a hospital in southern Seoul, but will continue to be questioned about his motive by the authorities.Police intend to refer his case to prosecutors by Friday.They are also continuing their probe into allegations that Kim violated a controversial security law here that bans South Koreans from openly praising North Korea.More than a dozen books have been found in Kim's home that were dangerously pro-North Korea"" in nature, they said.

250,250,[Reporter's Column] Korea-U.S. alliance is rock solid,"After last week’s knife attack on U.S. Ambassador Mark Lippert, concerns surged that the incident might undercut the South Korea-U.S. alliance ― one reason why Seoul officials convened an emergency meeting of vice ministers and even a National Security Council session right after the unprecedented incident.Amid media speculation that the incident would damage the bilateral partnership, President Park Geun-hye calle...","After last week’s knife attack on U.S. Ambassador Mark Lippert, concerns surged that the incident might undercut the South Korea-U.S. alliance ― one reason why Seoul officials convened an emergency meeting of vice ministers and even a National Security Council session right after the unprecedented incident.Amid media speculation that the incident would damage the bilateral partnership, President Park Geun-hye called it an “attack on the alliance.” Upon arrival from her trip to the Middle East on Monday, she rushed to meet Lippert, who is in hospital following surgery on knife wounds to his face and arm.Of course, the attack on Lippert was an attack on South Korea’s only treaty security ally, the U.S., which adds to pressure on Seoul to get to the bottom of the crime, prevent a recurrence and enhance the security of embassy staff and buildings.However, excessive worries about a crack in the alliance seem to insinuate that the alliance might be fragile. Talk of the attack’s adverse impact has made many wonder whether the two allies lacked confidence in the partnership that they have long hailed as “forged in blood” during the 1950-53 Korean War.Seoul officials said Seoul and Washington agreed to closely cooperate to prevent the attack from affecting the alliance. But few have come out and said that the time-tested alliance was resilient enough to weather the storm.Jitteriness about an impact on the alliance might have resulted partially from public sentiment against the U.S., which worsened after a senior U.S. official’s recent remarks that suggested Seoul and Beijing had contributed to the diplomatic deadlock with Tokyo over historical issues. The U.S. desire to deploy an advanced missile defense asset here is another source of tension in the alliance.But the allies have managed tougher challenges before, ranging from an upsurge in anti-American sentiment following the death of two girls who were run over by a U.S. military vehicle during an exercise in 2002, and an intense public health controversy about U.S. beef imports in 2008. Concerns about a dent on the alliance have flared up quite often when the allies seemed to have different approaches toward Pyongyang and its nuclear ambitions, or when pro-North Korea forces whipped up anti-American sentiment here. But the alliance is not that brittle. For Seoul, the alliance with Washington is all the more crucial at a time when the North pushes to develop more advanced ballistic missiles and nuclear warheads to fit on them, and continues its menacing rhetoric.For Washington, Seoul remains a vital partner, as it has been pushing for its strategic rebalance toward the Asia-Pacific ― emerging as a fulcrum of global power and wealth ― amid the increasing assertiveness of China. The allies have a host of strategic dialogue channels to forestall any foul-ups in their communications. The alliance is sturdy enough to look beyond the isolated incident and pursue a future-oriented partnership, given that the countries need each other for strategic cooperation not only on peninsular and regional issues, but also on global challenges including climate change, nuclear proliferation, antipiracy and antiterrorism.What can be done, meanwhile, is for both to work closely to prevent mishaps from undermining their alliance, or from being perceived as such. The allies should remain mutually confident about the alliance, and persuade the public of this, in order to further solidify their partnership and negotiate mutual benefits.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","week knife attack on ambassador ,after last week knife attack ,hospital following surgery on knife ,last week knife attack ,last week knife attack on","['U.S.', 'Mark Lippert', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'National Security Council', 'Park Geun', 'Lippert', 'Lippert', 'South Korea ’s', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Tokyo', 'U.S.', 'anti - american', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Pyongyang', 'pro -', 'north Korea', 'anti - american', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Song Sang - ho']",11,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.19192465  0.37129343

Their unit is known as ""Ahk,"" an Arabic word meaning ""brother.""It is the second time that Park has given a pep talk to the Ahk unit in less than a year.She met about 10 soldiers of the Ahk unit in May when she visited the UAE to attend a ceremony marking the installation of a Korean-built nuclear reactor at a power plant under construction in Barakah, some 300 kilometers west of Abu Dhabi.It is the first out of four reactors South Korea plans to provide the UAE under a 2009 deal worth US$20.4 billion that marked South Korea's first export of nuclear reactors.On Thursday, Park met with the Abu Dhabi crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and said the construction of a nuclear power plant ""has become a good starting point for the two countries to welcome the next hundred years,"" according to Park's office.Also Friday, Park met with about 30 South Korean doctors and nurses working in four hospitals in the UAE.Health care has emerged as a new promising area of cooperation between South Korea and the Middle Eastern countries. A health promotion center managed by Seoul's St. Mary's Hospital opened downtown in the oil-rich capital of Abu Dhabi earlier in the day.The move came weeks after the Sheikh Khalifa Specialist Hospital opened in the UAE under a consignment deal with Seoul National University Hospital, one of South Korea's top medical centers.Mohammed bin Zayed told Park that he trusts South Korea in the health care sector and said he would be pleased if more South Korean doctors and nurses come to his Gulf state.More than 1,150 UAE nationals came to South Korea for medical treatments in 2013, costing the wealthy Gulf state US$18 million, according to South Korean data.Later in the day, Park plans to fly to Qatar, the last stop on her four-nation swing that also included Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.

258,258,U.S. envoy Lippert to have stitches removed next week: doctor,"U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert was in good condition overall on Friday and is expected to have his stitches removed early next week from injuries inflicted by a South Korean assailant.Wielding a 25-centimeter knife, Kim Ki-jong slashed the ambassador five times, including a deep gash on his face that extends from his right chin to cheek.

Thursday's attack happened at a performance hall in downtown Seoul where the envoy was to give a speech. The wounds required more than 80 stitches.Kim, 55, said he carried out the attack because he was unhappy about the ongoing military drills between South Korea and the U.S., which he said hampered progress in inter-Korean relations. The Key Resolve and Foal Eagle exercises kicked off earlier this week and are intended to thwart North Korean aggression.Doctors at Yonsei University's Severance Hospital, where Lippert underwent surgery right after the attack, had said there was no irreversible damage to key facial organs like the nerves and salivary glands. There was, however, a minor injury to the nerves in his left pinkie, which they said should recover in about six months to a year.Yoon Do-heum, head of the hospital, said the stitches on his face will be taken out either on Monday or Tuesday and doctors will watch the envoy for another day or two before deciding when he may leave the hospital.Yoon said Lippert barely felt pain in his face, which was the most seriously injured, but told him his left arm and fingers continued to hurt.""But this kind of pain should go away in about two to three days,"" Yoon told reporters in a briefing.The envoy has had no problems moving around within his room, although he wasn't able to sleep until 3 a.m., Yoon said.At one point, Lippert's temperature rose to 37.7 degrees Celsius but has stabilized to normal levels. There were no signs of infections, but the doctors will keep an eye on his temperature to make sure there are no complications, he added.Yoon also said Lippert thanked the doctors in Korean and wanted to express thanks to the South Koreans who looked out for him.Lippert told the doctors he had slept well despite having only gotten four hours of sleep. Yoon said the ambassador appeared to be in better mental condition than the doctors, asking them if they were doing fine.The envoy had previously written on his Twitter account that he was ""doing well and in good spirits."" ""Will be back ASAP (as soon as possible) to advance US-ROK alliance!"" he wrote, using the acronym of South Korea's official name, Republic of Korea.Lippert became the youngest-ever U.S. ambassador to Seoul last year. His wife gave birth to a son here, to whom they gave a Korean middle name. He was formerly the assistant secretary of defense for Asian and Pacific security affairs from 2011 to 2012.

259,259,U.S. envoy attacker faces attempted murder charge,"Police said Friday they have requested an arrest warrant for a South Korean man on attempted murder charges for slashing U.S. Ambassador to Seoul Mark Lippert's face and wrist in a show of discontent over ongoing bilateral military drills.None of the wounds were critical, and Lippert was well on his way to recovery as of Friday morning, according to Yoon Do-heum, head of Severance Hospital where the envoy underwent s...","Police said Friday they have requested an arrest warrant for a South Korean man on attempted murder charges for slashing U.S. Ambassador to Seoul Mark Lippert's face and wrist in a show of discontent over ongoing bilateral military drills.None of the wounds were critical, and Lippert was well on his way to recovery as of Friday morning, according to Yoon Do-heum, head of Severance Hospital where the envoy underwent surgery.It was the first time a U.S. envoy here has been attacked. Kim was also behind the first-ever assault of a foreign envoy here when he threw a rock at a Japanese ambassador to Seoul in 2010.Kim had told officers that he plotted the attack to stop the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle exercises that kicked off earlier this week. The exercises are part of Seoul and Washington's efforts to better deter threats from North Korea. Kim said he thought the drills hampered progress in inter-Korean reconciliations. The two Koreas remain technically at war since the Korean War in the 1950s ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.Yoon Myeong-seong, head of the Jongno Police Station leading the investigation, said the arrest warrant was requested for charges of attempted murder, violence against a foreign envoy and business obstruction.A special investigation team has been assembled for Kim's case.The team is comprised of nearly 100 prosecutors and police officers, and will be led by the anti-terrorism bureau of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has asked the South Korean authorities to share information on the investigation.The FBI won't participate in the actual probe but will make requests about the probe's direction, an official at the National Police Agency said on condition of anonymity.Kim had told police officers that he had no intention to kill.But Yoon said the fact his act was premeditated and that he slit Lippert multiples times, including the face, with a 25-centimeter-long knife was enough to show that he at least willfully neglected the possibility.A preliminary probe has shown that Kim had been to North Korea seven times between 1999 and 2007. Kim did not appear suspicious during these trips which were approved by the unification ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs. He also tried to erect an altar at the heart of Seoul in memory of late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il in December 2011 shortly after he passed away.Police were already searching Kim's home and office in the western Seoul district of Seodaemun for documents and hard drives on Friday. They said the items will help them learn how Kim planned for the attack and why. They also intend to illuminate whether he had an accomplice. Police have also been issued a warrant to obtain Kim's phone records.The attack happened just four minutes upon Kim's entry to a breakfast event, where he was not invited and where Lippert was to give a speech. Witnesses said the attack happened as Lippert was telling event participants that he would like to have his second child here.Authorities said the U.S. envoy had not been one of the personnel requiring 24-hour guarding. The U.S. Embassy had also not requested bodyguard service, they added.Lippert, 42, became the youngest-ever U.S. envoy to Seoul last year. His wife gave birth to a son here, to whom they gave a Korean middle name. He was previously the assistant secretary of defense for Asian and Pacific security affairs from 2011 to 2012.

After two deadly shooting incidents south of Seoul in late February, the U.S. ambassador to South Korea was attacked by a knife-wielding assailant on Thursday.Despite the geopolitical risks from the inter-Korean confrontation, Seoul had been assessed as one of the safest cities in the world alongside some Asian cities such as Tokyo and Singapore, especially in terms of firearms-related incidents.The number of guns registered in the country hovered around 160,000 in 2014, less than one in 312 of Korea’s 50 million people. Civic group members hold a rally to denounce the knife attack on U.S. Ambassador Mark Lippert in front of Jongno Police Station, where his attacker is being held custody. (Yeo Jun-suk/The Korea Herald)In Seoul ― where roughly one-fifth of the country’s population resides ― there were only 127 cases of guns being used in major crimes from 2008-2013, according to Rep. Kim Hyun of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy. A report from the state-run Korea Development Institute, however, showed that the country has seen a continuous increase in criminal offenses. About 3 percent of Koreans are victims of crime each year, with subsequent social costs estimated at more than 16 percent of the nation’s GDP.Korea also has higher rates of homicide, sex crimes and theft than the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development average.Watchers also pointed to the need for strengthened security around public figures such as diplomats, to keep in line with the rising risk of terrorism worldwide.Until now, Korean police have not protected U.S. ambassadors. The U.S. Embassy has taken charge of guarding their envoys in an attempt to keep their whereabouts confidential.The police and the National Emergency Management Agency said the authority would bolster guard activities for diplomatic envoys residing in Seoul.Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo called for increased security around key diplomatic facilities including the U.S. Embassy. He said the government would “spare no effort in protecting foreign envoys” while instructing Home Affairs Minister Jeong Jong-sub and National Police Agency Chief Kang Sin-myeong to investigate the attack. Experts, however, underlined that the knife attack, albeit the actions of a delusional individual, shed light on the need for better security.“The assailant claimed to have committed the crime as an act of patriotism. But if that’s the case, he failed to understand that attacking envoys of key countries would cause serious repercussions to the country,” criminal psychology professor Lee Soo-jung of Kyonggi University said.“This means Kim’s thinking ability has been compromised,” he said.Korea, meanwhile, is also facing growing calls to bolster its capacity to cope with gun-related incidents.“In the past, there has hardly been a need to prepare against gun-related incidents because such cases were so few and far between,” said Kwak Dae-kyung, professor at the Police Administration Department of Dongguk University.He pointed out that the official manual in police stations for dealing with gun-yielding situations lacked specific instructions on what to do. In last week’s shooting spree in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province, for example, a police officer was shot dead while approaching the culprit with a taser gun.“Our best available option is to monitor the distribution of bullets. One potential solution could be to let people receive bullets at the hunting grounds and to have them return the unused bullets after hunting,” he said. “Basically, we have to make gun use as inconvenient as possible.”The government is mulling whether to put a GPS tracking device on all firearms, but it is unclear how effective it will be with nearly 5,000 guns unaccounted for.According to data presented by Rep. Lee Cheol-woo of the ruling Saenuri Party, the permits of 14,279 guns were canceled as of 2014, but 4,272 of them were not returned to the proper agencies.By Kim Yon-se and Yoon Min-sik(kys@heraldcorp.com) (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","terrorism worldwide until now korean ,after two deadly shooting incidents ,knife wielding assailant on thursday ,violent crimes in recent weeks ,shooting incidents south of seoul","['Korea', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'asian', 'Tokyo', 'Singapore', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'Mark Lippert', 'Jongno Police Station', 'Yeo Jun - suk', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Kim Hyun', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Korea Development Institute', 'Koreans', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'watcher', 'korean', 'U.S.', 'the U.S. Embassy', 'the National Emergency Management Agency', 'Seoul', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'the U.S. Embassy', 'Home Affairs', 'Jeong Jong - sub', 'National Police Agency', 'Kang sin - myeong', 'Lee Soo - jung', 'Kyonggi University', 'Kim', 'Korea', 'Kwak Dae - kyung', 'the Police Administration Department of Dongguk University', 'Hwaseong , Gyeonggi Province', 'Lee Cheol - woo', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Yon - se']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49736935  0.54174149

(Yonhap)President Park Geun-hye, who was in the United Arab Emirates, the third leg of her four-nation trip to the Middle East, said that the incident was not only an attack on the U.S. ambassador, but also an “unacceptable attack on the South Korea-U.S. alliance.”Later in the evening, Park called Lippert and told him she was shocked to hear about the incident.“President Park said she felt pained and said she fully understood what Ambassador Lippert was going through as she suffered from a similar incident,” said her office. Park was cut with a knife by an attacker while on the campaign trail in 2006.The South Korean president said she would pray for his quick recovery and closely cooperate with the U.S. to prevent the incident from having a negative effect on the South Korea-U.S. alliance.Speaking in Korean, Lippert said he was honored to hear warm words from the president, the office added.Her senior foreign secretary also told reporters in Abu Dhabi that the president was considering taking all possible measures. The presidential office held an emergency meeting with Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and Chief of Staff Lee Byung-kee soon after the incident was reported, he said. The South Korean foreign minister is currently accompanying Park on a nine-day trip to the Middle East. In Seoul, Korean National Security Adviser Kim Kwan-jin held an emergency meeting of National Security Council to seek countermeasures for the unexpected attack. U.S. President Barack Obama called Lippert after the attack to wish him a fast recovery, the White House said.The U.S. State Department condemned the attack, which happened at a performing arts center in downtown Seoul as the ambassador was preparing for a lecture about prospects for peace on the Korean Peninsula, and said Lippert’s injuries were not life-threatening.“We strongly condemn this act of violence,” State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said.Political parties here lamented the unprecedented attack and called for a stern and thorough investigation into the case, including looking into negligence on the part of the Seoul authorities in protecting foreign envoys here.They also echoed concern over the attack possibly hurting the Korea-U.S. alliance in the face of widening cracks caused by Washington taking a bolder stance on resolving historical issues with Japan.The parties, however, were of the view that the attack was an individual act by an apparent pro-North activist.“How can such (an attack) happen in our society,” said ruling Saenuri Party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung. Reiterating President Park’s definition of the attack as “terrorism against the Korea-U.S. alliance,” Kim wished for Lippert’s early recovery and called for a thorough investigation.Saenuri floor leader Rep. Yoo Seung-min said, “I cannot help but be appalled and am worried this may seriously affect Korea-U.S. relations.” He called for the government to deal with the case to prevent it from hurting the bilateral alliance.The main-opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy defined the attacker as a “radical nationalist prone to acting unpredictably.”“No act of violence with political intent can be rationalized,” said NPAD leader Rep. Moon Jae-in.

U.S. Ambassador to Korea Mark Lippert hurries into a vehicle while pressing on his wounds after a knife attack before a seminar at the Sejong center for the Performing Arts in downtown Seoul on Thursday morning. (Yonhap)Lippert was attacked by the 55-year-old suspect, Kim Ki-jong, who reportedly ran toward the ambassador, at around 7:40 a.m., with a 25-centimeter-long paring knife. The ambassador had begun to eat breakfast before a speech during the forum organized by the Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation.The bleeding diplomat was rushed to a nearby hospital for emergency treatment and then to another where he received surgery for the cut stretching from his right cheek to his chin and another injury on his left arm. He is in stable condition, medical officials said.Kim was held down by the forum participants right after the attack and arrested. The suspect claimed his attack was aimed at “stopping a war on the Korean peninsula” citing his opposition to the ongoing joint drill by the U.S. and South Korean militaries that is strongly opposed by North Korea.The incident came after the public sentiment against the U.S. deteriorated following U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Wendy Sherman’s recent remarks that suggested Seoul and Beijing were to blame for frayed relations with Japan over history issues.It was the first time a U.S. ambassador to South Korea has been attacked. The incident occurred just about four months after Lippert, a close confidant of President Barack Obama, assumed office at age 41 -- the youngest-ever American ambassador to Seoul.Mindful of possible negative ramifications on its alliance with the U.S., Seoul expressed “shock and deep regrets” over the attack and decided to “sternly” punish its officials in charge of protecting the U.S. diplomat. Police vowed to thoroughly investigate the case and beefed up its security of the U.S. Embassy staff and buildings.Seoul and Washington agreed to closely cooperate to prevent the attack from negatively influencing their alliance, Seoul officials said.During the breakfast conference, Kim was sitting at a table right next to the head table where Lippert was preparing for a speech. Witnesses said the attacker abruptly approached the diplomat, pushed him onto the table and slashed him.Lippert’s surgery lasted for some two and a half hours, and medical officials said that it was “successful.”“The cut on his face was 11-centimeter-long and 3-centimeter-deep, and the cut on his arm was about 2-centimeter-long and 2-centimeter-deep. He received some 80 stitches on his face,” said Chung Nam-sik, head of the Yonsei University Health System at a news conference.“He will need hospitalization for some three to four days. And we will need to watch him carefully, but our concerns for now are about the scars on his face and any aftereffect from the cuts on his wrist,” he added. Other medical officials said that the scars would almost disappear one or two years later. Right after his arrest, Kim, the head of the leftist group, “Urimadang,” shouted, “I carried out the terror attack. I have prepared to disseminate leaflets to oppose the (South Korea-U.S.) military exercise for a war.”In the leaflet, he called for the “suspension of the exercise that blocks inter-Korean dialogue and Seoul’s retaking of wartime operational control (from Washington).”Kim claimed his right ankle broke when the police restrained him He was carried away on a stretcher, and told reporters, “I oppose the military drills, a reason why the two Koreas can’t hold the reunions of separated families.”He also said that he prepared for the attack for some 10 days, and that there was no accomplice or any directives to carry out the attack. “I made a sacrifice myself so as to stop the Key Resolve exercise,” he said.Officials of the forum’s organizer said that Kim was not invited to the event, but they could not block him from entering because he expressed his wish to attend, and the organizers had no authority to block his entry.It was not his first attack on foreign diplomats. In 2010, he hurled blocks of concrete toward then-Japanese Ambassador Toshinori Shigeie during his lecture in Seoul. He was given a two-year jail term suspended for three years.According to intelligence officials, Kim shifted focus from anti-Japan activities to anti-U.S. campaigns after he visited North Korea multiple times. Seoul’s Unification Ministry said that Kim, who served as a member of the state unification education panel, visited the North Korean border city of Gaeseong eight times between 2006 and 2007 on a mission to plant trees.Investigators appear to believe it was his personal decision to carry out the attack. Police plan to raid and search Kim’s house and seek an arrest warrant to detain him for a longer period on charges of attempted murder and possession of a lethal weapon.

Abrasion caused slipperiness between older and newer parts of the safety control system, leading to the accident. The 21-year-old seaman of the 2nd Fleet Command, surnamed Oh, remains in critical condition.The officials also pointed out that several crewmembers failed to comply with safety rules concerning the removal of a piece of ammunition stuck in a malfunctioning gun, resulting in the injury.Oh was hit by a shell fired from the 76-caliber gun on a guided missile warship in the West Sea on Jan. 21. He was standing on the deck near the weapon as other sailors tried to remove the shells loaded in the malfunctioning gun for safety reasons. The gun malfunctioned due to a loosened nut in a component of the gun, officials said.The Navy said that it would take disciplinary action against those who failed to adhere to safety rules, and that it would increase the frequency of the regular overhaul of its warships from once every 12 years to every six years.The gun in question was installed on the warship in the early 2000s following a major overhaul after being used for some 21 years on a different warship.

The pastor of Light Korean Presbyterian Church near Toronto went to the North on a humanitarian mission, the paper said.Lim had been expected to leave the North on Feb. 4, but church officials were not immediately concerned because of North Korea's policy to quarantine foreigners for three weeks as a measure to contain Ebola, the paper quoted church spokesperson Lisa Pak as saying. She also said the pastor has visited the North more than 100 times on humanitarian missions so far.Christian missionaries have often been detained in the North.Kenneth Bae, one of such missionaries, was released in November after about two years of detention in the communist nation. Bae, who entered the North in late 2012, was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for unspecified anti-state crimes.

They were reported to be involved in a financial dispute. The victims’ daughter-in-law fled the scene, injuring her lower back after jumping from the second story of the home where the crime occurred.A construction worker nearby who heard gunshots alerted law enforcement. But the first police officer to reach the scene was shot on arrival by Jeon. The officer was not wearing bulletproof gear. Police cordon off a house in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province, where a man shot and killed himself and three other people Friday. (Yonhap)Jeon killed himself at the crime scene after he was cornered by law enforcement officers, police said.Police later found a letter written by Jeon in his car, claiming Friday’s crime was premediated.“I have written everything down by the book. I am sure no one has found out about my plans,” the letter read, according to authorities.“The letter indicates the crime was most likely planned out,” a police spokesman said. “But we will look into what the specific motive was.”Jeon had frequently threatened his brother and his family when he got drunk, police added. Jeon was reportedly under the influence of alcohol at the time of the killings.On Wednesday, a similar shooting in Sejong left four people dead. The killer had shot three people near a local convenience store, and killed himself a few hours later. The killer, surnamed Kang, set the store on fire after shooting his victims. The victims were the boyfriend and family members of Kang’s ex-girlfriend. Police think Kang committed the crime out of revenge, and disagreements over money with his former partner.Police said they would seek measures to make it more difficult for people to own guns.Both Jeon and Kang used hunting rifles, weapons usually stored at local police stations. Authorized gun owners can take out their guns in only at certain times of the year and certain times of day. Hunting rifles are allowed to be taken out by owners in the hunting season, which begins in November and ends in February.More than 160,000 guns are stored in police stations.

Indonesia is planning to host the Asian-African Conference from April 22-23 in Jakarta to be followed by a key ceremony in the Indonesian city of Bandung on April 24 to mark the 60th anniversary of the Bandung meeting in 1955. The nonaligned movement emerged from the 1955 gathering. A Taiwanese news outlet reported last month Kim may attend the April meeting, but it has yet to be confirmed. If Kim does so, it would be his first visit to a foreign country since abruptly taking power in December 2011 following the death of his father, Kim Jong-il. The North Korean leader is also reportedly planning to join a ceremony in Moscow in May to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory in World War II.The Indonesian government has also invited President Park Geun-hye to the April gathering although sources said she may not appear at the meeting due to scheduling conflicts. Still, the Indonesian meeting may draw heavy attention for the possibility of the North Korean leaders' contact with South Korean and Chinese officials, with Chinese President Xi Jinping and high-level South Korean diplomats expected to join the meeting. The communist North has apparently made much of the Bandung Conference, attempting to use it for diplomatic campaigns.The North's founding leader Kim Il-sung joined a 1965 ceremony to mark the 10th anniversary of the birth of the conference. The late leader Kim Jong-il accompanied him.A meeting between then South Korean Prime Minister Lee Hae-chan and Kim Yong-nam was arranged in 2005 when the North Korean nominal head attended the 50th anniversary.

Ex-parliament chief Park Hee-tae convicted of sexual harassment. (Yonhap)The local branch of the Chuncheon District Court sentenced him to six months in jail with a one-year stay of execution and ordered him to take 40 hours of anti-sexual violence education.Park persistently groped the plaintiff, identified only as a 24-year-old caddie, until the ninth hole, Judge Park Byeong-min said in the ruling. And while the plaintiff had withdrawn her accusations, sexual harassment is a serious crime punishable even without the plaintiff’s consent, he added.Still, the judge said he took into consideration that the plaintiff no longer wished to punish the former lawmaker and that she had reached an agreement with Park and withdrawn her accusations.He said he also took into account that Park admitted to his wrongdoing, has no criminal record and is ""of old age.""Prosecutors had called for a fine of 3 million won ($2,721) in addition to the anti-sexual violence education.Park said he will consider whether to appeal but declined to comment further.

A 45-year-old hotel employee surnamed Park died from carbon dioxide poisoning while working in the underground boiler room at Colon Hotel, the police said. Six others were hospitalized for minor injuries, they added. “The fire alarms suddenly rang while (they were) replacing the insulators, and then there was a leak of carbon dioxide,” the wounded workers testified to police. Investigators suspected that the fire extinguishing system had been damaged while an insulator was being replaced. The fire extinguishing systems of boiler rooms or machinery rooms are not equipped with water but with carbon dioxide due to the threat of electric shocks. While no fire was reported at the scene of the accident, the workers could not evacuate due to an automatic fire-containment door, police said. About 60 hotel guests immediately evacuated from the building, police added. An investigation to determine the exact cause of the accident is underway, authorities said.

The lion enclosure contained a 10-year-old male as well as a 6-year-old female. It is not clear whether Kim was attacked by both of the animals or just one. He was alone with the lions when the attack occurred.The 53-year-old was discovered by a colleague on Thursday afternoon, unconscious and bleeding. He died shortly after being sent to a nearby hospital.According to the Seoul Metropolitan Government, Kim has been working at the zoo for about 20 years, but had only been working with dangerous animals for the past three years. Authorities shut down the enclosure and put both lions in quarantine. The zoo at Children’s Grand Park has been temporarily closed since Sunday since a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza was confirmed in the feces of birds at a nearby stream. First established in 1973, Children’s Grand Park ― which includes hiking trails, a zoo and an amusement park ― has been open to the public for free since 2006. Its zoo owns some 4,100 animals of 95 species, including elephants and chimpanzees.According to the park complex, this was the first time one of its zookeepers was attacked by zoo animals. In 2013, a zookeeper surnamed Shim was attacked by a tiger at Seoul Grand Park Zoo in the city of Gwacheon and died in spite of 15 days of medical treatment.

Workers were pouring concrete into the mold of ceiling slabs when a few of them fell along with part of the ceiling that suddenly caved in and they were buried with others who were working underneath it at that time. They were trapped for a little over an hour before they were rescued by the firefighters and sent to nearby hospitals. None has sustained any serious injuries from the collapse, with a few of them appearing to have suffered leg injuries, firefighters said. Firefighters earlier had said there were nine people buried under the debris, but they found three more victims during the rescue.

The pileup occurred at 9:34 a.m. on the Seoul-bound lanes of the Yeongjong Bridge that connects Incheon’s Yeongjong Island ― where the nation’s main airport is located ― to the mainland.Police said the pileup was triggered after an airport limousine bus rear-ended the passenger-vehicle in front of it. Drivers’ visibility was severely limited due to heavy fog, they added.Survivors said they could only see about 15 to 20 meters in front of them because of fog during the time of the accident. The pileup caused a tailback extending for more than a kilometer, hampering emergency services’ access to the site and crippling traffic.According to the emergency services in Incheon, at least two people were killed and more than 60 people suffered injuries. Among the injured, at least eight are said to be in critical condition. The two victims were identified as 46-year-old Lim and 51-year-old Kim, respectively. While Kim’s body was sent to Myongji Hospital in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province, Lim’s was sent to Na-Eun Hospital in Incheon.As of Wednesday afternoon, 19 foreign nationals were confirmed to have been injured. Among them, seven were Chinese, five Thai, two Japanese and two Vietnamese. The victims also included a Swiss, Bangladeshi and Russian, according to firefighters.One of the 19 injured foreign nationals is in critical condition, they added.The injured were sent to three different hospitals near the bridge for treatment.Shortly after the accident, police and firefighters shut down the entire Seoul-bound lanes of the bridge.“We are looking into nearby CCTV footage to determine the exact cause of the accident,” a police officer said. The Yeongjong Bridge, established in 2000, is part of the Incheon International Airport Expressway.

The others suffered permanent physical disorders. The report was written by the center’s research team, led by anesthesiology professor Kim Duk-kyung.“This only counts the cases that led to medical lawsuits. The actual number of anesthesia-related accidents is assumed to be more than 100 cases every year,” Kim said. This is the first time that figures on anesthesia accidents have been released here. The research was published in the February issue of the Journal of Korean Medical Science. One type of general anesthesia, which induces loss of protective reflexes and requires the use of a breathing tube, accounted for 48 percent of the deaths, the report showed. Sleeping anesthesia, which also induces sleep yet allows patients to breathe unassisted accounted for 37 percent, it added. The latter is known to be relatively safer than general anesthesia but still had a notable accident rate, the report said. The Korea Society of Anesthesiologists, a doctors’ union, pointed out that about 43 percent of the cases would have been “preventable if standard anesthesia care was given.” In case of sleeping anesthesia accidents, more than 90 percent of anesthesia injections were given by surgeons not by anesthesiologists, the report stated. For sleeping anesthesia, an intravenously administered hypnotic agent called propofol was used 90 percent of the time. Propofol is known for its hallucinogenic effects and addictiveness. It has also been reported that propofol is likely to cause more respiratory depression than other types of sedation, experts said.Despite the side effects of propofol, the majority of the concerned institutions did not record information about the anaesthetization of the victims, the report said. Very few hospitals recorded information on the use of anesthesia, it added. Of the victims, about 83 percent were under the age of 60, it added. Based on the report, the KSA is gearing up to urge the government to raise awareness and strengthen regulations on the use anesthesia. By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","anesthesia accidents more than 90 ,16 people died of anesthesia ,105 patients who suffered anesthesia ,accidents in korea in recent ,sleeping anesthesia accidents more than","['Korea', 'Samsung Medical Center ’s', 'Kim Duk - kyung', 'Kim', 'the Journal of Korean Medical Science', 'the Korea Society of Anesthesiologists', 'KSA', 'Lee Hyun -']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34284511  0.34076017

The company ― which runs the city’s subway lines Nos. 1-4 ― refuted Oh’s claims by saying Oh was responsible for the accident since he had been walking down the escalator without holding the handle while counting money.Seoul Central District Court ruled in favor of Oh, and ordered Seoul Metro to pay him 66 million won ($59,929) to compensate for his injury. “Safety supervisors at a station have the responsibility to conduct thorough safety inspections and maintenance on facilities used by many people,” the court said in its ruling. “While Oh did walk down the escalator and was not mindful of the steps, his action cannot be regarded as something completely outside the norm. (The officials) should have anticipated such action would take place and made sure that it would not lead to an accident.”But the court said the company was only 80 percent responsible for the accident, since it would have been avoidable if Oh had paid closer attention to his actions.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","seoul metro after he lost ,accident at subway station local ,man who lost five toes ,escalator accident at subway station ,subway operator should pay compensation","['Seoul', 'Seoul Metro', 'Nos', 'Seoul Central District Court', 'Seoul Metro']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38674146  0.01597618

Prosecutors said they considered him a witness, rather than a suspect.The details of the case in which he was allegedly involved were not immediately clear. Ham was once in charge of the Navy's shipbuilding division.In November, South Korea launched a task force made up of prosecutors, military officers and government officials to root out corruption in the defense industry.The move came after an expensive homegrown salvage ship was proved defective at the peak of efforts to save those missing from a ferry disaster last year. The sinking claimed more than 300 lives.

The Navy said they had no other option but to drive them out in order to complete the construction of five four-story apartment buildings that would house essential members of navy operations and their families in the future, timed with the completion of the naval base in December as planned.The military has been constructing a modern military port that would hold up to 20 warships simultaneously, along with two 150,000 ton cruise ships.The military says the Jeju base, if completed as scheduled in December, will give Seoul a launching point for sending naval vessels into the South Sea, a key trade route for South Korea.But the opponents have long staged protests and taken legal steps to halt construction, citing potential environmental damage to the area designated as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.

(Yonhap)A 37-year-old suspect, identified only by his surname Heo, confessed to hitting the 29-year-old victim in Cheongju, North Chungcheong Province on Jan. 10. The victim, surnamed Kang, was on his way home with a bag of custard-filled bread for his pregnant wife who was studying for a state test to become a certified teacher. He died on the spot. Kang called his wife -- who is expecting a child in two months -- just before the accident apologizing for not getting her cake because of their financial difficulties. The final moments of the victim immediately moved tens of thousands of online users, who sympathized with him as “cream-bread dad.”News of the incident stirred a national uproar, but the police had difficulty in identifying the car model and its registered number plate due to the poor quality of image captured by the surveillance camera. The case went viral after a local traffic officer left a message on a popular website after reading the reports. He said that his office operates another surveillance camera installed near the accident site and that it could give a clue.After analyzing the fresh footage, the police on Thursday released that the car model the suspect drove was Chevrolet Windstorm, and requested for any information. (Yonhap)Under pressure, the suspect turned himself in at the police station later in the evening.Heo confessed that he drove after drinking four bottles of soju but claimed that he wasn’t aware of hitting the man at that time, the police said. He came to know of the tragedy from the news coverage, investigators said after questioning him on Friday. The police said they would seek an arrest warrant for the suspect soon, officials said. The suspect said he turned in himself because he “felt so guilty and couldn’t breathe.”Investigators, however, suspect that Heo may have attempted to remove all evidence and cover up the case.The suspect had brought the damaged car to his parents’ house and repaired it with components he purchased, police said. The police also said that the suspect tried to commit suicide but was persuaded by his wife to give himself up.

However, it was extremely unusual that, at least on paper, China sold no crude oil to North Korea for all of last year.In 2014, China's exports of petroleum products to North Korea jumped 48.22 percent from a year earlier to US$1.54 million, according to the data based on Chinese trade statistics and compiled by the Beijing unit of South's Korea Trade and Investment Promotion Agency.""Although final statistics show that China's exports of crude oil to North Korea were counted as 'zero' in 2014, experts suggest that the possibility of China's suspension of crude oil exports to North Korea remains low,"" the agency said in a statement.South Korean diplomatic sources in Beijing have also cautioned against reading too much into the official Chinese trade figures because China has provided crude oil to North Korea in the form of grant aid and such shipments were not recorded on paper.There has been no clear indication that the 2014 trade figures reflect China's willingness to use crude oil as leverage to press North Korea to change course in its nuclear ambition.North Korea conducted its third and most powerful nuclear test in February 2013, straining political ties with Beijing's leadership.Asked about the absence of crude oil shipments to North Korea, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying stressed Beijing's ""normal"" trade relations with North Korea, but sidestepped questions over whether Beijing genuinely stopped shipping crude oil to Pyongyang.Excluding crude oil, bilateral trade between North Korea and China fell 2.79 percent from a year ago to $6.36 billion last year, marking the first annual decline in six years, according to the data.

Nine are still missing. The sinking of the 6,825-ton ferry is one of the deadliest maritime disasters in the country's history, and it triggered widespread calls for an overhaul of the country's maritime safety regulations.Those implicated in the tragedy have been arrested and are on trial, with state prosecutors claiming a combination of ship cargo overloading, poor steering and remodeling of the vessel as the cause of the disaster.Criticism of the government's poor initial response and confusion led to the dismantlement of the Coast Guard.The ministry said that 800 million won (US$742,000) will be used next month to conduct detailed evaluations on the main sea routes around the country, with another 4 billion won to be spent on establishing new safe operational guidelines around the major ports of Ulsan, Gwangyang and Incheon that are used frequently by oil tankers and other large ships.The Sewol ferry had left from Incheon on its ill-fated voyage, with port authorities being blamed for failing to check whether the ship was overloaded.In addition, the maritime ministry said it will follow through on reform measures announced in September that call for the government to directly regulate safety, increase the amount of fines for rule violations from 30 million won to 1 billion won, and reduce the age of vessels that can be used as car ferries from 30 to 25 years.All crew members will be obliged to wear uniforms, and barriers restricting companies from entering the shipping line business will be lifted in June.To ensure that companies make a profit, which is critical for upgrading safety rules and crew training, the government will allow fuel surcharges and flexible fare rates for weekend operations.In addition, the ministry said it will take steps to reduce the number of accidents involving fishing boats, which made up 76.7 percent of all maritime accidents in the past five years.These steps include automatic location tracking systems, compelling crew members to wear life jackets and implementing mandatory safety instruction for people on fishing boats.On the peaceful use of waters surrounding the Korean Peninsula, systematic measures will be taken to better manage the country's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and its continental shelf regions, the ministry said.

Any driver who refuses a passenger will be slapped with a 200,000 won ($185) fine the first time, and a 400,000 won fine and 30 day suspension the second time. Drivers caught turning away passengers three times in two years will have to pay a 600,000 won fine on top of having their permits revoked.The government will also clamp down on taxi companies. For example, a company with 100 taxis will be issued a first warning if its drivers have been caught refusing passengers 20 times, resulting in a 60 day operation freeze. After 40 cases, the authorities will issue a second warning and force the company to reduce its number of taxis. After 60 violations, the company will receive a third warning and lose its license to operate.The number of violations required for each warning will vary in proportion to the size of each company’s taxi fleet.Officials said the new measure was aimed at reducing the inconveniences caused by taxis’ illegal refusal to accept passengers. Particularly late at night when most buses have ceased to operate, many taxi drivers here cherry-pick their customers to earn the highest profit per ride.

Japan’s continuing efforts to repatriate the abductees will deter North Korean military provocations this year, experts said in the seminar “Where do the North Korea-Japan relations stand today?” at the East Asia Foundation building in Seoul last Wednesday.“The abduction of Japanese citizens has been a stumbling block to improving relations with North Korea,” said Keio University professor emeritus Masao Okonogi. “Although a credible report has yet to be released by the North ― one was initially due last December ― the first finding will be a lynchpin in normalizing our diplomacy.”The issue has been Japan’s “top priority” regarding the North for the last 20 years; it prompted its participation in the six-party talks and diplomatic normalization efforts with the regime.While the United States and the United Nations have recently ratcheted up pressure on North Korea on human rights and nuclear issues, Japan has engaged in a policy of “pressure and dialogue,” observers say.North Korea has acknowledged having abducted 13 citizens between 1977 and 1983 to provide Japanese language and culture training for its spies. The Japanese government’s official tally is 17.Okonogi said that Prime Minister Abe Shinzo, now in his second term, was able to win the snap election on Dec. 14 on the promise of a “strong Japan” and the vow to settle the abduction issue while in office.“In his first term as prime minister from 2006 (to 2007), he made no progress on the issue and left behind a great burden,” Okonogi said. “Now his second prime ministership hinges on his ‘high-risk, high-reward’ pledge, which is set to determine his political life.”Critics have pointed out that Japan’s conservative politicians have used the issue to arouse nationalism, revise the pacifist constitution and strengthen its military.Japan’s leading scholar on North Korea, Keio University professor emeritus Masao Okonogi, spoke about the abduction issue in the seminar “Where do the North Korea-Japan relations stand today?” at the East Asia Foundation building in Seoul last Wednesday. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)“For Abe and other nationalists, the kidnappings underlined the weakness of Japan’s postwar institutions, which were incapable of ensuring citizens’ safety and territorial integrity,” The Diplomat said in reference to Abe’s “Taking Japan Back” campaign.North Korea had long justified its conduct as “revenge” against Japan’s wartime atrocities against Koreans. However, Ritsumeikan University visiting professor Hirai Hisashi, who participated in the seminar, said, “It also gave Japan a platform to see itself as a ‘victim’ rather than an ‘aggressor.’”At the height of the Cold War, North Korea sent waves of secret agents in high-powered spy boats disguised as fishing vessels to kidnap Japanese citizens. Their prime targets being coastal areas, five of 17 were abducted from the port city of Niigata.Megumi Yokota, then a 13-year-old girl, was abducted in Niigata in November 1977. She has since become a symbol of Japan’s “open wounds.” Her parents have appeared on television, given over 1,400 lectures nationwide and spoken to Japanese politicians and international organizations. When then-Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi visited Pyongyang to resolve the issue in 2002, North Korea said that Megumi had committed suicide in 1994 after being told that she could never return home. A DNA test of her alleged remains in Japan came out negative.Late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il acknowledged the abductions, but shirked responsibility by blaming “some agents who wanted to show their heroism and adventurism.”North Korea opened investigations in 2002 and 2004, and admitted that 13 were kidnapped, and eight had died. But Japan rejected the findings, trusting its National Police Agency instead, which estimated that around 880 had been kidnapped.Five abductees returned home on Oct. 15, 2002. Their children joined them after Koizumi revisited Pyongyang in 2004.In their first major high-level meeting in a decade in Stockholm last May, North Korea agreed to “reinvestigate” the abductions through a special investigation committee. In return, Japan lifted several sanctions last July ― raising the ceiling for money transfers to North Korea from Japan, and easing the ban on the entry of North Koreans and sending of humanitarian goods.Okonogi said that North Korea was unlikely to engage in a military provocation this year, at least until October, when the country celebrates the Workers’ Party’s 70th anniversary.“Public opinion will not be favorable to confrontation. Therefore, the regime will pursue the double-track of nuclear and economic development, while playing cat-and-mouse through negotiations,” Hirai said.Meanwhile, Megumi’s parents, 82-year-old Shigeru and 78-year-old Sakie, continue their search for their daughter, who would be 50 if alive. “Time is running out,” they told the press recently.By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","seoul last wednesday the abduction ,abductees will deter north korean ,korean family reunion this year ,fishing vessels to kidnap japanese ,building in seoul last wednesday","['South Korea', 'inter - korean', 'Japan', 'North Korea', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'north korean', 'North Korea', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'japanese', 'North Korea', 'Keio University', 'Masao Okonogi', 'Japan', 'the United States', 'the United Nations', 'North Korea', 'Japan', 'North Korea', 'japanese', 'Abe Shinzo', 'Japan', 'Okonogi', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'North Korea', 'Keio University', 'Masao Okonogi', 'North Korea', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Joel Lee', 'Abe', 'Japan', 'Diplomat', 'Abe ’s "" take', 'North Korea', 'Japan', 'Koreans', 'Ritsumeikan University', 'Hirai Hisashi', 'Japan', 'North Korea', 'japanese', 'Niigata', 'Megumi Yokota', 'Niigata', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'Junichiro Koizumi', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'Megumi', 'Japan', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - il', '”North Korea', 'Japan', 'National Police Agency', 'Koizumi', 'Pyongyang', 'Stockholm', 'North Korea', 'Japan', 'North Korea', 'Japan', 'North Koreans', 'Okonogi', 'North Korea', 'the Workers ’ Party ’s', 'Megumi', 'Sakie', 'time', 'Joel Lee']",10,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.7365877   0.20028438

Abe, speaking to public broadcaster NHK, said he was ""speechless"" at the ""unbearable pain and sorrow"" that Yukawa's family were feeling. ""Such act of terrorism is outrageous and impermissible, it causes me nothing but strong indignation,"" he said.""I condemn it strongly and resolutely,"" he said as he demanded the immediate release of Yukawa's fellow captive, freelance journalist Kenji Goto.Shoichi Yukawa told of the horror of realising the threats to kill his son had been carried out.""I thought 'Ah, this finally happened' and was filled with regret,"" he said in a statement to media.""I went totally blank, I was only sorry... I had no words to say,"" he said. ""In my mind I wish very much that this wasn't true.""US President Barack Obama led the condemnation of the Islamic State group's ""brutal murder"" of Yukawa. British Prime Minister David Cameron decried the movement's ""murderous barbarity"", and French President Francois Hollande labelled it a ""barbaric assassination"". Japan would continue analysing the images to fully confirm the authenticity of the video, said Abe, but the ""credibility"" of the footage was ""high"". The recording, which lasts nearly three minutes, shows a still image of Goto holding what appears to be a photograph of Yukawa's slain body.It was posted with an audio recording in which a man claiming to be Goto blames Abe for his fellow captive's death after he failed to pay a $200 million ransom.The voice also reveals a new demand from the militants for the release of Sajida al-Rishawi, a female militant now held in Jordan, in exchange for Goto's life.Abe said Japan was in contact with Jordan but declined to comment on whether Tokyo would ask Amman to release the prisoner, who is being held in connection with multiple murders.The appearance of the video was met with initial skepticism, partly because it was not posted on an official IS channel and does not bear their black and white flag. The execution of Yukawa is also not shown.Goto's mother, Junko Ishido, told reporters Sunday that she was left with little hope after seeing the picture of her son, in which he ""looked very tense"".- Mother's appeal for mercy -=============================The hostage saga began on Tuesday when the militants released a video in which they demanded a $200 million ransom within 72 hours in exchange for the lives of the two hostages.On Friday Goto's mother Ishido launched an emotional appeal begging for mercy for her son.""I say to you people of the Islamic State, Kenji is not your enemy. Please release him,"" she said.As the deadline passed Friday, there was an agonising silence from the jihadists until this new video was posted late Saturday.The Islamic State group, which rules large swathes of Iraq and Syria under a strict form of Islamic law, has murdered five Western hostages since August last year, but this is the first time it has threatened Japanese captives.Japanese officials have repeatedly said they are trying to make contact with the militants through various channels.Abe advisor Yosuke Isozaki reportedly said there had been some ""indirect""  communication with the militants, but ""nothing direct"".Tokyo has little diplomatic leverage in the Middle East, but local media had previously said Abe may try to use his close relationship with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to rescue the hostages.The Islamists linked their earlier $200 million ransom demand to the amount Abe said he would earmark to help countries dealing with the influx of refugees fleeing fighting between IS militants and regular forces.Abe was defiant Sunday, saying Tokyo was not intimidated by the murder. ""We will never give in to terrorism, and actively contribute to the peace and stability of the world together with the international community. We are not wavering at all on this policy,"" he said on NHK.The Japanese media has rallied around Goto, a respected and experienced war reporter whose work has appeared on domestic television channels.In video footage he filmed around the time he entered Syria, he explains that he is aware of the risks.""Whatever happens, I am the one who is responsible,"" he says. ""I am asking you, Japanese people, do not place responsibility on the people of Syria. Please. I am sure I will come back alive though.""

Oh was standing on the deck near the cannon as other sailors tried to remove the shells loaded in the flawed system for safety reasons.The accident took place some 6.2 kilometers off the coast of Taean, South Chungcheong Province at around 6.20 p.m. He was immediately transported to a nearby hospital and received emergency surgery that night. “During a live-fire drill on the ship near Uldo Island in West Sea, no shell was able to come out of the cannon for a reason yet to be identified. So, we decided to return to the base,” said a senior Navy official, declining to be named.“Before reaching the port, we had to remove all the shells loaded into the cannon to ensure that the shells did not explode on the ground. The shell, all of a sudden, was fired and hit the side of Oh’s head.”The official added that the fired shell exploded in the air and fell into the sea, and that there were no civilian casualties.The Navy is currently investigating what caused the problem in the cannon, and whether sailors complied with safety regulations concerning the process of removing shells from a malfunctioning weapons system at sea.The cannon was manufactured in Israel and has been upgraded by a Korean defense firm.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","shell accidently fired from malfunctioning ,coma after the shell hit ,hit by shell accidently fired ,accidently fired from malfunctioning 76 ,being hit by shell accidently","['Navy', 'the 2nd Fleet Command', 'Uldo Island', 'Navy', 'Navy', 'Israel', 'korean', 'Song Sang - ho']",14,[ 0.         0.         0.        ... -0.3843551 -0.000552   0.3577162]

The 18-year-old tourist from Seoul, surnamed Kim, vanished on Jan. 10 after leaving a hotel in the border town of Kilis, according to the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency and Foreign Ministry. He initially set foot in Istanbul on Jan. 8 and flew to the southern city of Gaziantep before reaching Kilis by car the next day with another Korean surnamed Hong, who reported his disappearance to the Korean Embassy on Jan. 12.After questioning his family and Hong, the police concluded that Kim appeared to have willingly gone to the border region as he had been in contact with a Turkish man via social media, arranged his entire itinerary on his own and concealed the purpose of the trip to Hong and his parents. “So far we have not discovered any link to a possible abduction or disappearance,” Chung Jae-il, head of the agency’s first international crime investigative unit, told a news conference in Seoul. “Although we unearthed a multitude of materials suggesting his interest in the IS, we cannot confirm whether he has actually joined it.” Since October, Kim had chatted with a Twitter user based in Turkey about ways to join the extremist group, the police said. The man gave Kim the phone number of a presumed IS member in Istanbul named Hassan who would “help” him via Surespot, an encrypted messenger service that directly links users’ devices to transmit conversations to boost security. In one Twitter post, a user purported to be Kim said he “wanted to join” the militant group. In another, he wrote he was “ready” to travel to the Eurasian country. He also wrote he sought to “leave my country and family” and “just want to get a new life.” The police also found more than 50 images on his computer of IS fighters and flags and Muslim women, as well as evidence that he had looked up such words as the IS, Islam, Turkey and Syria more than 500 times over the past year, with 65 related websites bookmarked on his browser. On Tuesday, Foreign Ministry officials here said that Kim had ridden with a local man in a vehicle with Syrian license plates that was being used as an unregistered taxi, citing CCTV footage and the Turkish police.The driver told Turkish police that he dropped them off after about 25 minutes near a Syrian refugee camp in Besiriye, some 18 kilometers east of Kilis and 5 kilometers from the frontier. He said the two men had not conversed during the ride, apparently to avoid revealing their identities. But the video failed to help identify the other passenger, who the driver said spoke Arabic and was “ordinary” though he could not specify his nationality.With Turkey and Syria sharing a porous border stretching some 900 kilometers, many foreign terrorist fighters travel from Istanbul to Kilis via Gaziantep to sneak into Syria, experts and activists say. If he has indeed joined the group, Kim would be the first confirmed Korean IS fighter. A Saudi Arabian IS member said in a media interview in September that the group consisted of fighters of various nationalities, including Koreans, but Seoul officials have dismissed the claim as unreliable. Ankara said it has barred entry to Turkey of more than 7,200 people who were thought to be seeking IS membership, while deporting nearly 1,200 would-be jihadists.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","korean teenager who went missing ,on his browser on tuesday ,turkish police that he dropped ,his browser on tuesday ,jan 10 after leaving hotel","['korean', 'Turkey', 'syrian', 'Islamic', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'Kilis', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency', 'Foreign Ministry', 'Istanbul', 'Gaziantep', 'Kilis', 'korean', 'Hong', 'the Korean Embassy', 'Hong', 'Kim', 'turkish', 'Hong', 'Chung Jae - il', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'Turkey', 'Kim', 'Istanbul', 'Hassan', 'Kim', 'eurasian', 'muslim', 'Islam', 'Turkey', 'Syria', 'Foreign Ministry', 'Kim', 'syrian', 'CCTV', 'turkish', 'turkish', 'syrian', 'Besiriye', 'Kilis', 'Turkey', 'Syria', 'Istanbul', 'Kilis', 'Gaziantep', 'Syria', 'Kim', 'korean', 'saudi Arabian', 'Koreans', 'Seoul', 'Ankara', 'Turkey', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46579963  0.43550387

It would mark the first known occurrence of a South Korean national to join any radical Muslim militant group if Kim were found to have joined the group voluntarily.   After searching Kim's personal computer, the investigator said Kim accessed IS-linked websites and exchanged dialogue with a Turkish friend he met online known as ""Hassan."" Kim's parents allowed him to travel to Turkey, along with a family friend, after he pleaded to make the trip, the official said, adding that they were unaware that Kim had wanted to meet Hassan in person.Also, police said Kim posted on his Facebook account on Jan. 7 that he wanted to leave South Korea to search for a new life.""I want to leave this country and family. I just want a new life,"" Kim said.The SMPA also said that Kim made one phone call on Jan. 9 and another on Jan. 10 before taking a taxi with a Syrian license plate, together with an unidentified man after meeting him in front of the hotel in Kilis. Kim and the unknown man then got off near a refugee camp in Besiriye, about 18 kilometers southeast from Kilis, on that day, according to the official.

But police found that he had already possessed the tools for the homicide when he visited the crime scene, said investigators at Ansan Sangrok Police Station. “CCTV images of the adjacent areas (of the crime scene) showed that Kim bought a pair of work gloves at a store near the victim’s home before breaking in,” officials said. They also learned that Kim already had on him the knife he used in the crime when he entered the residence where the victims lived.Although Kim has denied raping his stepdaughter before murdering her, forensic analysis of the girl’s body discovered Kim’s semen and traces of his DNA inside the body. Investigators found that Kim was frequently violent with his wife during the seven years they lived together. “When his wife refused to meet him or talk to him over the phone, Kim planned the cited crime. He believed that he could lure her out by taking the children hostage,” police said. Police profilers have deduced that Kim is a psychopath who is deluded into believing he can control the actions and even thoughts of his wife. They said that he has very little guilt and empathy. He is also very violent and tries to rationalize his crimes, they added.Kim is also being charged with the illegal possession of a Japanese sword. Overall, he is facing 10 different charges including homicide, rape, assault and confinement against one’s will.On Jan. 12, Kim entered the home of his wife’s ex-husband and took the man’s common law wife hostage. When his wife’s ex-husband returned, Kim killed him with a kitchen knife he is thought to have brought from his home. He then took the teenage girls, born between his wife and her ex-husband, hostage. He was caught after police commandos stormed the residence after a five-hour negotiation ended in failure.By Yoon Min-shik, Choi He-suk(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com) (cheesuk@heraldcorp.com)","raped his stepdaughter before killing ,police and killed his stepdaughter ,raping his stepdaughter before murdering ,killed his stepdaughter but police ,crime and raped his stepdaughter","['Kim Sang - hoon', 'Kim Sang - hoon(yonhap)the', 'Ansan', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Kim', 'Ansan Sangrok Police Station', 'CCTV', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'japanese', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Yoon Min - shik', 'Choi He-suk(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36560962  0.10139602

(Yonhap)The authorities believe that the workers, employees of a demolition contractor, were in the process of detaching the machine room from the 40-ton crane. According to reports, three of the workers were cutting through structures holding the machine room in place, while another was working inside the machine room. A fifth worker assigned to the project escaped unhurt as he was overseeing the operations from the ground. The shipyard was initially believed to belong to Daesun Shipbuilding and Engineering Co., but it was later revealed that the company had sold the facility to Geocheong Shipbuilding Co. in December. Geochung is a supplier of ship parts, and the crane was being dismantled as part of the company’s plans to convert the plot occupied by the structure for a different use. The police plans to question witnesses and officials of the contractor to determine whether safety protocols were followed.

The 18-year-old tourist, surnamed Kim from Seoul, vanished on Jan. 10 after leaving a hotel in the border town of Kilis, according to Korea’s Foreign Ministry and police. He touched down in Istanbul on Jan. 8 and flew to the southern city of Gaziantep before arriving in Kilis by car the next day alongside another Korean, who reported his disappearance to the Korean Embassy on Jan. 12.CCTV footage showed that Kim rode in a vehicle with a Syrian number plate used for illicit taxi services, along with a man speaking Arabic who waved to him at about 8:30 a.m. on that day, ministry officials said, citing the police there. The driver dropped them after about 25 minutes near a Syrian refugee camp in Besiriye, some 18 kilometers east of Kilis. “The Arab man approached the driver at around 7:30 a.m. that day and asked him to come pick him up one hour later near a mosque across the hotel where the boy was staying,” a ministry official told reporters on customary condition of anonymity. The findings are stoking concerns about the teen’s safety and possible ties with the extremist group. The police here have found from his computer images containing IS fighters and flags, as well as evidence that he had been in contact with a purported IS member named Hassan via social networking services such as Twitter and Surespot. With Turkey and Syria sharing a porous frontier stretching some 600 kilometers, many foreign terrorist fighters follow Kim’s itinerary linking Istanbul to Kilis via Gaziantep to sneak into Syria, experts and activists say. “The Turkish police said they have not yet passed a border checkpoint but we’ve not been able to figure out their whereabouts since they reached Besiriye despite all our effort,” the official said. “We cannot determine anything at this point, nor can we rule out the possibility that he has joined the IS, which would mean an extremely worrying situation. We’re working with other related agencies, putting top priority on his safety and immediate return.” The ministry has issued a travel warning for southeastern Turkey, especially within 10 kilometers of the Syrian border.

Adding to the concerns, the armed group issued a video online later in the day purporting to show two Japanese hostages, and demanding $200 million from Tokyo in ransom. The clip evoked dreary memories for Seoul, which has also been blackmailed by Islamist militants holding Korean nationals hostage in the Middle East. In 2004, the translator and Christian missionary Kim Sun-il was kidnapped and executed in Iraq by the Jama’at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad group after Korea brushed off demands that it scrap plans to send 3,000 more troops to the country and pull out hundreds of medics and engineers already there.In 2007, a group of 23 Korean Christians was taken hostage in Afghanistan by the Taliban. Two of them were killed during a standoff, while the rest were eventually freed.

Four were killed and 126 injured in a blaze that engulfed three residential buildings on Jan. 10. The city police confirmed from surveillance camera footage that the fire had started from a spark from a motorcycle in a ground-floor parking lot. The motorbike owner, identified by his surname Kim, was booked on charges of accidentally causing a fire and negligent homicide. According to the police, 53-year-old Kim attempted to warm up the motorbike’s ignition switch with a cigarette lighter as the key had gotten stuck in the cold. Investigators suspect that lighter may have melted the wire coating of the ignition box, which later caused the spark.Further investigation into motorcycle incident is underway, the police said. Authorities also booked owners of two of the damaged buildings for violating construction regulations. The nonresidential buildings were illegally turned into apartments by dividing the rooms to accommodate more residents, authorities said. Meanwhile, as part of efforts to tighten safety regulations, the Public Safety Ministry vowed to push for a new regulation that all buildings must have walls built with incombustible materials. Concerns have escalated over construction rules after it was reported that the apartment fire quickly spread to two adjacent buildings due to flammable walls. Currently, incombustible materials are only required for the construction of the outer walls of skyscrapers, public-purpose buildings and factories.

This means the harness was not being used,"" said a TEPCO spokesman.""We are investigating whether safety measures were appropriately observed,"" he added.The tank is one of thousands at the site used to store rain water that may have picked up radiation at the battered site.The worker is the second to die during efforts to stabilise the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant after reactors went into meltdown in the aftermath of a huge tsunami in March 2011.Last March, a worker died after being buried in earth and rubble while digging a hole.While the earthquake and tsunami it caused four years ago killed more than 18,000 people, no one is officially recorded as having died as a direct result of radiation released by Fukushima's broken reactors.In the unrelated incident at the Fukushima Daini plant, which was largely unscathed by the huge natural disaster, a worker died after suffering a severe head injury after being caught in equipment, a TEPCO spokesman said.

The eldest daughter of the airline owner Cho Yang-ho was indicted on Jan. 7 for five charges including violence and obstructing the crew duty in the New York-Seoul flight, a month after the so-called “nut rage” row stirred public uproar.  Cho Hyun-ah (center) is escorted a holding facility on Dec. 30 after the courts approved her arrest. (Yonhap)The trial hearing mainly focused on whether Cho changed the flight plan upon her authority. According to the prosecution’s probe, Cho had ordered the cabin crew chief to deplane from the Dec. 5 flight when the plane had already been taxiing. This caused an 11-minute delay of the Seoul-bound plane, which was carrying more than 250 passengers.  Prosecutors have suspected that the former airline vice president had forced the cabin crew to return to the gate, even though she had known that the flight was underway. Citing flight safety regulations, they consider the flight starting from the moment the plane doors close. Cho’s attorneys, on the other hand, denied the charges, claiming that she had not known that the plane was moving. They also asserted that the charges were not applicable since the flight was still on the ground, not airborne.If convicted of changing the plane route, Cho could be sentenced to a jail term of one to 10 years. The 40-year-old was also accused of having interfered in the Transport Ministry’s inquiry by having Korean Air officials attempt to cover up the case and manipulate evidence. The ministry had investigated the “nut rage” incident for a week before the prosecution’s probe was launched. Along with Cho, a ministry’s official and former Korean Air employee attended the hearing for having supported the heiress’ alleged misconduct.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","her arrest yonhap the trial ,last month the eldest daughter ,york seoul flight month after ,daughter of the airline owner ,eldest daughter of the airline","['korean Air', 'Cho Hyun - ah', 'Cho Yang - ho', 'New York - Seoul', 'Cho Hyun - ah', 'Cho', 'Cho', 'Seoul', 'Cho', 'Cho', 'the Transport Ministry ’s', 'korean Air', 'Cho', 'Korean Air', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47370014  0.16834392

The 18-year-old tourist, from Seoul, vanished on Jan. 10 after leaving a hotel in the border town of Kilis, the ministry said. He entered Turkey two days earlier for an eight-day trip with another man, who reported his disappearance to the Korean Embassy on Jan. 12. Turkish daily Milliyet reported that the missing man had been exchanging emails with IS members and might have entered Syria to join the group. “The embassy dispatched officials Tuesday and have since been tracking him down in cooperation with local police,” the ministry said in a statement. “We are not able to confirm that he crossed the Syrian border and are mobilizing all available channels to locate the missing teenager, keeping all possibilities in mind.”The hotel the missing Korean teenager stayed in Kilis, Turkey. (Yonhap)But the ministry denied reports that a man who was recently arrested in Kilis for illegal entry had claimed that he was a Korean national who had escaped from the IS. In Seoul, the missing teenager’s mother said he had a Turkish pen pal named Hassan and had last spoken with the family on the day he vanished. The National Intelligence Service has also secured his computer for analysis, an official at the Geumcheon district police office said. The ministry has issued a travel warning for southeastern Turkey, especially within 10 kilometers of the Syrian border. Some Koreans have previously visited the region for missionary or volunteer work at Syrian refugee camps. Seoul and Damascus have no official diplomatic relations. In September, a Saudi Arabian IS member said in an interview that the group consists of fighters of various nationalities including Korean. Seoul officials said the claim was unreliable. Some 3,000 people in Turkey are believed to be linked to the extremist group, a Turkish intelligence report said Saturday, calling for stepped-up surveillance in the wake of the deadly attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has also said that up to 700 Turkish nationals had joined the IS. Ankara has barred more than 7,200 people who were thought to be seeking IS membership from entering Turkey, while deporting nearly 1,200 would-be jihadists, he added.

The report claimed that the young man, identified as an 18-year-old surnamed Kim, had exchanged emails with IS before arriving in Turkey with another South Korean on Jan. 8.The South Korean Embassy said that the report contains some ""inaccurate"" information. But it did say that when Kim left his hotel in the town of Kilis, he took all of his belongings with him and left his traveling companion alone.The traveling mate, who shared the same room with Kim, reportedly told the Turkish police that he tried to find the missing teenager on his own for three days before contacting the authorities.In Seoul, the teenager's mother said Saturday her son had exchanged emails with his Turkish friend named Hassan, leading to speculation that the two might have set up a meeting in Kilis, which is situated near the border with Syria.Police in South Korea have said an analysis of the missing teenager's phone records showed no evidence that he has had any contact with IS. The mother said South Korea's intelligence officials studied the teenager's computer and found no connection with IS.The teenager's father, who had been in Turkey since Friday in search of his missing son, is scheduled to fly back to South Korea on Sunday. Speaking to Yonhap News Agency at Gaziantep Airport, the senior Kim repeatedly said, ""I have to find my son quickly.""Meanwhile, the top diplomats Turkey offered to fully support the search efforts for the teenager.The foreign ministry in Seoul said Yun Byung-se, the South Korean foreign minister, had a phone conversation with his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu, on Sunday. According to the ministry, Cavusoglu expressed concerns about the missing person case in his 10-minute talk with Yun. The Turkish minister also said the government, police and local authorities have been doing their best to locate the young South Korean and that they will continue to do so, according to the ministry.The ministry added that no particular progress has been made in the search for Kim and that the authorities in Turkey have left open all possibilities.

Officials said the other shark, whose species was not reported, was about three metres.The sharks were seen to be feeding on dolphins.In southern Sydney, a surf carnival at Wanda Beach was cancelled Saturday after two sightings of a shark, Surf Life Saving New South Wales spokeswoman Donna Wishart told AFP.The beach was temporarily closed by lifeguards before being reopened when there was no further sign of the animal during an aerial search, Wishart added.Despite the closures and ""shark sighted: keep out"" signs, and as lifeguards patrolled the waters on jet skis, some swimmers and surfers continued to enter the water as the sunny summer weather drew residents to the beaches.""Surfing is pretty dangerous at the best of times, and I just look at it like I've been swimming with sharks all my life,"" surfer Shawn Ofriel told the Newcastle Herald.""You're always surfing with them because they are always around, but (getting attacked) is pretty rare.""Wishart said it was up to the surfers to decide if they wanted to risk an encounter with a shark.""When we say we close the beach, we can't prevent people from going into the water, and lots of surfers are ignoring our closures,"" she said.""Even if we close the beach, the lifesavers and the lifeguards will remain there and they will actively discourage people from going into the water.""You take a risk going out there and there's not much we can do about that.""A 17-year-old boy was bitten on his hand after he tried to film a shark while spearfishing off Mollymook about 230 kilometres south of Sydney on Friday.The last shark fatality in Australia was in late December when a 17-year-old boy was attacked while spearfishing in the country's southwest.It was the second fatal mauling that month after another teenager died in an attack while swimming off Port Douglas in the northeast.Experts say attacks by sharks are increasing as water sports become more popular.","friday the last shark fatality ,last shark fatality in australia ,film shark while spearfishing off ,day saturday after two sharks ,on friday the last shark","['NEWCASTLE', 'AFP', 'Newcastle', 'Sydney', 'Sydney', 'Wanda Beach', 'Surf Life save New South Wales', 'Donna Wishart', 'AFP.The beach', 'Wishart', 'Shawn Ofriel', 'the Newcastle Herald', 'Mollymook', 'Sydney', 'Australia']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54820269  0.54887784

She was indicted for jeopardizing flight safety and the incident has tarnished the airline company's brand image significantly, with some customers boycotting its service.According to the data provided by Incheon International Airport Corp. and Korea Airports Corp., Korean Air transported a total of 482,000 passengers through its domestic lines last month, down 6.6 percent from a year earlier.The decline contrasted with a 13.2 percent hike for its smaller rival Asiana Airlines Inc., which flew 358,000 customers last month. The gap between the two largest airlines in terms of passengers narrowed from 158,000 to 76,000 over the past one year.This also comes despite an 11.5 percent on-year increase in the total number of passengers using domestic flights provided by seven carriers.Industry experts attribute the lackluster results of Korean Air to customers' avoidance of its service in the wake of the incident.""It seems that there are not a few passengers opting for other airline services following the incident, given that there are many options available when it comes to domestic flights,"" an industry expert said. Korean Air also underperformed next to other airliners on international lines.The company transported a total of 1.38 million passengers through its international flight services last month, up 2.5 percent from a year earlier. This is lower than the industry-wide 9.2 percent hike in the number of passengers traveling overseas, the data showed.In particular, Asiana Airlines seems to be basking in its rival's setback with the number of international passengers using its flights growing 9 percent. Low-cost carriers also saw their international passengers jump across the board.Korean Air said that there is no marked change in its booking ratio and that there is no relations between the number of passengers and the incident since most of tickets were booked months earlier. It expects that bookings for February and March are about 5 percent higher than last year.

He speculated that most of the cases are being caused by migratory birds that fly into South Korea during the winter months.The ministry said the movement of cars that move cloven-hoofed animals will be restricted over the weekend as well to help stem he spread of foot-and-mouth disease that has also broken out in the country.

The other two hostages were rescued unharmed. The authorities said the stepdaughter had been stabbed to death at around 9:36 a.m. when the police received a report from Kim’s wife. The unharmed stepdaughter also stated that the suspect killed her sister in the morning as the killer got enraged at his wife for having been out of touch with him, the police said. Kim demanded that his wife come and see him, they added. The police’s announcement came after criticism grew over the police’s rescue operation. Some claimed that the teenage victim could have been saved if the rescue mission had begun earlier. The stepdaughter victim was pronounced dead upon arrival at a hospital. The police said they started intervening in the case from 10:15 a.m. with the police commandos standing by on the roof. The police added the commandos did not storm the scene until 2:30 p.m. because the hostage-taker was highly agitated. Officers said they didn’t know until 12:45 p.m. that the hostages were harmed. Kim showed the body of the victim to her mother through video call at that time, they said. The police also revealed that the biological father was killed at around 9 p.m. the previous day when the killer entered the victim’s house. The 49-year-old victim was with his girlfriend at that time. Two daughters came home later after their birth father was killed in a fight with Kim, the investigators said. The former husband was found dead in a bathroom.The killer confessed to starting the hostage situation because he thought his estranged wife rekindled her relationship with her former husband, the police added.Kim and the 43-year-old married in 2007 but have been separated since August last year.

A third fire broke out at an apartment in Namyangju, Gyeonggi Province, with four people injured, earlier this week.The party and ministry officials in charge of public safety agreed in a meeting on Thursday that more apartment complexes should be obliged to provide evacuation facilities, which would help residents escape in the event of an emergency. Some presidential aides also participated in the discussions.The coming law revision will focus on wider distribution of hand-operated lifts, which are supported by ropes and carry evacuators. While these have been required for buildings up to 10 stories high, they will become applicable to apartments with 11 or more floors.In addition, the Land Ministry has decided to instruct builders to use high-quality materials for outer walls during construction of apartments. Investigators say that the fire in Uijeongbu caused more deaths and injuries due to the highly flammable outer walls, made of low-quality materials.Governing party Secretary-General Lee Koon-hyon said the revised motion would be proposed at the extraordinary session of the National Assembly, slated for February.He called on Saenuri lawmakers and ministry officials to bolster regulations on fire safety despite the overall policy aim of easing regulations on the business sector.Participants also vowed to come up with new safety regulations to prevent fires from spreading to adjacent buildings.The distance between the affected apartment buildings was only about 1 meter, allowing the fire to spread easily, authorities said. While regular apartment buildings must be over 6 meters apart, this rule has not been applied to buildings containing apartments under 85 square meters in size since 2009. This was part of the deregulation package of the former administration to boost apartment construction to resolve the housing crisis.The public safety officials, meanwhile, said they would soon draft a set of measures to support some 200 displaced residents who are staying at a temporary shelter.In Uijeongbu ― where the biggest of the three fires took place ― the blaze started on the first floor of an apartment building and quickly spread to two adjacent residential buildings, killing four and wounding 126 people.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","after fire accidents at apartment ,thursday that more apartment complexes ,within week third fire broke ,adjacent residential buildings killing four ,move came after fire accidents","['Saenuri Party', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Namyangju', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'the Land Ministry', 'Uijeongbu', 'Lee Koon - hyon', 'the National Assembly', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Yon - se']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50201917  0.1315055

It said further tests are needed to determine whether they died from the highly pathogenic H5N8 strain of the animal disease.The confirmation marks the first time that Busan has reported a bird flu case since 2008.Quarantine officials said 580 birds at the farm that raised geese, chickens and pigeons were all culled to prevent further spreading of the disease. It said four checkpoints have been set up around the poultry farm to disinfect cars and control the movement of people and animals.In addition to the Busan case, quarantine officials said tests showed birds at a duck farm in Anseong, near Seoul, have tested positive for the H5 strain. They said more detailed test results to determine whether the birds have been infected by the virulent H5N8 strain will come out over the weekend. Besides the latest AI case, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, which has been struggling to control the spread of foot-and-mouth disease in the country, warned that more outbreaks could occur in places such as Hongseong, Hwaseong, Gongju and Chungju, in the central part of the country.It said the assessment comes as pigs that had shown symptoms of the highly contagious animal disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals, were moved and may have contaminated slaughterhouses and vehicles that were used to carry other livestock. The ministry said the vehicles were used to ferry animals to and from the four areas cited.“It is unlikely that FMD will spread across the country as in 2010, but newer cases are still possible,” an official source said.He said that in order to counter such threats, the country plans to import enough vaccine for about 1.6 million animals this month.Besides such measures, the ministry said it will keep data on all farms reporting outbreaks and take action against those that have been affected by the animal disease time and again.It said quarantine inspections at airports and port terminals will be strengthened, and more will be done to develop FMD vaccines in the country.Since Dec. 3, 50 cases of FMD have been reported in 13 cities and counties across the country, resulting in the culling of 44,313 animals so far.

Eleven residents were seriously injured, officials said.

He supposedly received the information from a South Korean defense broker surnamed Kim, and forwarded it to other officials at his company’s headquarters in France. The leaked documents were grade-three secrets that were presented at the Joint Chiefs of Staff Council meeting, including data related to military satellites, long-distance surface-to-air missiles and an antijamming system, which blocks signaldisrupting offensives. Prosecutors also indicted a high-ranking official of a Europe-based defense firm for illegally securing classified military information from Kim, including information on the military’s harbor underwater surveillance system and submarine program. Investigators said Kim handed over the secrets to the Europe-based companies while he was working as a consultant for them.Kim was arrested in July on the charge of violating the military secret protection law. Kim is purported to have bought a total of 31 grade-two and grade-three military secrets from officers, including an Air Force lieutenant colonel and an Army major who were indicted on the charge of leaking the secrets.He is also believed to have been linked to a similar case in November, when a local defense contractor was indicted on the charge of illegally collecting military secrets about a military project to improve the Navy’s submarines and leaking them to a German firm. The leak of classified documents was the latest in a series of recent military-related corruption scandals that have sent shockwaves across the country. Last month, two officials of the state-run Defense Acquisition Program Administration were arrested on charges of taking bribes from a local company in exchange for granting rights to exclusively provide parts to a Navy rescue and salvage ship.An annual integrity scale by the Anti-Corruption & Civil Rights Commission showed that DAPA was one of the most corrupt government bodies in Korea.By Yoon Min-sik and news reports(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","signaldisrupting offensives prosecutors also indicted ,three military secrets from officers ,offensives prosecutors also indicted ,recent military related corruption scandals ,of illegally collecting military secrets","['korean', 'France', 'korean', 'the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ’ Office', 'south korean', 'Kim', 'France', 'the Joint Chiefs of Staff Council', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Air Force', 'Army', 'Navy', 'german', 'Defense Acquisition Program Administration', 'Navy', 'the Anti - Corruption & Civil Rights Commission', 'DAPA', 'Korea', 'Yoon Min - sik']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.09825015  0.40552905

""We plan to beef up cooperation with related countries to prevent Korean nationals from being involved in drug-related crime.""   Separately, the Korean government said it has protested to China over its delayed notification of the execution to Seoul.   Kim is the fourth South Korean that China has executed for drug offenses since last year. In early August, three South Korean nationals were executed in China for smuggling and trading drugs.   In 2001, China executed a South Korean drug dealer, identified only by his surname Shin.   Smuggling, producing or trafficking more than one kilogram of opium or 50 grams of heroin or methamphetamine is subject to capital punishment in China.   A foreign ministry official said the Chinese government on Dec. 16 notified South Korea of its decision to execute Kim.   Seoul had repeatedly asked for a stay of execution on humanitarian grounds, but Beijing rejected the plea, the official said.   He said the government will come up with measures to prevent South Koreans from committing drug offenses in China, which are mainly committed in the country's three northeastern provinces, including limits on drug offenders' overseas travel.
