After joining the military in September, Jeong was assigned to his current unit in October, and he had not shown any abnormal signs during his three-month service there, other military officials said.In South Korea, all able-bodied men must serve in the military for about two years since the country technically remains at war with North Korea after the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.

1,1,North Korea's senior official handling inter-Korean affairs dies,"North Korea's top party official handling inter-Korean affairs has been killed in a traffic accident, Pyongyang's state media said Wednesday. He was 73.Kim Yang-gon, the head of the United Front Department at the ruling Workers' Party, died in car accident at 6:15 a.m. Tuesday, according to the North's Korean Central News Agency.The KCNA called Kim ""the closest comrade-in-arms"" of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, say...","North Korea's top party official handling inter-Korean affairs has been killed in a traffic accident, Pyongyang's state media said Wednesday. He was 73.Kim Yang-gon, the head of the United Front Department at the ruling Workers' Party, died in car accident at 6:15 a.m. Tuesday, according to the North's Korean Central News Agency.The KCNA called Kim ""the closest comrade-in-arms"" of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, saying that North Korea will hold a state funeral for Kim on Thursday, to be headed by the North's leader.Kim Yang-gon was one of the two ranking North Korean officials who attended the rare inter-Korean high-level talks in August following heightened tensions sparked by a land mine blast near the inter-Korean border blamed on North Korea.The two Koreas reached a rare deal on Aug. 25 to defuse military tensions and make efforts to promote inter-Korean civilian exchanges.But inter-Korean ties have remained strained since the two sides ended their high-level talks on Dec. 12 without producing any agreements.South Korea's government said it offered condolences over Kim's death earlier in the day in the name of Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo.""The government expressed condolences over the death of Kim who contributed to a meaningful agreement at the August talks,"" Jeong Joon-hee, a ministry spokesman, told a regular press briefing.Jeong refrained from commenting on the immediate impact of his death on inter-Korean affairs, adding that a closer watch is needed.Analysts said that Seoul-Pyongyang ties may continue to be strained in the short term due to the death of Kim, a dialogue-seeking figure.""Kim's unexpected death is feared to lead to the prolonged suspension of inter-Korean talks,"" said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior researcher at the Sejong Institute. ""Given that the high-level talks fell apart in December, there is a chance that Seoul-Pyongyang ties may be further strained.""Kim had mainly dealt with inter-Korean affairs since the regime of Kim Jong-il, the father of the North's current leader, who died in late 2011.In 2007, Kim was named the head of the party's United Front Department, which manages Pyongyang's relations with Seoul. He also contributed to creating an inter-Korean summit held between Kim Jong-il and then-South Korean President Ro Moo-hyun in October of that year.Since Kang Sok-ju, a secretary handling international relations for the North's ruling party, remains ill, Kim was known as effectively doubling up with Kang's jobs at the party.North Korea announced a list of members for the funeral committee for Kim, including Choe Ryong-hae, a senior secretary of the ruling party and a key aide to the North's leader.In November, Choe was sent to a rural farm as punishment for his mishandling of a newly built hydroelectric power plant project.The inclusion of his name on the list may indicate that Choe has been reinstated.The Unification Ministry declined comment on Choe's status.Despite the troubling news, North Korea has not shown any abnormal signs on the military front, a military official said. ""The country has freshly entered the winter training season, but the training pattern is the same as those of previous years,"" the official said. ""No abnormal signs have been detected lately among North Korean troops.""

He was 73.Kim Yang-gon (Yonhap)The North’s Korea Central News Agency said that Kim, a secretary of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers’ Party and director of the party’s United Front Department, died at 6:15 a.m. on Tuesday following the accident, without elaborating.The demise of the North’s core diplomatic official, seen as a relatively dovish negotiator favoring dialogue, could negatively affect Seoul’s efforts toward inter-Korean cooperation and reconciliation, analysts noted.  “Our comrade, Kim Yang-gon has devotedly fought to realize our party’s policy of independent national reunification,” the KCNA said in a report. “Kim was loved and respected by the party members and people for his ceaseless dedication to the party and revolution, his revolutionary principles and humble character.”Pyongyang decided to hold a state funeral for the deceased party secretary, according to the KCNA. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un will chair the funeral committee. His funeral ceremony will be held on Thursday. North Korea also announced a list of Kim’s funeral committee members, which included Choe Ryong-hae, a senior secretary of the ruling party. Choe, who had been the North Korean leader’s key aide, was sent to a rural farm in November as punishment over the mishandling of a hydroelectric power plant project.Seoul’s Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo sent his condolences to the North by fax. Seoul is considering sending a delegation to attend Kim’s funeral. The late Kim has long led the communist state’s external policy affairs including cross-border issues and those related to China -- a reason why observers say his death would influence Pyongyang’s foreign policy to a certain extent.“As the party secretary who has led inter-Korean affairs died abruptly, it seems inevitable that cross-border talks would be suspended for a long period,” said Cheong Seong-chang, senior research fellow at the local think tank Sejong Institute.“Given that he has also played a role as an acting party secretary in charge of international affairs, the possibility has increased that the improvement in the relations between Pyongyang and Beijing would also be delayed.”Other analysts, however, said that his death would not seriously affect Pyongyang’s external policy, given that the dictatorial ruler calls all the shots when it comes to crucial policy issues.Born in 1942 in Anju, South Pyongan Province, Kim started his party work at the party’s Central Committee, upon his graduation from the foreign language and literature department of the Kim Il-sung University. Since then, he had worked up the ladder of the party hierarchy mostly in the divisions handling foreign affairs and inter-Korean relations. In 2007, he was appointed to lead the United Front Department and led the work of arranging the 2007 inter-Korean summit between then South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun and then North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. At the summit, Kim was the only official who flanked and assisted the North Korean leader.Along with Chang Song-thaek, the executed uncle of the North Korean leader, Kim had led affairs regarding China as well. He is known to have led the preparatory work for late former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il’s trip to China in 2010.Since 1998, he served as a core member of the Supreme People’s Assembly, the North’s rubber-stamp parliament. In 2010, he was appointed as a member of the party’s Central Committee and candidate member of the party’s powerful politburo.After Kim Jong-un took the helm of the country in December 2011 upon his father’s death, Kim Yang-gon continued to lead foreign policy affairs and was later appointed as a member of the politburo.Most recently, the late party secretary received the media spotlight in August as he, along with two other officials from the North, engaged in cross-border negotiations to defuse tensions caused by Pyongyang’s landmine provocation on Aug. 4.

Hah Jae-hun was conducting a patrol mission on the South Korean side of the Demilitarized Zone when landmines buried by North Korea exploded and maimed him and another soldier on Aug. 4.  The landmine attack, followed by North Korean artillery firing on the South, escalated military tensions between the countries in August before they reached the so-called ""Aug. 25"" agreement to ease tensions and facilitate talks.Hah has since undergone surgery and intensive rehabilitation treatments to recover his ability to walk.""I extend my sincere gratitude to the military and medical staff for providing the best treatment and the foundation for a new life,"" Hah said as he was discharged from the state-run VHS Medical Center, standing on his two artificial legs.""Even though I lost my legs, I will do my best to serve the country as a reborn soldier,"" he said. For now, Hah is able to take short walks indoors or go up and down stairs, but he will undergo a final round of treatment at an Army hospital before returning to service, according to the Army. The other injured soldier, Staff Sgt. Kim Jung-won, who had one leg amputated, completed his rehabilitation and returned to his unit in early December with a prosthetic leg.An Army representative said, ""Hah's case needed a more customized treatment system and more efforts on his part because, compared to Kim, it was more difficult for Hah to balance himself on two prosthetic legs."" A task force of medical staff from the rehabilitation, orthopedics, urology, psychiatry and dermatology departments have worked together to treat and help Hah return to his normal life, the Army also said.The VHS Medical Center said it will continue to help Hah carry out everyday activities and military service normally by providing more customized assistance devices down the road.

Police found a digital timer and a bundle of pipes presumed to be carrying explosives in the restroom at the shrine, local media said.DNA tests on cigarette butts found in the restroom and the suspect's hotel room matched, according to the Fuji News Network, a commercial television news network in Japan.Chon made a statement that he installed some sort of a device in the restroom on the day of the incident, according to local media.The indictment came as South Korea and Japan began crucial talks in Seoul on how to resolve the issue of former Korean sex slaves for Japan's World War II soldiers.South Korea and China view the Yasukuni Shrine -- which honors over 2.4 million war dead, including 14 convicted Class-A war criminals -- as a symbol of Japan's past imperialism.Many South Koreans still harbor deep resentment against Japan over its 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula.

According to the National Human Rights Commission of Korea, police and prosecutors arrested a Nigerian and detained him for 12 days, ignoring his multiple requests to contact the Nigerian Embassy. Police arrested the man, who was at the time on the wanted list, on a theft charge in November last year. He denied the charge and asked police officers to contact the Nigerian Embassy, but they allegedly refused his request. Police and prosecutors reportedly shifted responsibility onto each other, with police saying they were only in charge of the initial investigation and prosecutors saying the police should have contacted the embassy.“The man’s rights to self-defense was violated as police and prosecutors refused his request to contact his embassy when arresting and detaining him,” said an official from the watchdog.According to the Constitution, the families of those arrested and detained have a right to know the date, place and reason for arrest and detention.When foreign nationals face arrest and detention, police and prosecutors are required to allow suspects to freely contact their embassies in Korea for their self-defense. The law enforcement agencies should notify the embassies of suspects’ status, too. The NHRCK said it had imposed a recommendation for prosecutors and advised police to offer proper job training for officers to cope with such a situation. The man was eventually set free after he was found not guilty and falsely accused, as a fellow Nigerian national had given the man’s name and foreign registration number to avoid arrest when he had been caught stealing items. “The Nigerian was framed, but the arrest and detention were carried out in accordance with the law, so there is no problem in the law enforcement,” the NHRCK official said. The NHRCK, an independent organization monitoring the nation’s human rights issues, sets recommendations for abuse cases, but its advice does not have legally binding force. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","and prosecutors arrested nigerian ,police and prosecutors arrested ,prosecutors arrested nigerian ,prosecutors arrested nigerian and ,detaining an african man","['South Korea ’s', 'african', 'the National Human Rights Commission', 'Korea', 'Nigerian', 'Nigerian']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26345789  0.57796502

A 57-year-old man surnamed Cho was shot dead by four strangers who broke into his house early Sunday in Malvar, Batangas. The suspects ran away after stealing money and valuables, Manila authorities said. The Korean National Police Agency said it sent three police officers and one gun expert to the crime scene to help investigate the case. “As the police investigation is based on national sovereignty, (Seoul) is not directly probing the case, but supporting the scientific investigation with Manila’s permission. We are seeking a cooperative investigation that is almost like a direct probe,” said Kang Sin-myeong, commissioner general of the NPA.This is the first time that Korean officers are taking part in criminal investigations overseas. The Philippines investigators are probing whether the case was merely a robbery or related to Cho’s business dealings. The victim was reportedly running his own architecture firm, they said. Cho is the 11th Korean murder victim in the Philippines this year. Earlier last month, the police chiefs of the two countries reached an agreement to send English-speaking Korean officers to Manila whenever Koreans became victims of crimes such as murder, kidnapping, robbery or rape. Public concerns have escalated over the safety of Korean residents and tourists in Philippines as more have become crime targets. A total of 39 Koreans have been murdered in the last four years, according to police data. About 40 percent of Korean murder cases abroad have taken place in the Philippines since 2012. The Korean authorities suspect that Manila’s lax gun control and insufficient investigation system have contributed to the rise of violent crime amid the state’s sluggish economy. While the Manila government runs a gun permit system, penalties have rarely been imposed for violating the rule, leaving about 1 billion illegal weapons in circulation across the country. In addition, investigation techniques such as fingerprint analysis or inquiry methods are not yet well developed, posing challenges to finding suspects, they added. According to the Philippine police, over 885,000 crimes took place in the country in the first half of this year, jumping 46 percent on-year, with violent crimes -- such as murder, rape and robbery -- surging by 37 percent. As part of efforts to better protect Koreans, the two states set up a “Korean Desk” in Manila in 2012 to deal with Korean-involved criminal cases. One Korean resident officer works with four Filipino officers, officials said. With one more desk launched in Angeles, Seoul investigators made an agreement with Manila to expand the number of desks in five new regions soon. The Seoul government also vowed to provide 130 police cars and 142 motorcycles over the next three years to better improve the infrastructure of the Philippines’ police system. It will also seek to expand the number of surveillance cameras in regions where many Koreans reside or travel. About 100,000 Koreans live in the Philippines and an average of 1 million Korean tourists visit the country every year.

The current conditions of his wife and child were not known. Local law enforcement authorities are investigating into whether it was a simple robbery or if it was committed out of resentment by an acquaintance.The incident raised the number of South Koreans killed in the Southeast Asian country to 11 this year.The National Police Agency said they will dispatch a squad comprised of three police officers specialized in a crime investigation and one from the National Forensic Service later on Monday.It would be the first time that Seoul's police were send its officials abroad to probe into the crime that took place in a foreign country. ""Investigation is an activity based on sovereign rights, thus we are planning to support and advise the local authorities on scientific probe based on their prior approval,"" said Kang Sin-myeong, the National Police Agency Commissioner-General.The two country's law enforcement authorities made an agreement last month that calls for collaboration on growing violent crimes, such as murder and robbery, aimed at Korean nationals.Ten South Koreans were killed in the Philippines last year, while 13 Korean nationals were murdered in 2013, according to South Korea's Foreign Ministry.In November, the ministry imposed a travel ban on some areas of the Philippines. Under relevant South Korean law, those who visit an area under a travel ban could face up to one year in prison or up to 10 million won ($8,700) in fines.Seoul and Manila are planning to establish five additional task forces to deal with crimes against Koreans in the Philippines, including one in the country's resort island of Cebu, the police said.  Currently, the Philippines has two such teams under regional police agencies in Manila and the northern Philippine city of Angeles.

Seoul said that the two should be discussed separately.The issue of resuming the tour program is also linked to whether it would violate U.N. sanctions banning the transfer of bulk cash to Pyongyang.

Police had set a noon deadline for him to surrender himself, warning they would raid the temple if he refuses to come out.  (Yonhap)Han had been on the wanted list since June, for allegedly leading a violent rally on May 1 Labor Day. Another arrest warrant had been pending for him leading a demonstration on May 24 last year and attempting to march near Cheong Wa Dae. He has reportedly been hiding at the KCTU office before making an appearance at the Nov. 14 rally in Gwanghwamun that ended in clashes between pipe-wielding demonstrators and riot police firing back water cannons. Two days after the rally, Han sought refuge at Jogyesa Temple, which has often served as a shelter for political and student activists seeking refuge from police crackdowns in times of authoritarian rule, notably under the military-backed governments of the 1980s. Police have been stationed outside the temple to prevent him from fleeing.A major collision was averted Wednesday, as the police temporarily delayed their raid of the temple to detain Han.Police halted the operation at around 6 p.m. in response to Buddhist monks’ renewed calls for a peaceful resolution to the issue. As tensions intensified around Jogyesa temple, Buddhist monk Ven. Jaseung on behalf of the Jogye Order made a statement in a press briefing at 5 p.m., calling on both the police and the KCTU to end their standoff.Police stationed nearly 1,000 officers inside and outside the temple and cleared the way leading to the room in which Han has been taking refuge by pushing away monks and temple officials who have stood at the entrance to bar the officers from storming into the building. Only Buddhist monks, temple officials and journalists were allowed near the building Han was in to prevent clashes. At the height of the standoff, monks were praying and temple officials held up placards reading “Let’s solve the problem peacefully” and “Opposition to the police force in the temple,” wishing for a peaceful resolution to the issue.Kang Sin-myeong, the chief of the National Police Agency, threatened to raid the temple to execute an overdue arrest warrant unless Han came out of the temple voluntarily by 4 p.m. As the scheduled police raid neared in the afternoon, tensions escalated as several civic groups and lawmakers made their way to the temple to voice their opinions on the police arresting Han. “We want to ask whether the forcible execution of an arrest warrant complies with democratic values and the rule of law at this critical moment of wrangling over the labor market reform bills that can have a huge impact on laborers’ lives continues,” Jo Young-sun, a secretary general of Lawyers for a Democratic Society said, asking the temple to continue to provide Han with protection. On the other side of the road, a conservative civic group comprised of some 100 elderly people held a demonstration to lambast the Jogye Order for hiding Han in the temple. “The government should sternly punish North Korea sympathizers trying to topple our nation and undermine the rule of law,” the elderly group said, holding up placards reading “Immediately arrest Han Sang-kyun, who lead the violent protest.” Conservatives have often likened ultraprogressives with North Korea supporters.Buddhist followers, mostly in their 50s to 80s, gathered outside the temple at around 3 p.m. to condemn the union chief for hiding in the religious venue and undermining the rule of law. “Why have the police failed to arrest him until now? What did they do? Kick him out!” an elderly women told people around her. Others nodded along to her remarks, with some men bluntly shouting in the air, “Come out immediately!” Earlier on Tuesday, Buddhist monks warned that a police raid on the temple would be no different from religious persecution and a crackdown on Korean Buddhism as a whole. The monks have also urged the labor union head to make a “swift decision” to end the cycle of violence. “The Jogye order has strived to solve the issue through conversation, asking the police delay arresting him as we believe that the execution of the arrest warrant would not solve the conflicts, but would only lead to another conflict,” the monk Jaseung told reporters Wednesday. “We will decide what to do about his stay here by noon tomorrow.”  Considering the temple’s request, the police decided to delay arresting him until Thursday at noon. “We planned to execute the arrest warrant, but will delay it to tomorrow afternoon, considering the Buddhist monk Jaseung’s request,” the police said. “But if Han does not voluntarily appear by noon tomorrow, we will sternly execute the court-issued warrant.”At Han’s request, the Jogye Order — the nation’s largest Buddhist sect with several million followers — has played a mediation role between the labor activist and the government since he took refuge there. Meanwhile, the labor union renewed its pledge for an all-out strike upon the police’s forcible arrest of its chief. “The trade unions under the KCTU will stage a strike at the earliest possible moment if the police forces their way into the temple to drag him out. We will step up our fight against the government crackdown and its attempt to reform the labor market,” Park Sung-sik, a spokesperson for the KCTU said in a statement.

Police found a digital timer and a bundle of pipes presumed to be carrying explosives in the restroom at the shrine.  Chon arrived in Japan on Nov. 21, two days before the incident took place. He returned home on Nov. 23, the date of the alleged bombing incident.  South Korea and China view the Yasukuni Shrine -- which honors over 2.4 million war dead, including 14 convicted Class-A war criminals -- as a symbol of Japan's past imperialism.  Many South Koreans still harbor deep resentment against Japan over its 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula.  The Yasukuni case, however, will likely only have a limited impact on Seoul-Tokyo ties, observers said.  ""It's an isolated case,"" a diplomatic source said. ""It won't become a diplomatic problem.""

The area has been the site of deadly naval clashes between Seoul and Pyongyang for decades.   It was later confirmed that a Chinese patrol boat had been monitoring Chinese ships that poached across the Yellow Sea border, according to the South Korean military.   It was not clear why the Chinese patrol boat did not retreat despite the South Korean Navy's broadcasting of warnings.   However, the state-run Global Times newspaper said in an editorial on Wednesday that the South Korean Navy's action was ""very imprudent behavior,"" defending its patrol ship that violated the Yellow Sea border between the two Koreas.  The Chinese patrol boat might not have received the South Korean Navy's broadcasting of warnings, it said.   Tensions remain high between Seoul and Pyongyang over the Yellow Sea border, known as the Northern Limit Line that was set by U.N.-led forces at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. North Korea does not recognize the de facto sea border.   The Chinese newspaper also raised questions over the legitimacy of the NLL, saying North Korea claims its own Yellow Sea border with South Korea and the NLL is ""not an internationally-recognized border.""

(Yonhap-News)The Navy said that it fired 10 rounds in warning at a Chinese patrol boat that was conducting a crackdown on some Chinese fishermen illegal fishing near a border island in the waters off South Korea‘s west coast. The Chinese patrol boat trespassed across the maritime border, widely known as the Northern Limit Line, in the course of its crackdown.“The vessel retreated northward as we fired off warning shots at it after repeatedly issuing warning messages,” it said.It said that the ship was first presumed to come from North Korea, but it was later confirmed as a Chinese patrol boat.The North’s patrol boats have frequently intruded past the NLL, as it has long demanded that the line be moved farther south.Pyongyang does not acknowledge the NLL, which was drawn unilaterally by the U.S.-led United Nations Command when the 1950-53 Korean War entered into a ceasefire. The two Koreas fought bloody battles in 1999, 2002 and 2009 near the border.Chinese fishing boats often cross into South Korean waters in the Yellow Sea in search of abundant fish stocks, regularly leading to violence by Chinese crews during raids by the South Korean Coast Guard.“The Navy has beefed up its surveillance near the NLL,” a Coast Guard representative said.

All are capable of speaking English, the authorities said.Public concerns have escalated in recent years over the safety of Korean residents and tourists in the Philippines after dozens were killed or kidnapped. In the last four years, a total of 38 Koreans were murdered in Philippines.This will be the first time Korean police have investigated foreign criminal cases since the police were established in 1945. No foreign police have directly probed criminal cases in Seoul either, as keeping public order is considered part of national sovereignty.In an aim to better tackle Korean-targeted crime, Seoul and Manila launched a “Korean Desk” in 2012 under the Philippines police department, where four Filipino officers and one Korean resident officer work together. The two states also agreed last year to expand the number of desks, opening them in 10 other regions in the country. Once Korean-related criminal cases are reported, the team members will immediately fly to the Philippines and take part in investigations. The size of the dispatched crew will be determined based on each case, the agency said.

It was in March 2014 that the fridge, manufactured and purchased in 2003, exploded and started a fire. The owner's house and three neighboring ones were damaged. No casualties were reported.The National Forensic Service concluded that a short circuit caused the fire.The fridge maker, however, claimed that it is not responsible for a product sold more than 10 years ago, citing local law.The court, however, said it is not a socially accepted notion to assume that a kimchi refrigerator could cause a fire after being used for 10 years. It also said that out of the 22 cases of fires that were started by kimchi refrigerators with more than 10 years of use, 20 were made by the defendant. Taking into consideration that the fridge had never gone through safety inspections, the court ordered the manufacturer to compensate the insurance company 50 percent of the amount claimed.

Albeit crude, the small devices had taken photos of major military installations on border islands, potential infiltration routes and the presidential palace in downtown Seoul, kindling concerns over a potential security breach and lax air defense. Boosted by the brisk advancement of aerospace power following two World Wars, drones have revolutionized modern warfare over the last few decades. Despite persistent controversy over civilian casualties from U.S. drone strikes, such as in Pakistan and Yemen, the killing capabilities, greater public acceptance and lower political risks have made the weapons more appealing for leaders, compared with the often drawn-out bloodshed of using conventional ground forces. They are also at the forefront of Washington’s ongoing campaign in the Middle East to eliminate the Islamic State extremist group. With countries around the globe racing to roll out better performing unmanned aerial vehicles, South Korea is striving to strengthen its entry into the market.  An illustration of the corps-level drone being developed by Korea Aerospace Industries. (KAI)On the military front, the Daejeon-based Agency for Defense Development began delving into the technology in the late 1970s, seeking to introduce a miniature air launch decoy codenamed Solgae (black-eared kite) with technical assistance from the U.K. The project was called off by the Air Force in the mid-1980s before it could materialize, but did kick-off the Army’s drive to produce a battalion-level reconnaissance drone. In 2000, the ADD and Korea Aerospace Industries launched the country’s first homegrown UAV ― nicknamed the Songgolmae, RQ-101 or Night Intruder-300 ― and its deployment started two years later. A fixed-wing UAV with a 200-kilometer range and 45-kilogram payload capacity, the aircraft is designed to serve various missions such as aerial and battlefield surveillance, reconnaissance, target acquisition and bombing guidance, transferring real-time images even in unfavorable environments. State-run think tank and defense companies have since continued to study key technologies including those for autonomous takeoff and landing, multiple drone control and collision detection and avoidance. The government, for its part, has devised a road map to boost the industry in line with its mid- and long-term defense reform plans and as a fresh growth engine. “From the envisioned division-level drone to stealthy combat aircraft, we are putting much of our input into UAV development based on our 20-years-plus of experience,” a KAI official says. “It may sound new to the general public, but has a long history not just internationally, but also at home. We want to be a leader in the area as much as in other domains.” The efforts, however, have hit numerous snags. Though restarted in 2013, an ambitious 2006 program for a propeller-driven, long-endurance mid-altitude UAV was nearly scrapped in 2011 in the face of criticism that it overlapped with Seoul’s plan to adopt Northrop Grumman’s RQ-4 Global Hawks high-altitude spy planes. Currently, the ADD with KAI and Korean Air are respectively carrying out projects to develop division-scale UAVs. Another major prospective program is under way by the state-funded Korea Aerospace Research Institute and the national flag carrier, which has in recent years been expanding its foray into aircraft manufacturing, for a Predator-like surveillance and reconnaissance drone called the KUS-15. They have already completed developing a “smart, next-generation” UAV system consisting of tilt-rotor air vehicles capable of vertical takeoff and landing and sending real-time imagery information from distant places at all hours.“The industry consensus is that the U.S.’ F-35 and F-22 will be virtually the last manned fighters,” said an official at the Korea Defense Industry Association. “With drones rising as a global trend, many firms are investing in their development, but the key is performance.”Global spending on UAV programs is forecast to triple to about $14 billion over the next decade in military, commercial and consumer markets, with military research and development outlays set to add another $30 billion during the same period alone, according to a study released last August by Teal Group, a Virginia-based aerospace and defense market survey firm. Drones were also a key feature at a defense trade show in Bangkok early this month, with France’s ECA Group, Israel’s Aeronautics, Thailand’s Avia and other companies showcasing their products. “The market for UAVs looks very strong, increasingly driven by new technologies, such as the next generation of unmanned combat systems, and the development of new markets such as civil and consumer drones,” says Philip Finnegan, director of corporate analysis and coauthor of the study. “Our 2015 UAV study calculates the UAV market at 72 percent military, 23 percent consumer, 5 percent civil cumulative for the decade,” he notes, adding that civil UAVs will likely post the fastest growth of the three, albeit from a relatively low base.  (KAI)At a meeting with a national science technology advisory panel presided over by President Park Geun-hye last March, the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning unveiled its goal of securing 10 percent of the international market for remotely piloted machines ― aerial, ground and maritime combined ― by 2025 by nurturing 650 related firms and helping them rake in 15 trillion won ($13 billion) in total annual revenue. To that aim, Seoul is funneling millions of dollars into the initiative and refining regulations and administrative frameworks, while harnessing cooperation with other leading countries, including Israel. The two nations agreed in July 2014 to scale up their $2 million joint industrial research and development fund to boost technology sharing in UAV development and four other fields. Under the current rules, operators of drones weighing over 150 kilograms are required to seek government approval before use, while lighter ones are subject to registration, with exceptions for military systems and noncommercial devices weighing 12 kilograms or lower. As of July, 716 units are on the list, nearly a threefold jump from 2013, according to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. More than 582 businesses and 850 people have signed up as operators, up from 116 and 64, respectively, over the same period. “A small-scale market once dominated by aviation experts and club members is now expanding to embrace amateurs and ordinary people who use drones for crop-dusting, filming, land surveys or other industrial purposes,” the ministry said in an analysis released in September. Yet South Korea has a long way to go to become a major powerhouse, officials and experts say. They assess that the country ranks seventh in the world in terms of technological capabilities, falling behind the U.S. and other forerunners due to its lack of “core” know-how, professional manpower and infrastructure. The weight-based standardized current regulatory regime also needs to undergo a comprehensive overhaul and include concrete yardsticks, such as for penalties for unauthorized flights or safety certifications, so as to help minimize the public’s safety, ethical and privacy concerns. “While constant support for indigenous technological development and outside assistance is vital, we need to establish regulatory standards based on drone specifications, amend laws to allow realistic criteria for punising for illegal operations, and craft rules for safety certification, mandatory insurance coverage and personal information protection,” a future planning ministry official said, requesting anonymity due to internal policy.

The 35-year-old had suffered the longest battle against the disease among all MERS patients worldwide to date, according to Korea’s Health Ministry. He was the 38th Korean to die from the viral respiratory illness since its outbreak in May, raising the nation’s MERS fatality rate to 20.4 percent.The patient was Korea’s 80th confirmed MERS case. He had been suffering from cancerous lymphoma prior to contracting the virus while being treated at the Samsung Medical Center’s emergency unit in May.  A Seoul-based hospital`s separate, temporary clinic for potential MERS patients is now left unused. YonhapUpon being confirmed as a MERS patient on June 7, he received treatment at a quarantine facility until his release on Oct. 3. Before the release, he had tested negative for the virus twice consecutively.However, he was hospitalized again on Oct. 11 at Seoul National University Hospital after experiencing high fever. After being readmitted, he tested positive once again for the MERS virus. Prior to his rehospitalization, the Health Ministry had planned to announce the official end of MERS for the country on Oct. 29. Health authorities declared a de facto end to the outbreak of MERS on July 29.Under the World Health Organization guidelines, the official declaration of an end to an outbreak cannot be made until at least 28 days after the last patient has tested negative for the virus.“We think it’s inappropriate to talk about the declaration when a patient has just passed away,” Kim Young-taek, an official from the Health Ministry told The Korea Herald. “We choose not to comment on any plans on the declaration for now.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","died wednesday after fighting ,patient died wednesday after ,syndrome patient died wednesday ,suffered the longest battle ,patient died wednesday","['South Korea ’s', 'Korea ’s Health Ministry']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42464712  0.4305909

An AH-64 Apache helicopter from the U.S. Army 2nd Infantry Division crashed onto a mountain road late Monday near Wonju, Gangwon Province, some 100 kilometers east of Seoul. The accident took place 20 minutes after the attack helicopter departed from Osan Air Base in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province. The crew members were on their routine night low-fly training mission, the U.S. authorities said. The bodies of the two soldiers were recovered from the helicopter, Wonju firefighters said. The crewmen’s identities have not been disclosed. The investigators suspected that the attack helicopter hit a high-voltage line or a steel tower in the foggy weather. A disconnected line and upper part of a tower were found among the wreckage. “I heard a ‘bang’ sound and saw flames here and there around the road along with the broken line,” a witness resident said, according to a police report. The weather condition was appropriate for flying as the visibility was 8 kilometers with the wind speed at 2 meters per second, Korean military sources said. No further causalities or property damages were reported. The accident site was 500 meters from residential property. The U.S. military investigators collected the black box and the wreckage for closer investigation. The probe will likely take about a month, they said. The traffic around the accident scene was restricted Tuesday. The Apache helicopter, armed with a 30-millimeter M230 chain gun, Hydra 70 rocket pods and 16 hellfire missiles, is one of the most advanced attack helicopters in service. It has day or night or all-weather flight capabilities and can attack tanks or bunkers up to 8 kilometers away.

It's one of the most lavish defense procurement projects here with more than 8 trillion won in development costs in addition to 10 trillion won to be spent in mass production. KAI is South Korea's contractor manufacturer of the program.   With the partnership, Indonesia will be entitled to purchase 50 new planes.   Under the deal signed Sunday, Indonesia will be able to take part in the designing of the airplane, as well as in the production of components for the program.   It will also be entitled to acquire the aviation technology of the project and bring home one experimental airplane, according to KAI.   ""All the specifics have been agreed upon with the Indonesian side, regarding the KF-X development,"" said Jang Sung-sub, director of KAI. The KAI-Indonesia deal will be finalized after KAI signed its final agreement with the South Korean government as the contractor of the project later this year.   The latest deal will help expedite the local project, which has been criticized by the National Assembly, as well as the public.  The program was dealt a major blow after the U.S. Department of State refused in April to approve U.S.-based Lockheed Martin's transfer of four core aviation technologies for the South Korean project.   Speculation had also circulated that Indonesia might take back its offer to form a partnership first committed in 2011.   In addition to the 120 and 50 units to be delivered to the South Korean and Indonesian air forces, respectively, KAI plans to produce up to 600 units of the new airplane to sell them overseas, another KAI official said.

They also found a debit card and bankbooks under different names. The man, who entered Korea on a forged passport in 2007, is suspected of having supported the Nusra Front, a Syrian al-Qaida affiliate, through social media for months. He was found to have posted on social media a video clip of himself waving the terrorist group’s flag atop a local mountain in April. He also uploaded a photo of himself wearing a cap with the group’s logo at Gyeongbokgung Palace, Seoul’s most frequented tourist destination.

Beijing says the Syrians themselves need to arrive at a political solution.  IS said in its magazine Wednesday that it had killed two hostages it was holding for ransom _ from Norway and China _ after they had been ``abandoned'' by infidel nations.   The Chinese man had been identified as Fan Jinghui, 50, a self-described wanderer from Beijing who once taught grade school and sometimes worked in TV production. China's Foreign Ministry confirmed his killing early Thursday.                                                             Chinese President Xi Jinping (Yonhap)``China strongly condemns the brutality of the killing of Chinese national by the Islamic State extremists,'' the Chinese president said in Manila while attending an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting. He was quoted by China's official Xinhua News Agency. He expressed his condolences to the victim's family. ``Terrorists are the common enemy of humankind,'' Xi said. ``China firmly opposes terrorists of all forms and resolutely cracks down on any crimes that challenge the foundation of human civilization.'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China made all-out efforts to save Fan, but did not specify what actions were taken.  Fan also worked in advertising and TV production and described himself as a free spirit during an interview in 2001 by China National Radio. ``I love reading about the history of science,'' Fan said on the program profiling people without fixed careers. ``And the ancient Greek great philosophers' pure spiritual pursuit of freedom really gave me a jolt. That great spirit can be seen as the powerful motive for me to go after freedom.'' Fan said in the interview that he was born in 1965 and worked as a school teacher for six years after graduating from college. He said he joined an advertising firm in 1994 but left after about a year and later worked odd jobs, including as an off-the-books assistant producer at state TV broadcaster CCTV. In 2002 he registered his own advertising company, Beijing Jingcai Yinsu Advertising Co. Ltd., according to a corporate database run by the Beijing government. However, the license was revoked from September 2003 until at least 2009, and it is unclear if was later renewed.  On Thursday, a police car was parked outside the middle school where his wife works, and the school gatekeeper told a reporter that she had not come to the office. No one answered the door at Fan's apartment in western Beijing, where neighborhood elderly were patrolling the grounds to keep strangers out. China has not dispatched troops, planes or any other assets to take part in fighting in Syria.  However, Beijing in recent years has shown a willingness to use its military to protect its citizens in conflict zones and dispatched planes and a navy frigate to aid in the evacuation of 35,000 Chinese workers from Libya in 2011. More recently, China sent a naval squadron to Yemen this spring to rescue Chinese citizens and other foreign nationals from fighting.  Most Chinese citizens are believed to have already left Syria following four years of civil war.  Beijing also has been stepping-up anti-terrorism cooperation with other nations, including Turkey, from where most ISIS foreign recruits _ allegedly including some from China _ cross the border into Syria.","china strongly condemns islamic ,killing of hostage beijing ,china president on thursday ,killing of chinese hostage ,condemns islamic state killing","['AP', 'China', 'chinese', 'Islamic', 'Xi Jinping', 'China', 'Syria', 'Beiji']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.90432119  0.11778429

South Korea tends to think the power of China is growing equal to that of the U.S. as the country tries to reposition itself between the two superpowers and pitch itself as a balancer, Shin said.""But the 'balancer' discourse could cause unnecessary misunderstanding,"" the professor said, adding, ""South Korea needs to make it more clear that the central axis of South Korea's security and diplomacy is the South Korea-U.S. alliance. ""China does not have the willingness and the power to replace the U.S. (as the controller of the global system),"" he said. ""South Korea should not be deluded by China's recent charm offensive."" Under this backdrop, Seoul could play its role as a defuser whenever U.S.-China tensions escalate, Shin said, adding that leading the efforts to denuclearize North Korea could be part of the role.

The bombardment escalated into artillery engagement between the Koreas, killing two South Korean soldiers and two other civilians.This year's memorial service scheduled for Monday at the War Memorial in Seoul will gather together about 4,000 government officials and residents of the frontline island under the slogan ""The united power of the people could defend the country from North Korean provocations,"" according to the Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs. President Park Geun-hye plans to deliver a video message to the ceremony, which will overlap with her foreign trip. The ceremony will also include a performance where elementary students from the island will re-enact the 2010 engagement. Marine Corps servicemen also plan to stage a group dance performance in commemoration.

No official records are available on what damage the engagement incurred on the North Korean side, but a local media outlet specializing in North Korea has said it killed about 10 North Korean soldiers and wounded 30 others.

46,46,Questions surround asylum seeker’s airport death,"A Moroccan asylum seeker in Korea was belatedly confirmed to have died several months ago at Incheon International Airport while being deported by immigration officers, with human rights activists claiming there may have been “excessive” use of force. The 18-year-old Moroccan lost consciousness at the airport while being taken to the boarding gate on March 20, according to a report obtained by The Korea Herald.

He was rushed to a nearby hospital, but died, the Justice Ministry confirmed. The police conducted an autopsy on his body in March and sent the case to the Incheon District Prosecutors’ Office. His body was transported to his home country in April upon his family’s request.  (Picture not directly relevant to topic)In early November, the prosecutorial probe ended, but the cause and circumstances surrounding the death remain unknown.“We couldn’t confirm the cause of his death, but we concluded that he died while being subdued by the immigration officers,” an official from the Incheon District Prosecutors’ Office told The Korea Herald. “But we cannot file charges as we don’t know the cause of his death.”Refugee rights activists here raised the possibility that the immigration officers might have physically abused him while subduing him to take him to the airport for deportation from Hwaseong detention center, where he was staying.“We had asked for related documents including his death certificate and reports on his life at the detention center, but the government kept saying it cannot disclose the information as a probe was underway,” Kim Seong-in, secretary-general of refugee rights group NANCEN, told The Korea Herald. In Korea, citizens and civic groups have the right to information about public administration. It should be provided within two weeks. “But I wonder why they have still not provided us with the information even after the probe concluded,” he said. “Does the Justice Ministry have something to hide?” According to testimonies from foreigners who were forcibly deported from Korea, human rights abuses often take place especially during the deportation process. They claimed that the immigration officers handcuffed them, covered their faces with a cloth and turned off lights inside the bus to beat them up. A Pakistani witness, who was detained at the same time as the late Moroccan, explained that he had strongly resisted the deportation order and was forcibly dragged to the airport. The Moroccan feared he would face persecution back home, the witness said, wishing to remain anonymous.“If the Korean government did not force him to go back home, he would still be alive,” he told The Korea Herald.Kim of NANCEN said the government should clarify what really caused Mahammad’s death so as to prevent recurrences.The young Moroccan entered Korea on a tourist visa last year and stayed past its expiration. He was arrested for theft and transferred to Hwaseong detention center where he applied for refugee status in January due to religious reasons. Since the enactment of the Refugee Act in 2013, asylum seekers can apply for refugee status at the detention centers and are deported if denied. The applicants wait in the detention center until the result comes out, which normally takes up to three years. The former and current detainees The Korea Herald met all likened the detention center to “prison” due to what they called appalling conditions inside. The Moroccan could not cope with the ill treatment and even swallowed two batteries attempting suicide while at the detention center, the Pakistani fellow detainee said. According to a report by Korean Bar Association, some 16 detainees are locked in one room with iron bars and cannot freely get out, move around or use the Internet to connect to the outside world. They can only step outside the building twice a week for 20 minutes each. The Justice Ministry, however, said the teenager’s death had nothing to do with how he was treated or the conditions at the detention facilities. “He had mental health problems and attempted suicide a few times. He went to the hospital three times for such abnormal actions,” an official from the ministry explained. The ministry said he had not responded to its request for interview six times, which gave it legal ground to deny asylum and order him to leave the country.But the authorities did not respond to The Korea Herald’s request to confirm the conditions inside the detention center.The Refugee Act stipulates that those seeking asylum in Korea cannot be deported during the application process. But the law also states that the Justice Ministry can end the refugee application process when asylum seekers do not present themselves for interviews for more than three times.

They also found a debit card and bankbooks under different names. (Yonhap)The man, who entered Korea on a forged passport in 2007, is suspected of having supported the al-Nusra Front, a Syrian al-Qaida affiliate, through social media for months. He was found to have posted a video clip of himself waving the terrorist group’s flag atop a local mountain on social media in April. He also uploaded a photo of himself wearing a cap with the group’s logo at Gyeongbokgung Palace, the most frequented tourist destination in central Seoul. He expressed his anger toward the worldwide condolences for the French in the wake of Friday night’s deadly attacks in Paris, according to the police. “It is too much that people pray for France when nobody can confirm who did it while they feel nothing when 400,000 Syrian civilians die,” he said on social media. Al-Nusra, which was founded in Syria in 2011 at the command of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, aims to establish an Islamist state in Syria, mostly through carrying out bombing, guerilla and suicide attacks. It has links to al-Qaida, and has grown into an international terrorist group with an estimated 10,000 members.The police said they will continue the investigation to find out whether the suspect has accomplices or is part of a local network of terrorist sympathizers. Earlier Wednesday, the National Intelligence Service said in a parliamentary report that it found 10 South Koreans who had publicly expressed support for the Islamic State, the group thought to be behind the terrorist attacks in Paris. But the agency could not identify them for legal reasons. The agency added that 48 foreigners in Korea suspected of being linked to the international terrorist groups or viewed as security risks had been arrested and deported since 2010. The arrest comes just a month after the government caught five IS sympathizers trying to smuggle bomb materials into Lebanon. In January, an 18-year-old middle school dropout allegedly traveled to the Middle East to join the Islamic State. Two other Koreans attempted to follow suit, though their trip was canceled after the police confiscated their passports.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","korean police said wednesday ,police arrest indonesian ,police raided his residence ,police arrest indonesian al ,south korean police","['south korean', 'indonesian', 'Korea', 'al - Qaida', 'the National Police Agency', 'Indonesian', 'South Chungcheong Province', 'the Immigration Control Law']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.25745219  0.71284872

President Park Geun-hye is greeted by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as she arrived at the venue for the Group of 20 summit in Antalya, Turkey, on Sunday. (Yonhap)On the first day of the two-day summit, Park discussed ways to strengthen cooperation to eliminate the global threat of violent extremism as the event was taking place two days after a series of deadly attacks in Paris by the Islamic State group.Leaders were to discuss how to coordinate policies for inclusive and robust growth in Antalya, a resort Turkish city near the Syrian border. But with the deadly attack in Paris sparking global anxiety, leaders called for an immediate and concerted effort to tackle terrorism and go after the terrorist networks stretched worldwide.On the sidelines of the G20 summit, Park was to hold a bilateral meeting with British Prime Minister David Cameron to seek ways to expand economic cooperation, and bolster ties on regional security and on North Korea.Before she left for Turkey, Park offered deep condolences over the deadly attacks in France that left at least 129 people dead. “My people and I convey deep condolences,” Park said in a telegram of condolence.“Terrorism is a crime against humanity. It is never justified and should not be tolerated in any circumstance,” Park said.Park also said in the message to French President Francois Hollande that South Korea strongly supports French efforts to root out terrorism and vowed to join international antiterrorism efforts.“The South Korean government will support France’s antiterrorism efforts and actively cooperate with the international community to curb terrorism,” she said.The G20 summit was Park’s first leg of a 10-day tour. After Turkey, she plans to visit the Philippines and Malaysia for separate regional summits. In the meetings, she is expected to meet Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, just a few weeks after they had their first-ever meeting Seoul in which they agreed to speed up talks on Korean women forced into sexual slavery during the World War II, within this year.By Cho Chung-un and news reports (christory@heraldcorp.com)","attacks south korean president ,countermeasures against terrorism president ,terrorism president park geun ,greeted by turkish president ,against terrorism president park","['south korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Paris', 'Group of 20', 'Turkey', 'Park Geun', 'turkish', 'Recep Tayyip Erdogan', 'Group of 20', 'Antalya', 'Turkey']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.22867364  0.18249278

He was among the first to be rescued, without giving evacuation orders to the passengers.The court made the full bench decision that Lee had committed murder by gross negligence in the appeal filed by Lee and 14 other crew members.“While he could have easily informed the passengers of the urgent situation and reduce the number of casualties, Lee fled the ferry without doing so,” Chief Justice Yang Seung-tae said. “Even after Lee escaped, he did not provide information on the situation onboard to the Coast Guard, being totally indifferent to the passengers‘ safety.” Lee Joon-seok, a captain of the ferry Sewol. YonhapThe court, meanwhile, maintained the previous ruling against the chief, second mate of the ship and chief engineer of negligent homicide. The first ruling had convicted Lee of gross negligence and dereliction of duty, giving him a 36-year prison term. The second ruling, meanwhile, ruled Lee was guilty of murder, saying it had more grounds to deem he never made the evacuation orders. Lee received a life sentence.The ferry was en route to the southern resort island of Jejudo from Incheon, west of Seoul, on April 16. Most of the victims were high school students on a field trip.Preparations began this summer to salvage the ferry, which remains at the bottom of the sea along with nine missing bodies.The sinking of the 6,825-ton vessel is considered one of the worst maritime disasters in Korea. Nationwide outcry broke out after it was learned that most crew members, including Lee Joon-seok, had abandoned the ship before passengers were led to safety. The incident also unveiled a network of corruption between government and civil officials, and sparked criticism over the government’s failure to conduct effective rescue operations, which led to President Park Geun-hye disbanding the Korea Coast Guard.From news reports","april last year killing ,lee had committed murder ,life sentence against sewol ,last year killing 304 ,killing 304 on board","['the Supreme Court', 'Lee Joon - seok', 'Lee', 'Lee']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.19424044  0.68100864

(Yonhap)They agreed to hold another round of talks “at an early date” in line with their leaders’ agreement last week to accelerate the negotiations over the long-festering issue, the major source of bilateral antipathy.Lee Sang-deok, director general of Northeast Asian affairs at the ministry, led the South Korean side while the Japanese side was represented by Kimihiro Ishikane, director general of the Japanese Foreign Ministry’s Asian and Oceanian Affairs Bureau. “We held deep, useful talks. With regard to our differences, we decided to continue our consultations to reach agreement on them at another round of talks to be held at an early date,” a senior Seoul official told reporters on the customary condition of anonymity.”He refused to elaborate on the content of the bilateral talks, but noted that the two sides are moving forward “little by little toward a goal.”Since the first round of the talks in April 2014, Japan has maintained the issue was already settled under a 1965 treaty normalizing bilateral ties. Article II of the treaty states the problem concerning property, rights and interests of the two contracting parties and their nationals has been settled “completely and finally.”However, Seoul claims that the issue was not on the agenda for the negotiations over the treaty at the time, given that it was only in the 1990s that victims and civil society were just starting to raise the issue. It also claims it is a wartime human rights issue that should be dealt with separately from the treaty.Seoul’s First Vice Foreign Minister Lim Sung-nam repeated the government stance on Wednesday.“Our government’s firm stance has been that the issue was not included as part of the agenda for the negotiations for the 1965 treaty,” he said in a radio interview with the local broadcaster TBS.Earlier in the day, Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said nothing has yet to be determined with regard to the solution to the long-festering issue.“No decision has been made yet over the issue,” he told reporters.“As it is true that the comfort women issue has affected the development of bilateral relations, the two sides have repeatedly held director-general-level consultations,” he added, expressing hopes for an early resolution of the issue.There are 47 known surviving Korean victims, who are an average of 89.2 years old.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","enslavement of korean women ,sex slavery south korea ,tokyo fail to bridge ,japan wartime sexual enslavement ,seoul tokyo fail to","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'Lee Sang - deok', 'northeast asian', 'Kimihiro Ishikane', 'the japanese Foreign Ministry ’s', 'asian']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67178261 -0.01355544

General Assembly adopted a landmark resolution calling on the Security Council to refer North Korea's human rights abuses to the International Criminal Court. It is poised to adopt a similar resolution next month.Marzuki Darusman, U.N. special rapporteur on the human rights situation in North Korea, urged the international community to work on ensuring the North's accountability for what the world body called ""crimes against humanity.""""This year, another resolution will be tabled because not much change has happened in North Korea since last year. In fact, I don't think any changes have taken place,"" Darusman said in an interview with Yonhap News Agency held on Tuesday in Seoul.Darusman was in Seoul to attend a global conference on the North's human rights records to be held on Wednesday.North Korea has long been branded as one of the worst human rights violators. Pyongyang has bristled at such criticism, calling it a U.S.-led attempt to topple its regime.Darusman said in his recent report to the U.N. that there are widespread human rights abuses in the North such as summary executions and torture.He also said that more than 50,000 North Koreans have been forced to work abroad, mainly in China and Russia as the North seeks to earn hard currency. Pyongyang is under heavy sanctions by the Security Council for its nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches.The U.N. rapporteur claimed that there is the need to apply the concept of ""universal jurisdiction"" to North Korea's rights abuses.The exercise of universal jurisdiction allows states to investigate and prosecute those who commit crimes against humanity, regardless of where such atrocities are committed or the criminals' nationality.""It means that any court in the world should be able to address any case that is related to the DPRK with the regard to its human rights violations,"" he said. The DPRK is the acronym of the North's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.Darusman said that the move would pave the way for making North Korean perpetrators accountable for such crimes, voicing hope that the U.N. could initiate discussion on the issue.""Universal jurisdiction will help effectively make the accountability process universal and spread out throughout the world. That means there is no escaping from wrongdoings that have been committed on their people,"" he added.Darusman said he is ""ready"" to visit North Korea if Pyongyang invites him so that he could have a ""deeper understanding"" about the North's situation.In October last year, the North offered to allow him to visit the reclusive country in exchange for dropping the clause on the referral of the North human rights issue to the ICC in the resolution. At that time, he urged the North to invite him unconditionally.He also stressed the need for the South Korean government to increase humanitarian assistance to the impoverished North.""I think (the provision of) humanitarian aid should be separated from political issues because it is aimed at easing the suffering of people in the DPRK,"" Darusman added.South Korea is seeking to spur civilian inter-Korean exchanges, but the government's aid to the North have been largely small since Seoul imposed sanctions on Pyongyang following the deadly sinking of a warship in 2010.""It should be disconnected to any immediate political issues,"" the U.N. rapporteur said, adding that South Korea should be at the forefront of extending such assistance to the North.

He was sentenced to three years imprisonment. Following the incident, the police have mobilized not only the team in charge of hit-and-run cases, but also police officers dealing with general traffic accidents to swiftly respond to such incidents, the police said. Most recently, the police succeeded in apprehending a man within 13 hours last month, as they found white paint at the scene and traced all the 245 white-colored vehicles registered with the city government in Gangjin, South Jeolla Province. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","and run murders nationwide ,the police arrested total ,monday they had arrested ,run murders nationwide ,police ramp up arrests",[],10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60046154  0.46770394

The businesses, for example, cannot specify that they want a female secretary or a male worker in their job advertisements. English expressions such as “waiter” and “waitress” that can distinguish a sex cannot be used, either. The guidelines specify companies refrain from giving job seekers different entitlements or job statuses based on gender, asking personal questions like marital status at job interviews or mentioning specific requirements related to appearance and body size in the ads. But the ministry will allow specific jobs, such as a model for male clothes or a guard for male dormitory, to be reserved for specific genders due to the nature of the jobs. The companies will also be allowed to recruit a certain gender with the purpose of easing existing gender inequality at their workplaces. In recent years, there have been widespread complaints that companies still ask female candidates sensitive questions, such as whether they are married or plan to have a baby in the near future during the employment process. “The corporate culture that violates job seekers’ privacy by asking about marital status and appearance is a problem, but what’s more worrisome is that many companies are not aware of the illegality of such practice,” said Labor Ministry official Nah Young-don, who is in charge of youth and women policy. “We will actively promote the relevant law and step up monitoring breach cases to lighten job seekers’ burden.” Under the current law on gender equality in employment, no one should face discrimination due to their marital status, role or gender without appropriate reasons. The law also bans companies from asking questions related to height, weight and appearance. Last year alone, there were an estimated 630 cases in which employers put up discriminative job postings looking for “good-looking” candidates. The government only warned the companies to scrap the postings or correct some phrases without legally punishing them. Defending the claims, another official told The Korea Herald that it is “difficult” practically to take legal actions against businesses violating the law. “Job seekers who experienced discrimination in the hiring process are reluctant to come forward in fear that such complaints might adversely affect their job prospects, which makes it tough for us to crack down on the employers breaking the law,” said Labor Ministry official Lee Young-ki.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","korean government said tuesday ,sex discrimination in hiring ,hiring the south korean ,send major companies guidelines ,workplaces against such violations","['south korean', 'the Ministry of Employment and Labor']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.31242669  0.47932485

Local police said Hong seemed to have died due to illness.   The Filipino authorities were in drawn-out talks with the kidnappers demanding a huge amount of ransom.   ""The government is considering adjusting the level of travel warnings for the Philippines in general,"" the Foreign Ministry official told reporters in a background briefing. ""The government is mulling over the designation of some areas as a travel ban zone.""   It is among various measures considered to prevent crimes against South Koreans in the Philippines that are on the steady rise. Nine Koreans have been murdered there this year alone.    Around 88,000 South Koreans live in the Southeast Asian country on a permanent basis, with more than one million others traveling there every year, according to official data.   Under its passport law, South Korea has prohibited its people from traveling to conflict-ridden nations such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Libya, Somalia and Syria.

The government said it is closely monitoring over 850 students and lecturers who have been using the College of Animal Bioscience and Technology building in northeastern Seoul, to check if more have been infected. All the 31 patients are from three laboratories in the university building. Of the patients, 23 were placed in isolation at state-run facilities, while eight others were quarantined at home, with the government still trying to find the cause of the infection.The university also put up posters around campus asking those who visited the bioscience building from Oct. 8-28 and who are showing suspicious symptoms to report to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.SK Group, which used the building Sunday for a test for job applicants, said it would contact the candidates to notify them of the possible infection. The company refused to reveal the number of people who took the exam in the building. Since a 26-year-old female student from the college showed symptoms on Oct. 19, 20 more students working toward their doctoral and master’s degrees at laboratories in the building have contracted the unknown virus. With the growing number of patients, Konkuk University shut down the whole building Wednesday, while the CDC conducted an epidemiologic inspection into the building and disinfected it earlier in the day.  “We assume that the source of infection is inside the building, but don’t know what exactly it is,” an official from the CDC said. “For now, there are no human-to-human infections and the virus hasn’t spread outside the building.”As of Thursday evening, there were no additional cases of infection.The first four graduate students showing symptoms allegedly visited a cattle fair in Gyeonggi Province as well as an animal farm owned by the university in Chungju, North Chungcheong Province, last week, triggering speculations that they might have caught the Brucellosis bacterial infection. Brucellosis, which generally infects animals including cattle, sheep, goats and dogs, can be passed on to human beings when they come in contact with infected animals. But professor Chang Won-joong, who is in charge of managing animals and plants for the university, dismissed the claims, saying the students had not touched cattle placenta. There is little possibility that their visit to the animal farm and cattle fair could be linked to the infection, he added. Some experts suspect Q fever, which can be transmitted by air and is caused by the Coxiella burnetii bacteria found in the droppings of animals. Symptom such as fever, headache and muscle aches appear after a two-week incubation period.The university is now waiting for the results of the inspection by the CDC.

Chinese railway authorities opened the memorial hall earlier last year honoring the Korean independence hero Ahn Jung-geun, who assassinated the Korean Peninsula's first Japanese governor-general, Hirobumi Ito, at a railway station in the northeastern Chinese city of Harbin in October 1909.  The assassination was a watershed moment in Japan's 36-year colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula that began in 1910. The authorities will gradually renovate the Harbin railway station, where Ito was killed, by 2018, and the size of the memorial hall will be expanded to as large as 500 square meters from the current size of 200 square meters, according to the Chinese officials. ""Construction of a new memorial hall is expected to begin in the first half of next year,"" a memorial hall official said. Yang Xinglong, head of the memorial hall, said, ""We will display more exhibits to let more people understand martyr Ahn's spirit of the anti-Japanese movement and peace in line with the expansion of the memorial hall."" Ahn is viewed in both Korea and China as a symbol of the fight against Japan's Imperial Army, but Japanese officials have drawn criticism by describing him as a terrorist.The memorial hall at the Harbin station has attracted about 200,000 visitors so far.

Lee Sun-jin shakes hands with troops at a unit on the country’s frontline island of Yeonpyeongdo on Oct. 9. (Yonhap)The South Korean Navy ship fired five warning shots with a 40 mm-caliber gun. The ship retreated to the North 18 minutes after the shots were fired. No damage was seen on the ship, Seoul authorities said. Pyongyang called the South’s use of the gun a “deliberate military provocation,” warning that the inter-Korean relations could return to the point before the two sides struck a comprehensive deal on Aug. 25 to defuse cross-border tensions.The North’s vessel came some 700 meters into the South Korean waters at around 3:30 p.m., according to Seoul authorities. At the time, the vessel was carrying out a stepped-up clampdown on some 100 Chinese vessels operating near the Northern Limit Line, the de facto sea border.“In the process of (the North) making its retreat, there was no naval clash or anything,” said a military official on condition of anonymity. “We are keeping closer tabs on the North Korean military’s movements and strengthening our readiness posture.”The North’s violation of the NLL raised tensions as the two Koreas were holding reunions of families that have been separated since the 1950-53 Korean War at Mount Geumgangsan on the North’s east coast.The North’s Committee for Peaceful Unification of the Fatherland criticized the South, arguing that Seoul carried out a “military provocation” intentionally targeting its naval vessel.“The South Korean military’s warmongers fired a barrage of shots toward our vessel that was conducting a normal maritime mission,” said the committee’s unnamed spokesperson in an interview with the North’s Korean Central News Agency.“It is a deliberate provocation that is intended to raise military tensions again in the West Sea.”Seoul authorities countered that they fired the warning shots in accordance with “due procedures.”“It was not the first time that the North’s patrol ship has violated the NLL,” a Seoul official told reporters on condition of anonymity. “When a North Korean ship crosses the NLL into the South, the Navy is immediately to make a warning announcement and then fire warning shots.”Since the Aug. 25 agreement, the North has violated the NLL twice. On Aug. 31, a North Korean patrol ship retreated to its waters after the South fired three shots with a 40 mm-caliber naval gun. As of October, the North violated the NLL more than 10 times, according to Seoul authorities.The North has often violated the NLL in what Seoul claims to be a move to turn the waters near the NLL into a disputed area. The North contests the NLL as a maritime border, as it was drawn unilaterally by the then U.S.-led U.N. Command after the end of the Korean War. The North argues the NLL should be redrawn further south.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","crackdown on chinese fishing ,korean military said sunday ,chinese fishing boats operating ,on saturday during beefed ,korean navy ship fired","['north korean', 'chinese', 'south korean', 'South Korea ’s', 'Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'Lee Sun - jin', 'Yeonpyeongdo', 'south korean', 'Navy']",10,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.29245669  0.3340838

Some 90 families have been temporarily reunited since Saturday for a three-day event. The first round involved another 90 families and ended Thursday.This isn't the first time a North Korean boat has crossed the NLL, with the communist country claiming a line further down south as the maritime border.The most recent transgression took place on Aug. 31, only six days after a landmark deal was reached between the Koreas to diffuse tension. Two more crossings took place earlier in June, with South Korea firing warning shots in all of the incidents. The family reunions that started last week are part of the deal.

It was not clear what Hwang meant by ""determination.""But the National Intelligence Service, South Korea's top spy agency, prevented Hwang from sending the memo to Jang during his visit to South Korea.Ha, who said he frequently met with Hwang since 2001, said the former North Korean official thought that Jang should assume power after Kim's death and pursue reform and openness in North Korea.Hwang, who taught North Korea's ""juche"" philosophy of self-reliance to Kim, died in Seoul in 2010.Kim died of a heart attack in 2011 and was succeeded by his youngest son, Kim Jong-un.North Korea executed Jang in December 2013 on charges of treason.

The nation’s worst maritime accident killed more than 300 people, mostly students on a school trip. “Without any evidence that the rumors about Park’s relationship with a man were true, it seems like the accused intended to spread the rumors, pretending that it is for the public good,” prosecutors said in court. “The accused did not even try to verify the rumors.”The court is expected to hand down a sentence for Kato on Nov. 26. In his defense, Kato said that he did not have an intention to defame her. “I only meant to deliver objective reports on Korean politics and society as Japanese take great interest in President Park’s moves,” he said in final testimony. Kato’s lawyer argued the whereabouts of the president is a public matter and Kato wrote the column based on circulating rumors that were already published in the Chosun Ilbo, South Korea’s largest newspaper. The column in July last year questioned Park’s whereabouts on the day of the ferry sinking, triggering rumors that she might have been with a man at the time. “The Japanese government has strongly demanded the Korean government reasonably respond to the case from the perspective of bilateral ties and freedom of press, expression,” Yoshihide Suga, the spokesperson for the Japanese government said at a press briefing in Tokyo on Tuesday, voicing concerns and regret over the penalty sought for Kato. Sankei Shimbun also expressed astonishment and anger at the move, asking the Korean prosecution to make a ruling based on democratic values and “international common sense.” Reporters Without Borders urged the South Korean judicial system to refrain from imposing a jail sentence on Kato, calling it a “real threat” for journalists and viewing it as the government's desire to tighten controls on media.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","defaming south korean president ,fury from japan prosecutors ,seoul seeks jail term ,japanese journalist accused ,jail term for japanese","['japanese', 'south korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Japan', 'Tatsuya Kato', 'Seoul', 'japanese', 'Sankei Shimbun', 'south korean']",10,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.14219676  0.30003393

German police said the stabbing of a prominent candidate Henriette Reker for Sunday`s mayoral election in Cologne had a ""racist political"" motive linked to the huge numbers of migrants entering the country.(AFP-Yonhap)She has pushed for a fairer distribution of people across the European Union, but the crisis has sorely tested ties between member states and put unprecedented strain on the right to free movement that is at the core of the 28-nation bloc’s values.Slovenia said Saturday it was drafting in the army to help police cope with an expected influx of thousands of migrants arriving after Hungary shut its border with Croatia overnight in its latest hardline move to stop the flow of people.More than 630,000 people fleeing war and misery in the Middle East and Africa have landed on Europe‘s shores this year, with many making risky sea crossings from Turkey to Greece.Highlighting the human cost of the crisis, another 12 people drowned on Saturday when their wooden boat sank off the Turkish coast as they were trying to reach the Greek island of Lesbos, Turkey’s Anatolia news agency reported.Most of the refugees and migrants are trying to get to Germany, Europe‘s economic powerhouse, which has said it expects up to one million asylum seekers this year after saying it would open its doors to Syrian refugees.Merkel’s policy has led to growing tensions in Germany, triggering a backlash from her conservative allies and spawning a growing number of increasingly vocal far-right protests.Reker, an independent close to Merkel‘s ruling Christian Democrats (CDU) responsible for refugee issues in Cologne, was stabbed in the neck at a party information stand in the city. Four other people were also injured, one of them seriously, with regional police chief Wolfgang Albers saying it was a “political act”.The attacker was arrested at the scene and told police he had “a racist motivation for committing this act,” Cologne police official Norbert Wagner said at a news conference.  (AFP)","german politician stabbed ,racist attack german mayoral ,german politician stabbed in ,politician stabbed in racist ,attack german mayoral candidate","['german', 'Angela Merkel', 'german', 'Cologne', 'Henriette Reker']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.92450196  0.28544733

(Yonhap)At Hanwha Resorts, a total of 394 people will be briefed on an array of issues including details about the reunions at Mount Geumgangsan, their health care and what they should be cautious about in the communist state.They have been given the opportunity to attend the first round of the reunions, as 96 families in the North, which Pyongyang has selected, have sought to meet them. The first round will continue through Thursday, followed by the second and last round that will end next Monday. During the second round, 255 people from 90 families, which the South’s Red Cross selected through a computer lottery, will meet their relatives in the North.The reunions, which will be the first since February 2014, were arranged after the two Koreas reached a comprehensive agreement on Aug. 25 to ease cross-border tensions, seek regular high-level talks and bolster civil-sector exchanges.On Tuesday, a total of 541 South Koreans including 118 staffers to facilitate the reunions and 29 press people will travel to Mount Geumgangsan. During the three-day program, the participants will meet their relatives six times -- each for two hours. They will meet for two group reunions, a welcome reception, one individual gathering, one joint dinner session and farewell reunions. Seoul authorities have paid much attention to the health care of the participants as there are more old family members -- a reason they increased the number of medical staffers to 18 from 12 in the previous 2014 reunions. Dozens of the participants are in their 90s. Seoul has regarded the issue of the separated families as an urgent humanitarian one, as many family members pass away due to old age each year.It is presumed that more than 60,000 people, including more than 1,000 South Korean nationals living abroad, remain alive. The South Korean side has sought to exchange lists of the surviving members of families with the North, allowing the families to exchange letters and meet through video links, in addition to holding the reunions on a regular basis. But it remains unclear whether the North will agree to Seoul’s proposal, as it could potentially enable the flow of outside information into the highly controlled society and pose a threat to the dictatorial regime, observers said.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","family reunions nearly 400 ,gangwon province on sunday ,400 south koreans will ,resume family reunions nearly ,1950 53 korean war","['South Koreans', 'Sokcho', 'Gangwon Province', 'Red Cross', 'Sokcho', 'Gangwon Province', 'Yonhap)At Hanwha Resorts']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29330572  0.22294019

It does not state the statute of limitations for the nullification.In February, a Chinese-Korean man surnamed Yang challenged the clause after he was stripped of his South Korean citizenship in 2013 for falsifying the paperwork during his naturalization. He had become a Korean citizen in December 2002.Yang said allowing the state to revoke citizenship ― albeit obtained via an illegal process ― whenever it wishes infringes upon the freedom to relocate and pursue happiness, and is in violation of the principal of prohibiting over-restriction stipulated in the constitution. “Recognizing the validity (of the citizenship) despite the illegal nature of its acquisition would effectively validate the illegal naturalization,” the court said in its ruling, adding that imposing only administrative punishments upon those who illegally obtained citizenship could not sufficiently fulfill the purpose of the nationality law. “The current law does not stipulate unconditional cancelation of an illegal naturalization, but requires the Justice Minister to consider whether or not to revoke the citizenship after considering the severity of the illegal action, the relationship of the person after being naturalized, the aftermath of the action and the time between the authorization and cancellation.”It also pointed out that a person whose citizenship has been revoked due to his or her wrongdoings is still entitled to one’s rights as a foreign citizen and can reapply to become a Korean citizen, which means it does not violate the principal of minimized infringement in the constitutional law.The case marked the first time the Constitutional Court officially recognized the legitimacy of not having limits to when an illegal naturalization can be revoked.Korea has recently seen an increase of cases involving the naturalization process, as it has become home to more foreign residents and naturalized Koreans than ever before.According to the Ministry of Interior, there were 1.38 million foreigners and 158,064 naturalized Koreans living in the country as of 2015. A total of 92,316 were naturalized through marriage. The number of foreign-born residents has increased each year since the government started tallying and has tripled compared to 530,000 in 2006, the ministry said.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","naturalization south korea constitutional ,cancel an illegal naturalization ,illegal naturalization south korea ,illegal naturalization process regardless ,korea constitutional court ruled","['South Korea ’s', 'Constitutional Court']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.10926307 -0.33574507

According to the police, the 9-year-old boy threw a 1.83-kilogram cement brick from the rooftop of his 18-story apartment building in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province, on Oct. 8 as part of an experiment with two of his friends on how gravity worked.(Yonhap)The brick consequently killed the 55-year-old woman, identified only by her surname Park, and injured a 29-year-old woman, also surnamed Park, who were building a makeshift shelter for street cats in a garden on the first floor at the time.  The elder Park, later nicknamed “Cat Mom,” was rushed to a hospital, but later died. The younger Park, who was helping her, sustained a skull fracture. The boy confessed his crime to the police, who were questioning and searching the homes of some 20 residents who were present at the time of the incident. The National Forensic Service also confirmed that footprints found on the rooftop were his. The police called in the young suspect and his parents for questioning Thursday. His parents were unware that their son killed the woman, as he did not tell them about the incident for fear that he might be scolded, police said. The police concluded that the child had no intention to harm anyone with the brick. Even if he meant to kill the woman, those aged under 14 cannot be punished under the current law. But the victim’s family can file a lawsuit seeking financial compensation. With few clues and no witnesses suggesting a suspect, online users, the police and media initially speculated that the brick was intentionally thrown to harm the woman, as it was later revealed the two victims were regularly feeding stray cats and setting up shelters in the neighborhood.The “Cat Mom” case further shed light on brewing conflicts between cat lovers and their neighbors in Korean society. While pet lovers cite responsibility to protect all animals and take care of street cats in their neighborhood, opponents accuse them of encouraging noisy, unsanitary cats to reproduce. Some netizens went as far as to post messages describing various ways to stop those helping cats. Suggestions included putting rat poison in food offered to the cats or overdosing cats with painkillers. A photo of a warning sign went viral, reading: “Don’t feed cats here. If caught feeding cats, I will cut your wrists.” According to the Seoul government, the number of “Cat Moms” and “Cat Dads” hovers around 3,000, with nearly 250,000 stray cats living in the city.

As the 40-year-old automatically lost his South Korean citizenship when he left the country at the age of four to be adopted, Crapser has always been effectively stateless.Newly released South Korean government data showed that almost 10 percent of 166,138 registered Korean adoptees who left the country since the 1950s may be in Crapser’s shoes. According to the report published by Rep. Nam In-soon of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, some 15,592 Koreans adopted by foreign nationals may be stateless, a vast majority of them estimated to be living in the U.S.The individuals account for 9.3 percent of all Korean adoptees, according to the report.According to the lawmaker, most nations in Europe and Australia have been granting automatic citizenship to foreign-born children who arrived in their countries through international adoption. However, this was not the case in the U.S. until 2001. Prior to 2001, children were required to enter the country on foreign-born adoption visas, sponsored by adoption agencies. Once the adoption visa expires after six months, it was the adoptive parents’ responsibility to file for their children’s American citizenship. Lawmaker Nam said most of the 15,592 Korean adoptees who may be stateless are estimated to be those living in the U.S., who have never been formally naturalized in the country as their adoptive parents did not apply for their citizenship. Of the 166,138 Korean children -- local NGOs estimate that the actual number is 200,000 -- who were sent abroad for international adoption since the 1950s, some 100,000 were adopted to the U.S.In 2000, lawmakers in the U.S. made citizenship automatic for international adoptees. But the law, which took effect in February 2001, excluded adoptees 19 or older at the time.

83,83,Suicide bombings kill 95 people at Ankara peace rally,"Nearly simultaneous explosions targeted a Turkish peace rally Saturday in Ankara, killing at least 95 people and wounding hundreds in Turkey’s deadliest attack in years _ one that threatens to inflame the nation’s ethnic tensions.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility but Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said there were “strong signs” that the two explosions _ which struck 50 meters (yards) apart just after 10 a.m. _ were suicide bombings. He suggested that Kurdish rebels or Islamic State group militants were to blame.The two explosions occurred seconds apart outside the capital’s main train station as hundreds of opposition supporters and Kurdish activists gathered for the peace rally organized by Turkey’s public workers’ union and other groups. The protesters planned to call for increased democracy in Turkey and an end to the renewed violence between Kurdish rebels and Turkish security forces. The attacks Saturday came at a tense time for Turkey, a NATO member that borders war-torn Syria, hosts more refugees than any other nation in the world and has seen renewed fighting with Kurdish rebels that has left hundreds dead in the last few months. Many people at the rally had been anticipating that the rebels of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, would declare a temporary cease-fire _ which it did hours after the bombing _ to ensure that Turkey’s Nov. 1 election would be held in a safe environment.Television footage from Turkey’s Dogan news agency showed a line of protesters Saturday near Ankara’s train station, chanting and performing a traditional dance with their hands locked when a large explosion went off behind them. An Associated Press photographer saw several bodies covered with bloodied flags and banners that demonstrators had brought for the rally. “There was a massacre in the middle of Ankara,” said Lami Ozgen, head of the Confederation of Public Sector Trade Unions, or KESK.  The state-run Anadolu Agency said the attacks were carried out with TNT explosives fortified with metal ball-bearings.Turkey’s government late Saturday raised the death toll in the twin bomb blasts to 95 people killed, 248 wounded. It said 48 of the wounded were in serious condition.Selcuk Atalay of the Turkish Medical Association’s Ankara branch put the death toll at at least 97 and feared the toll could rise even higher, since several of the wounded were in serious condition with burns. (Yonhap)“This massacre targeting a pro-Kurdish but mostly Turkish crowd could flame ethnic tensions in Turkey,” said Soner Cagaptay, an analyst at the Washington Institute.Cagaptay said the attack could be the work of groups “hoping to induce the PKK, or its more radical youth elements, to continue fighting Turkey,” adding that the Islamic State group would benefit most from the full-blown Turkey-PKK conflict.“(That) development could make ISIS a secondary concern in the eyes of many Turks to the PKK,” Cagaptay said in emailed comments, using another acronym for IS militants.Small anti-government protests broke out at the scene of the explosions and outside Ankara hospitals as Interior Minister Selami Altinok visited the wounded. Some demonstrators chanted “Murderer Erdogan!” _ referring to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whom many accuse of increasing tensions with Kurds to profit at the ballot box in November. Erdogan denies the accusations.Later Saturday, thousands gathered near Istanbul’s main square denouncing the attacks and also holding the government responsible.The Turkish government imposed a temporary news blackout covering images that showed the moment of the blasts, gruesome or bloody pictures or “images that create a feeling of panic.” A spokesman warned media organizations they could face a “full blackout” if they did not comply.Many people reported being unable to access Twitter and other social media websites for several hours after the blasts. It was not clear if authorities had blocked access to the websites, but Turkey often does impose blackouts following attacks.At a news conference, Davutoglu declared a three-day official mourning period for the blast victims and said Turkey had been warned about groups aiming to destabilize the country. “For some time, we have been receiving intelligence information based from some (Kurdish rebel) and Daesh statements that certain suicide attackers would be sent to Turkey... and that through these attackers chaos would be created in Turkey,” Davutoglu told reporters, using the IS group’s Arabic acronym.“The (Kurdish rebels) or Daesh could emerge (as culprits) of today’s terror event,” Davutoglu said, promising that those behind the attacks would be caught and punished.Davutoglu said authorities had detained at least two suspected would-be suicide bombers in the past three days in Ankara and Istanbul. Authorities had been on alert after Turkey agreed to take a more active role in the U.S.-led battle against the Islamic State group. Turkey opened up its bases to U.S. aircraft to launch air raids on the extremist group in Syria and carried out a limited number of strikes on the group itself. Russia has also entered the fray on behalf of the Syrian government recently, bombing sites in Syria and reportedly violating Turkish airspace a few times in the past week.On a separate front, the fighting between Turkish forces and Kurdish rebels flared anew in July, killing at least 150 police and soldiers and hundreds of PKK rebels since then. Turkish jets have also carried out numerous deadly airstrikes on Kurdish rebel targets in northern Iraq.  Erdogan condemned Saturday’s attacks, which he said targeted the country’s unity, called for solidarity and canceled a planned visit Monday to Turkmenistan.“The greatest and most meaningful response to this attack is the solidarity and determination we will show against it,” Erdogan said.President Barack Obama offered condolences to Erdogan in a phone call Saturday. The White House said in a statement that Obama affirmed that the U.S. will stand with Turkey in the fight against terrorism. Critics have accused Erdogan of re-igniting the fighting with the Kurds to seek electoral gains _ hoping that the turmoil would rally voters back to the ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP.  Electoral gains by the country’s pro-Kurdish party caused the AKP, founded by Erdogan, to lose its parliamentary majority in a June election after a decade of single-party rule. The attacks Saturday, which even surpassed twin al-Qaida-linked attacks in Istanbul in 2003 that killed some 60 people, also drew widespread condemnation from Turkey’s allies.Turkey’s state-run news agency said President Barack Obama called Erdogan to extend his condolences. The Anadolu Agency, citing unnamed officials, said Obama told Erdogan the United States would continue to side with Turkey in the fight against terrorism. It quoted Obama as saying the U.S. “shared Turkey’s grief.”Erdogan earlier said the twin bombings aimed to destroy Turkey’s “peace and stability.” Anadolu said the two leaders agreed to talk more in the coming days.German Chancellor Angela Merkel sent her condolences, calling the attacks “particularly cowardly acts that were aimed directly at civil rights, democracy and peace.” “It is an attempt at intimidation and an attempt to spread fear,” she said. “I am convinced that the Turkish government and all of Turkish society stands together at this time with a response of unity and democracy.”NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said “there can be no justification for such a horrendous attack on people marching for peace... All NATO allies stand united in the fight against the scourge of terrorism.”Saturday was the third attack against meetings of Kurdish activists. In July, a suicide bombing blamed on the Islamic State group killed 33 peace activists, including many Kurds, in the town of Suruc near Turkey’s border with Syria. Two people were killed in June in a bomb attack at the pro-Kurdish party’s election rally.“This attack (Saturday) resembles and is a continuation of the Diyarbakir and Suruc (attacks),” said Selahattin Demirtas, leader of the Turkey’s pro-Kurdish party.  He held Erdogan and Davutoglu’s government responsible for the latest attack, saying it was “carried out by the state against the people.”In the aftermath of the Ankara attack, the PKK declared a temporary cease-fire. A rebel statement said Saturday the group is halting hostilities to allow the Nov. 1 election to proceed safely. It said it would not launch attacks but would defend itself.The government has said there would be no letup in its fight against the Kurdish rebels.“Our operations (against the PKK) will continue until they lay down arms,” Davutoglu said late Friday.

84,84,Suspect denies charge in Itaewon murder trial,"The key suspect in a reopened murder case denied his charges of stabbing a South Korean college student to death in Itaewon, Seoul, nearly two decades ago at the first court hearing on Thursday. Arthur John Patterson, a 35-year-old U.S. citizen, was extradited to Korea late last month to face a new trial on charges of murdering Cho Joong-pil, 22, in 1997 at a Burger King restaurant in Itaewon, a multicultural distri...","The key suspect in a reopened murder case denied his charges of stabbing a South Korean college student to death in Itaewon, Seoul, nearly two decades ago at the first court hearing on Thursday. Arthur John Patterson, a 35-year-old U.S. citizen, was extradited to Korea late last month to face a new trial on charges of murdering Cho Joong-pil, 22, in 1997 at a Burger King restaurant in Itaewon, a multicultural district frequented by expats residing in Seoul. Arthur Patterson (Yonhap)At the hearing, Patterson accused Korean-American Edward Lee of killing Cho, who was found on the restroom floor with several wounds to his neck. Cho died in transit to a hospital. On Thursday morning, Patterson looked pale and nervous in the green prison uniform as he walked into the court room with more than 100 in attendance.“Patterson said he could not admit to the charge as Edward Lee stabbed the victim,” Oh Byung-joo, Patterson’s lawyer, said on his behalf in the courtroom. “The crime was committed without a motive or purpose, which could only have been done by a person who was either crazy or under the influence of drugs,” Oh said, citing Lee’s record of drug abuse and dealing. Lee, now 36, was also at the crime scene and sentenced to 20-year jail term in an appeals court for murdering Cho. But Lee was later cleared of the murder for lack of evidence in the retrial ordered by the highest court. In what many see as botched investigation, Patterson was indicted on lesser charges including destruction of evidence and possession of an illegal weapon at the time. A year later, prosecutors launched a new probe into the murder case, viewing Patterson as the prime suspect. But Patterson fled to the U.S. after the government failed to renew his travel ban. This time, the prosecution vowed to revisit evidence and collect more testimonies to prove Patterson’s guilt in the fresh trial. Given the location of the stabbing, the prosecution initially ruled out the possibility that Patterson, who is shorter than the victim, stabbed Cho. But newfound evidence, the victim’s backpack, allegedly indicated otherwise. The prosecution also said it had already secured testimonies from Patterson and Lee’s friends who witnessed them leaving the crime scene. But Patterson’s lawyer questioned the credibility of the evidence provided by the prosecution, including the backpack and Patterson’s bloodstained T-shirt, asking the judges to closely look into them. Patterson’s lawyer also took issue with Korea’s double jeopardy rule banning a defendant to stand trial over the same charge for a second time, even if new evidence comes to light. Patterson was already convicted of destroying evidence and carrying a weapon and served his jail term until he was freed in special amnesty in 1999.But the prosecution refuted his claims, saying that Patterson was indicted on a murder charge this time. Another sticking point is whether the statute of limitations on murder could apply to Patterson. If Patterson were found to have intentionally fled to the U.S. in 1999 to avoid being punished here, his statute of limitations could be extended, making it possible for the prosecution to further investigate the case. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","stabbing south korean college ,reopened murder case denied ,in reopened murder case ,1997 at burger king ,of stabbing south korean","['south korean', 'Itaewon', 'Seoul', 'Arthur John Patterson', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'Cho Joong - pil', 'Burger King', 'Itaewon']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.16224293  0.43659452

The 35-year-old was under investigation when he fled the country in 1999.

According to the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, the 43-year-old Chinese diver fainted when a sudden blast took place in the nose of the 6,825-ton ship on Monday evening while he was participating in a propeller-cutting operation. The diver was immediately pulled to the surface by a colleague and moved to the hospital. He is in stable condition, but reportedly suffering from peritonitis and body muscle pain resulting from decompression. The blast is suspected to have occurred due to the combination of sparks and air that was being used for the propeller-cutting job. A consortium led by Chinese state-run company Shanghai Salvage has been leading the ship recovery work since August. Over 100 Chinese divers and workers are currently carrying out preparations for the actual recovery of the ship, with an aim to pull the ferry out of the water no later than June next year. A total of 304 passengers died in the Sewol tragedy in April last year, with nine still missing. The ministry said the diver could choose to return to work or go back to China upon treatment.

Hong allegedly needed to secure some 30 million won ($25,000) to invest in opening a restaurant with his friend. According to the police, Hong had planned the crime in advance, stealing a kitchen knife from a local market and researching the indoor shooting range online.The suspect said during police questioning that he had attempted to steal a handgun and bullets at the range on Thursday, but gave up as two male staff were at the scene. On Saturday morning he committed the crime when only the female owner was at the range, with the other male staff member on duty having left to go to the supermarket. Hong received 50 bullets from the store, of which he fired 20 at the range. He then fled with the 45-caliber handgun and 19 bullets after stabbing the owner.The 46-year-old woman was taken to hospital, but is not in a life-threatening condition.Police immediately mobilized all officers in the region and asked the public for help to track him down by releasing CCTV footage of the suspect through media.Investigators acquired his fingerprints from a daily business log at the range, which enabled them to locate the suspect by detecting a signal from his mobile phone.Hong purportedly changed his clothes in the building next to the range and took taxis twice to flee until he was forced out of the taxi and captured by the police at 1:40 p.m. the same day. The police recovered the handgun and 19 bullets on the spot.The incident has unleashed a fresh debate over lax gun regulations at indoor ranges across the nation.During the news briefing on Sunday, a chief of the Busanjin Police Station noted that anyone could access the guns at the range without a key.The relevant law requires indoor ranges to have at least three staff members onsite for safety, but there are no rules allowing punishment of those who break the law. The customers’ identities are not properly checked at most of the ranges, with Hong’s personal information on the business log turning out to be fake. “The loose management at the indoor range caused a casualty, but it will not likely face penalties for its wrongdoing,” a police source said, citing a lack of ordinances on gun control at indoor ranges. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","stabbing suspect planned robbery ,gun range stabbing suspect ,suspect planned robbery police ,him from stealing handgun ,robbery police said sunday","['Busan', 'Hong']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44612405  0.15976301

Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony from 1910 to 1945.

Lee has been investigated for allegedly embezzling some 14.6 billion won in school funds, some of which is suspected to have been used for bribes to high-ranking government officials. Investigators raided Kim’s office last week and summoned him several times for questioning recently. Prosecutors reportedly have also procured evidence that Lee had been conducting illegal lobbying with politicians as well. Kim, who was unavailable for comment, was transferred to state-run Korea National University of Education on Wednesday, the day prosecutors requested a warrant for him. The ministry claimed it had no specific knowledge of the investigation and that Kim had requested work at a university due to “health related reasons.”According to the KNUE, Kim on Wednesday asked for paid leave for the remainder of the week. The university said they were unaware of the investigation and were “baffled” at the scandal.Kim has held several posts at the ministry for over two decades and headed the office of planning and coordination at Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education before returning to the ministry last December as its spokesman.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","arrest south korean prosecutors ,faces arrest south korean ,education spokesman faces arrest ,college officials said thursday ,kickbacks from local college","['south korean', 'the Education Ministry', 'Kim', 'Lee Jung - hak', 'Sohae College', 'Gusan', 'North Jeolla Province', 'the Jeonju District Prosecutor ’s Office']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.18841252  0.44100803

Those killed in the accident also included some 200 high school students on a school excursion.The 15 surviving crew members of the ferry have been handed down prison terms ranging from five to 30 years while the ship's 68-year-old captain Lee Joon-seok has been sentenced to 36 years in prison.So far, 47.2 billion won has been paid in compensation to the victims' families or those injured in the accident.The amount also includes compensation for residents and fishermen from the areas close to the accident site who had been forced to give up their daily work to make way for search and rescue operations that lasted nearly seven months until mid-November.A fresh search operation is now under way, this time to recover the ship and the bodies of nine victims who remain missing.

According to the studies, which monitored a total of nine TV channels and their daily news shows from Aug. 1-8, male hosts were four times more likely to open the shows by delivering the first news segment of the programs compared to their female counterparts. Also, male anchors in general were significantly older -- on average by 10 to 20 years -- than female anchors. Among the 18 male anchors working for the news shows for the nine channels, including KBS, MBC and YTN, four of them were in their 30s, eight in their 40s and six in their 50s. None were in their 20s.  A news program by MBC (MBC)However, eight female hosts hired by the nine broadcasters were in their 20s, the second largest number of any age group. Nine of them were in their 30s while only one of them was in her 40s. None of the women were in their 50s.“The age difference gives the male anchors more authority as they have more experience and more expertise,” said a researcher at the Korean Institute of Gender Equality Promotion and Education, the think tank that released the studies. “We never see a female anchor in her 50s paired up with a male anchor in his 20s. The age difference between male and female anchors gives an impression that women hosts are only doing supportive, complementary roles while their male counterparts are the ones who are delivering the ‘important’ news.”The studies also discovered that male TV reporters in general appeared more on shows than their female counterparts. Among a total of 966 TV news reports aired by the nine channels, 64 percent were reported by male reporters. The studies also found that while most male reporters were in charge of covering politics, economy and social affairs, many female reporters were placed to cover life or cultural events.Also, among some 1,141 individuals interviewed for the TV news programs, 30 percent of them were women. In particular, women only accounted for about 10 percent of the interviewees considered as experts, such as lawyers, university professors or scientists.The think tank also monitored a total of six daily newspapers, including the Chosun Ilbo, JoongAng Ilbo and the Kyunghyang Shinmun, in August. The study found that among a total of 1,209 stories published by the papers, only 7.8 percent of them were about women’s issues. Also, among a total of 66 contributing writers for the papers, only 15.2 percent were women.“Some of the reasons why there is so little coverage on women’s issues while there are still so few women who work as contributing writers have to do with the general social perception that does not value women’s experiences and their expertise,” said Kim Ha-ing, president of the KIGEPE, through a statement. “And in order to bring changes to this general perception, the role of the media is crucial. We need equal coverage on the experiences of both genders.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","korean media industry sexism ,in korean media industry ,sexism is still prevalent ,media industry sexism ,male hosts were four",['South Korea'],10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5528906   0.59731162

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon have expressed hope that North Korea does not go ahead with a long-range rocket launch.The two also shared the view that the isolated country should come forward for dialogue with the international community, Ju Chul-ki, senior presidential secretary for foreign affairs, told reporters after their meeting at Ban's official residence on Friday evening.Park arrived in New York hours earlier for the U.N. General Assembly.Park and Ban, a former South Korean foreign minister, did not hold specific consultations on sanctions the U.N. could impose on North Korea in case Pyongyang launches a long-range rocket, Ju said.North Korea has long been under an array of U.S. and international sanctions for its nuclear and missile programs. A new rocket launch, if carried out, is likely to prompt the U.N. to further tighten sanctions on North Korea.There is speculation that North Korea may launch a long-range rocket in October to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Workers' Party.Seoul and Washington view a satellite launch as a cover for testing the North's ballistic missile technology, which is banned under U.N. resolutions.The North has also suggested that it may conduct a nuclear test in response to what it claims is the hostile policy of the United States and other hostile forces.Park told Ban that North Korea should end its obsession with its nuclear weapons program and have dialogue with South Korea and work toward a peaceful unification.Ban vowed to assist in efforts to promote peace and the development of inter-Korean relations.Last month, South and North Korea produced a breakthrough deal that defused tensions on the Korean Peninsula and set the stage for temporary reunions for families separated since the 1950-53 Korean War.Also Friday, U.S. President Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, held summit talks and reaffirmed their commitment to a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.Xi also said he opposes any action that violates U.N. Security Council resolutions, in an apparent warning against North Korea over its possible rocket launch.Park also unveiled her commitment to contribute to the development of underdeveloped countries, citing Seoul's ""Saemaeul Movement,"" or new community movement.The initiative -- launched by Park's father, then-President Park Chung-hee in the 1970s -- is credited with helping modernize the then-rural South Korean economy.Park made the comment early Friday as she congratulated Ban on the adoption of a new U.N. global agenda at the start of a three-day summit on sustainable development.The new agenda commits every country to taking an array of actions that not only address the root causes of poverty but also increase economic growth and prosperity, and meet people's health, education and social needs, while protecting the environment, according to the U.N.

He is suspected of stabbing a college student, identified by his surname Cho, multiple times at a Burger King in the popular foreigner district of Itaewon in central Seoul 18 years ago.   Arther Patterson, a U.S. citizen accused of murdering a South Korean college student in 1997 was extradited to South Korea Wednesday. (Yonhap)""It's not right that they (the family of the victim) have to keep going through this pain over and over and over, but it's not right that I'm here either. I'm still shocked that I'm even here,"" Patterson told reporters after arriving at the airport.   Denying the charges, he pointed to Korean-American Edward Lee, who he was with at the site of the homicide, as the culprit.  A local court found Lee guilty of murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment in 1998, but he was acquitted by the Supreme Court the following year on a lack of evidence.  At the time, Patterson, who is half Korean, was in Seoul as the dependent of a civilian worker with the U.S. military. The 35-year-old was under investigation when he fled the country in 1999. His departure was made possible after law enforcement authorities failed to extend his foreign travel ban.  Prosecutors indicted Patterson for the murder of the 22-year-old student in November 2011 and set into motion the extradition process.  While Patterson was caught in the United States in May 2011 in collaboration with U.S. authorities, he has been delaying extradition by submitting multiple habeas corpus petitions, the Ministry of Justice said.  He will be taken into custody at the Seoul Detention Center before standing trial.

The $110 million agreement was clinched between the Korea Aerospace Industries and the Thai government in Seoul. The supersonic aircraft, built with technical assistance from the American defense giant Lockheed Martin, is scheduled to be delivered by March 2018. The Thai Air Force has been pushing to replace its L39 jets manufactured in the former Czechoslovakia and used for more than 30 years. Its cabinet approved 3.7 billion baht ($103 million) for the project late last year. The country’s sole aircraft maker vied with those from the U.S., Russia, China and Italy. The Sacheon, South Gyeongsang Province-headquartered company and its Chinese competitor had been seen as the most likely winners. “The decision by the Thai Air Force, which has long purchased cutting-edge weapons systems made by aerospace powerhouses, will provide a chance for its long-term partnership with KAI,” the firm said in a press statement. “The T-50 is the best alternative for the force’s drive to modernize its military and cultivate fourth-generation combat pilots.” The latest agreement may pave the way for additional sales of the T-50 as Thailand is reportedly seeking to bring in as many as 24 more trainer jets in the coming months. If KAI wins the contract, the sum is likely to near $800 million, the largest package for the model’s exports. KAI is also setting sights on the U.S. Air Force’s $10 billion program called T-X to adopt new two-seat, faster jet trainers to replace the Northrop T-38 Talon. The winner is expected to be announced in the second half of 2017, company officials said. On the industry front, the deal highlights South Korea’s efforts to shore up its charges into the global warplane market.  KAI sealed a $420 million contract with the Philippines last year to sell 12 light attack FA-50 fighters, the T-50’s armed version, a $1.1 billion deal with Iraq in 2013 to supply 24 FA-50s and a $400 million bid with Indonesia in 2011 to provide 16 T-50s. In 2013, Thailand signed its largest-ever naval procurement agreement worth 14.6 billion baht to purchase a multipurpose frigate from South Korea’s Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering, with its delivery slated for 2018.

Security Council resolutions if it forges ahead with its plans to launch a satellite using ballistic missile technology.State Department spokesman John Kirby made the remark after the North's space agency strongly suggested that the country may launch a satellite aboard a long-range rocket around next month's 70th anniversary of the foundation of the ruling Workers' Party.""There are multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions that require North Korea to suspend all activity related to their ballistic missile program, and establish a moratorium on missile launches, stop conducting any launches using ballistic missile technology and abandon its ballistic missile program in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner,"" Kirby said.""So any satellite launch using ballistic missile technology is a clear violation"" of U.N. resolutions, he said.Speculation has persisted that the North could launch a long-range rocket to mark the anniversary after a recent upgrade enabled the launch site to handle bigger rockets. Monday's statement from the North's National Aerospace Development Administration was Pyongyang's first official acknowledgment of the possibility.""The world will clearly see a series of satellites of (North) Korea soaring into the sky at the times and locations determined by the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea,"" the KCNA reported in an English statement, without elaborating.The North also claimed it has the right to launch rockets for peaceful purposes.Pyongyang has long been accused of using long-range rocket launches as a pretext for test-firing intercontinental ballistic missiles. Experts say long-range rockets and ICBMs are basically the same with differences only in payloads.The North is believed to have honed advanced ballistic missile technologies through a series of test launches, including a 2012 launch that succeeded in putting a satellite into orbit. That test is considered the most successful so far.The test also sparked fears that the North has moved closer to ultimately developing nuclear-tipped missiles that could potentially reach the United States mainland. The country has so far conducted three underground nuclear tests: in 2006, 2009 and 2013.

Park’s son was thrown back into the spotlight after a local broadcaster reported that a lawsuit filed by a group of 1,000 citizens remains pending against the son, who they claimed allegedly submitted someone else’s X-rays photos to get exempted. The son had faced a similar lawsuit in 2013 but was acquitted.“Our decision on (Park’s son) is lawful.

The ruling Saenuri Party urged Park’s son to testify before a court to clear the charges, while the main opposition New Political Alliance for Democracy labeled the call as a smear campaign to tarnish Park, who leads the polls among opposition presidential hopefuls.Seoul City authorities described the news report as biased and filed a lawsuit against the broadcaster. A Seoul City senior official said in a news conference that the program intentionally left out the prosecutors’ decision to acquit Park’s son of the allegation that he violated the military service law.Park, for his part, vowed to fight back against the accusation and urged the public to support his claim. “I can exercise tolerance toward whom I can protect,” said Park on his Facebook account. “Authorities have already confirmed that the allegation is unfounded.

Rescue efforts are still (going) on, so I can't say exactly how many may be trapped inside the debris,"" Alava, additional police superintendent for Jhabua, told AFP by phone.      ""The restaurant was in a tightly packed locality and a lot of people were here having breakfast, that is why the casualties are so high,"" she said earlier, adding that some 35 injured had been rushed to a nearby hospital.   Alava said the intensity of the blast knocked down a neighbouring building and damaged several others.    Television footage showed scores of people and rescue workers using their bare hands to shift mangled heaps of steel and concrete of the ruined buildings while police cordoned off the area.   Bodies covered in dust and ash lay in the streets alongside the twisted wreckage of burned vehicles.   Another district police official, Anurag Mishra, cited the restaurant's proximity to a busy bus stand as a reason for the high number of casualties.   Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan took to Twitter to express his sadness at the loss of life.   ""The Jhabua tragedy is heart wrenching. I offer my condolences to the families of the victims and pray for the speedy recovery of those injured,"" Chouhan said.   He offered compensation of 200,000 rupees ($3,020) to the families of the dead and 50,000 rupees ($755) to help the injured victims.    Domestic gas cylinder explosions are common in India, where safety standards are relatively poor.   But although reports of fatal accidents from cylinder blasts are frequent, mass casualties are unusual.(AFP)","cylinder blast kills 25 ,25 people dead saturday ,explosion in packed restaurant ,blast kills 25 in ,people dead saturday police","['India', 'Madhya Pradesh', 'GMT']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.58993751  0.42798054

But he added that any agreement reached by the tripartite committee before the process was finalized would be reflected in the bill. “Considering the time needed to pass the labor reform bill, allocation of the budget and the National Assembly‘s schedule, we cannot wait indefinitely until the tripartite committee strikes a deal,” he said at a press conference in Sejong Government Complex. Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan. YonhapThe budget for the labor reform was to be submitted later Friday. The government will start work on the bill with the ruling Saenuri Party next week, Choi said.Seoul had set Thursday as the deadline for the tripartite committee to see eye to eye on labor market reform, negotiations over which resumed late last month after collapsing in April.Issues to be covered in the government-Saenuri bill include raising unemployment benefits, reducing working hours and expanding the compensation for workers injured while commuting.The Labor Ministry also plans to iron out administrative guidelines that will make it easier for companies to lay off underperforming workers and introduce policies that penalize workers for poor performance. These have been among the most contentious issues in the three-way talks.Labor Minister Lee Ki-kweon said while the workers should back down on the lay-offs issue, the corporations should make compromises by hiring more workers. Korea is pushing back the retirement age to 60, starting next year, which is expected to raise employment-related costs even with the wage peak system that will also be implemented the same year. Under the peak wage system, employees are allowed to work for longer but are given reduced salaries as they approach retirement.But the government’s announcement to power through with the labor reform has faced objections from the labor side and the opposition party.Kim Dae-hwan, head of a tripartite committee, asserted that the committee had never set a deadline for the talks, vowing to resume the negotiations on Saturday regardless of the government’s decision.Rep. Moon Jae-in, leader of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, berated the government’s labor reform plans. “A labor policy that makes it easier to lay off workers and reduce their wages is a backwards policy,” he said.NPAD floor leader Rep.

In the still-available clip, Banks, an African-American TV personality, claims that the surgery that the 25-year-old Korean-American named Liz received was an attempt to “look more Caucasian” by Asian women. “You and I are the same,” Banks tells Liz, pointing her own artificially straightened hair. Her voice is firm and even intimidating.“I know I’m not going to look white with a hair weave. But it’s still one step closer to (looking white). And your eyelid is one step closer. Do you understand?”Are women like Liz really trying to “look white” by undergoing the procedure that creates a permanent crease on upper eyelids without even realizing it? In today’s Korea, where 20 percent of the female population has had plastic surgery at least once in their lives, the public rarely associates its ever-booming cosmetic surgery industry with race or the nation’s turbulent modern history. “I would get serious complaints if I performed the procedure and the Korean patient gets a crease like the one of a Caucasian person. What people want is a natural crease that is suited to Asian faces,” said Seoul-based plastic surgeon Na Min-hwa, who has been performing the procedure for the past 15 years. “The whole idea that undergoing this surgery is an attempt to look white is absurd.”A number of studies, however, have suggested that the introduction of the double-eyelid surgery to the Korean Peninsula in the 1950s was closely related to racism and the U.S. military agenda, and that legacy still carries a significance today.Most popular plastic surgery in the worldWith or without Tyra Banks’ rant, the double-eyelid operation has evolved into an even more popular procedure in Asia and the rest of the world in recent years. According to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, the procedure was the most-performed plastic surgery worldwide last year. Some 1.43 million individuals underwent the procedure, including Asian-Americans, accounting for 14.8 percent of all cosmetic surgery performed across the globe in 2014. South Korea, meanwhile, performed the fourth-most cosmetic surgical procedures in the world last year.Among the well-known Korean figures who have had the procedure are former President Roh Moo-hyun and veteran singer Patti Kim.The surgery was first developed and performed in Korea by Dr. D. Ralph Millard, an American military plastic surgeon who was stationed in the country during the Korean War (1950-53). Among the very first Koreans who received the particular procedure were Korean war brides who married American soldiers. It is estimated that 50 percent of Asians have naturally creased eyes. However, the preference for double eyelids among Asians today is not “inherent, natural or random,” according to scholar Taeyon Kim. “This preference has an historical development that is shaped by the motives of the American Cold War that produced the Asian as an ambivalent threat that needed to be contained and domesticated,” Kim wrote in her 2005 Ph.D. dissertation submitted to Bowling Green State University. 'Superior palpebral fold'Although it is believed that double eyelid surgery was first introduced in late 19th-century Japan, it was during the Korean War that the operation became popular in Asia, according to Kim’s research. According to Kim, Millard was stationed in Korea during the war as part of an American public relations campaign to show “American’s benevolent face to the Koreans.” On top of developing and performing double eyelid surgery ― which was the alteration of “Oriental” features to “Occidental” ― he was also committed to serving those who were severely injured on the battlefield and in need of surgical reconstruction. During the war, Korean eyes without the crease ― referred to as the superior palpebral fold in American medical texts ― were dubbed “slanted,” and were seen as a mark of inscrutability and deviance. In her text, Kim argued that it was significant that Millard, who is one of the pioneers of Asian double eyelid surgery, was a military surgeon whose experience of Asian bodies was firmly rooted in Cold War ideologies and discourses. “Surgically altering the ‘slanted’ eyes became a mark of a ‘good’ and trustworthy Asian, one whose modification of the face provided a comforting illustration of the pliable Asian, and served as evidence of the U.S. as the model and Asia as the mimic,” Kim wrote. The scholar pointed out that the legacy of such notions can be found even in the popular advertisements in Korea in the 2000s. The perceived enlargement of the eyes by undergoing the procedure is described in ways that suggest a “broadening of the mind, a brightening of the soul, and confidence in the spirit” in modern Korean ads, according to the scholar. In 1964, Millard wrote why the Koreans without the fold are problematic. “The absence of the palpebral fold produces a passive expression which seems to epitomize the stoical and unemotional manner of the oriental,” he wrote. Korean military brides to AmericaAlthough the War Brides Act in 1945 enabled American soldiers stationed overseas to bring home wives of a different race, interracial marriages were illegal in parts of the U.S. until the early 1960s. In such a political climate, Korean military brides were considered both cultural and racial threats to the U.S., which influenced many Korean women, especially those who wished to marry American soldiers, to alter their eyes in the 1950s.“It is felt that this deorientalizing problem may well come home to the American plastic surgeon, for there have been well over 10,000 Japanese war brides as well as many post-war marriages with Korean girls,” wrote the American surgeon Millard in 1955.According to Yuh Ji-yeon’s 2002 study on Korean military brides, the women who were brought to American families at the time were strictly pressured to nurture their children as future Americans and provide their husbands with an American lifestyle: “Their fear was that, unless properly Americanized, the women would ‘foreignize’ their husbands and children.”David Palumbo-Liu’s book, “Asian American: Historical Crossings of a Racial Frontier” talks about how cosmetic surgery reduced such American anxieties by demonstrating the “shaping power of the U.S.” and the “malleability of Asia.” By altering their eyes, the Korean brides became less threatening racially, while their “passive, compliant” nature would make them easily assimilate, according to the studies. “While it is primarily beauty that motivates (today’s women’s) desire to alter their eyes, this beauty is built on a legacy of a history of Western science and race that privileged the white body as the normal, beautiful body,” Kim wrote in her study.Unconscious legacy Song Ji-hye, a Seoul native, underwent double eyelid surgery in 2005, at age of 19. The 29-year-old said she just wanted to have a more “defined look,” and had no desire to look white.“I’ve never had anyone asking me if I underwent the surgery in order to look more white,” she said. “I’ve never seen anyone who underwent the procedure for that reason, either. It sounds absurd to me. Caucasians are not the only racial group of people who have double eyelids. If anything, I think those who undergo the procedure want to look like fellow Asians who have naturally creased eyes.”Culture critic Lee Moon-won said most Koreans are unconscious of the Western influence on the country’s beauty standards, partly because they are not often exposed to ethnic or racial diversity. “Most people don’t think they want to look white, and that may be true,” he said. “But when you think about it, what the society collectively considers as beautiful ― big eyes, a small face, and perked nose ― are things that many Koreans can’t achieve naturally. The (Western) influence is there, but people don’t question it because the society has very narrowly defined notions of beauty. When everyone wants to look the same way, you think that’s the normal way regardless of its history or meaning.”Millard in 1955 predicted that the double-eyelid surgery would be useful in the U.S. to assimilate the children of military brides from Asia. “Especially in the products of the second generation, the plastic surgeon may be called upon to help them blend with their surroundings,” he wrote.Some 60 years have passed, and South Korea has evolved into the world’s plastic surgery-capital. A total of 440,582 surgical operations were performed in Korea last year alone, accounting for 4.6 percent of all procedures performed in the world. Double-eyelid surgery is one of the most common procedures being performed here. In the U.S., plastic surgery is on the rise among Asian-Americans overall, with 44 percent of them opting to receive double-eyelid surgery. And women continue to be shamed in both countries. Song Ji-hye was once called a “seonggwei,” meaning “plastic surgery monster” by a male colleague at a drinking party.“You get shamed no matter what,” Song said. “If you don’t get it, you are made fun of your looks, and once you get the procedure, you are shamed for having done it or not being naturally beautiful.

The incident took place at 11:08 a.m. as a 20-year-old trainee, identified only by his surname Sohn, was preparing to throw a K413 hand grenade right after removing its safety hook. A 27-year-old sergeant surnamed Kim who was giving guidelines in the same trench was immediately hospitalized to treat shrapnel wounds all over his body but died at 12:53 p.m., officials said. The blast also severed Sohn’s right wrist. He underwent surgery at Kyungpook National University Hospital. Another 27-year-old sergeant surnamed Park, who was about 1 meter away from the recruit, also suffered injuries to his left leg, said Maj. Gen. Koo Hong-mo, head of operations at the Joint Chiefs of Staff.“The grenade detonated in the trainee’s hand just when he was about to hurl it,” Koo said during a parliamentary audit later in the day. Police enter an Army training center in Daegu where a grenade blast killed one instructor and injured two soldiers on Friday. (Yonhap)Some other 200 soldiers were at the site for their fourth week of training, but no one else was hurt, he noted. The military has launched an investigation to examine if the device was faulty and how the incident happened. The K413 is an upgrade to the Korean-made K400 fragmentation grenade, which went off at a boot camp last September in Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province, killing three. Yet the new model showed poor performance during a regular ammunition test conducted in April 2014 by the Army as six out of 30 units exploded before the three-second threshold, according to Rep. Kim Kwang-jin of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, citing documents submitted by the Army and the Defense Agency for Technology and Quality. Though the DTaQ determined that the premature blast resulted from manufacturing defects after a seven-month-long analysis, the military recalled only 60,000 units produced in 2011. About 1 million K413s have been delivered since 2010, with the current inventory standing at around 250,000, the lawmaker said. “Given the discovery of the flaws, the military should halt the use of the grenade and consider retracting all existing ones at least until the exact cause of the incident comes to light,” Kim said. The explosion in Daegu is the latest in a string of military accidents involving firearms, land mines and other weapons. In November 2008, a blast occurred within a guard post in Cheorwon County, Gyeonggi Province, after a private broke the return rule and threw a grenade in a barrack where 16 other servicemen were asleep. The incident wounded five. In South Korea, all physically able young men are subject to compulsory military service for about two years, after which they are required to receive six rounds of three-day training over a period of eight years.

But he added that any agreement reached by the tripartite committee before the process was finalized would be reflected in the bill. “Considering the time needed to pass the labor reform bill, allocation of the budget and the National Assembly’s schedule, we cannot wait indefinitely until the tripartite committee strikes a deal,” he said at a press conference in Sejong Government Complex. The budget for the labor reform was to be submitted later Friday. The government will start work on the bill with the ruling Saenuri Party next week, Choi said.Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan  (Yonhap)Seoul had set Thursday as the deadline for the tripartite committee to see eye to eye on labor market reform, negotiations over which resumed late last month after collapsing in April.Issues to be covered in the government-Saenuri bill include raising unemployment benefits, reducing working hours and expanding the compensation for workers injured while commuting.The Labor Ministry also plans to iron out administrative guidelines that will make it easier for companies to lay off underperforming workers and introduce policies that penalize workers for poor performance. These have been among the most contentious issues in the three-way talks.Labor Minister Lee Ki-kweon said while the workers should back down on the lay-offs issue, the corporations should make compromises by hiring more workers. Korea is pushing back the retirement age to 60, starting next year, which is expected to raise employment-related costs even with the wage peak system that will also be implemented the same year. Under the peak wage system, employees are allowed to work for longer but are given reduced salaries as they approach retirement.But the government’s announcement to power through with the labor reform has faced objections from the labor side and the opposition party.Kim Dae-hwan, head of a tripartite committee, asserted that the committee had never set a deadline for the talks, vowing to resume the negotiations on Saturday regardless of the government’s decision.Rep. Moon Jae-in, leader of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, berated the government’s labor reform plans. “A labor policy that makes it easier to lay off workers and reduce their wages is a backwards policy,” he said.NPAD floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul defined the government’s unilateral labor reform move as “a threat to the workers,” which he said would harm the labor market.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","korean government vowed friday ,labor reform after negotiations ,government vowed friday ,government vowed friday to ,south korean government vowed","['south korean', 'Choi Kyung - hwan']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.2401503   0.55658269

Lee No-keun of the ruling Saenuri Party, over 40 cases in violation of the aviation safety regulations were caught last year, which was triple the figure of 2013. In-flight smoking was the most common violation, accounting for 80 percent. Most of them were caught while smoking in the restroom, the report said. By law, anyone smoking in the airplane can be fined up to 5 million won ($4,200). A total of 12 cases were related to affrays, while six other cases were sexual crimes, including sexually harassing flight attendants or masturbating in the seats. Meanwhile, another report by Rep. Kang Seok-ho of the same party showed that crime occurrences surged not only in the flights, but also at the airport.About 1,000 violations were caught at Incheon International Airport over the last three years, with theft accounting for 30 percent of the total.Thefts continue to rise, with over 60 cases already being reported this year, double that of 2010, Kang said. The apprehension rate for theft, however, remained around 40 percent over the past six years, the lawmaker added.The number of lost items also rose every year, with the return rate staying under 50 percent. The number of lost belongings reached around 30,000 last year. Of them, only about 40 percent were returned to owners.As part of the efforts to raise the collection rate, the airport police has recently expanded the lost-and-found office and started to offer delivery of lost items through a parcel service.

Ahn Min-suk of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, an average of 63 foreign students benefiting from the government’s sponsorship program each year discontinued their studies and went back to their countries from 2011 through this August.  (Yonhap)Out of 2,186 students on the scholarship program during the 2011-15 period, 270 of them were not able to receive a degree, with the number of such students increasing every year. The biggest reason behind the students quitting their studies was family affairs, followed by health problems, language barriers, failure to adapt to studying in Korea and poor academic performance.A 28-year-old foreign student, who asked not to be named, said that most of the problems arise from foreign students who are not familiar with Korean culture, especially the strict, competitive educational environment here. “I can see the government trying to help us, but some of my friends return to their countries due to problems with host universities,” he told The Korea Herald.“For example, we often have disagreements with our labs over working hours and conditions,“ said the South American, who is required to stay for 12 hours in his university lab every day. ”We often found it difficult to cope with the strict, competitive educational environment here pressuring us to study and work long hours.“Another student from Africa also added that Korean universities are not ”open-minded“ enough to embrace foreign students here. ”I saw some friends having been refused from attending certain classes just because they were foreigners,“ he said. ”It will help us a lot to adjust to the new environment if Korean teachers and students are a bit more fluent in English and open-minded to us.“The lawmaker Ahn said that behind the problem was the lack of systematic support for the foreign students to help them adapt to the Korean environment and culture. He called for a more comprehensive monitoring system to look after the government-sponsored students.The Korean government has stepped up efforts to attract foreign students in recent years through the sponsorship program. Under the scheme, authorities offer the selected students a yearlong Korean language course, a full scholarship and living expenses until they finish earning their degrees at Korean universities. The number of the students sponsored by the Korean government surged from 422 in 2012 to 887 last year, with the government‘s plan to receive as many as 200,000 foreign students by 2023. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","foreign students quitting studies ,korean government quit their ,quitting studies in korea ,foreign students quitting ,60 foreign students sponsored","['korean', 'the National Institute for International Education', 'Ahn Min - suk', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28340828  0.37215701

Byun Jae-il ahead of the annual parliamentary audit of the government.   The lawmaker's office said that Incheon International Airport scored an average of 76.93 points among the nine categories checked, way below Gimpo International Airport in western Seoul, which got 96.37 points. Jeju International Airport, on the southernmost resort island of Jeju, came in second with 88.80 points, with Gimhae International Airport in the second-largest city of Busan trailing at 85.72.Incheon International Airport, one of the largest and busiest airports in Northeast Asia, is located 48 kilometers west of Seoul.""Incheon's score was mostly affected by high food prices at the airport,"" the office said. ""The airport got low marks in terms of accessibility from major urban hubs, expensive parking fees and courteousness of employees.""The low score comes as a surprise because Incheon International Airport, the main gateway to South Korea, has been rated as one of the best airports in the world by Airports Council International as well as being viewed as one of the world's finest transit hubs by Skytrax since 2005.ACI is the only global trade representative of the world's airports, while Skytrax provides consultancy on airlines and airports as well as conducting customer reviews.Rep.

(Yonhap)The doctor had come under media attention after the Seoul city government and Mayor Park Won-soon accused him of putting the lives of nearly 1,500 people in danger by continuing to attend social gatherings and treat his patients even after becoming aware of his possible exposure to the potentially deadly disease.The doctor, whose identity has been withheld for privacy reasons, has dismissed the accusation.Since the country reported its first MERS case on May 20, the disease has infected 186 people, killing 36 of them.No additional cases or fatalities have been reported since early July. An official declaration of the end of the MERS outbreak can be made 28 days after every person ever diagnosed with MERS completely recovers from the disease.MERS is a viral disease that is still fairly new to humans. No vaccine or treatment is currently available for the disease, apparently a reason for the high fatality rate of around 36 percent globally.In South Korea, the fatality rate of the disease remains at 19.4 percent.

The 9.77-ton boat called the Dolgorae, or Dolphin, was found about 6:25 a.m. Sunday near Chuja Island, north of the southern resort island of Jeju, the maritime security agency said. The boat lost contact with another chartered fishing boat around 7:38 p.m.Saturday, about half an hour after it left Chuja for Haenam, South Jeolla Province, it said.Originally, the fishing boat was chartered for two days and was scheduled to return to Chuja late Sunday.In the operations, 25 coast guard vessels, seven naval vessels, another three from the local government in addition to nearly 40 private fishing boats were dispatched to the site of the accident, according to the Ministry of Public Safety and Security. More than 20 divers were mobilized, including special forces from the coast guard, for underwater search operations. The coast guard is carrying out search operations in a large circle around Seosaengi Island, where the survivors were found and 500 kilometers from the northeast part of Chuja Island, the last known location of the ill-fated boat.As the waves are expected to be about two to three meters high with winds of up to 14 meters per second until tomorrow, the operations face potential difficulties. The coast guard said it has started an investigation into the boat's sinking. It said based on the testimony of survivors, the tragedy may have been caused by high waves or by the fishing vessel getting snarled in a rope of some kind.Related to the tragedy, observers said that there were critical lapses in the reporting process that delayed rescue operations.While it was around 7:40 a.m. that the boat last identified its location, it wasn't until 8:30 p.m., when the captain of another fishing boat that accompanied the Dolgorae reported the situation to authorities, that the vessel traffic service or the coast guard became aware of the accident, coast guard officials said.It took another 23 minutes before the Chuja safety center radioed the coast guard about the missing boat. Coast guard officials said that after being notified of the boat's possible distress, the safety center could not get a fix on the boat and it wasted precious time trying to contact those on board by mobile phone. All such developments affected the time it took for rescuers to reach the stricken boat and the survivors.Even after the coast guard was notified, it may have misjudged where the ship was, and sent ships and planes to the wrong area, observers said.

Only three were saved by a passing boat 11 hours after the incident. A probe is underway, but high waves are suspected to be the cause, the authorities said.Family members of those missing from the capsized boat wait for news at a makeshift station set up at a gymnasium in Haenam, South Jeolla Province, Sunday afternoon. (Yonhap)The maritime police said the initial response to the accident was delayed largely because of a false report by a man who was supposed to be on board but was not.The police said the first distress call was received by the Chuja Safety Center at 8:40 p.m. by another fishing boat, which safely completed its route. The time was about an hour after the Dolgorae is presumed to have capsized. The captain of the other boat reported that the captain of Dolgorae did not respond to his call. The safety center immediately called all the passengers based on the passenger list. While no one onboard responded, one man whose information was withheld replied to a call saying the boat was sailing well, the police said.Later, however, it was found that the man had lied, concerned that he might get punished for not boarding the boat, although he had put his name on the list, the police said.Worried about the passengers’ safety, the man later told the truth to the safety center, after he discovered that no one was responding to his calls. Right after the Korea Coast Guard received the report from the man around 9 p.m., it dispatched three patrol ships to an area where the capsized boat was likely to have drifted. The Coast Guard estimated the probable site with its “drift prediction system,” which projects possible locations of the drifting ship based on calculations of wind and water flow. The ships searched the east side of where the boat’s last positioning signal was detected. The boat, however, was found in the southwestern area 11 hours after it capsized. “The system didn’t seem to reflect real-time weather updates,” the Jeju Coast Guard officials said. The drift prediction system, launched in 2009 with an injection of over 14 billion won ($11.6 million), was introduced to the Korea Coast Guard in 2012. Poor management of the passenger list was also deemed to have aggravated the rescue efforts.It took hours for the authorities to confirm the exact number of passengers, since four of the 22 names on the list were found not to have taken the vessel. Three unregistered passengers were found to have boarded the boat in their stead. Of the three, one survived and two were found dead.Authorities later confirmed that a total of 21 passengers were on board.While commercial fishing boats usually submit the passenger list before sailing, there are no regulations to force cross-checking of the listed people and the actual passengers. Lax safety measures onboard were also dubbed a reason for the casualties, as many of the passengers were reportedly not wearing life jackets that were soaked from rain.The Coast Guard began an underwater search Monday as part of the efforts to find the missing. Relatives of the missing also urged the government to clearly investigate the accident. The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy condemned the authorities, calling it a smaller version of the “Sewol” tragedy, referring to the sinking of a large ferry that claimed the lives of 295 last year. They vowed to grill those responsible during the parliamentary audit session.The ruling Saenuri Party pledged to review the fishing boat safety laws and come up with countermeasures to better ensure the safety of fishermen and prevent similar accidents. It also vowed to pass a fishing law that has been pending in the National Assembly. The law would require all boat passengers to wear life jackets while fishing. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Public Safety and Security vowed to take stern action against groundless rumors over the accident. Rumors were spreading online that the Coast Guard deliberately ignored the rescue requests of the survivors at sea. Anyone spreading falsehoods can be sentenced to up to five years in jail or fined up to 15 million won.

Ten people, including the captain, have been confirmed dead, while an estimated eight others remain unaccounted for.Lee was rescued along with two other people early Sunday morning after hanging on to the boat for more than 10 hours, crying out for help and encouraging each other to hold on for just another 30 minutes or an hour.The captain's courage has brought back memories of the captain of the ferry Sewol, which sank off the country's southwest coast in April 2014, leaving more than 300 people dead or missing.Lee Joon-seok, the Sewol's captain, was the first to abandon the ship.Another survivor, surnamed Park, recalled how Kim ordered passengers to leave their cabins, something the Sewol's captain failed to do.""Water was beginning to fill the boat and as soon as I came out, the boat capsized,"" he said.

Lee said that four people who were originally listed as having been passengers were not on the boat, while three that were not registered did get on the vessel. Originally, the fishing boat was chartered for two days and was scheduled to return to Chuja late Sunday.The official said that Kim Cheol-soo, the 46-year-old captain of the boat, was among the dead. Eight naval vessels, a Lynx helicopter and a P-3C maritime patrol aircraft have been dispatched to the site of the accident, according to a Navy official. In total, more than 50 naval and coast guard vessels have been mobilized in the search and rescue operations.            The Air Force has sent CN-235 transport planes and HH-47 helicopters to support the nighttime search operations.

Park has been briefed on the accident since Saturday night, it said.She also ordered the minister to provide exact information on the accident and the search operations to the families of those missing, relevant authorities as well as the general public. The public safety ministry said a planned bilateral meeting on disaster management with China scheduled for this week has been postponed indefinitely so the minister can focus on the fishing boat sinking.One of the survivors, surnamed Park, said the boat capsized ""in an instant"" due to rolling waves.""I was sleeping when the boat's engine went off and the captain told us to get out and water started to fill the boat,"" the 38-year-old said at the hospital. ""I was the last to come outside and as soon as I did, the boat capsized.""Park and the other survivors climbed on top of the capsized boat and held on for more than 10 hours as they waited to be rescued.Other passengers were initially with them, but they later disappeared from view after apparently falling off due to the strong waves, Park said.The coast guard said it has started an investigation into the boat's sinking. It said based on the testimony of survivors, the tragedy may have been caused by high waves or by the fishing vessel getting snarled in a rope of some kind.""A survivor said the boat may have been snagged by a rope, so authorities are trying to determine the exact cause,"" an official said. He said investigators will look at why the boarding registration was incorrect and why none of those on board wore life vests.The ministry, meanwhile, said in a press release that despite some media reports about the fishing boat not having been checked by authorities in the last eight years, such a claim is not true. ""The boat was launched in 2005 and in the last 10 years it was checked six times,"" it said.

She expressed gratitude to Xi for the constructive role Beijing has played in defusing tension.   The North's committee for the peaceful reunification of Korea said that South Korea should refrain from making comments that could dampen inter-Korean ties.   ""If the South's leader has basic political perspectives, (she) should be careful of making comments that can hamper inter-Korean relations at a sensitive time,"" the committee said in a statement, carried by the North's Korean Central News Agency.   ""Currently, inter-Korean ties are like standing on thin ice that can be easily broken,"" it said, adding that whether the bilateral relations can be improved hinges on Seoul's attitude.   Just one day before, the North denied Seoul's claims that its recent expression of regret over the land mine explosion near the inter-Korean border in early August is equal to an apology.   Last week long-strained Seoul-Pyongyang ties took a dramatic twist as the two sides reached a landmark deal on easing military tension and resuming a much-awaited reunion of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War.   The North expressed ""regret"" over the land mine explosion that left two South Korean soldiers seriously injured as part of the deal.

(Yonhap)In its Monday edition, the conservative daily carried the column accusing Korea’s diplomacy of being historically subservient to big powers -- China, Russia or Japan -- alternately, and of keeping the “bad heritage” of playing both the U.S. and China.Critics here perceived the column as reflecting the paper’s displeasure over the indictment last year of its former Seoul bureau chief, who was accused of libel after reporting on rumors that Park was staying with a man when the Sewol ferry disaster occurred last April.The Seoul government demanded through its embassy in Tokyo that the Sankei Shimbun retract the column and take steps to prevent a recurrence. But the newspaper reportedly rejected the demand. Cheong Wa Dae refused to handle the case itself, dismissing it as being unworthy of its attention.“We don’t even feel the need to comment on an article of a media outlet in connection with specific figures within Japan, who frequently make brazen claims about the past with their DNA of historical distortions and revisionism,” a Seoul official said, declining to be named.The controversial column came after President Park made a diplomatically tricky decision to attend China’s military parade on Thursday to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II -- a high-profile event to highlight China’s military ascent against the backdrop of its intensifying strategic competition with the U.S.Park’s decision was in tune with her “trustpolitik” initiative to seek regional cooperation in denuclearizing North Korea and promote the overall security in the region, Seoul officials explained. Apparently prioritizing its alliance with the U.S., Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe decided not to attend the event.The conservative paper’s column infuriated Koreans particularly because of its derogatory description of Korea’s diplomacy. “Toward the end of the Joseon era (1392-1910), (Korea) easily changed countries, to which it held flunkeyism, from (Chinese) Qing Dynasty to Japan, and then to Russia,” the column said. “(South) Korea that has inherited that DNA is employing a way (of diplomacy) reminiscent of the Joseon era.”The column’s comparison between Park and Empress Myeongseong, in particular, angered Koreans. The column stated that on the back of Russia’s support in 1895, the empress took power, but she was assassinated months later.The empress was murdered in 1895 by agents under Miura Goro, then the Japanese minister to Korea. Japan, then, thought of her as a major hurdle to its expansionist policy as she was in support of closer ties with Russia.Korea’s political circles exhibited rare unity in denouncing what they criticized as the “ahistorical” column.“The description in the column was a shameful portrait of Japan’s ultraconservatism. We are just left speechless by the brazen facade of its ultraconservatism,” said Kim Yong-woo, spokesperson of the ruling Saenuri Party.“The Sankei Shimbun and ultraconservatives in Japan would be forsaken by Japan’s conscientious people and the international community.”Kim Young-rok, spokesperson of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, also expressed his party’s displeasure.“Before the paper talked about toadyism or whatever, it should reflect on what Japan has done -- its pursuit of the expansion of collective self-defense to allow itself to be able to wage a war while leaning on the U.S.,” he said.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","assassinated by japan president ,century korean empress assassinated ,empress assassinated by japan ,korean empress assassinated by ,korean empress assassinated","['japanese', 'Sankei Shimbun', 'Park Geun', 'China', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Park Geun', 'Cabinet', 'Yonhap)In', 'Ko']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61252004  0.53969103

The incident took place at 11:46 a.m. on Sunday in Yeoncheon, Gyeonggi Province, during a scouting mission around an area where the Army intentionally planted mines to deter a possible intrusion by North Korean troops. The staff sergeant, who was wearing galoshes and other protective gear, suffered a slight fracture in his left heel, military officials said.  (Defense Ministry)Following a probe, the Joint Chiefs of Staff concluded that the detonated device was the South’s antipersonnel M-14, citing plastic remnants found near the scene, the testimonies of other team members and the way the mine inflicted wounds. “The mine zone was set up as a means to hamper the enemy’s incursion, and the injured officer apparently strayed from the narrow pathway while handling communications devices,” a JCS official told reporters on customary condition of anonymity. “He underwent surgery yesterday at the Armed Forces Capital Hospital (in Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province) and is expected to fully recover in two to three months.”Military officials were cautious about the disclosure of the incident and its timing. It took place while high-level inter-Korean talks were underway, as the sides locked horns over the Aug. 4 land mine blast in the DMZ. While the South pointed to the North as the culprit, the North denied responsibility, though it later conceded and displayed regret in a joint statement.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","an explosion last weekend ,army intentionally planted mines ,soldier injured in dmz ,explosion last weekend ,wounded in an explosion","['Army', 'south korean', 'the Demilitarized Zone', 'Yeoncheon , Gyeonggi Province', 'Army', 'north korean']",10,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.17831223 -0.24996856

The soldier is expected to recover from the wound, a JCS official said on the customary condition of anonymity.""The mine that exploded this time appears to be our military's M-14 anti-personnel mine,"" the official said, citing plastic debris found at the site, as well as testimonies and the impact of the explosion. ""The exact reason of the explosion is under examination."" An M-14 is a South Korea-used toe popper in a plastic case, intended to disable enemy targets.The JCS had embargoed press reports on the explosion, citing the then on-going high-level talks between South and North Korea.Two South Korean staff sergeants were severely injured when three land mines, which the South concluded were planted by the North, exploded in the southern half of the DMZ in Paju on Aug. 4. The explosion led to South Korea's resumption of anti-North propaganda warfare broadcasts along the border, as well as an exchange of artillery fire, between the countries last week.Amid heightened tensions, the countries reached a breakthrough deal to end hostilities at the border Tuesday.The DMZ is laced with more than 1 million anti-personnel and anti-tank land mines planted by South and North Korea during and after the 1950-53 Korean War.Since the bloody explosion earlier this month, front-line troops have been ordered to wear anti-mine boots and carry mine detectors on patrol missions.

The move came after a series of false conscription text messages and rumors were massively circulated after the North fired artillery across the border last Thursday. A 23-year-old college student surnamed Kim was arrested Thursday for spreading massive draft texts. The message said “discharged men aged between 21 and 33 will be drafted once the war is imminent,” adding that all should check their designated military camp’s website on the ministry’s homepage once the war declaration is confirmed. The message was sent under the name of the Defense Ministry. Kim reportedly claimed that it was a prank.  Earlier this month, another rumor was circulated saying that the recent landmine attack by the North in the Demilitarized Zone seriously injuring two South Korean soldiers was manipulated by the South. The police said such false messages are commonly spread when inter-Korean tensions are high.Most of the false rumor spreaders were found to be college students or office workers in their 20s, the authorities added.The police warned that those spreading false draft rumors can be punished with up to five years in prison or a fine of up to 10 million won ($8,400) for interfering with the Defense Ministry’s operations, officials said. Investigators also vowed that they would consider such an act as an attempt to benefit the enemy and sternly punish the spreaders in accordance with law. The police added that they would conduct online monitoring around the clock and promptly launch probes if any similarly groundless rumors are found.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","korean police vowed sunday ,arrested thursday for spreading ,kim was arrested thursday ,thursday for spreading massive ,south korean police vowed","['south korean', 'Koreas', 'Kim']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.1330061   0.51418048

Witnesses told local TV that the jet appeared to have crashed when it failed to pull out of a loop maneuver. West Sussex Police said seven people died at the scene and one patient with life-threatening injuries was taken to the hospital. Another 14 people were treated for minor injuries.News video and photographs showed a fireball erupting near trees and huge plumes of thick black smoke rising. A witness, Stephen Jones, told the BBC that the pilot had just begun his display. An explosion at the Shoreham Air Show, in Sussex, Britain, Aug. 22, after a fighter jet crashed. The 1950s Hawker Hunter crashed into several cars on a nearby road exploding in a huge fireball. Although the pilot was pulled alive from the wreckage, seven others have been confirmed dead. (Yonhap)“He’d gone up into a loop and as he was coming out of the loop I just thought, you’re too low, you’re too low, pull up. And he flew straight into the ground either on or very close to the A27, which runs past the airport,” Jones said.The force said all the deaths were believed to have occurred on the road, and no one on the airfield was believed injured. It was not known whether the pilot was able to eject.The road was closed in both directions Saturday.Crashes at British airshows are rare, but in 2007 the pilot of a World War II Hurricane died at the Shoreham Airshow after performing an unplanned barrel-roll.“We mustn’t rush to knee jerk reactions about the safety of airshows,” said Tim Loughton, a member of Britain’s parliament who represents Shoreham. “This is an airshow that’s been going for 26 years, only the second time there’s been any serious accident, and the first time that spectators and people on the ground have been affected, bad though that is.” (AP)","saturday killing seven people ,airshow crashed into busy ,crashed saturday afternoon witnesses ,british airshow crashed into ,road saturday killing seven","['british', 'Hawker Hunter', 'Brighton', 'England']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.04327803  0.19479901

Last October, North Korea fired artillery at Yeoncheon to shoot down balloons carrying propaganda leaflets across the border. South Korea also returned fire. No casualties were reported.South Korea’s Navy issued an order Friday to ban fishing ships from leaving their harbor at Yeonpyeongdo, Daecheongdo and Baengnyeongdo islands located close to the border. Ships from Ganghwado Island are allowed to catch fish after the ban was lifted earlier Friday.The government decided to close down cross-border tourist attractions, mostly observatories that allows visitors a rare opportunity to see the reclusive regime. It was the first shutdown since North Korea’s shelling of Yeonpyeongdo Island in 2010. Concerns also grew over the safety of 924 South Korean citizens visiting or working in North Korean territory.The Ministry of Unification said 840 people were staying at the North’s border town of Gaeseong and 83 people were in Pyongyang to attend an international soccer match. Officials said Friday afternoon that they have not yet decided whether to bring them back to the South.Meanwhile, South Koreans who live far away from the border also expressed fears over a possible military clash between the two Koreas. Song Ji-yeon, a 31-year-old office worker in southern Seoul, said that the fear is much stronger this time because it was an artillery attack striking South Korean soil. “Compared to the previous attack by North Korea on Yeonpyeongdo Island, I think the latest artillery shelling seem to be much more threatening. What happened at Yeonpyeongdo comes off as an incident from a remote area, whereas the incident literally involves artillery literally being fired at us across the DMZ,” said Song. Mindful of mounting public fear, South Korea’s Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn on Friday urged Cabinet members to “prioritize” public safety and directed them to check on safety facilities in cross-border villages. “The government’s priority should be securing public safety. While preventing the public from being caught up with fear unnecessarily, I need Cabinet members to do their utmost to ensure the safety of those living in cross-border towns and maintain robust work ethics,” Hwang said.

Shortly after detection, the Army discharged a 155-milimeter self-propelled gun at 5:04 p.m. The Army reported no damage. Casualties in the North were not immediately known.Coincidentally with the exchange of fire, Pyongyang sent two separate letters to the South, calling for a withdrawal of the loudspeakers and threatening military action.In the letter sent from the General Staff of the North Korean People’s Army to South Korea’s Defense Ministry through a border telephone channel at around 4:50 p.m., Pyongyang warned that it would initiate “military action” unless Seoul stops the propaganda broadcasts within 48 hours from 5 p.m.In a separate letter by Kim Yang-gon, director of the United Front Department in charge of cross-border affairs, to National Security Office chief Kim Kwan-jin, Pyongyang said the broadcasts constitute a “declaration of war” but it is willing to resolve the current situation and “open a way out for the improvement of the relationship.” Seoul said it has no plan to dismantle the speakers at this point. “The letter, which coincided with the provocation against us, was most likely to be intended to cover up the fact that the aggravated situation resulted from North Korea’s land mine provocation,” the Unification Ministry said in a statement. “We will solidly take measures under the principle that the government sternly responds to North Korea’s wrong behavior.”This undated image shows South Korean soldiers conducting live fire drills. (Yonhap)President Park Geun-hye convened an emergency meeting of the presidential National Security Council to examine the incident and formulate follow-up steps. The government also released an evacuation order for some residents of Yeoncheon, Paju, Ganghwado Island and other border areas.The North’s anti-aircraft gun ammunition appeared to have hit an uninhabited hill located several kilometers away from a loudspeaker set, an official at Seoul’s Defense Ministry said. Yet the North did not appear to have aimed at the equipment, he noted, without elaborating. “We detected signs that the North Korean military staged two rounds of firearm provocation in the southern part of the Military Demarcation Line, and fired dozens of rounds of a 155-millimeter self-propelled gun as warning shots,” Joint Chief of Staff spokesman Col. Jeon Ha-kyu said at a news briefing. “Our military immediately raised our security posture to the top-notch, while closely monitoring the North Korean military’s movement and maintaining full readiness to respond robustly and firmly to any further provocation.” Last week, the South Korean military restarted the broadcasts in the Demilitarized Zone, closing an 11-year hiatus, after the JCS found that the North was behind the Aug. 4 explosion of land mines that inflicted serious wounds on two soldiers. Flatly denying its responsibility, the North Korean military urged to remove the loudspeakers in its “public warning” last Saturday, threatening “indiscriminate strikes” if its demand was not met.The North, for its part, has resumed its own propaganda program in the area and tightened vigilance against the South. The Rodong Sinmun, the North’s ruling Workers’ Party’s mouthpiece, called the border broadcasts and anti-Pyongyang leaflet sprayings a “prelude to war” and “most explicit plot for psychological warfare.”Pyongyang has also been churning out military threats against the ongoing Ulchi Freedom Guardian, a major annual drill by South Korea and the U.S. “This year’s UFG exercise implies a stringency that cannot be overlooked in light of various unusual signs that have recently emerged around the Military Demarcation Line,” the paper said Tuesday. Yet tension is set to flare up across the border as Defense Minister Han Min-koo vowed to expand the broadcasts “to full-scale.” During a parliamentary session last week, he said that the program was airing at four spots, and anti-Pyongyang leaflets and propaganda electronic boards are other options being considered as next retaliatory steps. The minister has also raised the possibility of another major provocation timed for the anniversary of the founding of the Workers’ Party in October.The loudspeakers were taken down in 2004 as a result of inter-Korean military dialogue. They were reinstalled at 11 places along the MDL following the North’s 2010 fatal attack on the corvette Cheonan, which led Pyongyang to threaten to shoot them down, but had since been idle. With the absolute majority of North Koreans remaining isolated from the outside world, the broadcasts have proved to be a rare source for news of the execution and purge of elite military executives and other power struggles within the top echelons, information about free democracy and other regional and global issues, along with weather forecasts and music. Many defectors resettled in South Korea have testified that they had come to hear first about the South through the broadcasts, which can travel as far as 10 kilometers.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","traded fire on thursday ,two koreas traded fire ,fire on thursday ,fire on thursday after ,koreas trade fire near","['Koreas', 'Yeoncheon County', 'Gyeonggi Province']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5049051   0.44573361

The postings included those who claimed the U.S. Embassy in China had warned people to avoid exposure to the rain as sodium cyanide has leaked into the air. On Sunday, Beijing news outlets reported that Chinese officials had discovered about 700 tons of sodium cyanide was stored at the explosion site, stoking public concerns over the possible leak due to the explosions. Water-soluble solid sodium cyanide forms hydrogen cyanide if treated with acid. The exposure to hydrogen cyanide can cause burns, dermatitis, headaches and even death. The sudden issuance of the ultrafine dust alert over the weekend in Korea added fuel to the rumors that the country would be hit by the toxic chemicals from China. On Sunday morning, the ultrafine dust advisory was raised in Seoul and Incheon for over six hours as the hourly average ultrafine dust concentration exceeded 120 micrograms per cubic meter for more than two hours. The alert was lifted later in the afternoon. The Environment Ministry, however, said the sodium cyanide spreading to Korea is geographically nearly impossible. “Tianjin is 800 kilometers away from Seoul, which is too far to be affected,” said the ministry. Experts also played down the concerns, citing the characteristics of the toxic substance. “Sodium cyanide is naturally heavier than air. Therefore, it’s nearly impossible to spread through the wind over hundreds of kilometers,” chemistry professor Lee Chong-soon at Yeungnam University told The Korea Herald. The weather data of the blast day also showed little chance of it spreading. “On Aug. 12, the wind of the concerned region headed from south to southwest, according to the data. This indicates that the wind actually blew in the opposite direction of the peninsula,” said Korea Meteorological Agency officials. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Public Safety and Security vowed to carry out an emergency safety inspection on a number of factories and ports that deal with harmful chemical substances as part of its efforts to prevent similar accidents and alleviate public concerns. The safety inspections will be conducted with municipal firefighting departments and four ministries, including the Environment Ministry and Labor and Employment Ministry, the authorities said. It will also hold a group meeting Thursday to review the preventive measures and accident response manuals, they added.

""I was very surprised and heartbroken upon hearing the news of your injuries,"" Park was quoted by the official as telling Kim on the phone Saturday. Kim lost one leg in the explosion. The president pledged the government's best support for the recovery and rehabilitation of the wounded soldiers, also extolling the courage they have shown during and after the explosion, according to the official.Kim promised Park a quick recovery, the official also said.Calling Staff Sgt. Hah, who lost both legs, Park said, ""You and other service members have greatly touched the heart of the public.It was an unfortunate provocation that should not have happened."" Park's message came as military tension is escalating at the border over the attack. North Korea denied its involvement in the explosion, threatening to shoot down loudspeakers on the border that the South Korean military is using for propaganda warfare against the North as a retaliation measure. On Monday, Park called on the military to maintain tighter combat readiness against North Korea and denounced the recent mine explosion as a ""clear military provocation that was intended to kill or injure our soldiers.""

The injury left him paralyzed from the waist down. “The supervisor at the workplace should have been aware of the danger that the truck could damage a person,” the court said, citing the Korean supervisor‘s “negligence of duty.”But the South Korean government should compensate the victim on behalf of the boss, hired by the U.S. military, in accordance with the Status of Forces Agreement signed between South Korea and the U.S. in 1966, it said.The court also acknowledged the victim’s negligence, too, saying that the government doesn‘t have to fully compensate the victim. The authorities were ordered to pay 75 percent of the money the man initially claimed.The verdict is the latest addition to a series of rulings that held the South Korean government accountable for the misdeeds or violations of domestic law by U.S. soldiers. Earlier in July, the court ruled that the government should compensate a Korean citizen injured in a traffic accident caused by a U.S. corporal driving a five-ton army truck in Suwon in 2011.SOFA stipulates that South Korea is responsible for compensating third parties who suffer damages caused by U.S troops stationed here. Around 28,500 U.S. soldiers are stationed in South Korea, where the U.S. military has maintained a large presence to deter North Korean aggression since the 1950-53 Korean War. The war ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty, leaving the two Koreas technically still at war. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","injured base worker seoul ,korea to pay injured ,compensate korean citizen paralyzed ,pay injured base worker ,korean citizen paralyzed from","['Seoul', 'south korean', 'korean', 'U.S.', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'U.S.', 'Gye']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.1724214  -0.30150002

Over 1.2 million are being raised in the two-hectare fish farm in the coastal city. The dead fish were reported four days after the National Fisheries Research and Development Institute issued a red tide warning in the coast around Geoje and Goheung-gun in South Jeolla Province. This was the first red tide warning issued across the country this year. The red tide, which is a type of algal bloom, produces natural toxins and depletes dissolved oxygen, killing the fish. It commonly occurs in coastal areas. A warning is raised when the red tide occurs with a radius of over 5 kilometers and the concentration of cochlodinium exceeding 1,000 cells per milliliter. The government issues a red tide advisory when readings over 300 cells per milliliter are detected with a radius of 2 to 5 kilometers. Chochlodinium, the culprit of the red tide, is known to proliferate in the sea at temperatures over 25 degrees Celsius. The rising water temperature contributed to the red tide growth, the NFRD said. According to the organization, the average water temperature of the Korean coast has risen by 1.29 degrees Celsius over the past four decades. The warning was also raised in the coastal city of Yeosu, South Jeolla Province on Thursday last week. About 5.5 million fish are being raised in a 197-hectare fish farm in Yeosu, which is equivalent to 170 billion won ($144 million) of property. Last year, over 43,000 fish in Yeosu died to red tide, causing 70 million won in losses, officials said. “The level of the red tide is falling thanks to the cloudy weather, but it can go up again once the sun gets stronger,” the Yeosu City Government said. Red tide concerns have been escalating as it has been seen expanding to the East Sea. On Saturday, the NFRD issued a red tide advisory in the coastal areas of Gyeongju and Pohang in North Gyeongsang Province. As part of efforts to eliminate the algal bloom, municipalities have been spraying red clay in coastal waters with hundreds of ships. The red clay is known to soak up the minerals and minute plankton, thereby sinking the red tide algae toward the bottom of the sea. They have also used the propellers of fishing boats to deconcentrate the red tide.

Three wooden-box landmines, supposedly buried by North Korea, exploded on the South Korean side of the DMZ as the soldiers stepped on them during a routine patrol.The statement came 10 days after the accident and four days after South Korea designated Pyongyang responsible.""If our army really needs to achieve a military purpose, we would have used strong firearms, and not three units of mines,"" the Korean statement said.""(Seoul) should bring forth a video that can prove (Pyongyang was behind the explosion),"" it continued. ""If they have none, they shall not speak of the North-led provocations.""""Only disgrace of fabrication shall grow for Park Geun-hye and her groups as South Korea speaks more of these groundless North-led provocations,"" it added.After the mine blast, the South Korean military immediately launched a propaganda broadcasting campaign at the border, blasting out anti-Pyongyang messages and outside news to be heard by North Korean soldiers and border residents.North Korea also expressed discontent against the move through the latest statement, adding South Korea is blaming Pyongyang to justify such actions.

Police said it didn't find any leakage of personal data of the patients as the North's aim seems to be causing functional disorder rather than siphoning private information. While probing a separate case in March, police found some leaked data from Hauri, a company that provides vaccine programs to computer servers, including ones related to the country's Defense Ministry.""The North seems to have found some weak points in the vaccine program Hauri provides and targeted the hospital, which uses the program,"" an official from the NPA said.Police expressed strong suspicion that the North conducted the attack on the grounds that the Internet Protocol (IP) address where the attack came from coincided with the one from Pyeongyang that launched a cyberattack on the South's major banks and financial institutes in March 2013. ""We are still investigating on whether there are other victims attacked,"" the official added.

165,165,[REPORTER'S COLUMN] More soul-searching needed in wake of DMZ mine blasts,"South Korea would be acting the way North Korea would have intended by directly taking staunch retaliation against last week’s land mine incident, Staff Sgt. Kim Jeong-won, one of the two bedridden frontline soldiers injured in the blast, said in a media interview earlier this week.An army soldier engages in a mission to detect minds near the inter-Korean border on Wednesday.

Kim Jeong-won, one of the two bedridden frontline soldiers injured in the blast, said in a media interview earlier this week.An army soldier engages in a mission to detect minds near the inter-Korean border on Wednesday. (Yonhap)Indeed, what Seoul’s defense authorities have shown to the public in the wake of the Aug. 4 incident is a flurry of emotion-laden pledges to “retaliate” and strengthen border defense, which includes resuming loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts and installing camera-equipped drones.Defense Minister Han Min-koo ordered the military to respond “bravely and unsparingly” if provoked, with his ministry upbraiding the North for violating the Armistice Agreement and vowing to make it “pay dearly” for the blast.But what seems to be missing in Seoul’s reaction is deep soul-searching regarding the seemingly porous frontline defense that again allowed the unpredictable state to catch Seoul’s defense establishment off guard and launch what could have been a deadly attack.This discussion, of course, is by far subsequent to nationwide and international condemnation and warning against North Korea, which once again resorted to provocation in violation of the cease-fire treaty, a grave challenge against the stability of the Korean Peninsula. However, repeated vows of retaliation seem to be routine practice for the South Korean military, which has come under fire for having failed to fend off North Korea’s apparently periodic provocations, including the two deadly attacks in 2010 that killed 48 South Korean troops and two civilians.Seoul’s harsher rhetoric against Pyongyang could even be seen by critics as a move to divert public attention from its sore spots and circumvent the emerging public criticism that “the better-equipped South once again was dealt a blow by the ill-equipped North.”What’s fortunate is, of course, that no fatalities occurred, thanks to the South Korean troop who took proper emergency response steps, although the two soldiers suffered indelible physical and mental scars.Rather than focusing on how to outdo the North in the game of provocation, the South Korean military needs to ask itself fundamental questions: Why has the defense been porous? How can it prevent a recurrence? Has it ever been complacent? Are there other possible ways of future North Korean provocations?Long embroiled in seemingly ceaseless disputes over defense industry corruption, inter-service rivalries and animosities “among friendly forces,” which stem from abuses in the barracks, the military should really think about how it can reinforce itself -- and do so strongly enough to deter the evolving North Korean provocations. As the Seoul government dealt with the land mine incident, it has also revealed what appears to be a lack of inter-agency coordination. The land mine explosions took place last Tuesday. A day later, Seoul’s Unification Ministry proposed working-level government talks with the North to discuss a range of pending issues. All the while, the investigation was ongoing to determine whether the North was to blame for the incident.Seoul officials said that the dialogue proposal was made as nothing had been determined of the explosion at the time. But critics argue that it illustrates a lack of coordination between the ministries of defense and unification, though Seoul may want to say it was a case of a two-track approach employing dialogue and a stern response to the North’s provocations and nuclear development.The most crucial virtues for a country’s external policy, particularly when dealing with an unpredictable partner, should be caution and prudence, as international relations pundits routinely say. These virtues should not be missing in the implementation of Seoul’s policy toward Pyongyang.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","last week land mine ,korean border on wednesday ,mine blasts south korea ,bedridden frontline soldiers injured ,week an army soldier","['South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Sgt', 'Kim Jeong - won', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59129333  0.36056912

Kim Jung-hoon of the ruling Saenuri Party released the report based on data submitted to the National Assembly by the Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs.  A total of 133 suits were filed by descendants of pro-Japan collaborators against the state as of July 2015, according to the data. Of the total, 119 cases were won by the government.   The courts ruled in favor of the descendants in 14 other cases as the real estate in question had already been sold to third parties.  The struggle over this still-delicate chapter of modern history was first settled under the former Roh Moo-hyun administration, which passed a law in 2005 that allowed the seizure of the property in question.  The special law on the state ownership of property owned by pro-Japanese collaborators stipulates that the government can seize assets acquired by or given to Koreans who supported Japan during the colonial period and their descendents.  In 2011, the Constitutional Court ruled that the law is constitutional, saying it is necessary to clear away remnants of the bitter period.  The largest piece of real estate confiscated by the state was inherited by descendents of former Korean politician Min Byung-suk, according to the data. Min received a title of nobility from Japan for his contribution to the country's annexation of Korea in 1910.  The Supreme Court in 2013 ruled in favor of the state, saying that the assets were a reward for his collaboration and that the Constitutional Court also ruled that the law is constitutional.

It also warned that the North would “pay dearly” for the provocation.But Pyongyang is likely to call it an accident and deny its responsibility, Seoul officials said.Seoul officials believe that the “land mine provocation” appears to be Pyongyang’s retaliation against a South Korean civic group, which floated balloons carrying 100,000 anti-North Korea leaflets toward the North from Cheolwon, Gangwon Province, on July 31.The leaflets listed names of North Korean officials “to be executed after reunification,” which included North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, his wife Lee Sol-ju and Hwang Pyong-so, the director of the North Korean military’s General Political Bureau.In response to the dissemination of the leaflets, the North warned of “merciless physical response” and criticized the Seoul government for not preventing civic activists from conducting what it calls a “grave provocation” against it.The upcoming Ulchi Freedom Guardian military drills between South Korea and the U.S. are also likely to infuriate the communist regime, which sees the drills as a “rehearsal for a nuclear war of invasion” against it.As if to highlight its unwillingness to mend fences with the South, Pyongyang has repeatedly rejected Seoul’s calls for government talks.Last Wednesday, Seoul’s Unification Ministry made an offer of official talks to discuss “issues of mutual concern,” but the North refused. The ministry expressed regret over the North’s rejection.“We delivered our intention for talks and gave enough time for the North to consider our offer. But the North did not even receive the offer. We express our regret over the fact that the North did not show even a basic level of courtesy to the South by not accepting the request,” said ministry spokesperson Jeong Joon-hee.“This (the North’s rejection) calls into question the North’s will to deal with inter-Korean issues through dialogue and improve cross-border ties.”The North also spurned the request by Lee Hee-ho, the widow of former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, to meet with North Korean leader Kim during her four-day trip to Pyongyang last week.A spike in inter-Korean tensions came as Pyongyang is expected to engage in provocative acts such as a long-range rocket launch around Oct. 10, the 70th anniversary of the foundation of its Workers’ Party. The North was spotted completing a construction project to enhance the missile launch pad in the North’s northwestern town of Dongchang-ri. Seoul officials have been closely watching the site though there are not yet any clear signs of an imminent missile launch.Disregarding Seoul’s concerns over its missile launch, the North said last week that its launch of a “satellite” is a “matter of sovereignty.” During a news conference on the sidelines of ASEAN-related meetings in Malaysia, the North’s delegation also threatened to carry out additional nuclear tests depending on the “U.S.’ attitude.”The news conference was arranged as Seoul’s Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se stepped up diplomacy during the ASEAN forums to bring global attention to the problem of North Korea’s possible provocations and its nuclear development.Spurning Seoul’s calls for dialogue, the North appears to be not in desperate need of outside assistance. The latest report of the U.S.’ Congressional Research Service on North Korea noted that the reclusive state’s economic conditions appear to be improving. It said that since early 2015, reports have come in about “modest economic growth” in the North.It also pointed out that the reforms that appear to apply market principles to some sectors of North Korean business and agriculture, have created opportunities for economic growth in the impoverished state.

The explosion severed the legs of two staff sergeants.  North Korean wooden-box mines were the cause of the blast, said Army Brig. Gen. Ahn Young-ho, who headed a joint probe into the incident, referring to mine debris found in the site.   ""It is clear the enemy has deliberately laid the mines with an intention to inflict harm on our operational forces,"" Ahn said. ""The explosives are clearly wooden-box mines that the North Korean army is using.""  The design and types of the wood cases, three spring parts and the Trinitrotoluene explosive material, or TNT, found at the explosion site were cited as evidence supporting the conclusion.  The North Korean plot may be intended to derail the upcoming Ulchi Freedom Guardian, the annual war simulation exercise scheduled to take place next week between South Korea and the U.S. to prepare for a potential incursion by North Korea, an official at the Joint Chiefs of Staff said.  ""It seems to be aimed at interrupting the scheduled implementation of UFG by obscuring who did the provocation and spurring discord inside South Korea over it,"" the JCS official said.  The Paju border area is also where the two Koreas exchanged machine gun rounds last October after South Korean activists launched anti-Pyongyang propaganda leaflets into the North Korean side.   He likened the latest blast to the North's deadly torpedoing of the South Korean Navy Corvette Cheonan in March 2010. North Korea has not yet accepted responsibility for the torpedo attack, despite much evidence showing otherwise.  A couple of North Korean soldiers may have secretly crossed the military demarcation line and come 440 meters further south to bury the mines around a South Korea Army-guarded gate that opens to the DMZ, possibly between July 26 and Aug. 1, the Army brigade general said.  The JCS vowed to retaliate against the North Korean provocation, saying in its statement that ""Our military will make North Korea pay the equally pitiless penalty for their provocations.""   On Monday, the United Nations Command also released the conclusion of its special investigation, blaming the North for the mine explosion.   ""The UNC condemns these violations of the Armistice Agreement, and will call for a general officer level-dialogue with the Korean People's Army,"" the UNC said in a statement without elaborating on when the proposal will be made.The DMZ is a four kilometer-wide arms-free buffer running between the two countries which have been under a ceasefire since the 1950-53 Korean War. In actuality, the width is less than 4 km as the countries' troops moved closer to the demarcation line which bisects the DMZ as part of tighter vigilance operations.   The accident site had previously been a mine-free zone where South Korean troops conduct regular search missions and there's no possibility of the North Korean mines being washed up there, the army official said, backing up the conclusion of the probe.  The suspected mine laying by North Koreans, however, was not detected during the South Korean military's regular surveillance operations possibly due to heavy fog seen in the area recently as well as heavy forest blocking the view during the summer, he said.  Following the explosion, the JCS has ordered heightened war-readiness positions among the servicemen and issued caution over the possibility of more mines being buried than the three that went off last week, military sources said.  In his capacity as the commander of the United Nations Command, the U.S. Forces Korea Commander Gen. Curtis M. Scaparrotti has also endorsed the recent conclusion during a recent telephone call with JCS Chairman Adm. Choi Yoon-hee, the sources said.  It was the first explosion by North Korea-laid explosives within the heavily-fortified DMZ since similar incidents took place in the mid-1960s, possibly a violation of the armistice which prohibits military action in the buffer zone.

Located at Jamsil, the 5-meter-deep lake is artificially made with its lakebed composed of well-drained silty sand.  The lake leak coincided with the construction around the region, and the isotope probe also showed that the lake water was highly similar to the leaked underground water from the Lotte World Tower and Subway Line No. 9, officials said. The water flow also changed direction to those two sites after the construction began, they added. The city, however, projected that the water level will rise again once the construction of the Lotte skyscraper and the subway wraps up. Several sinkholes in Jamsil were found to be not related with the lake leak, they added. As part of its efforts to prevent further lake leakage, the city vowed to run a lake monitoring team and obligate construction workers to report it immediately should an underground water leak be spotted, the authorities said.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","seoul lake leakage ,seoul lake leakage report ,caused seoul lake leakage ,lake leak that recently ,subway caused seoul lake","['Seoul', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Lotte World Tower', 'Songpa']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22239982  0.22823152

According to the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over 610 people suffered from heatstroke this year, with half of them being diagnosed between July 26 and Aug. 1. It showed a 7.3 percentage point jump compared to the week before. Only one related death was reported a year before. A pedestrian keeps out of the sun with a plastic fan as she passes by a sunflower in Daegu, Tuesday. (Yonhap)The sunstroke figure includes anyone who visited the emergency room due to heat exhaustion, heatstroke or heat convulsions. The elderly accounted for 60 percent of those hospitalized. Men took up 74 percent of the total. More than 80 percent of the sunstroke cases took place outdoors.On Tuesday, heat wave warnings were raised in the southern part of the country and Gangwon Province with temperatures in the region reaching as high as 35 degrees Celsius. The heat wave advisory was also issued in some cities in Gyeonggi Province and the Chungcheong region as the temperature hit 33 degrees Celsius. The Korea Meteorological Agency said the heat wave would continue throughout the week along with tropical nights. Seoul’s daytime temperature may reach 33 degrees Celsius by the end of the week, with a possibility of a heat wave advisory issuance, it said.In a separate report, Incheon was found to be the most vulnerable city to the sweltering heat.The National Institute of Meteorological Research said in its study that Incheon started to report deaths from sunstroke at the lowest temperature among the regions, followed by Seoul and Daejeon. The death toll from heatstroke started to rise as the temperatures started to reach 28 degrees Celsius on average in the cities.Southern areas such as Busan and Daegu, on the other hand, reported deaths from sunstroke when the temperature reached 30 degrees Celsius on average.Cities with lower temperatures in general are more vulnerable to heat waves, the report said.“For Daegu, the city surrounded by mountains experiences high temperatures more frequently than other cities. Daegu seems to have socially and culturally adapted more to the heat,” the institute said. The study analyzed city’s heat wave adaptation level between 1991 and 2010 based on various factors such as the death toll, population composition, medical service quality and economic and environmental factors. The heat has also been affecting livestock as the farmers reported increasing deaths.According to insurance company NongHyup Property and Causality Insurance Co., over 1.23 million livestock were killed by the high temperature between June 28 and Aug. 2. Of the dead, chickens took the largest share with about 1.2 million, followed by ducks and pigs, with some 23,000 and 420, respectively. The compensation cost is expected to reach a record high of around 3.2 billion won ($2.7 million) this year since the company introduced heat wave insurance in 2012, the firm said.

Lim Hyeon-soo (Rim Hyon-su), 60, of Light Korean Presbyterian Church near Toronto was detained after entering the North via China on a humanitarian mission in late January.Pyongyang's Korean Central News Agency accused him of acting as ""a servant of the U.S. imperialists and South Korean puppet group.""""He malignantly hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership and social system of the DPRK and resorted to subversive plots and activities in a sinister bid to build a religious state in the DPRK while frequenting it under the guise of 'humanitarian aid' and 'free donation' over the past 18 years,"" KCNA said.""He confessed to all his crimes in the course of the investigation by the competent organ,"" it said.KCNA quoted the pastor as saying that he delivered a ""report on what is going on in North Korea before tens of thousands of South Koreans and overseas Koreans at a sermon on Sundays at my church and during preaching tours of more than 20 countries including Canada, the U.S., south Korea, Japan and Brazil."" ""Each time I malignantly slandered the dignity and social system of the DPRK,"" he was quoted as saying.The pastor also confessed that he met with the U.S. ambassador to Mongolia in 1996 and discussed the issue of helping more than 500 North Korean defectors go to South Korea via Mongolia every year, according to KCNA.He also told the news conference that he received a GPS device from a Korean American named Dennis Kim and handed it to a Korean Chinese broker helping North Koreans defect from their communist homeland, KCNA said.The Unification Ministry said that it is ""improper"" for North Korea to detain the pastor for charges of what the North calls ""subversive plots.""""In terms of four South Korean nationals detained in the North, it is not easy to figure out their whereabouts,"" Jeong Joon-hee, the ministry spokesman, said in a regular press briefing on Friday.""The government is making efforts via diplomatic channel.""Seoul has called on Pyongyang to set free the four South Koreans detained in North Korea including a New York University student and missionary Kim Jung-wook.Christian missionaries have often been detained in the North.Kenneth Bae, one such missionary, was released in November after about two years of detention in the communist nation.

She went into the memorial and protested the banner, slapping the 44-year-old father of one of the victims in the process.According to a local news report, the woman also destroyed a model of the Sewol ferry at the memorial, saying that the death of the students was “their fate.”On April 16, 2014, the ferry capsized off the coast of South Korea’s southwestern island of Jindo. The accident left 304 dead or missing, 250 of whom were students of Danwon High School in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province.The government was severely criticized by the public for the lackluster rescue operations, which led to the disbandment of the Coast Guard and reshuffling of the government’s safety-related branches.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","year ferry sinking police ,ferry sinking police ,wednesday for assaulting bereaved ,woman assaults sewol victim ,last year ferry sinking","['Park', 'Gwanghwamun', 'Seoul', 'Ansan Danwon Police']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49672386 -0.0223101

Their marriage, however, reportedly was not permitted according to the tradition of their country as they came from two different tribes. Both sides of their families began to threaten them, to a degree at which the couple were forced to go in hiding, the reports said.One of the couple, who had been residing in Korea for job opportunities, eventually filed for refugee status in 2012, saying they could be murdered by their families if they returned home, and that the Pakistani government could not provide them any protection.But the immigration office turned down the request the following year, saying there was not enough basis to deem that the couple was suffering from fear on grounds that they could be subject to persecution based on the refugee convention, and that their problem involved family objections.The 1951 Refugee Convention states that a refugee is someone who, “owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.”The court also sided with immigration, saying that the couple’s case did not fulfill the refugee conditions and the Pakistani system had due process against crimes.","court wednesday denied refugee ,the seoul authorities denial ,denies asylum for pakistan ,wednesday denied refugee status ,court denies asylum for","['south korean', 'pakistani', 'the Seoul High Court', 'Seoul']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.24954137  0.27305648

After receiving a request for an investigation from the White House, police arrested the man at his home in Seoul on July 14. On Lee's confiscated laptop, records of access to the homepage were found, as well as a draft of the letter and a screen capture taken as he allegedly wrote the letter on the website, the release said.Lee denies the charge that he wrote the letter and seems to have no accomplices, the release said.After creating their profile, police concluded that Lee lived in seclusion and spent most of his time surfing the Internet, as he failed to find a job after graduating from university.Lippert was attacked with a knife at a breakfast function in Seoul on March 5, which left him with deep gashes on his face and arm that needed more than 80 stitches.Kim Ki-jong, who attacked the envoy, is standing trial over allegations of violence against a foreign envoy, attempted murder, business obstruction and sympathizing with North Korea in violation of the National Security Law.

In the lawsuit filed with the Supreme Court of the State of New York on Thursday, Korean Air purser Park Chang-jin sought compensation for emotional and physical damages against former vice president Cho Hyun-ah for last year's in-flight commotion widely known as the nut rage incident, according to the sources. On Dec. 5, Cho forced Park to disembark from an Incheon-bound flight in New York, and after she reportedly threw a fit over some macadamia nuts that were not served to her liking.The latest litigation comes several months after Kim Do-hee, another flight attendant from the incident, filed a similar suit against both Cho and Korean Air at the New York court. Cho's legal representatives have asked the U.S. court to dismiss Kim's suit for the sake of efficiency, arguing that the case will be better handled at a South Korean court for practical reasons, and also said they are planning to take similar action against Park's lawsuit. Last month, the Seoul High Court sentenced Cho to 10 months in prison but suspended the term for two years for changing the aircraft's flight route at the time when she forced off Park the plane. Prosecutors said they have submitted an appeal to have the court's decision reversed.

The 17-year-old had been hiding under a large parasol on a beach in Boryeong, South Chungcheong Province, and took pictures of the woman swimming in the ocean wearing a swimsuit using his phone’s zoom feature. The teen was caught by one of the police officers on patrol at the time. But the victim, an 18-year-old student, had no idea that she had been observed and photographed without her consent. Among some 940 crimes that have occurred on beaches in the summer over the last three years, sex crimes, including filming or taking pictures of someone’s body without their consent, were the third most frequent category, following physical assaults and thefts.It is also linked to increasing criminal cases that involve using smart devices in South Korea. The number of reported sexual harassment cases using smartphones has increased dramatically since 2009, from about 800 to 4,800 in 2013. Among some 940 crime cases that have occurred on beaches in the summer over the last three years, sex crimes, including filming or taking pictures of someone’s body parts without consent, were the third most frequent violation, following physical assaults and thefts. (Yonhap)To tackle the issue that has raised serious concerns, the National Police Agency and the Gender Equality Ministry have hired 1,400 public servants and police officers to monitor the public and launch crackdowns on the specific crime on 93 beaches nationwide starting this month. “Sexual harassment cases using smartphones can happen anywhere, especially in public places including the subway trains,” said Choi Su-yeong, deputy director of the women’s rights division at Gender Equality Ministry. “But it’s especially common on beaches in the summer because many wear swimsuits in such crowded places.”Not all cases of sexual harassment at summer beaches involve smartphones, according to Choi. Many of the reported cases involve an offender touching someone’s body part without consent in the water, pretending he or she is swimming. A number of people have been arrested for luring tourists to illegal brothels and bars that offer sexual services near the beaches.Under the current Korean law, taking pictures of another person’s body parts which “may cause any sexual stimulus or shame, against the latter’s will by using a camera or other similar mechanism” can be punished by imprisonment of a maximum period of five years or a fine up to 10 million won ($8,600). Those who sell, distribute, lease or openly screen such pictures can also face the same punishment.Yet the specific crime is difficult to crack down on, mostly because it’s a form of voyeurism where the subject of the violation is very often unaware of being harassed, said Choi Jeong-sook, a police officer who currently serves in Busan in charge of monitoring the Haeundae beach. Many smartphone applications, including those that enable the users to take pictures without a shutter sound, also make it easier for voyeurs to commit their crime. “The police are doing the best we can to monitor all visitors and find potential offenders,” she told The Korea Herald. “But I’m sure (the police crackdown) has its limits. And many cases end up not being reported because victims just don’t’ know that they have been harassed at all.”The current definition of the particular crime also needs to be more specific, another police officer who wanted to remain anonymous said. “What does it really mean by ‘body parts which may cause any sexual stimulus or shame’? That can be different for everyone,” she said. “And it’s easy for offenders to get away with the crime by saying, ‘I was just taking pictures of the beach and this person just happened to be in it.’”South Korea is one of the world’s most wired countries, with 80 percent of its population owning smartphones as of last year. The number of smartphone users doubled to 40 million from 2011 to 2014.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","beach sexual harassment ,2013 police arrested high ,police arrested high school ,2013 police arrested ,arrested high school student","['Boryeong', 'South Chungcheong Province']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3696647  -0.13639377

""It was a mistake on my part. But there is nothing to be worried about over any of my actions.""  Lim also apologized to his colleagues and added, ""I hope (the leadership) will manage the NIS so that all the employees can carry out their operations without hesitation.""  The will was written on three sheets of legal paper. The contents pertaining to the NIS were written on one page. The other two pages were mostly Lim's apologies to his family, and his relatives refused to make those parts public, according to police.  Investigators said there was a piece of burnt coal inside Lim's car, but there were no signs of forced entry or any suspicious marks on his body, making it likely that the 45-year-old took his own life. An autopsy on Lim will be performed Sunday.  The apparent suicide and the note are expected to further stoke the controversy surrounding where and how the NIS used the hacking program it bought from an Italian company in 2012.  The NIS has so far said the program, which uses Remote Control System technology, allows hackers to manipulate and track smartphones and computers by installing spyware.  It said the system can hack 20 mobile phones simultaneously, making it ideal for eavesdropping.  The NIS emphasized that it used the program for the purpose of strengthening cyber warfare capabilities against Pyongyang and only against people living outside the country that have ties with the reclusive, communist country.  Such explanations, however, have been met with skepticism by many in the country, and in particular, the main opposition party, which believes the NIS has also spied on South Korean civilians.  The spy agency countered that while the information about the hacking is classified, it will show the usage records of the controversial hacking program to lawmakers to alleviate concerns that clandestine operations were carried out on locals.   After Lim's will was disclosed, ruling party lawmakers said the information deleted by the late employee can be recovered in its entirety.  In a press briefing, Saenuri Party's Lee Chul-woo and Park Min-shik, both members of the National Assembly's intelligence committee, said the NIS told them that the lost data can be restored using digital forensic techniques.  According to the lawmakers, the NIS said Lim must have feared that information regarding counter-terrorism and operations on North Korea would cause a major stir and must have deleted it while momentarily forgetting that the data could be recovered.  The lawmakers said Lim, because he was deeply involved with the hacking program, appeared to have felt burdened when the program sparked a political controversy.  An NIS official said once the deleted files are revived, they will be shared with the members of the intelligence committee.  ""We don't know the details of the deleted data, but we're in the process of finding out,"" the official told Yonhap News Agency on the condition of anonymity. ""When the lawmakers serving on the intelligence committee visit our headquarters, we will disclose the information to them.""  The official noted that the committee members are trying to schedule their visit to the NIS and added, ""We hope their visit comes fairly soon.""  A government source said the NIS has informed some members of the committee that the files should be restored in their entirety by the end of July at the latest.  ""By law, the NIS won't be able to disclose such information to the general public,"" the source added. ""Yet since there is such a major controversy over this matter, no one will believe (the NIS) unless the intelligence committee members find out the details. I understand the NIS will reveal its data at least to the committee.""

The two cultural artifacts were passed through Korean customs as they were mistakenly appraised as copied antiques.As South Korean cultural artifacts were looted by Japan during its 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula, Seoul has been making efforts to reclaim them.But South Korea's decision to return one of the statues to Japan came as Seoul's prosecutors concluded that there is no proof that the statue was illegally moved to the neighboring country and no one in South Korea has claimed ownership of it.A diplomatic source said that the South Korean government delivered the statue to Japanese officials earlier in the day. It will be transported via airplane later Friday, according to the source.Experts said the statue, which was crafted in the 8th century during the Unified Silla period, was presumed to have been moved to Japan through either cultural exchanges or looting during the Japanese invasion of Korea, known as the Imjin War (1592-1598).Japan is also demanding Seoul return the other Buddhist statue, which was presumed to have been made in the 14th century during the Koryo Dynasty (918-1392) and was designated by Japan as an intangible cultural asset.The decision to return it has been delayed due to the need for further investigation. The South Korean Buddhists' society has been seeking to reclaim the artifact, saying that it might have been stolen from a temple located in Seosan, some 151 kilometers south of Seoul.

They ran across the doomed vessel in a desperate attempt to get as many students to safety as they could. It was the last time they were seen alive, as the two teachers were among 304 killed when the Sewol ferry capsized on that fateful day.Earlier this week, the Ministry of Personnel Management said the two could not be subject to the screening process to be considered “killed in the line of duty.” The reason was that they were temporary teachers. This effectively barred their families from being compensated in the same way as those of the nine other teachers who died in the accident.“I cannot accept that my daughter is being discriminated in her death. I urge the people to help me so my daughter’s honor can be restored,” Kim Seok-woo, the father of late Kim Cho-won, said Tuesday at a press conference in front of Seoul Government Complex. He and Lee Jong-rak, father of Lee Ji-hye, visited the government officials and submitted a petition to reconsider their decision, signed by 120,000 teachers across the country.  Kim Seok-woo (center), father of the late Kim Cho-won, wipes away his tears while submitting a petition at the Ministry of Personnel Management in Seoul on Tuesday (Yonhap)The incident was a reminder of the discrimination temporary teachers in the country still face, even the ones who had perished in what is widely considered a heroic death.In Korea, one wishing to acquire a permanent teaching job at elementary, middle and high schools must receive a teacher‘s credentials from certified colleges or universities. Then they must pass a state-commissioned test and be appointed by the government to receive the status of “education civil servant.” Those who were college-certified but did not pass the state test can only get temporary jobs, which deprives them of many benefits other teachers are entitled to. This includes job security, joining the civil servant pension program, and providing financial compensation to government officials who are killed on the job. Temporary teachers say they often fall victim to discrimination at work, both from the school administration and their coworkers. “My students received an award from a state-sponsored competition, so I filed a report on it. But then I learned that temporary workers cannot claim credit for their contribution, so I had to fill in the forms under the name of another teacher who held a permanent post,” said a 31-year-old temporary teacher at a Seoul-based middle school. Temporary teachers are also the first in line for doing remedial classes, he added. Some faculty members, like the principal, even ask them to run personal errands.In 2012, the local court ordered schools to pay bonuses to the temporary teachers. The case is currently pending decision by the Supreme Court. Whether or not the temporary teachers should be considered education civil servants has sparked controversy here. The Personnel Ministry stated that Kim and Lee could not receive benefits for education civil servants, as they had different working conditions and did not contribute to the civil servants pension program.But a study by the National Assembly Research Service ― commissioned by Rep. Jeong Jin-hoo of the minor Justice Party ― found that the current law implies that temporary workers should be subject to the education civil servant law.Clause 32 of the education civil servant law states that those appointed as temporary teachers are considered “education workers,” and clause 2 of the same law stipulates that education workers working at an educational institute are considered education civil servants. Last month, 69 lawmakers including Jeong proposed a joint resolution that urged the government to recognize Kim and Lee as education civil servants killed on the job.Local teachers’ groups have also voiced complaints about the temporary teachers not being entitled to privileges. “Teachers exist for students. And a teacher trying to protect lives of students should be respected above all, whether one is a temporary teacher or not,” said Kim Dong-seok, the spokesperson for the Korea Federation of Teacher’s Associations. He said that compensating the deceased teachers as education civil servants can contribute to boosting the morale of all temporary teachers, since it delivers a message that the government respects teachers who are willing to sacrifice themselves for students. The Korea Teachers and Education Workers’ Union on Tuesday submitted a petition ― signed by 90,000 citizens ― urging the government to compensate all teachers equally.“Both Kim and Lee tried their best even though they were treated unfairly. But now they are being discriminated in their death,” said the KTU. “We will continue fighting with the families (Kim and Lee) until our demands are accepted by the government.” While Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea has expressed hopes for the two teachers’ recognition, the ministry’s efforts have been limited. “In principle, we hope that it will happen. But there isn’t much we can do since it is really not up to us,” said a high-ranking ministry official Wednesday, denying earlier reports that the education and personnel ministries had agreed to pursue policies to compensate the two teachers as education civil servants.Kim Seong-wook told local media that he would not give up until his daughter receives what he believes is the proper treatment as a teacher at Danwon. “Her students came up to me and asked why she was discriminated (in the government compensation). To them, she was their teacher. They don’t care if she held a temporary job or a permanent one,” he said.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","the sewol ferry capsized ,high school rushed downstairs ,sewol ferry capsized on ,sewol ferry capsized ,ferry capsized on tha","['Kim Cho - won', 'Lee Ji - hye', 'Danwon High School']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.20984735 -0.02970492

Police arrested an official, identified only by his surname Kang, at his residence after obtaining an arrest warrant for 10 key members of the group. Police officers carry a box containing account books, computer hard disks and other materials that they seized at the head office of Corea Alliance in Seoul, Wednesday. (Yonhap)It is currently tracking down seven others in Korea and two overseas for their arrest. Police accused Corea Alliance of being sympathizers of the communist regime, therefore violating the 1948 National Security Law. South Korea has put in place the controversial National Security Law that prohibits anti-state activities, such as those supporting North Korea. Those found to be breaching the law can face life imprisonment. Police also took issue with the leftists distributing “pro-North” leaflets and having a meeting in Germany with key officials from the reclusive regime. Corea Alliance was founded in November 2011, led by “patriotic” organizations and individuals “seeking a democracy and reunification for two Koreas.” In recent months, the group has focused on condemning the conservative President Park Geun-hye administration and the U.S. troops stationed in Korea. Six left-leaning organizations campaigning for gender equality, democracy and anti-capitalism are a part of Corea Alliance. The pro-North group has been searched a few times in the past on charges of violating the National Security Law, most recently in December last year. The raid came a day after Corea Alliance announced that it would file for a compensation suit against the government, denouncing the police for “intervening in the organization’s peaceful assemblies and demonstrations” in a violent and illegal manner. In Korea, several organizations have been labeled as illegal by the Supreme Court for allegedly advocating North Korea, which the progressive bloc has viewed as an attempt to silence criticism of the government. The Supreme Court outlawed a Pan-Korean Alliance for Reunification, an association of civic groups known as BumMinRyun, in 1997 for its outright support for North Korea and protest against the presence of the U.S. military here. The South Korean Federation of University Students Councils, a leftist student group called Hanchongryun here, was also criminalized the same year for the same reason. The National Security Law, which dates back to 1948, has stirred controversy in the divided nation, with left-leaning activists calling it a gimmick to stifle freedom of expression and oppress left-wing activists. South Korea remains technically at war with North Korea as the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.

Doctor Hwang Woo-suk oversees a cloning procedure on a dog in November, 2014 at Sooam Biotech Research Foundation in Seoul. Park Hyun-koo/The Korea HeraldAccording to reports, Hwang filed a criminal complaint accusing prominent researchers including Park Se-pil of Jeju National University, accusing them of embezzlement and attempted blackmail in June.Other researchers involved in the case are Chung Hyung-min of Konkuk University and Kim Eun-young of Mirae Cell Bio.In 2012 Hwang began working with Russian researchers to clone mammoths from cells recovered in Sahka Republic in eastern Russia. The plan is to extract the nucleus -– the part that contains genetic materials –- from replicated mammoth cells. The mammoth nucleus would then be inserted into eggs from elephants –- the mammoth’s closest living relatives –- from which all genetic materials have been removed. For the cloning process to begin, however, the mammoth cells retrieved from preserved carcass found in Russia first need to be replicated in the lab. Although Hwang had attempted to cultivate mammoth cells in collaboration with Russian researchers for some time, they had failed to produce results.Following years of failure, Hwang recruited the help of Park earlier this year, and his team was able to induce cell differentiation from the samples Hwang provided. While Park’s work opened up the way for mammoth cloning, Hwang claims that Park’s results are part of his own research and that he has sole rights over all related experimental methods. Hwang bases his claims on the fact that he provided the mammoth cells Park worked with.Park, however, argues that Hwang provided the cells without any conditions, and as his team’s cell cultivation method was critical in achieving the results, the research should be considered a collaborative effort.After failing to settle the dispute, Hwang filed a legal complaint accusing Park and his colleagues.The prosecution has so far finished questioning Hwang. Kim and Chung have also been questioned, and the prosecution plans to interview Park in the near future. Hwang was once a leading researcher who rose to fame in animal cloning. However, in attempting to apply his animal cloning techniques to human embryos, Hwang used doctored results that eventually led to his downfall. In the paper published in 2005, Hwang claimed that he had cloned a number of human embryos, but it was later found that his results were fabricated.By Choi He-suk (cheesuk@heraldcorp.com)","disgraced south korean researcher ,cloning disgraced south korean ,attempts to clone mammoths ,complaint accusing prominent researchers ,controversy over mammoth cloning","['south korean', 'Hwang Woo - suk', 'Hwang Woo - suk', 'Sooam Biotech Research Foundation', 'Seoul', 'Park Hyun - koo', 'Hwang']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.17371899  0.28184235

(AP-Yonhap)The North Korean soldiers crossed the Military Demarcation Line near Cheorwon, Gangwon Province, between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m., prompting the South to send calls for a withdrawal and then fire warning shots, an Army official said, adding that the North Koreans did not fire back, though they were armed. The incident marked the South Korean military’s first discharge of warning shots against North Korean servicemen this year. Last October, the two Koreas briefly traded fire after the North Korean soldiers approached the MDL in Paju, Gyeonggi Province. No casualties occurred that time. Pyongyang is believed to have been tightening border controls and reconnaissance activities in recent years as part of its efforts to stem the defector outflow, while beefing up training for surprise attacks and ambush infiltrations into the Demilitarized Zone and its surrounding regions.

They invested a combined 190 billion won in the joint tour program.""We urge the two Koreas to stop political confrontation and hold honest talks,"" the Mt. Kumgang Enterpriser Association said in a statement.""The government should resume the joint tour program and lift its sanctions against North Korea,"" it added. The sanctions were imposed after the North's torpedoing of a South Korean warship and its shelling of a border island in 2010.The Mount Kumgang tour project, a symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation, had attracted some 2 million South Korean visitors until it was put on hold, according to the group.Pyongyang has called for the resumption of the tour program, which served as one of the few legitimate revenue sources for the cash-strapped country.The Seoul government has said that the North should take measures to guarantee the safety of South Koreans and ensure that similar incidents do not recur.The issue of resuming the Mount Kumgang tour program is linked to whether cash earnings from the tour project are subject to United Nations sanctions on North Korea.Following the North's third nuclear test in 2013, the U.N.Security Council imposed sanctions on North Korea that bans the transfer of bulk cash to the North on concerns that such money could be used to develop its nuclear and missile programs.

Choi Doo-yeong, the president of the Local Government Officials’ Development Institute, was found dead on the ground outside a hotel. He seemed to have fallen from his fourth-floor hotel room, but the reason for it had not been confirmed, the Ministry of Government Administration and Home Affairs said.  Choi Doo-yeong (Yonhap)Choi left for China on Thursday to handle the aftermath of the bus crash that killed 10 Korean nationals and injured 16, with eight in critical condition. Of the victims, nine were Korean public servants who were taking part in the LGODI’s training program. More than 140 Korean civil servants were visiting Jian as part of a five-day work training program hosted by the institution. The 55-year-old was reportedly under pressure over the tragic deaths, sources said, adding that he had struggled with mediating between the bereaved families who wished to bring the bodies of their loved ones home and the Chinese government, which advised cremation in line with Chinese custom. While no suicide note was discovered, the Chinese police found a paper on which Choi attempted to write something in his hotel room, a government official said. No specific message had been written, the official added. The Chinese authorities said no signs of murder had been found, with the investigation into the death still underway. Choi was appointed the LDODI president in January after working in the senior position in the Gangwon provincial government and in the Government Administration Ministry for over 30 years. The LDODI, founded in 1965, has served as a top education system for raising top public servants in municipalities. The institute is an affiliated organization under the Government Administration Ministry. Of the wounded, those in critical condition will stay in China until they fully recover, the ministry said. Other public servants who participated in the field trip safely returned to Seoul on Saturday.The exact cause of the accident is still under investigation but it is suspected that the driver was speeding before the bus ran over the side of the bridge, the authorities said. The bodies of the victims will return home as early as Monday, they said. Choi’s body will arrive separately later this week, they added. By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","bus crash that killed ,killed 10 koreans ,was found dead sunday ,dies while probing china ,surrounding deadly bus crash","['south korean', 'chinese', 'Jian', 'Koreans', 'Choi Doo - yeong', 'the Local Government', '’ Development Institute']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.21849072  0.18051484

The special investigation team called in an official from Hanwha Chemical associated with the accident and five officials from Hyundai Environment, a subcontractor in charge of workers’ safety, for questioning to determine the cause of the accident.  Investigators and forensic officials inspect an explosion site Sunday at facility in Ulsan run by Hanwha Chemical Co., after a blast on Friday left six dead and one injured. (Yonhap)The blast occurred at around 9:19 a.m. during welding work on a storage tank to expand a wastewater disposal facility at its plant in Ulsan, the company said in a statement on Friday. The Ulsan plant mainly produces polyvinyl chloride, a plastic used in a wide range of products. It is the second-biggest chemical factory operated by Hanwha Chemical, an affiliate of Hanwha Group. The cause is yet to be determined, but the company officials suspect that the explosion was triggered by a gas leak. They said the project manager did not measure the levels of gas inside the storage unit before allowing laborers to do the welding work. The police already raided the offices of safety-related teams at Hanwha Chemical’s factory in Ulsan and Hyundai Environment’s office in Busan on Friday and seized job sheets, safety inspection reports and a floor plan for the factory. More raids could follow if necessary, the police said. It also conducted an autopsy to determine the cause of death of six workers killed in the blast. The result will be released in three to four days, the police said. The Ulsan branch of the Employment and Labor Ministry is questioning witnesses and reenacting the events that led up to the explosion as part of efforts to find the cause of the accident. If Hanwha Chemical or Hyundai Environment were found to have neglected their duty to prevent such an explosion from happening, the Labor Ministry will punish the companies for violating occupation safety and health acts, it said. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","plant explosion investigation speeds ,speeds up korean police ,explosion that killed six ,probe into deadly explosion ,plant explosion investigation","['korean', 'Hanwha Chemical Corp.', 'Ulsan', 'Hanwha Chemical', 'Hyundai Environment']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29213703  0.30479565

The drivers were demanding a 7.29 percent rise and additional welfare benefits while bus owners sought to freeze wages. The drivers’ union had threatened to stage a strike from Saturday unless their demands were accepted. Over 90 percent of the union members on Wednesday voted for the walkout. The compromise, however, invited criticism that the drivers held public transportation hostage for personal gain, citing a rise in bus fares going into effect from Saturday.Earlier this month, Seoul Metropolitan Government said it would increase public transportation fares to address a budget deficit and service improvement. The bus fares will jump by 150 won ($0.14) to 1,200 won. Some claimed that the majority of the extra revenue from the fare hike will be used to cover the drivers’ wage increases. Since July 2004, Seoul City has introduced a quasi-public operation system for buses. Under this system, a joint group manages the revenue of the bus companies while the city covers the deficit in exchange of holding the authority to determine the bus routes. The city has annually covered about 300 billion won in losses while the wages of drivers were hiked by over 160 percent since it adopted the new operation system, sources said. “Causing concerns over the bus strike ahead of the fare hike suggests that the drivers and the employers only considered their own interests important, particularly when the public at the moment is in confusion over the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak,” said an official from civic group Wirae in the eastern capital. In May 2012, bus drivers threatened to stage a strike over the wage hike but canceled it after the raise was agreed.

The government began receiving bids one month ago on May 23. Out of the seven consortia, five were led by foreign companies while the rest were headed by local firms.There were a total of six foreign companies, including two from the United States and two from China. The other two are from Denmark and the Netherlands, the ministry said.The ministry said it will begin evaluating the bids early next month, while a preferred bidder or bidders is expected to be named later in that month.It earlier said the bidders will be evaluated on a 100-point scale, with technological capabilities accounting for 90 percent of the evaluation.The bidding price will account for the remaining 10 percent of the score.The weight on technical possibility, instead of price, comes as the country seeks to hoist the sunken ship out of water without any significant damage so as to prevent the possible loss of any bodies believed to be inside.The ship sank on April 16 last year while en route to the country's southern resort island of Jeju. So far, 304 people, mostly high school students on a school excursion, have been confirmed dead. Nine people remain missing to date.

We do a lot to take care of veterans, keep them happy, keep them active and healthy,"" the official said.""Our military veterans are very special to us. Without them, we wouldn't be here. So, what we try to do is fulfill our mission of providing a premier retirement community and giving them the best care.""Korean War veterans all spoke of not only their sacrifices but also the sacrifices Koreans went through after the war to rebuild the war-torn nation.Kenneth Hall, 84, another veteran who served for 18 months in 1950-52, said he never forgot Korea.""I followed you all these years. I didn't forget Korea,"" he said. ""One of the proudest things I did in my life was (my service in Korea) and I'm certainly proud of what you did, too.

""As for what the country is like now? ...

Cleaning and preservation treatments were skipped. The sealed corpse was immediately sent to a cremation facility and turned to ash in just a few hours. Looking at the flames in the distance, the bereaved families remained lethargic.The whole process, rushed and hushed, only seemed to amplify the sudden tragedy that hit the family, to whom Middle East respiratory syndrome was something of a faraway land until less than a month ago.Under the government orders for fear of further infection, the corpses of MERS victims are mandated to be cremated within 24 hours of death. No funeral ceremonies are allowed. “It’s so sad that the families cannot say goodbye to them. Bereaved families cannot even check the faces of their beloved before the cremation, because of virus concerns,” funeral worker Lee Sang-jae told The Korea Herald. He managed the cremation process of five MERS victims this week in Seoul.  A medical staff member in protective clothing stands in the quarantine room at a hospital in Seoul, Sunday. (Yonhap)As of Wednesday afternoon, the contagious virus outbreak had claimed 20 deaths in the country since late last month. “The dead can be cremated only in the late afternoon after the other uninfected bodies are done first. Until then, the bereaved families can do nothing but wait,” he added. Only a limited number of bereaved family members are allowed to go to the designated cremation facilities, wearing mandated protective clothing. Some family members who are infected or in quarantine cannot even visit. Most painfully, the patient is usually not able to share the last moment with the loved ones. While the government says that the families can spend the moment with the patients upon discussion, it is usually technically difficult as family members tend to be placed in quarantine, thereby not allowed to go out.This often leads to a sense of guilt for the remaining family members, as many feel as if they did not fulfill their duties, experts said. “The Korean culture of the three-day funeral service actually helps the bereaved families express and release their sorrow and be comforted by others. But since the MERS victims’ families are asked to finish everything in 24 hours, they are likely to be under much more stress,” said psychiatrist Hwang Jae-uk at Soonchunhyang University Hospital. Worsening their mental stress is the prejudice of others, Hwang noted.“They become stigmatized as many people try to shun them over worries that they might expose the virus. Knowing that, the bereaved families will also attempt to conceal the MERS history and refrain from expressing their emotions or stress,” Hwang added. As part of the efforts to relieve the mental stress of the bereaved families, the government Tuesday pledged to provide psychological support. The MERS response headquarters said that the five public hospitals and a few municipal health centers will offer counseling. Experts, however, stress that the most basic, yet best solution can be made by the public.“The attitude in which the public attempts to avoid them over virus concerns can leave them in social isolation. Offering thoughtful words and care can make a big difference to them,” said psychologist Kwak Keum-joo at Seoul National University.

Gangnam Severance took samples of the patient’s sputum and isolated the patient at a separate treatment facility. But the patient reportedly threw a fit saying “If I have MERS I will spread it all around,” the officials said. Three other doctors who were nearby have since been put on isolated watch as a result of the incident.The patient then refused to wait until the results came, broke the lock, took a taxi and returned home, according to reports. The patient was confirmed of MERS in the first round of testing.After repeated phone calls to the patient and the patient’s family members, the person was finally admitted to Seoul Medical Center the next day, and the patient was again confirmed of MERS.Health center officials said they are looking at closed circuit television footage and tracing the patient’s route. While the patient has testified to missing work after suffering from the symptoms, they are also looking into whether that is true, they said.(khnews@heraldcorp.com)","fled hospital while waiting ,syndrome outbreak fled hospital ,outbreak fled hospital while ,fled hospital while ,outbreak fled hospital","['Gangnam Community Health Center', 'Samsung Medical Center']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.31551901  0.03155056

Seventy art pieces of painting, wood sculpture and stonework by artist Kim Yun-shin are displayed at the Hanwon Museum of Art in Seoul from June 11-July 8. Kim, a former professor at the Sangmyung University in Seoul, immigrated to Argentina in 1984, after a trip enchanted her.Intense sun, pristine forests, vast meadows, idle cattle and free-spirited Argentines beckoned her, along with abundant stones and woods, which were rare materials for a Korean artist. Kim devoted her next 30 years to the singular pursuit of art, and in 2008, opened her own museum ― Museo Kim Yun Shin ― in Buenos Aires. Former Vice President of Argentina Julio Cobos, Mayor of Buenos Aires Mauricio Macri and former Korean Ambassador to Argentina Hwang Eui-seung visited the museum.  Korean-Argentine artist Kim Yun-shin (left) poses with Argentine Ambassador Jorge Roballo at the opening of her exhibition at the Hanwon Museum of Art in Seoul on Thursday. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)At the opening of the exhibition on Thursday, which was attended by over two hundred guests, performance artists from KimBokHee Dance Company staged a live show with music. The venue is Kim’s 33rd exhibition, her 10th in Korea since 1988.“Madam Kim Yun-shin, who is Korean by birth but Argentine by residence, will introduce interesting ways to bond our cultures,” Argentine Ambassador Jorge Roballo said in a speech. “This year marks the 50th anniversary of Korean immigration to Argentina, and Koreans have demonstrated assiduous work ethics and harmonious assimilation with not only Argentines, but other immigrant communities.”Kim said that she felt enthralled and elated to meet her former students again, who are now well into their 50s and 60s. Following the biblical story of ancient people, Kim plans to live and work until 125, she told The Korea Herald. “I can move vigorously even at this age, because I have got used to the rigorous work regime every day,” Kim noted. “I have to move heavy stones, saw and sandpaper logs all day. This balances my life. If I didn’t do anything, I will forget about everything.” Kim’s paintings have bright colors and leaf patterns. Her wood sculptures possess simple and crude forms, resembling aboriginal symbols. Her stonework cuts through the rock’s layers to expose compacted sedimentary patterns.  Performance artists from KimBokHee Dance Company display a live show at the exhibition opening at the Hanwon Museum of Art in Seoul on Thursday. (Joel Lee / The Korea Herald)Unlike her former days, when she used to preconceive a design before cutting, these days, she relies on her “spiritual inspiration from the bottom of her heart,” the artist explained. “My paintings are colorful and powerful, because I draw the inner forces underneath a Latin American society,” Kim highlighted. “I am not just drawing the European landscape of Argentina. I have tried to bring to light the aboriginal culture and spirit, which existed before the European immigration.”Having lived in Argentina for 30 years, Kim said that she discovered the essence of Korean culture and identity on a foreign land. As Koreans have historically lived in tight-knit communities, they have become zealous together, and no other people are as indefatigable as Koreans, Kim stressed. “Koreans in Korea have taken our culture for granted,” she said. “We should not lose sight of our culture, which is important and precious. We should learn to embrace our imperfect circumstances gracefully.” Argentines, by contrast, blessed with vast lands, food and resources, have developed a more leisurely lifestyle and attitude, according to Kim. In the mid-1980s, a family of 6 people could live comfortably off a hundred dollars, she recalled. Some 30,000 Koreans in Argentina now have established themselves socially and economically, with the second generations branching off from the small businesses of their parents, to succeed in their white-collar professions. Koreans came to Argentina largely before the Asian financial crisis of 1997, and the number dropped by half until 2003. Many first generations engaged in textile and clothing businesses. “Koreans don’t come to Argentina as immigrants anymore,” Kim pointed out, adding that Argentina became a stopover country for transnational immigration. “Most immigrants come to Argentina with capital, to make more money, and move onto America, Canada or Australia. I stay in touch with Koreans weekly through the Catholic church.”By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","old korean argentine woman ,korean argentine woman artist ,korean argentine woman ,year old korean argentine ,argentine woman artist opened","['korean - argentine', 'Seoul', 'Kim Yun - shin', 'the Hanwon Museum of Art', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'the Sangmyung University', 'Seoul', 'Argentina']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56737518  0.60527581

It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points with a confidence level of 95 percent.  Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon was ranked as the most-favored next political leader for the first time this year with a 17 percent rating.   This is apparently due to his challenge of the Park administration for its alleged slow response to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus spread.  Park led the next-leader poll in late last year, but was overtaken by ruling Saenuri Party leader Kim Moo-sung and main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy leader Moon Jae-in this year.   Kim and Moon followed with the rate of 13 percentage points each.

Most reported victims are hospitals, schools or private education facilities.Rumors were distributed rampantly early after MERS first broke out on May 20, before the government released the list of MERS-affected hospitals on June 7.The government had vowed stern measures against those who spread false rumors thereby worsening public fears over the disease.“Even after the government announcement of the list of (MERS-hit) hospitals, distribution of false information about medical facilities and other privately owned businesses seems to continue,” the police said.The suspects will face criminal charges if their distributed information is found to have defamed or obstructed business, it added.From news reports (khnews@heraldcorp.com)","killed nine and infected ,police book eight ,rumors police said wednesday ,police said wednesday eight ,infected more than hundred","['South Korea', 'the National Police Agency']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46355364  0.47136986

A member of staff at a community health center will give you a call,” the text message read. “Nearly an hour passed, but my mother’s phone did not ring. I had to phone the hospital to find out the situation,” Yoo, who has been under quarantine at home since Sunday, told The Korea Herald. A day after her mother visited the hospital, the 25-year-old office worker learned that the 76th confirmed MERS patient stayed at the hospital’s emergency room until Saturday morning, the same day Yoo’s mother had surgery for a fracture. A government official from her local ward office finally contacted them Monday, but only asked Yoo’s mother to quarantine herself at home. The official did not ask any further questions, and so failed to find out that Yoo and her father also visited the emergency room to take care of her. Yoo and her father were quarantined only after they reported themselves to the authorities. Receptionists at Seoul Asan Hospital in western Seoul wear masks after the hospital saw its first MERS infected patient Tuesday. The patient had been working as a security guard at the emergency center where the sixth patient was admitted on May 26. (Yonhap)As of Tuesday afternoon, some 2,892 people were under quarantine. The government reported the seventh death from MERS and confirmed eight more cases of the disease, pushing the number of confirmed patients to 95. Three confirmed patients were discharged after recovery. “The government appears unprepared to cope with the MERS outbreak,” Yoo said, pointing to gaps in the authorities’ efforts to trace all contacts of infected people and place them under quarantine. “It seems like the government totally depends on the medical records provided by hospitals, meaning that it is unrealistic to trace all those possibly exposed to the virus,” she said. Although Yoo understands the government’s difficulty in monitoring everyone under quarantine, she doubts whether it can combat the spread of MERS this way.“The official assigned to our family checks whether we are at home and have symptoms for MERS by phone twice a day,” Yoo said. “If we don’t answer our phone, there is no way he can track us.” Despite the government’s stepped-up efforts to contain the deadly virus, concerns are growing that the authorities’ lax management of those quarantined could lead to transmission of the disease outside of hospitals. Local news outlets are reporting increasing numbers of cases in which patients suspected of having MERS are wandering around hospitals for treatment, potentially exposing unspecified crowds to the virus. Four days on since Yoo’s family was placed in isolation, they are still suffering from a lack of food and heaps of rubbish at home. “When I asked how we can feed ourselves and deal with the garbage without stepping outside, the government official kept saying ‘We cannot help it,’” Yoo said, berating the government for not providing enough instructions for those abruptly placed under quarantine. “They should offer us more than a mask, disinfectants and a simple brochure with measures to prevent MERS,” she said, calling on the government to give more detailed instructions and create a bearable environment for those quarantined. With food running out, Yoo ordered groceries through an online shopping mall to have them delivered in front of her door, preparing for the days to come under quarantine. Given MERS has an incubation period of two to 14 days, the family needs to be in isolation for 10 more days. Meanwhile, some others placed in isolation said that the fast-circulating rumors in the community about their possible infection made them feel even more isolated. “Even after our family is released from quarantine, I am not sure we can continue to live in this neighborhood with such a stigma,” said a doctor, who has been quarantined for nearly two weeks.While Yoo’s family was considered “lucky” to be informed by the hospital of their possible infection, many others showing symptoms are having difficulties in receiving medical check-ups to confirm whether they are infected. As part of efforts to prevent the virus from further spreading, the government set up a hotline for those suspected of MERS to report themselves to the authorities. But the lines are always busy, a 31-year-old Seoul citizen said, adding that the parties in charge of protecting citizens appear to be trying to shift responsibility onto each other. “When I managed to contact a counsellor, she said that I should go to a hospital first. When I went to a hospital, the doctor said that I should go to a community health clinic,” he said.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","family into panic sunday ,panic sunday evening patient ,at our hospital emergency ,whole family into panic ,our hospital emergency","['Seoul', 'Yoo Hye - ji ’s']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38872281 -0.00659409

The defendant had stopped providing for the two after confessing to his wife about the affair late in the year.The woman sued him, demanding he pay 40 million won ($35,746) for child support along with 5 million won in alimony, claiming the two were in a common-law marriage. The defendant responded by filing a lawsuit for the child’s custody.“Considering that the plaintiff is currently raising the child in the Philippines and the fact that the child’s existence caused rift among the defendant’s family, it is appropriate to grant the custody to the plaintiff,” the court said in its ruling.It, however, turned down the woman’s request to get paid up-front, ordering the defendant instead pay her 300,000 won per month until the child reaches adulthood. It also struck down her request for alimony, pointing out that their relationship cannot be defined as a common-law marriage given that the man already had a spouse.Kopino, a combination of Korean and Filipino, refers to children born to a Korean father and a Filipino mother who have been abandoned. While authorities provide no official tally on how many Kopinos there are, the figure is estimated to range between 10,000 and 30,000.The number has been rapidly climbing in recent years, with over a million Korean tourists visiting the Philippines annually.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","korean father to pay ,estranged half filipino child ,court ordered korean father ,philippines on business trip ,his estranged half filipino","['Seoul', 'korean', 'the Seoul Family Court', 'Philippines']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45790341  0.16432747

So far, 87 South Koreans have tested positive for MERS, of whom six have died.  She also called on officials and experts to thoroughly monitor whether people suspected of being infected with MERS remain in self-quarantine, the key measure to stop the spread of the virus.  The government said the number of people quarantined from the disease has jumped to 2,508, while 583 people were recently released from quarantine.  She also instructed officials to come up with measures to try to minimize the negative impact the disease could have on the economy.  The comment came hours after Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan said that his ministry is considering providing support for tourism, retail and other sectors hit hard by the MERS outbreak, noting the outbreak could hurt consumption and business investment.  Park only plans to hold an essential meeting this week to focus all her attention on containing the MERS virus.  The disease has put Park's key agenda items, including labor reform and the nomination for a new justice minister, on the back burner.  ""All tasks of Cheong Wa Dae are now focused on MERS for the time being. It's fair to say other issues have come to a standstill,"" an official said.  Some ruling and opposition lawmakers pressed Park to consider delaying her visit to the United States unless the virus is quickly contained.  Ha Tae-keung, a lawmaker of the ruling Saenuri Party, made the request for a delay, saying that Park needs to demonstrate her commitment to containing the virus.  He also claimed that the U.S. could fully understand South Korea's situation, saying that U.S. President Barack Obama canceled his trip to Asia in 2013 due to a government shutdown.  Still, the presidential office showed no indication of rescheduling Park's visit to the U.S. this coming weekend.  ""There is nothing to announce"" regarding any possible change in Park's visit to the U.S., presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook told reporters.  Park is set to leave for Washington on Sunday for talks with Obama.  The two leaders are scheduled to hold summit talks on June 16 to exchange views on a broad range of security, economic and global issues, including the South Korea-U.S. alliance.

It was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and has since spread to several other countries. There currently is no vaccine or treatment for the disease.Most people infected with MERS develop severe acute respiratory illness, including fever, cough and shortness of breath. Many of them have died.

Spray painting graffiti on public or private property without permission will be punishable with charges of criminal trespassing and damaging property, the National Police Agency said. Those charged with property damage can be punished with a penalty of up to 7 million won ($6,300) and three years in prison, while those charged with trespassing face a penalty of up to 5 million won and a three-year jail term, according to the police. Foreigners are no exception to the charges, police said. “If graffiti painters are found to be foreigners, the police will partner with international law enforcement agencies to hold them accountable,” they said. The ramped-up crackdown came as part of the government’s nationwide campaign against graffiti that has increasingly daubed the walls of buildings and public transport across the nation. Most recently, a 25-year-old U.S. citizen was booked without detention earlier Wednesday evening after scrawling graffiti on the wall of a building in Itaewon, central Seoul, the Yongsan Police Station said. The Korean-American photographer, who entered Korea to find his biological parents, stated that the graffiti was intended to “leave a trace” in Korea. Last month, another foreigner, a 31-year-old Korean-German only identified by her surname Kim, was caught red-handed printing a heart-shaped image and Roman alphabet letters on the wall of a building in downtown Seoul calling for world peace. Three foreigners respectively from Romania, Spain and Latvia were also apprehended in the same month, accused of painting graffiti on the exterior walls of subways running through Seoul, Incheon and Ansan from 2013 to April.Police also nabbed a group of Korean men after they daubed some 70 walls of private residences and parking lot gates in southern Seoul with graffiti. The authorities vowed to step up patrols in factory sites and train and bus depots to better deter graffiti.

According to local news reports, she was hospitalized on May 25 after experiencing shortness of breath. She died six days after.Earlier on the day, Seoul said it was monitoring 682 people, a massive expansion from its watch list of 64 people announced last month, for possible infection of Middle East respiratory syndrome, after confirming the country’s 18th case.  Travelers arrive at Incheon International Airport wearing masks Monday as fears of MERS infection continue to spread. (Yonhap)Those on the watch list have also been banned indefinitely from leaving the country, the government said. The announcement came shortly after Seoul’s recent failure to prevent the 10th MERS patient from going overseas to China on May 26. This left 165 passengers and crew members on board the same plane at potential risk of infection.“We will put forth our best efforts to prevent any potential MERS patients from going overseas,” said Kwon Jun-wook, who leads the government’s special task force tackling MERS. Among the 18 confirmed patients, five of them are in unstable condition, meaning they either have to rely on a ventilator to breathe or are experiencing kidney or other organ failures. A 71-year-old, who became the sixth confirmed MERS patient on May 28, is particularly at risk, as he had been suffering from a chronic kidney disease prior to being diagnosed with MERS, officials said. The first confirmed patient, quarantined since he was diagnosed on May 20, had visited four medical clinics and hospitals over the course of 10 days prior to his diagnosis. He is currently believed to be the sole spreader of MERS in Korea. The 682 people to be watched include all health care workers and patients who were present when the first MERS patient either stayed or visited the four facilities. Among the 682, about 35 percent are considered to be the most vulnerable -- those who are aged 50 or older and those who have chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart or kidney diseases. Kwon said about 150 beds were currently available nationwide for patients who needed to be isolated. “We can, of course, increase the number of hospital beds (with the right equipment),” he said.Last month, the Health Ministry’s monitoring list omitted patients who did not share a ward with the first three confirmed patients but stayed in the same hospital, claiming MERS was less contagious than many other infectious diseases. The list then only contained close family members of the three patients, as well as health care workers who treated them. Almost half of those infected by the first patient were not even included in the government’s initial monitoring list. Among the 17 patients who are believed to be infected by “patient zero,” 15 were at the same facility as the 68-year-old, who was being treated there as an inpatient from May 15-17. Out of the 15, nine were staying there as inpatients. The facility, which has since been temporarily shut down, is the second of the four hospitals he visited or stayed at before being quarantined.The remaining two patients are health care professionals who treated the first patient prior to his diagnosis, each at different medical clinics, on May 15 and 17, respectively. The incubation period of MERS is considered to be from two to 14 days, and all those infected by the first patient were in contact with him from May 15-17. As the first patient visited different clinics before his diagnosis between May 17 and 20, more people may be diagnosed this week, as the incubation period of those who may have been infected at the clinic lasts until Thursday.As the nation continues to grapple with the spread of MERS, members of the government and the ruling party gathered for an emergency countermeasures meeting.“This week is a crucial turning point in which the situation can either get better or worse,” said Rep. Won Yoo-chul, senior policymaker of the ruling Saenuri Party. “The government must do everything it can this week to prevent a further spread of the disease, while making sure false rumors about the disease that make the public unnecessarily anxious don’t go viral.”The party and the government also discussed the incident involving a live anthrax sample that was mistakenly sent to an American military base in Korea from the U.S.“We are considering legal and institutional ways to regulate all potentially dangerous substances that arrive in Korea,” Won said. “We’ll be discussing this issue at the Status of Forces Agreement meeting scheduled in July.” By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","woman dies after contact ,respiratory failure on monday ,breath she died six ,woman dies after ,she died six days","['Korea', 'the Health Ministry', 'Seoul']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63779742  0.22263224

The object flies into the sky with a loud blast after being ejected from underwater in what looks like a test-firing of a ballistic missile.The footage contains a caption that states North Korea's successful launch of an SLBM will nullify the Seoul-Washington alliance and the U.S. nuclear umbrella. The North also claimed that Seoul will be engulfed with chaos with just one or two SLBMs.It is not confirmed whether the North's footage is authentic or not.The first 10 seconds of the clip appears to be an edited version of a YouTube video that features the launch of a U.S.ballistic missile, the Trident I.The transition into the latter half, which shows the airborne missile, also appears abrupt, suggesting the second half may have been taken from a different video.The news came as North Korea said last week that it has already made nuclear warheads small enough to fit on missiles.Experts have raised concerns over Pyongyang's move, since it is seen as part of efforts to equip its missiles with miniaturized nuclear bombs.South Korea has said the North's test-firing was more of a test for an ejection rather than a firing, since the missile is assumed to have only made it about 100 meters after coming out of the water.But some analysts said if the North's claim is confirmed, the move will add a fresh threat to security on the Korean Peninsula as it is hard to detect where the SLBMs will be launched.

The victims’ families and activists from Asian Citizen’s Center for Environment and Health said they are consulting with a British law firm to file a lawsuit in a British court, accusing Reckitt Benckiser of dodging responsibility. The announcement came about three weeks after a woman who had used the product since 2001 died of a lung disease last week, pushing the death toll to 142. Reckitt Benckiser’s humidifier disinfectants have been blamed for claiming 142 lives in Korea for its harmful substance that caused serious lung disease. The Korean government confirmed in April that it found a significant association between the disease and the use of humidifier disinfectant. “We met with Reckitt Benckiser (officials) three times when we went to England, but the company neither offered a sincere apology nor showed willingness to take responsibility,” the families and activists said at the news conference held in front of the company’s Korean office in Yeouido on Friday afternoon. “We asked Reckitt Benckiser to create a committee involving victims, the manufacturer and civic organizations (to solve the issue), but it did not accept our suggestion,” they said, lamenting that the British company only shifted responsibility to its Korean office. Earlier in the month, seven victims’ families and activists including Kang Chan-ho, the father of an 8-year-old girl who now struggles with lung damage after using a similar Danish product called Cefu, visited the headquarters of the British company in London for a protest. They also held demonstrations at major tourist sites like Trafalgar Square and Westminster City Council, calling for an apology. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","wednesday the victims families ,firm to file lawsuit ,died of lung disease ,file lawsuit in british ,law firm to file","['Reckitt Benckiser', 'british', 'Asian Citizen ’s Center for Environment and Health', 'british', 'british', 'Reckitt Benckiser']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57576001  0.2342349

At the time, authorities said the suspects were linked to IS.Although Sunni extremists attacked Westerners and government targets in Saudi Arabia between 2003 and 2007, the Al-Dalwa shootings were the first major militant assault against Shiites.The IS group, which considers Shiites heretics, has declared a ""caliphate"" in seized parts of Iraq and Syria. It has claimed numerous atrocities including the beheading of foreign hostages.Saudi Arabia and its Sunni Gulf neighbours last year joined a US-led military coalition bombing IS in Syria, raising concerns about possible retaliation in the kingdom.Since late March the kingdom has also led a coalition bombing Iran-backed Shiite rebels who seized large parts of Yemen and have sent deadly shell fire into Saudi Arabia.In its statement claiming responsibility for the Qatif attack, IS vowed ""dark days ahead"" for Shiites until militants ""chase them from the Arabian Peninsula"".Political and religious leaders in the kingdom, and its media, were unanimous in denouncing the mosque bombing.""No room for discord... the people are united,"" said the Al-Watan daily. The interior ministry said the attack against ""honourable citizens was carried out by tools controlled by foreign forces that aim to divide the unity of society and pull it into sectarian strife"".But widespread condemnation by Saudi society ""sends the message to them that their endeavours have failed,"" the ministry said.Saudi Arabia's top cleric, Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdul Aziz al-Sheikh, called it a ""criminal act"" which targeted national unity.The United Nations Security Council and Saudi Arabia's regional Shiite rival Iran condemned the mosque attack.Most of the kingdom's Shiites live in the east, where the vast majority of the kingdom's oil reserves lie but where Shiites have long complained of marginalisation.The Qatif attack occurred despite the arrest since December of nearly 100 jihadists, most of them allegedly linked to IS.The interior ministry said five members of the suicide bomber's 26-member cell were involved in the May 8 shooting of a policeman on patrol in southern Riyadh.""They had confessed to their crime and set fire to his body,"" the ministry said.Investigators recovered two Kalashnikov rifles used in the policeman's murder, 17 other firearms, and 230 kilograms (507 pounds) of chemicals used for making explosives.The other 21 detained suspects included two 15-year-olds and one who was 16, the ministry said.It added that all 21 ""had adopted the ideology of the terrorist Daesh,"" and recruited followers especially among young people.Frederic Wehrey, a Gulf analyst at the US-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, has written that the kingdom's vows to counter the Islamic State group and its sectarianism expose a paradox.""In its own domestic policies, the Saudi government has institutionalised sectarianism in virtually every aspect of political, social, and economic life,"" Wehrey wrote in a December article for Foreign Policy.","after kingdom deadliest attack ,bomber who killed 21 ,who killed 21 worshippers ,suicide bomber who killed ,deadliest attack in years","['RIYADH', 'AFP', 'Saudi Arabia', 'shiite', 'Islamic', 'State', 'Sunni', 'jihadist', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Salih']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63005799  0.41101277

The 68-year-old is currently reported to be in a stable condition.The man stayed in Bahrain from April 18 to May 3 and was engaged in a farming-related business there, according to the Health Ministry. He returned to Korea via Incheon International Airport. Prior to his arrival, he had a layover in Qatar.The patient had been asymptomatic until May 11, seven days after his arrival to Korea. He was eventually hospitalized on May 12 for symptoms including high fever and coughing. The Korea National Institute of Health on Wednesday confirmed that he was infected by MERS. Since the diagnosis, the patient has been quarantined at a government-certified medical facility, the ministry said.Although camels are suspected to be the primary source of MERS infection in humans, the exact transmission routes remain unknown. Since it was first reported in 2012, some 1,142 people from 23 countries have been infected by the virus. Among them, 465 died. Also among the infected, 97.8 percent were lived in the Middle East, especially Saudi Arabia and UAE. In Asia, MERS cases were confirmed in the Philippines and Malaysia prior to the one in Seoul. Although the Korean patient was diagnosed with the infection after staying in Bahrain, no case someone contracting MERS within Korea has been reported by the health authorities.Symptoms of the virus include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. It has been shown to spread between people who are in close contact, most probably through droplets when an infected person coughs. There is no known cure and no vaccine to prevent the virus.However, Kim Young-taek, an official from the Health Ministry, said MERS isn’t impossible to treat. “There are ways to ease the symptoms which eventually would help one’s immune system fight the virus,” he said. “One of the most important things is to prevent any complications that may follow, including kidney failure and pneumonia.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","seoul earlier this month ,seoul confirms first mers ,ministry on wednesday confirmed ,health ministry on wednesday ,bahrain to seoul earlier","['South Korea ’s', 'Health Ministry', 'Bahrain', 'Seoul', 'Bahrain', 'the Health Ministry', 'Korea']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61530882  0.91297257

272,272,Top U.S. official strongly suggests N.

Fortunately, they've not gone as far as their clever video editors and spinmeisters would have us believe,"" Adm. James A. Winnefeld Jr., vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said during a discussion at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.  ""They are many years away from developing this capability,"" he said.  The North claimed earlier this month that leader Kim Jong-un oversaw a successful underwater test-launch of a ""strategic submarine ballistic missile."" The test, if confirmed, would represent a significant step forward in the North's missile technology.  But last week, Joseph Bermudez, a top North Korea military expert, claimed that the North is believed to have test-fired the missile from a submerged barge, not from a submarine, and that the North appears to have ""photoshopped"" images of the test to exaggerate progress.  South Korean officials said they believe the North's imagery was not manipulated.  Winnefeld stressed a North Koren SLBM, if fully developed, would be a serious threat.  Should North Korea eventually develop the capability, it will present a hard-to-detect danger for Japan, South Korea as well as our servicemembers stationed in the region. This only reinforces the importance of regional ballistic missile defense,"" he said.  Winnefeld said the U.S. is interested in using the THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) missile defense system to help defend South Korea from North Korean threats, but emphasized that it is up to the host nation to decide whether to accept the system.  ""Of course, we are interested in the potential for using this system to augment the defense of this important ally, including our own troops who are there to help defend the ROK from attack from the North. It's a good system. It will not pose a threat to any other nation in the region,"" the admiral said.  He stressed that the two countries have not yet engaged in formal negotiations or discussions about the possibility of a THAAD deployment and the U.S. is ""respectful of our host nation's concerns"" and won't put the system there unless Seoul wants the system.  ""So, I'll leave it to the diplomats and the negotiators and the like, but I just want to emphasize one more time, we have not opened up any kind of discussion formally with South Korea on this particular topic,"" Winnefeld said.  ""When it's ripe I'm sure we'll get into that, but we're approaching this very cautiously because we have such great respect for our partners,"" he said.  In Seoul, South Korean military officials dismissed speculation that the imagery of the North's SLBM test was bogus.  ""South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities agree that North Korea succeeded in the shoot-out test of SLBM itself,"" a Defense Ministry official said. ""It has been confirmed to be true that an SLBM was fired from a submarine and soared out of the water to fly around 150 meters."" The remarks by the U.S. admiral seem to emphasize that the North's SLBM technology still falls short of what it wanted to show off.  ""It seems like what he meant is that North Korea's SLBM capability is not at a worrisome level yet,"" the official said, requesting anonymity.

The wage cap has been set at 5 percent per year.   The group of South Korean businessmen with factories in the complex returned home after making a visit to the park earlier in the day to help resolve the prolonged dispute following two previous visits.Seoul had requested its companies not to send out March paychecks, vowing to punish violators. Despite the warning, 49 out of 124 South Korean companies have paid March wages to the North's workers apparently after threats from the North.   The 10-day period of the wage payment for April began Sunday, signaling more tension between the two Koreas. The Ministry of Unification said that there has been a reported work slowdown at the complex.   ""We delivered our difficulties to the North,"" Chung Ki-sup, who led the group, told reporters in Paju, north of Seoul.   He said the group had requested the North accept the current agreement on paychecks based on $70.35 per month. He suggested to the North if the two Koreas produce a breakthrough on their talks on the wage hike, the firms will offer retroactive pay.   The two quasi-state committees from each side have not held talks on the wage dispute since April 20.   ""I could not sense any signs of North Korean workers refusing to come to work,"" Chung said.   The North's committee claimed Wednesday that the South Korean government has violated Pyongyang's sovereignty, threatening to make its workers refuse to work.   ""It is none of the South's business as the industrial park is a special economic zone being operated by the North and South Korean companies,"" the committee said. ""It is wrong for the South to block our move to raise an insignificant amount of wage.""   In return, Seoul called on Pyongyang to rescind its unilateral move and to return to the talks for the resolution of the drawn-out dispute.   The joint factory park, which opened in 2004, is the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation. It has served as a major revenue source for the cash-strapped communist North, while South Korea has utilized cheap but skilled North Korean laborers.

The ministry will review plans to install surveillance cameras at shooting ranges and bulletproof screens between firing lines.  Reservists check their targets at an Army shooting range in Daejeon on Friday. (Yonhap)The military said it would consider providing the instructors with firearms, reinforced helmets and bulletproof jackets during shooting practices. It would also consider giving live ammunition to controllers ― a group of officers who supervise shooting trainings ― to control contingency. Alongside those measures, the ministry said it would suspend shooting practices at the 210th regiment under the 52nd division ― the unit where the shooting incident occurred. In-class marksmanship training will be held instead. Other reserve training camps, however, will proceed with shooting training as scheduled. Instead, the military will seek other safety options, such as putting instructors on every firing line and bringing in available personnel to assist with reserve training, officials said.The measure was announced after a 23-year-old reservist opened fire at his colleagues and turned the gun on himself during a shooting session on Wednesday morning. The reservist, surnamed Choi, had deliberately planned the attack and sent mobile messages hinting at suicide to a friend, the Army said in its interim reports on Thursday.The incident sparked controversy over military safety, as a safety hook was reportedly not fixed properly at that time, allowing the gunman to turn around and shoot colleagues close to him.Nine personnel were working as instructors at the site, but none of them stopped the shooting. The three officers and six enlisted soldiers are said to have hidden when the gunman opened fire. In the meantime, Rep. Yoo Seung-min, floor leader of ruling Saenuri Party, criticized the military for lacking discipline and asked them to halt reserve training and overhaul the training system. “I am shocked that those nine soldiers just ran away while the gunmen was firing point-blank,” Yoo said. “The military should immediately halt reserve trainings and undertake complete overhaul to address such incidents.”The military, however, said that an immediate suspension would be difficult to manage, saying that mobilized reserve training is crucial as the number of reserve forces is dwindling.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","following deadly shooting rampage ,reservists camp halts shooting ,reservists shooting drills to ,camp halts shooting drills ,instructors during shooting training",['the Defense Ministry'],10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32412452 -0.01839563

He then shot himself to death. Citing the results of a probe so far, the Army said the shooter had planned to use the training session as the chance to hurt others and take his own life.""He had sent some 10 text messages to his friend since March which indicated that he would commit suicide during the reservists' exercise,"" said Col. Lee Tae-myung, the chief of the Army's central investigation team. ""For one, he told the buddy on April 22, 'I will die on May 12.Bye,'"" he said. The shooting session was part of a three-day exercise that began on Tuesday.The investigator also pointed to his suicide note as grounds for its interim call that the killings were premeditated.""The shooting drill is due tomorrow. I want to kill them all and commit suicide,"" the shooter said in a two-page suicide note found later in his trouser pocket. ""I don't know what the purpose of living this life is ... I hate everything about myself, my pride, and my external and internal things. I want to die.""Prior to the beginning of the shooting drill, he also asked his instructor to take the leftmost shooting lane out of the total 20, which would allow him a clearer line of fire for the shooting rampage, according to investigators.His medical records also showed that Choi received treatment for mental disorders three times in 2010 before joining the Army, and he again went to the doctor three times after being discharged from the military in 2013. ""We've learned that he had been under stress in recent months after failing to obtain a certificate for welding vessels earlier this year,"" the colonel said.As an active-duty soldier, he had difficulties adjusting to military life, and was put on the military's ""list of soldiers requiring special attention.""As part of efforts to better manage the troops, the military classifies at-risk soldiers into three categories of A to C, factoring in the results of enlistees' psychological consultations and their backgrounds, with A deemed the most vulnerable.""As a Class B soldier, he was subject to extra care by his senior colleagues. Due to his maladjustment, however, he had been moved from one unit to another four times during active-duty service,"" another Army officer said. In the note, the shooter said, ""I should have killed everyone (while serving the duty) at the general outpost and committed suicide. It is really regretful that I missed the chance."" He was last affiliated with the Army division in the inter-Korean border town of Yeoncheon.

""He then aimed at himself and took his own life. Investigators are looking into what caused him to do so,"" he added. Of 445 reservists who took part in the three-day training session from Tuesday, some 200 were participating in the shooting exercise, with exactly what happened before and during the training among the reservists yet to be known.In South Korea, all able-bodied young men are subject to compulsory military service for about two years. Beginning in the following year after completing their active service, reservists are required to take part in an annual three-day training session up to six times in an eight-year period.It is the first time in South Korea's military history that a reservist has opened fire on people, though the country has witnessed several suicides and accidents involving reservists with firearms.While serving as an active-duty soldier, the shooter was on the military's list of draftees ""requiring special attention,"" according to another Army officer. He refused to be identified.   In a move to better manage the troops and to sort out the vulnerable, authorities made the list factoring in the results of enlistees' psychological consultations and their backgrounds.""He had been transferred to several units during his service as he failed to adapt to the barracks life,"" he said, noting Choi was released from the military in 2013. ""According to his medical records, he had received treatment for depression and showed signs of online addiction.""In June, an Army sergeant detonated a grenade and fired on his comrades at their front-line border outpost in Goseong, Gangwon Province, killing five and wounding seven others. He was also classified as a soldier requiring extra care.This latest case sparked public ire over the military's lax management and control of trainings and weapons.""Three captains and six other active-duty soldiers were at the scene, but none of them took action to prevent the casualties,"" another Army officer said. ""A total of 20 lanes were there, and each was supposed to be controlled by one supervisor.""Expressing condolences to the victims and their bereaved family members, the defense ministry vowed to carry out a thorough probe and come up with measures to prevent a recurrence.Meanwhile, South Korean rapper Psy had been at the camp to participate in the training prior to the incident, a source close to him said.The ""Gangnam Style"" star ""was granted an early leave due to an afternoon engagement,"" he said.

The man fired seven shots with his rifle at around 10:44 a.m. during a shooting drill at the 52nd division under Army Capital Defense Command, located in Seocho-gu, southern Seoul. The 23-year-old gunman was only identified with his surname Choi, according to reports. The man fired a K-2 rifle toward other reservists who were calibrating their rifles for “zeroing training,” a process of adjusting a rifle sight. He shot once at the target and suddenly turned around and started shooting at others, Army officials said.A military ambulance leaves a training camp in Naegok-dong, southern Seoul, where a reservist went on a shooting spree, killing one and wounding three, before turning the gun on himself, Wednesday. (Yonhap)The wounded were transported to a military hospital in Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province, and other civilian hospitals near the site. But one died during medical treatment and another was reportedly in a critical condition. The remaining two are said to be stable, according to reports in the afternoon.Defense Minister Han Min-koo apologized to the victims and vowed to conduct a thorough investigation into the incident. Follow-up measures to prevent such incidents would be also taken, he said. “The military will do its utmost to make sure such incidents do not happen again,” the minister was quoted by his spokesperson Kim Min-seok. “(The minister) extended his sincere condolence to those who lost their lives. He wished those injured a speedy recovery,” Kim added. Army Chief of Staff Gen. Kim Yo-hwan, who was visiting the Philippines, canceled the trip and returned home to lead the investigation, officials said.The cause of the incident still remains unclear.But initial reports showed that the gunman was one of soldiers “requiring special attention.” He was rated as class-B with A being the worst. During his service, Choi was sent from one unit to another as he failed to adapt to military life. He also had a medical record of depression, reports added.The military said all victims are reservists. Some 600 reservists were participating in the shooting practice as part of a three-day training session that started on Tuesday. Among the reservists was South Korean singer Psy, who left the site 20 minutes before the incident, reports said. At the incident site, nine active-duty soldiers ― three captains and six enlisted ― were positioned to ensure the safety of 20 firing lines, said the Army. The military, however, refrained from saying whether all the reservists had followed safety rules during the drill.Every eligible South Korean man aged between 18 and 35 is obliged to serve more than two years in the military.

His position was the second highest in the North’s 1.19 million-strong military after Hwang Pyong-so, the director of the General Political Bureau of the military.Hyon, who served in the Army for nearly five decades, has been regarded as one of the most prominent generals in the military-centric country over the last five years.Hyon Yong-chol. (Yonhap)He was promoted to four-star general in September 2010 when he was serving as the commander of the 8th Army Corps, which is in charge of guarding the communist state’s northwestern areas including those near the border with China.Two years later, Hyon was promoted to vice marshal and took up the post of the general staff chief, which is equivalent to Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman. He replaced Ri Yong-ho, who was then regarded as the No. 1 man in the armed forces. Despite his stellar rise up the military ladder, he also had his own share of tribulations. Just a few months after he was promoted to vice marshal, he got demoted to four-star general. In May 2013, he also lost his position as the chief of the Army’s general staff to Kim Kyok-sik, another prominent military figure. He was then demoted again to three-star general and posted to the 5th Corps in charge of the central frontline in the North’s Gangwon Province. But last June, he reemerged to prominence and took the post of the chief of the People’s Armed Forces. He also became a member of the powerful National Defense Commission.Since then, Hyon was seen frequently accompanying Kim when the leader was conducting on-site inspections of military installations and joining special military or national events. Any member of Kim’s entourage is regarded as being in his inner circles.Last July, Hyon was with Kim when the leader paid his respect to the late national founder Kim Il-sung during a ceremony to mark the 20th anniversary of his death at the Geumsusan Palace of Sun. He was also seen accompanying Kim who oversaw military drills at frontline units.The dead general was noticed leading North Korea’s military delegation to Russia to attend a forum on international security last month. On April 25, he was spotted paying his respect to the late leaders Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il at the Geumsusan Palace to mark the 83th anniversary of the founding of the armed forces.Hyon was last seen watching a musical performance in a photo released by the North Korean media late last month.

South Korea remains technically at war with North Korea.Criminalizing those who object to military duty, however, constitutes a violation of human rights, Amnesty International said in its latest report ""Sentenced to Life,"" released at a press conference in Seoul. South Korea currently imprisons more than 600 conscientious objectors, or more than the rest of the world put together, according to the report.Most of them are Jehovah's Witnesses, a Christian group that opposes war, and in their early 20s.Apart from South Korea, only four United Nations member states -- Eritrea, Singapore, Turkey and Turkmenistan -- are believed to have held conscientious objectors in prison as of 2013.Song In-ho, 25, who declined to serve military duty because of his Christian beliefs, said he knew from an early age he would end up in jail.""I was born a criminal. All my life I felt like I was imprisoned because I knew I would be sent to jail,"" Song, who now works for a cleaning company, was quoted as saying in the report.""I was a future criminal.""Not only is rejecting military service shameful, it also spells the end of a prestigious career, Song said.South Korea had at one point considered introducing alternative service for conscientious objectors as demanded by Amnesty International.In 2007, the Ministry of National Defense made the pledge to do so in two years, but the plan fizzled after the Lee Myung-bak administration took power in 2008.South Korea fears conscientious objection may jeopardize national security and undermine social cohesion.A court ruling Tuesday challenged the view.In the first ruling of its kind in eight years, the Gwangju District Court in South Jeolla Province acquitted three Jehovah's Witnesses of violating the Military Service Law.""We need to harmonize the rights to conscience as stated in the constitution and the duty to serve in the military,"" Judge Choi Chang-seok said. The Supreme Court is expected to throw out the acquittal, as it did in 2004 and 2007.The Constitutional Court also ruled in 2004 and 2011 that punishing conscientious objectors is constitutional.

Corp. in Seoul, was indicted in March 2013 on charges that he conspired to export U.S. aircraft parts without the required export licenses to intermediaries in China and Korea and ultimately customers in Iran.The aircraft parts, known as ""accelerators,"" can be used in missile navigation systems.Part of the evidence used in the indictment was a laptop computer that a special Homeland Security Department agent seized from Kim when he was departing the U.S. from Los Angeles International Airport in December 2012.In March this year, Kim filed a motion to suppress the evidence, saying the airport search of the laptop violated his privacy. Kim's case is pending at the U.S. District Court for Washington D.C., and Kim is out on bail after an arrest in late 2014.The court accepted Kim's argument.""There was little or no reason to suspect that criminal activity was afoot at the time Kim was about to cross the border, and there was little about this search -- neither its location nor its scope and duration -- that resembled a routine search at the border,"" Judge Amy Berman Jackson said in a decision announced Friday.The government had argued that a laptop computer was simply a ""container"" examined pursuant to its authority to conduct warrantless searches at the border, and its unfettered right to search cargo at the border is aimed at protecting the country.But the judge pointed out that the search of Kim's laptop began well after Kim had already departed, and it was conducted approximately 150 miles away from the airport. She also said that the government also engaged in an extensive examination of the entire contents of Kim's hard drive after it had already been secured and it accorded itself unlimited time to do so.""The fundamental inquiry required under the Fourth Amendment is whether the invasion of the defendant's right to privacy in his papers and effects was reasonable under the totality of the circumstances,"" the judge said.

Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency booked the local drug firm, whose name was not revealed, and its CEO without detention on charges of violating the Pharmaceutical Affairs Act. Police also booked 10 doctors without detention on charges of breaching the Medical Law in a case that allegedly involves hundreds of other medical professionals. The drug company’s CEO, surnamed Kim, is suspected of creating a slush fund and offering kickbacks to doctors, asking them to prescribe the company’s drugs to their patients between 2010 and 2014. The doctors were found to have received rebates worth up to millions of won. Police have searched the pharmaceutical company and seized its accounts and computer files in January. Apart from its involvement in the rebate scandal, the company is also under suspicion of bribing a tax officer to sway a tax investigation in its favor. Pharmaceutical companies in Korea have a long history of issuing rebates to doctors as part of their sales strategy. Most recently, DongWha Pharmacy, the country’s oldest pharmaceutical company, was caught providing more than 5 billion won worth of rebates to 923 hospitals and clinics nationwide last December.

It also specifies the setup of the committee, such as its subcommittees and their respective roles.The ordinance will come into effect after receiving President Park Geun-hye’s approval.The controversial ordinance has raised eyebrows among its opponents, namely the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy and families of Sewol victims. Bereaved families of victims in last year’s deadly ferry sinking hold a rally Wednesday against the ordinance for the investigation into the accident in Gwanghwamun Square, Seoul. (Yonhap)Under the ordinance, government officials will participate as key members of the committee, which the opposition and the bereaved families suspect is the government’s attempt to dictate the overall direction of the investigation.Critics of the ordinance point out that government officials should not play a prominent role in the probe when the network of corruption between maritime safety regulators and Sewol operators is pinpointed as one of the causes behind the ship’s sinking. Subsequent investigations into the ferry’s founder ascertained that the vessel had been carrying more cargo and less ballast water than regulated by law.“It is very regretful that the government decided to push ahead (with the ordinance) despite protests by the bereaved families, special investigative committee, and the opposition. The president and the government are responsible for all incidents that occur due to this decision,” said NPAD chief Rep. Moon Jae-in at a party supreme council meeting. He added that the current ordinance “hampers any attempts to uncover the truth behind Sewol’s sinking,” and vowed to demand the ruling Saenuri Party join the NPAD’s calls to revise the ordinance.But Yoo Kyung-keun, who represents the families of Sewol victims, also blamed the opposition for failing to stop the ordinance from being passed. He told reporters that families cannot accept it and will “resist the government decision to the end.”Another source of complaint is the high percentage of civil servants in the 90-member investigative committee. Of the 85 nonpermanent members, 36 are government officials.The special investigative committee on Sewol held a press conference in the afternoon and said it will immediately demand a revision to the ordinance. Its leader Lee Seok-tae said the committee will not be held back by the ordinance and would set up its own rules to conduct the probe. In one of South Korea’s worst maritime disasters ever, the ferry sank off the southwest coast on April 16, 2014, and left 304 people dead or missing. Most of its victims were students from Danwon High School in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province, headed toward the resort island of Jejudo. The incident sparked immense criticism of the government after it was revealed that its botched initial rescue operation failed to rescue most of the passengers onboard, although the ship lay on its side for over an hour before capsizing completely.Last month, the government confirmed the salvage plans for the sunken ship. The operation, expected to cost at least 1,000 billion won ($92.5 million), is expected to commence as early as September.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","investigate last year sinking ,ferry touching off protests ,wednesday approved an ordinance ,last year sinking ,300 people dead",[],10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24078646  0.39970994

They usually met in groups of four to eight at a time, police said.

They are allegedly the main drug dealers.

The North could also use the detainees as a negotiating chip should inter-Korean talks reopen.When announcing last month the arrest of the two CNN interviewees -- Kim Kuk-gi and Choe Chun-gil -- North Korea accused them of working as spies for South Korea's main intelligence agency National Intelligence Service (NIS), branding them ""heinous terrorists.""

North Korean minders were present during the interviews, CNN said.CNN also said North Korea is often accused of pushing detainees to make false confessions.Kim was quoted as telling CNN that he was a missionary struggling financially in northern China when the South's spy agency recruited him. They offered to pay for information about the North, such as itineraries of visits by leaders to foreign countries and copies of new North Korean currency to be used in forgery.Kim was also quoted as saying he was paid about $500,000 over roughly nine years.Choe said he was working as a businessman in northern China when he was approached by the South's spy agency to gather information and materials from North Korea. He said he worked as a spy for three years before he was arrested.They said they were being treated well by the North Koreans, accusing the South of disowning them.Choe apologized to his family for getting into trouble.

The KCNA said he has admitted to his ""grave crime"" during interrogation by the North's relevant authorities but it provided no other details, including his motive.In April, the North deported a U.S. woman accused of anti-Pyongyang propaganda activities.Last year, North Korea released three American citizens -- Jeffrey Edward Fowle, Kenneth Bae and Matthew Todd Miller -- who had been detained there for unspecified anti-state crimes.But a South Korean missionary, Kim Jung-wook, remains detained in North Korea after being sentenced to hard labor for life on charges of spying and setting up underground churches.Meanwhile, the KCNA denounced the United States and the United Nations for organizing a forum on Pyongyang's human rights violations in New York earlier this week.

The company, known for its signature health goods made of Chinese traditional medicine Cynanchum wilfordii, used a cheaper toxic ingredient, Cynanchum auriculatum Royal, to make its products, the ministry said. Cynanchum wilfordii and Cynanchum auriculatum Royal are hardly different in their appearance, but the latter is strictly banned from use for human consumption by the Korean government due to safety concerns. The health product manufacturers appeared to have used Cynanchum auriculatum Royal, which requires less time to farm and is cheaper than Cynanchum wilfordii. Cynanchum wilfordii, called “baeksuho” in Korean, has enjoyed popularity among the middle-aged in recent years, for its purported medicinal effects. The herb has been widely known to treat various geriatric diseases, strengthen the immune system and improve blood circulation. It has also been traded on the global online shopping mall eBay. The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety has examined 300 manufacturers whose health products claim to use Cynanchum wilfordii after the Korea Consumer Agency found that Natural Endotech had not used the medicinal plant in its products.The results of the investigation are yet to be revealed, but the ministry confirmed that 13 products, including those by Natural Endotech, have been found to include the illegal herb. But Oriental medicine doctors said that consuming Cynanchum auriculatum Royal would not be as harmful as expected. “In theory, Cynanchum auriculatum Royal can also be used for medicine, though it could be dangerous to use the ingredient as a replacement for Cynanchum wilfordii,” said an official from the Korean Medical Association.

YonhapThe vice minister was killed after complaining about the current reforestation policy, as was the deputy chief of a national planning panel who opposed the young ruler’s instruction to put a flower-shaped roof over a science and technology hall that is under construction in Pyongyang, said Reps. Lee Cheol-woo and Shin Kyoung-min, members of the parliamentary intelligence committee, following a closed-door briefing by the spy agency. The four entertainers of the Unhasu orchestra, a top music group where Kim’s wife Ri Sol-ju is known to have previously worked, were killed in the wake of a sex scandal involving them. Kim Yong-chol, former head of the North’s Reconnaissance General Bureau who is believed to be the mastermind behind the communist country’s deadly attack on a South Korean corvette in 2010, was recently demoted to a three-star general again, the lawmakers said, adding that his rank had been changed at least four times over the last three years. “Kim tends to carry through his thinking without accepting any excuses or reasons at all that may block it, and if you raise any other opinion, you will get executed as an example of what happens when you challenge his authority,” Shin told reporters. “He instantly gives you an order, and you will get demoted if you don’t follow.” The 15 deaths are part of the ongoing string of slayings the Kim regime has been engaging in to tighten his grip since the shock execution in December 2013 of his uncle Jang Song-thaek who was once dubbed the country’s second most influential man. The NIS confirmed that an additional 41 officials were killed last year, Shin noted.Despite lingering uncertainties, the agency sees “quite a high possibility” that Kim will travel to Moscow next month for his maiden overseas outing to take part in a ceremony marking the 70th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany, he added. By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","north korea has executed ,executes 15 top officials ,vice minister was killed ,wednesday leader kim jong ,minister was killed","['North Korea', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Seoul ’s National Intelligence Service', 'N.K.', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Pyongyang']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65070635  0.70248002

The stricken area in Badakhshan province is cut off from the rest of the country, covered in snow and is only accessible from the air, significantly hampering any rescue efforts, said Shah Waliullah Adeeb, the provincial governor.Badakhshan is one of the poorest and least-developed regions of Afghanistan. It regularly suffers huge landslides when snow begins to melt in the spring.Tuesday's landslide struck early in the morning in the province's Khawahan district, near Afghanistan's border with Tajikistan. The isolated area is located about 200 kilometers (124 miles) from the provincial capital, Faizabad. There are no roads leading to it and ""the only way to reach it is by helicopter,"" Adeeb said. ""We won't be able to get there today. We are preparing to go to the area and are waiting for the choppers to take us there.""The deputy head of Afghanistan's National Disaster Management Authority, Mohammad Islam Sayas, said initial reports suggest the avalanche struck only one village but it was likely to have been completely wiped out.""Our emergency team is trying to get to the scene, and have requested the Defense Ministry to provide us with choppers as that is the only way to get there,"" Sayas said. Badakhshan is in the Hindu Kush and Pamir mountain ranges. Unchecked environmental degradation and deforestation across large parts of Afghanistan contribute to a growing problem of landslides when winter snows melt and seasonal rains begin.Afghanistan has suffered through some three decades of war since the Soviet invasion in 1979.

The main part of the recovery will involve divers who will link scores of chains around the hull to two cranes to pull the vessel out of the sea, the ministry noted. Up to 150 billion won (US$139 million) will likely be required for the recovery, although the cost could increase further if the project is delayed or any unexpected technical issues arise. Still, the retrieval also has safety risks and uncertainties, including the possible destruction of the 20-year-old vessel, typhoons in the summer, and a strong current in the shipwreck's location, Park said. ""The government will spend its utmost efforts to salvage the ferry Sewol successfully through the related bodies' full preparations for the work,"" Park said. Oceans Minister Yoo Ki-june  said  his ministry will lead the salvage project, adding it  will start the process soon by selecting salvage firms from home and abroad before coming up with a comprehensive salvage scheme.""The retrieval will be carried out with our full efforts and in a way that does not create collateral safety accidents,"" Yoo said, pledging the government's endeavor to help the victims and their bereaved families. The bereaved families welcomed the decision on the salvage of the ship.They had long called for a speedy retrieval of the hull in hopes to find the bodies of those who are still missing.""We welcome the official announcement of the recovery plans,""Yoo Kyung-keun, the spokesman for the families' group, said.

The former soldiers fought against the invading North Korea backed by China during the 1950-53 war.In a symbolic goodwill gesture, Speakman donated 10 medals he earned during his 23-year military career, including three from his 10-month wartime service in Korea. He was a private affiliated with the First Battalion of the King's Own Scottish Borderers.""I decided to donate my medals to the people of South Korea, because ... you rebuilt your country and what you've done, it truly touches me,"" the elderly man said in a press meeting in Seoul. One of the medals is the Victoria Cross, the highest military decoration awarded for valor to members of the armed forces of Commonwealth countries. Speakman received it from Queen Elizabeth II in 1952.On November 4, 1951, at the age of 24, Speakman led his party in a series of grenade charges against heavy shell and mortar fire by more than 6,000 Chinese forces in the inter-Korean border town of Yeoncheon. Undaunted by severe wounds to his leg, he led operations to help save the lives of many of his comrades when they were forced to withdraw from their position.  Speakman recalled that it was ""not out of bravery but that was the way we were trained.""""(The donation) is just to show you about my appreciation about what you've done, and I sincerely hope that the future generation of South Korea will follow their forebears and look after this beautiful place of yours,"" he said. Expressing his ""sincere hope"" that North Korea will realize the repercussions of being divided, he stressed that ""the whole world wants to get Korea whole again as a beautiful, peaceful and loving place where people can all live together.""The Korean War broke out on June 25, 1950, when North Korean troops, backed by the Soviet Union, invaded the South. The United States and 20 other allied countries fought alongside South Korea under the United Nations flag, while China helped North Korea.

District Court delivered the verdict earlier this month, bringing the total amount of damages North Korea has to pay as results of a series of lawsuits in the U.S. so far to about $777 million, according to diplomatic sources.Rev. Kim Jong-shik was taken by a North Korean kidnapping squad in 2000 from Yanbian in northeastern China, apparently due to his support for North Korean defectors in China. Kim is believed to have died the following year.Kim's family in the U.S. filed the lawsuit in 2009.""This is an important human rights decision that will be utilized in all political abduction cases going forward,"" said the Israel Law Center, known as Shurat HaDin, in a statement. The Israeli civic group filed the suit on behalf of Kim's family.Few expect North Korea to comply with the verdict and pay the damages, but Shurat HaDin is seeking to seize North Korean assets the U.S. government has frozen as part of a series of financial sanctions over Pyongyang's weapons of mass destruction development and other bad behavior.There has been a series of similar verdicts that found the North liable for damages in the U.S.In 2010, Pyongyang was ordered to pay US$370 million in compensation to families of victims for helping the Japanese Red Army and Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine carry out the 1972 Lod Airport massacre in Israel.But it has not been known whether such victims were awarded the compensation.Diplomatic sources say such verdicts are meaningful in that courts clearly determined North Korea's responsibility in terrorism and other bad behavior, but it is legally unclear how frozen North Korean assets can be used to pay such damages.

About 5,100 troops were dispatched halfway around the world to help fight the North's invasion, of which 213 were killed and 448 wounded.About 1,000 veterans are believed to still be alive.The 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, leaving the two Koreas technically in a state of war.""Once again, I deeply appreciate your sacrifices and courage,"" Park in a meeting with about 180 surviving veterans and family members of the war dead at a hotel.High-profile participants included Colombian Navy Commander Admiral Hernando Wills Velez whose father served in the Korean War, and Francisco M. Caicedo, an 85-year-old veteran, who met Park in 1975 when he was invited to Seoul along with other veterans. At that time, Park served as a stand-in first lady because her mother had been killed in a failed assassination attempt on her father, then President Park Chung-hee.Also Saturday, Park met with more than a dozen people from the Korean community in an effort to motivate them to work hard.Later in the day, Park left for Lima for a four-day state visit aimed at further strengthening economic and other relations between the two countries.Park said South Korea and Peru should expand the sphere of cooperation to a much broader range of areas, including healthcare and renewable energy, according to an interview published Friday in Peruvian newspaper Gestion.South Korea and Peru implemented their free trade pact in 2011.Peru is the second stop on Park's four-nation swing to South America. The trip will also take her to Chile and Brazil for separate talks with her counterparts on deepening bilateral relations.On Friday, Park met with her Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, and called for a quick ratification of a free trade agreement to further boost bilateral trade.The sides clinched an FTA in February 2013, but opposition mainly from the automobile sector in Colombia has delayed the domestic ratification process.Colombia's Constitutional Court has yet to approve the deal, while South Korea's parliament has completed its ratification.

President Park visited Jindo Harbor, widely referred to by its old name Paengmok Harbor. She vowed to “seriously consider” salvaging Sewol from the seabed. She fell short of an official promise to initiate operations.  A victim’s family member cries while laying a flower at a memorial held in Incheon to mark the first anniversary of the Sewol ferry disaster on Thursday. (Yonhap)The ship lies some 40 meters below the surface near Jindo Island, South Jeolla Province, where it sank on April 16 last year. The tragedy left 304 dead, with nine bodies still missing. Families say the bodies are likely inside the shipwreck.But families of the missing, who have camped in makeshift homes at Jindo Harbor since the accident, vacated the spot upon hearing of the president’s planned visit, in an apparent show of protest.Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo and Saenuri Party chair Rep. Kim Moo-sung also made separate visits to a memorial altar at Ansan, Gyeonggi Province, where the pictures of 273 victims are displayed, most of them former students at Danwon High School in Ansan.But bereaved families there turned their backs on the prime minister, asking that he leave the memorial.“We do not want to hear that you will do your best (to salvage the ship), prime minister, we want an outright commitment that the government will start salvage operations,” said Jeon Myeong-seon, a spokesman for the victims’ relatives.Relatives also urged the government to repeal an enforcement decree that formed a special committee to investigate the sinking. The decree puts investigators under the watch of the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries and the presidential office. The relatives oppose government officials sitting on the probe panel. The government should be a subject of the probe, not a member of it, they said.A brawl between the bereaved and Saenuri Party officials broke out at the memorial altar when Kim visited later Thursday. Kim was unable to pay his respects due to the families’ opposition to his visit, a witness said. Police broke up the scrum, before he left the scene under police protection.The victims’ families eventually canceled the memorial service at the Ansan altar, saying that the government had failed to heed their demands to salvage the ship and repeal the decree on future probes.“We listened to President Park’s speech today,” Yoo Gyoung-geun, a family spokesman and a father of a victim, said. “But everything she said was absolutely meaningless.”Thursday’s visits by Saenuri officials came after an earlier attempted visit to Jindo Harbor by Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min on Wednesday.Yoo had stopped by the harbor to attend a memorial service but left when families of the student victims booed and demanded he leave.Meanwhile, lawmakers at the National Assembly passed a resolution earlier Thursday, urging the Park administration to salvage the Sewol. The bipartisan resolution passed 161 to 2, with two legislators abstaining.Lawmakers wore black at the plenary meeting Thursday, and held a moment of silence before the vote.South Koreans throughout the country held separate memorial services to commemorate the disaster. Local government offices in Ansan, Jeju Province and Incheon ― areas most affected by the tragedy ― held separate memorial services.In Ansan, a siren rang throughout the industrial city of 760,000 at 10 a.m. signaling a moment of silence.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","killed in deadly ferry ,families south korean president ,party and park criticizing ,deadly ferry disaster year ,ferry disaster expressed anger","['south korean', 'Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.26293483  0.32420111

Two of these men remain at large, said Park, who leads SMPA's international security investigation team.Keum, a mother of twin daughters who had been homeless before meeting Mohhammad, agreed to marry him because she had no stable source of income and the man had promised her housing and monthly allowances. Mohhammad, who has a wife and children back in his home country, had worked in South Korea illegally since 1999 and was able to afford a place for Keum and her two daughters.Mohhammad became a South Korean citizen in June 2005 and divorced Keum seven months later.Within three months of their divorce, Mohhammad asked Keum to marry his friend, surnamed Ali, who never got to obtain South Korean citizenship due to a separate immigration fraud that led to his deportation in 2010. Ali has since been blacklisted.Last year, Mohhammad connived with his brother, who had also gained South Korean citizenship through a sham marriage, to have Keum's 21-year-old daughters marry their sons for the same reason. Police have yet to identify the whereabouts of Mohhammad's brother. Mohhammad's son wasn't naturalized with his father because Mohhammad had entered South Korea under a fake name.Keum and the girls were denied monthly rent, allowances and cell phone payments they had been promised after the first few months of their marriages.The scam was only revealed after Mohhammad's son molested one of Keum's daughters. Keum reported them to police, although she knew she and her daughters could face prosecution.Sham marriages in South Korea are punishable by up to 10 years in prison or a maximum fine of 50 million won ($46,000). The Mohhammads also face charges of fabricating official documents and sexual assault.

A group of armed gunmen fired 40 shots from a machine gun while driving past the embassy early on Sunday, killing two Libyan guards and wounding another. The Tripoli chapter of the Islamic State militant group claimed responsibility via Twitter, saying it had “removed” two guards. The Foreign Ministry convened an intra-agency meeting to assess the situation in the region hit by the rise of IS, while exploring ways to ensure the safety of its staff and some 35 Koreans remaining in the conflict-laden country. Chaired by Lee Key-cheol, ambassador for overseas Koreans and consular affairs, the session was attended by director-general-level officials from Cheong Wa Dae, the National Intelligence Service, police and the defense and other four ministries. The embassy was relocated to Tunisia last July due to soaring security concerns. Two diplomats have since been shuttling between the two countries for alternate two-week stints to continue political affairs and consular services, aided by local administrative officers. The focal point will be whether the incident was explicitly directed at the embassy, officials say. News reports suggested that the assailants aimed at the guards given differences in the patterns of the organization’s previous attacks on other embassies and facilities. Unlike the past, they did not attempt to break in and open fire on those inside the building. Yonhap News quoted an unnamed source as saying that a police probe was underway, as signs had emerged that the officers were “implicated in some argument.” “We held a meeting Sunday led by a vice foreign minister to look into the possibility for a complete transfer of the embassy to Tunisia and decided to individually contact all remaining citizens in Libya to recommend to pull out,” Lee said at the outset of the session. “Today we’ve gathered to examine whether the IS did indeed carry out the attack and its background, and share views on future measures to protect our citizens there.” The Foreign Ministry issued a statement condemning the attack, saying “no attack or violence against a foreign diplomatic mission can be justified.” The U.S. and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also displayed strong condemnation and offered condolences to the families of the victims. “The ongoing escalation of violence in Libya against civilians and its critical institutions further widens a conflict that is fundamentally political, which in turn makes Libya and its citizens vulnerable to extremist actors,” a U.S. State Department spokesperson said in a statement. Safety concerns persist in Libya as the battle drags out between rival governments and strong militias jockeying for control following the 2011 death of longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi. Currently, only 18 countries maintain diplomatic missions there, 10 of which are African nations. Alongside Turkey and Ukraine, six Asian states continue to operate missions, including North Korea, India, Pakistan, the Philippines and Bangladesh. Seoul has also imposed a travel ban in the North African country, as well as in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan and Somalia.

The incident took place at around 1:20 a.m. Libyan time when the assailants fired some 40 shots from a machine gun as they drove by the embassy, an official said. The Islamic State militant group claimed responsibility about two hours later on Twitter, saying it had “removed” two guards at the facility. The three officers who were affiliated with Libya’s Interior Ministry were sent to a nearby hospital by local residents, but two later died. The ministry temporarily relocated its embassy to Tunis last year due to growing security concerns. Two Korean diplomats, who are assigned to move between the two cities for two weeks in turn, and one assistant serving at the embassy were unharmed, the official said, adding it is considering a complete withdrawal from the conflict-ridden country. The compound is protected by about 20 special security forces, in line with the embassy’s request. “We do not know if those in the vehicle targeted the embassy or the police officers there, but other than on the exterior walls, there is no damage inside, including to our diplomats and administrative officer,” he told reporters on condition of anonymity. “The local police immediately opened a probe, which is still underway. Embassy officials phoned the police chief to call for a thorough and swift investigation, as well as an increase in security personnel.” The unprecedented attack is set to heighten further safety concerns in the Middle East that prompted Seoul to impose a travel ban in five countries ― Libya, Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Afghanistan. With infighting stoking instability since the 2011 death of longtime ruler Muammar Gaddafi, the diplomatic missions of other countries in the region have also been attacked by armed gunmen in recent years, including those of the U.S., the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. In January, a Korean teenager went missing in Turkey after taking a route that locals say is typically chosen by aspiring IS jihadists to sneak into Syria. The National Intelligence Service said in February that the 18-year-old man was training to become a member of the extremist group.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","sunday killing two libyan ,killing two libyan guards ,gunmen attacked the south ,armed gunmen attacked the ,tripoli on sunday killing","['south korean', 'Tripoli', 'libyan', 'Foreign Ministry', 'libyan', 'Islamic']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.47813427  1.07567596

The project could easily last up to 18 months depending on weather conditions.The country's conservative groups are opposed to spending large amounts of taxpayers' money to salvage the sunken ferry. The government earlier said it has already spent some 185 billion won, mostly on search and rescue operations that lasted nearly seven months after the tragic sinking of the ship.It said at least an additional 250 billion won will be needed to compensate the victims, as well as residents and fishermen near the accident site who were forced to halt their daily jobs due to the prolonged search and rescue operation.The ministry official said other methods of recovery considered included using only offshore cranes, which will likely cost less than using both cranes and a floating dock.

321,321,[Newsmaker] Court reviews antiprostitution law,"The debate on legalizing prostitution has heated up in South Korea as the Constitutional Court began reviewing the law that criminalizes the sex trade.

The court held its first public hearing Thursday.The antiprostitution law was enacted in 2004 to protect human rights, partly prompted by fire that killed 14 sex workers who were locked in a brothel in Gunsan, North Jeolla Province, in 2002. The law stipulates that both purchasing and selling of sex carry a penalty of up to one year in prison or a fine of up to 3 million won ($2,747). It gives exemption to people forced into prostitution, leaving only voluntary sex workers ― many of whom oppose the law ― subject to the punishment.A 41-year-old woman accused of selling sex for 130,000 won filed for a constitutional review of the law in 2012. The woman argued that punishing voluntary prostitution, especially when the sex worker has no other means of income, was a violation of fundamental human rights. Activists hold a rally to demand a repeal of the anti-sex trade law in front of the Constitutional Court on Thursday. (Yonhap)“Are we (sex workers) doing something that is worse than stealing? Is what we do worse than murder?” the woman said back in 2012.Her request for a review was granted by the Seoul Northern District Court and eventually by the Constitutional Court. Police crackdowns on brothels have also had damaging outcomes in recent years. Last year, a prostitute in Tongyeong, South Gyeongsang Province, jumped from a motel during a raid and died. A police officer had reportedly approached her while pretending to be a client.Those who are against the antiprostitution law claim there is little evidence that punishing sex workers is effective in curbing the sex trade. According to government data, the number of female sex workers increased by 3.8 percent from 2010 to 2013, in spite of the law.According to a study last year by the Gender Equality Ministry, almost 80 percent of female sex workers were in their 20s and 30s as of 2013. Also, 86.6 percent of the surveyed women grew up in broken homes, while 13.4 percent suffered from poverty and domestic abuse before turning to prostitution. Sixty percent of them began working as sex workers as teenagers after running away from home. The Gender Equality Ministry, which regularly conducts a joint crackdown against sex workers with police, said the current law was necessary to protect women’s rights, especially teenagers. “The idea that it’s necessary to scrap the antiprostitution law is irresponsible and dangerous,” said an official from the Korean Women Lawyers Association, which has a member representing the government during the review.“What we need is in fact stricter punishment of the sex trade to protect our young children.”Kim Hye-sook, a philosophy professor at Ewha Womans University also thinks the current law needs to be kept. “I would be willing to consider legalization of prostitution in a positive light if Korea was a more just and fair society,” she said.“Yet there is still a lot of discrimination (against women) at workplaces and the glass ceiling is still pervasive. We need to examine what pushes the women into prostitution first before considering giving them freedom to choose (sex work) as their job.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","killed 14 sex workers ,legalizing prostitution has heated ,criminalizes the sex trade ,first public hearing thursday ,killed 14 sex","['South Korea', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Gunsan', 'North Jeolla Province']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49578714 -0.09110055

In Germany and the Netherlands, however, prostitution is legal as long as it is for one's livelihood.   Around 250 sex workers, mostly clad in sunglasses to apparently hide their identities, showed up to submit their petitions and attend the first public hearing on the issue. Only half, however, were allowed to enter the court room due to limited space.    The case came after a 44-year-old woman accused of sex trafficking in 2012 for what she claims was for a living filed a petition with the court, questioning the constitutionality of the current law.   Jeong Gwan-yeong, attorney for the woman, surnamed Kim, said South Korea should allow prostitution on a small scale, noting for some women, it's the only means to make ends meet.   ""Most of these workers have no other means of earning a living,"" he told the justices at the hearing.   But opinions vary even among those who want the law repealed.   For instance, Kim Kang-ja, a renowned activist for the legalization of prostitution, says both buying and selling sex should be allowed.    ""Everyone should have equal opportunities for sex,"" she told reporters after the hearing. ""Even single fathers or people with disabilities.""   The justice ministry, however, maintains most South Koreans believe sex trafficking is wrong.   ""There's a common need for us to ban and punish prostitution,"" one of the justices said.   Sex trafficking law in South Korea was first legislated in 2004, after fires in the red light district in Gunsan, 274 kilometers south of Seoul, in 2000 and 2002, revealed the poor conditions in which prostitutes worked.   Justices are to rule on the constitutionality of the law by the end of this year.

The body of Sung Woan-jong, former chairman of Keangnam Enterprises, was found hanging from a tree some 300 meters from a ticket booth in Mount Bukhansan. A suicide note was found at his home.Sung’s death comes just days after prosecutors charged him of embezzling 80 billion won ($73 million) in government subsidies obtained by inflating accounting records. Officials also accused Sung of swindling those funds. He had denied the charges at a teary news conference on Wednesday.Sung’s death is expected to impede prosecutorial probes into alleged scandals surrounding the former Lee Myung-bak government’s policy of investing trillions in tax money in energy development projects abroad in early 2010.(Yonhap)Prosecutors had hoped Sung’s extensive networks in both business and politics would provide evidence linking the Korea Resources Corporation, Korea National Oil Corporation, and Korea Gas Corporation to alleged bribery violations and influence peddling scandals.Former President Lee’s resource policy had aimed to lessen energy-poor Korea’s dependence on natural resource imports by increasing investments in overseas energy projects. But prosecutors are looking into long-held suspicions that some Lee administration officials had swindled public money in backroom deals with foreign companies under the guise of the energy policy.The National Assembly is also conducting its own probe into the Lee administration’s energy policy. Opposition lawmakers have demanded President Lee testify at the legislature, while some governing Saenuri Party lawmakers criticized the probe as being politically motivated.Sung, a former Saenuri Party lawmaker, had called the investigations a politically-charged witch hunt.“Many other companies had participated in resource development projects (under the Lee administration) at the time,” he added. “I do not understand why only we are being targeted.”Sung was last seen at his home at 5:10 a.m. on Thursday. His driver and son notified police after finding the suicide note. Sung also did not appear for a court hearing later in the morning. Judges were to decide if prosecutors could detain Sung on related charges. Earlier Thursday, about 1,300 officers, police dogs, military personnel, and helicopters were deployed to Pyeongchang-dong, a district in northwestern Seoul, and its surrounding areas, as Sung’s phone was last reported in the area, according to telecommunications signals, police said.Police also found closed-circuit television camera footage showing Sung hiking up the mountain near the Pyeongchang-dong police office a few hours after he was reported missing.Prosecutors expressed regret over Sung’s death and sent words of condolence to his bereaved family.Sung was a businessman-turned politician. Born into poverty in the midst of the Korean War in 1951, Sung was an elementary school drop-out and a self-made entrepreneur. He earned a seat in the Assembly in the 2012 parliamentary elections. He lost his seat last June when the Supreme Court fined him 5 million won for violating election laws.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","suicide police on thursday ,graft suspect found dead ,in apparent suicide police ,dead in apparent suicide ,suspect found dead in","['Sung Woan - jong', 'Keangnam Enterprises', 'Mount Bukhansan']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50581682 -0.14108235

The wage cap has been set at 5 percent.  South Korea plans to propose future talks to North Korea through the committee, according to government officials. The North has so far spurned the South's call for government-level dialogue.  Seoul's efforts for the talks have gained urgency as the deadline for the payment of March wages is April 20.  The industrial complex opened in the early 2000s and is the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation. It has served as a major revenue source for the cash-strapped communist country.

Those measures included the dissolution of the Coast Guard and the establishment of a new government ministry tasked with overseeing disaster control.  Critics have questioned the effectiveness of such measures.  Some experts claim, however, that part of the problem lies in an excessive reliance on the government. The public has a responsibility to actively participate in the construction of a safer society, they say.  ""It's too bad the government is trying to do everything,"" Lee Jae-eun, a public administration professor at Chungbuk National University, said. ""We should build 'safety governance' under which local governments, civic groups and businesses independently find and resolve safety issues.""  Others stress a more hands-on approach to disaster prevention.  ""Until now, there's been a tendency to neglect the field and solve issues through administrative means,"" said Oh Won-shin, an expert at a school for firefighting safety in Incheon, west of Seoul. ""In a culture that neglects the importance of the field and counts people's precious lives only in terms of numbers, one or two more deaths in the field are seen by the staff in charge of safety as largely irrelevant to their work.""  Park Beom-soon, a professor at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, called for sincere reflection on the disaster.  ""The accidents and disasters of the past were a result of our 'compressed growth,'"" he said, referring to South Korea's rapid industrialization that has often been blamed for shoddy infrastructure. ""As our society continued to be growth-driven, there was no proper introspection or self-reflection, leading to repeated tragedies.""

Critics have argued that the government's bungled initial response to the disaster contributed to the high death toll.""I express my deep condolences to the families of the missing and the bereaved families who have lived with pain in their hearts,"" Park said during a meeting with her senior secretaries at her office, Cheong Wa Dae.She said a technical review is under way to determine whether the ship can be salvaged.""If a conclusion is reached that (the ship's) recovery is technically feasible, (we) will gather the opinions of the families of the missing and experts, as well as public opinion and actively consider raising the hull.""The recovery process has been estimated to cost 620 billion won ($560 million).The government officially terminated the search for the missing in early November, citing inclement weather and safety risks for divers.

Last year, a 45-year-old Chinese captain of a ship was killed while resisting a similar raid.

Most of the victims were high school students on a field trip to the southern island of Jeju.  The government will provide more than 1.1 million won to each family, consisting of four members, or about 270,000 won per person, for a duration of six months to financially help them weather the accident.  Students younger than college-age in the families will also be given free tuition for two years while college-level students will receive two semesters of free tuition.   Mental counseling and rehabilitation programs will also be offered to the victims' families to help their rehabilitation.  The committee of nine vice ministers and other private experts, chaired by Choo Kyung-ho, the policy coordinating minister at the Prime Minister's Office, plans to meet again in mid-April to approve further support measures.   ""The opinions of the victims and bereaved families should be considered foremost in deciding the support measures and commemoration events,"" Choo said during the meeting.  The prospect of the compensation package being accepted by the bereaved families remained murky, however, as the mainstream group of victims' families stepped up their protest against the government's handling of the tragic accident partly attributed to lax supervision and failed state rescue measures.  A group of victims' families held a head-shaving protest in central Seoul a day earlier, demanding the withdrawal of the government process to hand out compensations. They claimed the bodies of the nine people who remained unaccounted for should be retrieved first before the compensations are made.

Relatives of the victims of the Sewol ferry disaster shave their heads in Gwanghwamun Square in downtown Seoul, Thursday. (Yonhap)“All we ask is that the ferry be towed out from the sea, so that those still missing can be found and that officials fully investigate the cause of the disaster,” Yoo added.The 6,800-ton passenger ferryboat Sewol sank in waters off southwestern Korea last April, killing 304. Nine are still missing. Most of those killed were students of Danwon High School at Ansan, Gyeonggi Province, an industrial town south of Seoul.The Oceans Ministry announced Wednesday that the government would pay about 720 million won ($657,000) to every family that lost a child in the disaster. The costs were tallied by taking into account the foregone wages of the teenagers who had not lived to be adults.Families said Thursday’s conference was organized to express their “utter disgust” at such plans.“Do you think it’s just going to be OK if you throw money at us?” one mother yelled in anger. “Why do we have to be the ones suffering on the streets? What have we done to deserve this?”Most of the fathers remained silent, their eyes closed, with looks of both despair and determination.Supporters of the families shaved the heads of about 50 parents. Some of the mothers started weeping as their long wavy hair slowly fell to the gray asphalt streets of downtown Seoul. The families also demanded the government give more authority to a special investigative committee formed earlier this year to investigate the disaster’s causes. The committee was formed after the bereaved families refused to accept the results of earlier prosecutorial and parliamentary probes, saying they were insufficient.The committee’s mandate, written by the government last month, would put investigators under the close watch of the Oceans Ministry, which some families accuse of avoiding responsibility for the accident. It comes into effect next Monday. Some of the families, and 10 of the 17 members on the probe committee have strongly urged the government to revise the mandate.“I will not give up,” one mother said, her voice quivering as tears rolled down her cheeks. “I will not allow myself to see my son in heaven and tell him that I’m sorry.”“I will make sure I’m able to look him in the eyes and tell him that I did my part.”By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","students killed in ferry ,high school students killed ,seoul the parents shaved ,school students killed ,ferry accident last year",['Seoul'],10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60321265 -0.07162752

He was referring to a package of bilateral sanctions on Pyongyang.He also dismissed Pyongyang's claim that Seoul is cooking up a story on wartime abductees.Many South Korean nationals were forcibly taken to the communist nation during the 1950-53 Korean War, and some of them are believed to be still alive there, according to the South's government.The North said the South's view is groundless and it is making false reports for propaganda purposes.Lim said his government will continue efforts to confirm the fate of the abductees and get them repatriated.""We urge North Korea to respond positively to our humanitarian demand (with regard to the abductee issue),"" he said.Earlier Monday, North Korea played down South Korea's decision to join a China-led regional bank as a trade-off for the deployment of an advanced U.S. missile defense system on its soil.On its propaganda website, Uriminzokkiri, the North claimed the U.S. will take a full-fledged step to send a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery to the peninsula as quid pro quo for allowing Seoul to become a member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).After months of internal debate, the South's government announced its decision last week to participate in the envisioned AIIB, which Washington apparently views as part of Beijing's efforts to expand its influence.On its part, the U.S. is considering deploying the THAAD system in South Korea, citing growing military threats from the nuclear-armed North.Chinese officials believe Washington is actually seeking to curb Beijing's clout.The AIIB and THAAD issues represent a grim reality facing South Korea, sandwiched between its top ally and major economic partner next door.The North said the U.S. is ratcheting up pressure on Seoul for the deployment of THAAD after letting it join the AIIB.If THAAD is deployed on the peninsula, it added, the South and the U.S. will face serious consequences of war risks and an arms race.

The militant group has expanded its influence following its seizure of the capital Sanaa in September.Seoul's foreign ministry said eight Korean residents in Sanaa and two embassy employees departed for Djibouti on a U.N. plane earlier in the day as part of the evacuation plan.The evacuation reduced the total number of South Koreans in Yemen to 28 who include two diplomats.""We considered a number of issues including the fact that this plane may be the last way out (of Yemen), but decided that at least some of our embassy staff should stay behind if there are people wishing to stay,"" a foreign ministry official said, asking that he not be identified.Before the evacuation, 20 Koreans were living in the capital and 18 others in three different areas, including Taiz.Most of the Koreans still remaining in Yemen opted not to leave the country, according to ministry officials.As security concerns are growing, many countries, including the United States, Britain, Germany, France and Japan have temporarily closed their embassies in Yemen.Yemen is one of the six countries on which Seoul has imposed travel bans. The five other countries are Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Afghanistan. Travel to those nations requires special government permission.

Lee's body has been lying in state in parliament since Wednesday after he died on Monday at the age of 91.The city-state has a population of 5.5 million, but only 3.34 million are citizens. The rest are guest workers, expatriates and their families.Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in a Facebook post Friday he was ""deeply moved by the overwhelming response"" of people wanting to pay respects to his father's lying in state.But as many might not be able to do so because of the long queues, the government has set up a YouTube link (https://youtu.be/u7fvd6ndZkc) for people to follow the events live, he said.Lee, who died after a long illness, is credited with the rise of the former British colony into one of the world's wealthiest societies after he served as prime minister for 31 years, followed by another 20 years as cabinet adviser.There has been a widespread show of grief -- accompanied by tributes from world leaders -- over the passing of the patriarch who governed Singapore with an iron fist, sidelining political opponents, muzzling the media and restricting political freedoms as he steered the economy to prosperity.Lee is to be given full state honours before being cremated Sunday, including a 21-gun salute and a flypast by fighter jets. Former US President Bill Clinton, South Korean President Park Geun-Hye,  Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Malaysian King Sultan Abdul Halim Mu'adzam Shah are among the confirmed state representatives attending the funeral.","cremation this weekend officials ,his cremation this weekend ,cremation this weekend ,parliament late friday for ,10 singapore citizens queue","['SINGAPORE', 'AFP', 'Singapore', 'Lee Kuan Yew']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.12282491  0.52833855

Otherwise, local authorities would have had to ask the USFK to turn him over, according to the Status of Forces Agreement, which gives U.S. military personnel immunity from South Korean law.""The USFK appears to have considered the diplomatic implications of keeping him employed,"" a police official said, asking not to be identified.The suspect reportedly told officers that he was looking for a hospital to refill his prescription for heart disease and doesn't remember the details because he was suffering from heartburn at the time.Closed-circuit TV footage, however, shows his brake lights coming on, suggesting he noticed the officer in front of him. A woman who was with him said she told him to stop the car but he refused to listen.A doctor who diagnosed him said memory loss was not related to heartburn. The suspect also did not have heart disease, he added.Authorities said the accident, therefore, appeared intentional.Only about 0.55 percent, or 385, of all USFK personnel, including civilian employees, faced trial from 2013 to 2014, according to the USFK spokesman. Of them, 144 were convicted. He did not mention the number of personnel who were charged with crimes during that time.There are about 28,000 U.S. soldiers stationed in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean, which left the two Koreas divided and technically still at war.

A South Korean-led investigation, including experts from the U.S., Australia, Britain and Sweden, concluded that the corvette was downed by a North Korean torpedo, but Pyongyang has denied any responsibility.Speaking at a memorial ceremony in Daejeon National Cemetery, 164 kilometers south of Seoul, Park vowed to push for reunification of the two Koreas to honor the fallen soldiers.""The government will expand our national defense capabilities and establish a firm war deterrent based on our solid alliance with the United States, and ensure that incidents similar to the attack on the Cheonan never happen again,"" Park said in her address to the more than 5,000 people gathered, including the bereaved families, survivors, top government officials and citizens.She also ordered the military to be on the alert against unexpected provocations and block all such possibilities.""I hope North Korea also abandons its reckless provocations and belief that nuclear weapons can protect it,"" Park said. ""Only when North Korea abandons its isolation and stagnation for the road to true change will we be able to build a new Korean Peninsula.""This year marks the 70th year since Korea gained independence from Japanese colonial rule and came under U.S. military occupation in the South and Soviet occupation in the North.""Realizing a unified homeland where people of both the South and North are happy is sure to be an earnest wish of our patriotic martyrs and a way to ensure that the sacrifices of the Cheonan soldiers were not in vain,"" Park said.South Koreans across the country marked the anniversary with memorial ceremonies, photo exhibitions, concerts and marches.In the southeastern port city of Busan, more than 3,000 students and citizens are expected to gather at a square to commemorate the anniversary.The Navy is also scheduled to hold meetings and carry out drills at each unit.

Such events, however, have been organized by South Korean civic groups in China before. The Chinese government built the memorial hall honoring Ahn early last year at the railway station in Harbin, where Ahn killed Ito. Ahn is viewed in both Korea and China as a symbol of the fight against Japan's Imperial Army, but Japanese officials have drawn criticism by describing him as a terrorist. In 1910, Ahn was executed at a Japanese prison in the northern Chinese town of Ryojun, now called Lushun.Lee Kyung-geun, a senior official at South Korea's Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs, and several lawmakers, including Rep. Suh Chung-won of the ruling Saenuri Party, led the memorial service held at the Lushun prison museum in the Lushun district of the northeastern coastal city of Dalian. In a speech read by Lee, Park Sung-choon, the South Korean minister of patriots and veterans affairs, said, ""The righteous movement by Martyr Ahn sounded the alarm against imperialists worldwide at the time."" Rep. Suh called for Japan to demonstrate its ""genuine remorse"" over its wartime history as this year marks the 50th anniversary of establishing diplomatic relations between South Korea and Japan. The assassination by Ahn took place a year before the Korean Peninsula was formally subjugated by Japan as its colony.

On March 26, 2010, the 1,200-ton warship sank while on a training mission in the Yellow Sea, killing 46 out of the 104 sailors on board. A South Korean-led international investigation concluded that a North Korean submarine torpedoed the ship, though Pyongyang has denied responsibility.""As we've experienced the enemy's attack, our focus has been on how to boost anti-submarine capabilities,"" said Cmrd. Choi Won-il, who led the ship at the time of the tragedy, stressing his and his colleagues' firm resolution to repel provocations by the North ""at any cost.""According to Navy headquarters, the military has equipped its newest Type-214, 1,800-ton submarines and destroyers with Haesung, an anti-ship cruise missile which can fly some 1,000 kilometers.Last month, the Navy also inaugurated a submarine command in the southern port city of Jinhae, becoming the world's sixth country to have such an entity. The command has taken full charge of submarine-related activities ranging from operations, education and training to maintenance and logistical support.It now operates 13 submarines -- nine 1,200-ton submarines and four 1,800-ton subs, with the Navy to add five more 1,800-ton submarines by 2019 and to deploy nine 3,000-ton submarines capable of launching ballistic missiles starting in 2020.In a move to beef up coastal defense capabilities, the Navy has been replacing 1,500-ton frigates and 1,000-ton patrol ships with 2,300-ton next-generation frigates which have a state-of-the-art sonar system and torpedo acoustic countermeasure equipment so they can avoid another torpedo attack. ""After a four-year project, the military completed building a three-dimensional geographic information analysis system for effective operations,"" a Navy officer said. ""We've also bolstered coastal artillery forces in the Yellow Sea.""North Korea, however, has further heightened tensions by making good on threats of provocations and continuing its military build-up near the Northern Limit Line, the de facto inter-Korean sea border.In October last year, South and North Korean patrol boats briefly exchanged fire after a North Korean naval vessel violated the NLL.Declaring 2015 the year of completing unification, the bellicose regime has carried out maritime exercises in the Yellow and East Seas under the scenarios of striking a U.S. aircraft carrier and attacking South Korea's Spike missiles bases on the border islands, according to the Navy. Pyongyang is also known to have been developing a submarine-launched ballistic missile in a move to boost its underwater missile strike capabilities after launching a new 2,500-ton submarine last year.""North Korea has significantly boosted its ability to launch surprise infiltration by, for example, building small submarines for littoral operations,"" an officer of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said. ""Though it is believed to have superiority in the sheer number of submarines, we are confident in our capabilities to counter their attacks. Enemies will be sure to be buried exactly where they launch the provocations,"" he added. The North has some 70 vessels, including about 20 1,800-ton Romeo-class submarines.Later on Thursday, a memorial ceremony will be held at the national cemetery in Daejeon, 164 kilometers south of Seoul, to be attended by bereaved families, surviving crew members, senior government officials and military officers. Of the 58 rescued sailors, 32 are still in service.

Nine people remain unaccounted for.The government said it has finished evaluating how and when the ferry would be lifted from the ocean in May. But it has yet to announce whether it will actually go ahead with the plan.

(Yonhap)The Cheonan case was one of the biggest turning points in inter-Korean relations.The Lee government imposed a package of tough economic sanctions on Pyongyang, effectively suspending all inter-Korean joint projects except for the Kaesong Industrial Complex. The current Park Geun-hye administration maintains that the North should first take a responsible measure in connection with the Cheonan incident if it wants to see the sanctions, dubbed the May 24th Measure, lifted.The South has been putting more pressure on the North as it marks the fifth anniversary of the March 26 tragedy this week.The North's commission, however, argued that the South ""cooked up"" the Cheonan story in a bid to nullify the two inter-Korean summit deals in 2000 and 2007.""The warship sinking case and the 'May 24 step' taken by them in its wake were a vivid manifestation of the anti-reunification acts,"" said the policy department of the organ directly headed by leader Kim Jong-un.It urged the South to immediately lift the sanctions, saying they are ""based on the fictitious story about the North's 'involvement' in the sinking.""""If the South Korean authorities truly wish for the improvement of the North-South relations, they should bear in mind that they have to move first to lift the measure,"" it added.The commission also demanded a re-investigation into the Cheonan sinking, calling on the South to reveal all related evidence associated with it.The South dismissed the North's statement and urged it to stop ""distorting"" relevant facts.""It was clearly found through an international probe that the Cheonan sinking was done by North Korea,"" a unification ministry official told reporters, saying it's the government's formal position.It's regrettable that Pyongyang is still condemning the South by distorting what actually happened, he added.The official made it clear that the North should take a sincere step to address the Cheonan issue in order for the May 24th Measure to be lifted.

Five people, including three children, were killed, while two were injured after a fire engulfed a 16-square-meter tent on Ganghwa Island in Incheon. Two families were sleeping in the tent, police said. Investigators said the electric panel used for heating in the tent appears to have sparked the blaze, which engulfed the tent made from combustible material in about three minutes. Fire extinguishers at the campsite also did not work, they added.  Police investigating Sunday’s deadly campsite fire confiscate items found at the scene, located near a beach on Ganghwado Island, Incheon, Monday. (Yonhap)Police are reportedly considering charging the head, manager and actual owner of the campsite for negligence resulting in death and sought an overseas travel ban against them. If the court issues the ban, their status will change to suspects, police said. “They appear to be responsible for causing the deaths by establishing a facility vulnerable to fire,” investigators said. Earlier in the day, authorities raided the campsite owner’s office and seized license-related documents, following questioning on Sunday over whether the site was properly equipped with fire equipment, they said. The tragic fire prompted calls to fortify the blind spot around safety regulations on increasing the number of outdoor camping facilities nationwide.Under accommodation law, lodgings are required to register their business to authorities and have appropriate safety equipment. Outdoor campsites, however, have not been considered as accommodation facilities, although they operate as quasi-lodgings equipped with various electrical home appliances and heating devices. The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism ordered outdoor accommodation owners to register their businesses in January with a grace period of five months until May. The campsite where the fire broke out was not registered.According to the ministry, 90 percent of some 1,800 campsites in the country remain unregistered.When the National Disaster Management Institute conducted a random safety inspection in 2013, about 80 percent of 430 campsites across the country received the lowest grade of “E” in safety. Only 17 of them acquired the “A” grade. As the number of people camping soared to nearly 4.8 million as of 2012, the number of accidents at outdoor accommodations also drastically increased to 4,300, jumping 15-fold since 2010, data from the NongHyup Economic Research Institute showed. As part of the efforts to prevent reoccurrence, the government and ruling Saenuri Party said they would draft up a set of measures on Tuesday. The Seoul city government also conducted an emergency safety inspection at a dozen local outdoor camping sites, officials said.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","injured after fire engulfed ,cause of campsite fire ,three children were killed ,were injured after fire ,after fire engulfed 16","['Incheon', 'Investig']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37995416  0.01561084

Whether safety policies are being implemented well on-site and how the policies could further be improved will be focus of the forthcoming inspections, the ministry noted. On the first day of inspections Thursday, Park will visit a paint factory and a disease-prevention center just southwest of Seoul, the ministry said. Park will also visit a flood-prone area in the capital's western district of Gimpo as well as the newly-refurbished Jangchung Gymnasium in central Seoul, it added.

An international investigation concluded that the North torpedoed the ship, but the communist country has flatly denied the accusations.In May of that year, South Korea halted all cross-border trade and exchanges with the North, leaving only the joint industrial park in Kaesong, a North Korean border town, in operation.Liberal groups have long demanded that the government lift the sanctions to ease tensions and improve ties between the Koreas, but the conservative administrations of then President Lee Myung-bak and incumbent President Park Geun-hye have insisted the North first apologize and punish those responsible for the sinking.Rep. Yoo Seong-min, the floor leader of Park's ruling Saenuri Party, voiced opposition to the sanctions' removal.""If we recall the past from five years ago, it's impossible to unilaterally lift (the sanctions) as if nothing happened,"" he said during a party meeting.Rep. Kim Young-woo, a ruling party member of the parliamentary foreign affairs and unification committee, expressed agreement with Yoo's view.""If (the sanctions) were to be lifted suddenly as if nothing happened, that would damage the principle and consistency of our policy on North Korea,"" he said in a phone call with Yonhap News Agency.Other ruling party members, however, called for a change in the government's stance, saying it should pursue new policies in its push for inter-Korean reunification.""Under the May 24 measures, humanitarian aid is possible but even that hasn't been done so far,"" Kim Moo-sung, the party's chairman, said in a meeting with reporters, referring to the sanctions.

Another man surnamed Cheon ― who was later identified as Lee’s friend since middle school ― and his 7-year-old son were also killed. The bodies were transported to Ganghwa Hospital. (Yonhap)Lee’s second son, 8, was rescued from the site by a 43-year-year-old man surnamed Park who had been camping in a nearby tent. “I went into the tent after evacuating my own children, and found the boy who was crying near the entrance,” Park said.Park and the boy suffered from smoke inhalation and second-degree burns and were moved to Bucheon’s Soon Chun Hyang University Hospital and Bestian Medical Center, respectively, for treatment.According to fire officials and closed-circuit television footage, the fire engulfed the tent, made from inflammable material, in about three minutes. The flames were already subsiding by the time rescuers arrived on the scene, and died out completely approximately 25 minutes after ignition.Officials had yet to determine the cause of the fire. “There isn’t much evidence since the tent has been destroyed completely. We have to conduct further investigation to determine what exactly caused the fire,” Ryu Hwan-hyeong, the head of Incheon Ganghwa Fire Station, told reporters.CCTV images showed that the fire originated from a spark from inside the tent, leading police officials to suspect that an electronic heating device was responsible for the tragedy. They have requested the National Forensic Service to analyze the evidence. Police said they were questioning operators of the campsite over possible neglect of fire prevention or facility registration protocol. Investigators also commenced a probe against the site’s owner.The campsite was being used for so-called “glamorous camping” or “glamping,” a trend of camping that incorporates high-tech gadgets like computers, refrigerators, TVs and electronic heating devices. But the latest fad here remains largely in the blind spot of government regulations such as fire inspections due to a lack of inclusive guidelines that oversee such accommodation facilities nationwide.There was no fire extinguisher inside the tent, despite being furnished with multiple electronics that could have potentially started a fire. Park, the 43-year-old survivor, reportedly said some of the fire extinguishers found at the main campground did not work. Rescue workers found a total of five fire extinguishers at the spot, two of which were unused. Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo ordered prompt countermeasures after the accident, and urged Public Safety and Security Minister Park In-yong to step up fire safety inspections on campgrounds and lodging facilities across the country.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","campsite fire that broke ,incheon killed five people ,campsite fire kills injures ,fire kills injures campsite ,kills injures campsite fire","['Incheon', 'Ganghwado Island', 'inter - korean', 'Incheon Ganghwa Fire Station', 'Lee']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49617395  0.335596

A South Korea-led multinational probe team has concluded that a midget submarine torpedoed the 1,200-ton patrol ship ― a conclusion that Pyongyang has denied.Since the unprecedented attack, the South Korean Navy has bolstered its defense capabilities, including antisubmarine capabilities, with new equipment and changes in its operational strategies and tactics, and toughened personnel training. Cdr. Choi Won-il“Since the attack on Cheonan, our naval staff has worked its fingers to the bone to bolster antisubmarine capabilities. Thus, our efforts have made great progress in terms of operational doctrines, tactics, education, training and reinforcements of our equipment,” said Cdr. Choi Won-il, who led the ill-fated Cheonan at the time of the attack.“All naval forces including draftees and commanders are full of determination and resolve. We will fight and win if provoked again.”Amid the South Korean Navy’s push to bolster operational capabilities, the North has also been sharpening its naval capabilities. It has been developing submarine-launched ballistic missiles and has continued to bolster coastal artillery forces. It has also held drills aimed at infiltrating South Korea’s border islands.To counter Pyongyang’s persistent maritime threats, the South Korean Navy has launched a submarine force command in which it has incorporated its functions of underwater operations, training and education, and maintenance to conduct more integrated submarine operations. A marine touches a memorial portrait of one of the 46 sailors who died in North Korea’s 2010 torpedo attack on the South Korean corvette Cheonan, at a commemorative monument on Baengnyeongdo Island last Monday. (Related story on Page 3) (Yonhap)The Navy has also been pushing to bolster its 13-submarine naval fleet, consisting of nine 1,200-ton 209-class submarines and four 1,800-ton 214-class submarines. The Navy seeks to add five 214-class submarines by 2019 for a total of 18 submarines. In the 2020s, the Navy plans to add nine 3,000-ton submarines equipped with vertical launchers for submarine-to-ground missiles.To secure longer-range strike capabilities, the Navy has installed ship-to-surface cruise missiles on its major destroyers and submarine-to-surface missiles on its 214-class submarines. Both missiles have a range of some 1,000 km.The Navy has also established a naval intelligence analysis system that provides a three-dimensional map of underwater terrains to enable naval commanders to predict the enemy’s underwater infiltration routes. To avert another torpedo attack, the Navy has installed torpedo acoustic countermeasure equipment on all of its corvettes and bigger warships. When a warship equipped with the TACM system detects a torpedo, the system fires rounds into the sea up to 800 meters from the warship. The rounds then emit sounds louder than that of the ship in order to attract acoustic torpedoes away from the vessel.Despite the modernization of naval forces, the North continues to pose a grave naval threat. The North has recently conducted maritime exercises including amphibious landing drills based on a scenario of “striking and occupying” South Korea’s border islands. Last year, the North also held an amphibious landing exercise in which it designated guided missile bases on South Korea’s frontline islands as virtual targets. The bases on the islands are equipped with Israeli-made Spike missiles that are capable of launching precision strikes on the North’s coastal artillery hidden in mountain caves and tunnels.South Korean officials also believe that the North has continuously built midget 130-ton Yeoneo-class submarines ― the same type the North used to attack the Cheonan. Pyongyang is known to have some 10 130-ton Yeoneo-class submarines, about 20 1,800-ton Romeo-class submarines and 40 300-ton Sangeo-class submarines.

The body of the helicopter was found some 1,200 meters south of the island on Thursday, six days after the accident.Having recovered the wreckage of the helicopter, investigators will launch a probe to determine the exact cause of the accident, officials said.

Investigators confiscated computer hard disks, financial statements and other documents at their offices.Fresh allegations continued after the 10 billion won ($9.9 million) slush fund scandal involving POSCO E&C; in Vietnam hit the market last week. POSCO’s offices in southern Seoul. (Yonhap)Investigators are reportedly looking into additional allegations that POSCO E&C;’s parent group POSCO had created a slush fund via its operations at home and abroad as well as its construction unit in Vietnam.According to insiders at the Prosecutors’ Office on Tuesday, the steel producer is suspected of creating a slush fund of 10 billion won in Indonesia by inflating outsourcing costs during its construction of a steel mill.It is alleged that the conglomerate signed an exclusive contract with a Korean builder, which has close relations with then-POSCO chairman Chung Joon-yang, who was in office from 2009 to 2014.The prosecution speculates that about 1 billion won from this amount was handed over to a POSCO senior executive.In addition, the conglomerate is suspected of rigging the financial statements of some units in the local market in an attempt to secure funds for politicians.There is widespread speculation that the business group enjoyed close relations with the government of former President Lee Myung-bak, namely the members of a “Yeongpo (Yeongil & Pohang) Line,” a private group of Lee’s closest allies.The prosecution is reviewing its records after summoning some former and incumbent POSCO executives to determine whether to seek arrest warrants for them. It is also fine-tuning the timing of a summons for ex-head Chung.Meanwhile, the investigative authority is widening its net and has reportedly launched a low-key investigation into other business groups including SK, Shinsegae and Dongbu over their slush fund allegations.Like the POSCO case, observers say that the probe could include irregular bookkeeping for embezzlement or tax evasion.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","tuesday raided three subcontractors ,investigators on tuesday raided ,raided investigators on tuesday ,posco suppliers raided investigators ,on tuesday raided three","['POSCO Engineering & Construction', 'Vietnam', 'Busan', 'Heungwoo']",10,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.06471375 0.4858278  0.24599111],Kim Yon-se,Social affairs,3,2015,"on tuesday raided three subcontractors ,tuesday raided three subcontractors ,investigators on tuesday raided three ,tuesday raided three subcontractors of ,investigators on tuesday raided","['POSCO Engineering & Construction', 'Vietnam', 'Busan', 'Heungwoo', 'POSCO E&C', 'Vietnam', 'Seoul', 'POSCO E&C', 'POSCO', 'Vietnam', 'the Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Indonesia', 'korean', 'Chung Joon - yang', 'POSCO', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Lee ’s', 'posco', 'Chung', 'Shinsegae', 'Dongbu', 'POSCO', 'Kim Yon - se']",4,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.06471375 0.4858278  0.24599111]

They are investigating whether he is mentally ill.  The surviving victim was attacked outside the office, while the two who died, one of whom was Korean-Chinese, were stabbed on the back, neck and chest inside the office, witnesses were quoted as saying.  Police are also interested in whether the attack had been premeditated because Jeon told them he stole the weapon from a traditional market a day earlier. But Jeon did not appear to hold any grudge against the victims, they said.  Jeon divorced his wife two years ago and moved to Jinju from Suwon, a city south of Seoul, about a year ago, police said, adding they are looking to see whether these facts have anything to do with the attack.

The ship was delivered to the Navy the previous year after passing an operational capability test.  Looking into the case, the state audit agency, the Board of Audit and Inspection, asked the defense ministry in December to take punitive action against Hwang over the alleged corruption.  Two weeks later, Hwang offered to step down as chief of Naval Operations, and his resignation was accepted last month.  In 2012, South Korea launched the project to build the country's first home-grown next-generation salvage ship with a budget of 160 billion won ($154 million) in the wake of the sinking of its warship Cheonan by North Korea in 2010. It aimed to enable the military to effectively carry out rescue operations and tow away damaged vessels.  After the military lowered the requirements by postponing the installation of two faulty parts -- a remotely operated vehicle and hull mounted sonar, the Tongyeong was again put into service at the end of last year.

Kim began serving the prison term in July and is scheduled to be released in August.  Supporters of Kim have claimed that the information Kim passed to the reporter is not highly sensitive or based on concrete intelligence, but just common-sense information that anyone could discern.   On the other hand, Petraeus was accused of giving classified materials to Paula Broadwell, his mistress and biographer, while he held the top job at the CIA, but the Justice Department decided to permit him to plead guilty to a misdemeanor.  Petraeus was also charged with giving Broadwell several notebooks that contained highly classified information he had compiled during his time as a top general, including the identities of covert officers, war strategy and intelligence capabilities.  The Justice Department announced that Petraeus had signed a plea agreement that would allow him to avoid a trial and potential jail time by entering a guilty plea. Petraeus and the Justice Department jointly requested a sentence of two years' probation and a $40,000 fine.  ""The decision ... demonstrates more clearly than ever the profound double standard that applies when prosecuting so-called 'leakers' and those accused of disclosing classified information for their own purposes,"" the lawyer said in a letter to the department.  Lower-level employees like Kim are prosecuted because they are ""easy targets and lack the resources and political connections to fight back,"" while high-level officials leak classified information to forward their own agendas with virtual impunity, he said.  The lawyer emphasized that the infractions involving Kim and Petraeus are basically the same. Though the department cited Kim's motive and lying to the FBI as reasons to deny him a misdemeanor, Petraeus has also admitted to lying about his conduct to the FBI, he said.  ""It is too late for us to undo the plea and seek the misdemeanor that Mr. Kim should have been offered,"" Abbe said. ""However, some justice and fairness can occur, even at this late date, by our at least joining to end his incarceration now.""  Kim's case was viewed as a test of the Barack Obama administration's handling of espionage issues. Critics argued that severe punishment against Kim will damage press freedom, claiming that the leaked information was not directly associated with national security or the well-being of Americans.  Before going to prison, Kim said in an interview with Yonhap News Agency last summer that four years of legal battles with the state devastated his life. Kim said he exhausted the life savings of his parents, his sister and his own, and the case dealt a critical blow to his reputation and did deep social and personal damage to his family.

Police forwarded the case to the prosecutors, with charges of attempted murder, battery of a foreign delegate and obstruction of official duties. Their investigation into whether Kim violated the National Security Law and if there was any accomplice or an organization behind him will continue, they said.  Kim Chul-jun, a senior police officer at Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, announces the results of the investigation into the knife attack on U.S. Ambassador Mark Lippert at Jongno Police Station in Seoul on Friday. (Yonhap)Kim was found to have contacted a man previously convicted of spying for North Korea and a known member of a pro-North organization, but officials are yet to find tangible evidence linking either party to Kim. “Kim denied his intention to kill the ambassador. But due to the fact that he approached the envoy with a knife and attacked him immediately upon finding him, and stabbed the victim more than twice with the ferocity that was described as ‘hacking,’ we’ve concluded that his purpose was to murder (Lippert),” police said.Kim’s attack on March 5 during a morning seminar sparked diplomatic concerns over the Korea-U.S. alliance, reignited political debate over pro-North forces and prompted days of rallies by citizens in support of Lippert.While defined by the U.S. as an attack by a radical individual, Seoul officials and politicians lambasted the aggression as an attack on the alliance. Korean authorities escalated their investigation and bolstered security around foreign envoys here.Police said the 55-year-old attacker appears to have acted out of frustration with the Korea-U.S. military drill and that Kim, calling himself a patriot, believed the drill was the main reason hindering inter-Korean relations.The SMPA said they found Kim to be pro-North based on his testimonies, and that they confirmed he visited the communist country seven times. They also found evidence that Kim elaborately premeditated the attack such as by looking at Lippert’s blog and searching Lippert’s height and the criminal law the day before. Kim was arrested after approaching and wounding Lippert in the face and left wrist with a 25-centimeter knife. The police launched an 83-member team to investigate the case and questioned a total of 35 witnesses including the seminar’s organizer Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation. They searched Kim’s home and office and looked into his recent whereabouts, phone logs and bank accounts.After confiscating 43 items including books, the police said they received confirmation from experts that 24 of them contained contents “benefiting the enemy.”On Thursday, police visited Lippert for testimonies during which the envoy stated he wished for Kim to be punished.Upon the attack, President Park Geun-hye blasted it as an “attack on the South Korea-U.S. alliance,” while ordering a thorough investigation on the case. She visited the hospitalized ambassador Monday on the coattails of returning from her Middle East tour.The ruling Saenuri Party defined the attack as “an act by followers of North Korea,” and launched an offensive against the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy as “being a host for pro-North figures.”Although the investigation has not unearthed a direct connection between Kim and the NPAD, the Saenuri Party urged the opposition to announce they will sever ties with pro-North Korean advocates. The NPAD said they were mulling legal actions against Saenuri lawmakers that accused them of having connections with Pyongyang.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","intention to kill police ,to kill police kim ,man who attacked ambassador ,pro north korean activist ,to kill police","['Kim Ki - jong', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Mark Lippert', 'north korean', 'anti - american', 'U.S.', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency', 'po']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.31376165  0.03907631

The wounds required more than 80 stitches.Kim had told officers the reason he brought a knife was because his previous attempt to harm a Japanese ambassador to Seoul by hurling pieces of rock in 2010 had failed. He, however, said he did not mean to kill the U.S. ambassador.Kim's attorney, Hwang Sang-hyeon, also said Kim's attack was more of a ""symbolic performance"" than attempted murder.Authorities are now investigating what Kim had been up to since Feb. 17, the day he received an invitation to attend the breakfast event where the incident happened.Kim is currently hospitalized for a broken ankle but is continuing to be questioned by the authorities.Police have said they will refer the case to prosecutors by Friday.They are also investigating whether Kim violated a controversial security law that bans South Koreans from openly endorsing rival North Korea. More than a dozen books were found from Kim's home that are suspected of being in violation of the law.South Korea remains technically at war with the North after the Korean War in the 1950s ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.

384,384,[Reporter's Column] Korea-U.S. alliance is rock solid,"After last week’s knife attack on U.S. Ambassador Mark Lippert, concerns surged that the incident might undercut the South Korea-U.S. alliance ― one reason why Seoul officials convened an emergency meeting of vice ministers and even a National Security Council session right after the unprecedented incident.Amid media speculation that the incident would damage the bilateral partnership, President Park Geun-hye calle...","After last week’s knife attack on U.S. Ambassador Mark Lippert, concerns surged that the incident might undercut the South Korea-U.S. alliance ― one reason why Seoul officials convened an emergency meeting of vice ministers and even a National Security Council session right after the unprecedented incident.Amid media speculation that the incident would damage the bilateral partnership, President Park Geun-hye called it an “attack on the alliance.” Upon arrival from her trip to the Middle East on Monday, she rushed to meet Lippert, who is in hospital following surgery on knife wounds to his face and arm.Of course, the attack on Lippert was an attack on South Korea’s only treaty security ally, the U.S., which adds to pressure on Seoul to get to the bottom of the crime, prevent a recurrence and enhance the security of embassy staff and buildings.However, excessive worries about a crack in the alliance seem to insinuate that the alliance might be fragile. Talk of the attack’s adverse impact has made many wonder whether the two allies lacked confidence in the partnership that they have long hailed as “forged in blood” during the 1950-53 Korean War.Seoul officials said Seoul and Washington agreed to closely cooperate to prevent the attack from affecting the alliance. But few have come out and said that the time-tested alliance was resilient enough to weather the storm.Jitteriness about an impact on the alliance might have resulted partially from public sentiment against the U.S., which worsened after a senior U.S. official’s recent remarks that suggested Seoul and Beijing had contributed to the diplomatic deadlock with Tokyo over historical issues. The U.S. desire to deploy an advanced missile defense asset here is another source of tension in the alliance.But the allies have managed tougher challenges before, ranging from an upsurge in anti-American sentiment following the death of two girls who were run over by a U.S. military vehicle during an exercise in 2002, and an intense public health controversy about U.S. beef imports in 2008. Concerns about a dent on the alliance have flared up quite often when the allies seemed to have different approaches toward Pyongyang and its nuclear ambitions, or when pro-North Korea forces whipped up anti-American sentiment here. But the alliance is not that brittle. For Seoul, the alliance with Washington is all the more crucial at a time when the North pushes to develop more advanced ballistic missiles and nuclear warheads to fit on them, and continues its menacing rhetoric.For Washington, Seoul remains a vital partner, as it has been pushing for its strategic rebalance toward the Asia-Pacific ― emerging as a fulcrum of global power and wealth ― amid the increasing assertiveness of China. The allies have a host of strategic dialogue channels to forestall any foul-ups in their communications. The alliance is sturdy enough to look beyond the isolated incident and pursue a future-oriented partnership, given that the countries need each other for strategic cooperation not only on peninsular and regional issues, but also on global challenges including climate change, nuclear proliferation, antipiracy and antiterrorism.What can be done, meanwhile, is for both to work closely to prevent mishaps from undermining their alliance, or from being perceived as such. The allies should remain mutually confident about the alliance, and persuade the public of this, in order to further solidify their partnership and negotiate mutual benefits.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","last week knife attack ,knife attack on ambassador ,week knife attack ,week knife attack on ,unprecedented incident amid media","['U.S.', 'Mark Lippert', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'National Security Council', 'Park Geun']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42453173  0.05095782

As he was hauled away, he shouted opposition to joint military exercises under way between South Korea and the U.S., in line with North Korean rhetoric.Yoo said the injured envoy is suffering most from pain in his left arm but added that other side effects have mostly been covered through the surgery.""The wound is clean and the patient is stable. He has resumed daily activities such as walking and has improved to the point of taking a shower,"" the doctor said.Yoon Do-heum, head of the hospital, added that Lippert is recovering quickly and was able to talk well with visitors.""Regarding the wrist pain, which was one of the most serious problems, Lippert said his pain reached the level of 4, down from a higher level of 7 yesterday,"" he said. In the scale that measures pain from a scale of 0 to 10, a higher number refers stronger pain.

Their unit is known as ""Ahk,"" an Arabic word meaning ""brother.""It is the second time that Park has given a pep talk to the Ahk unit in less than a year.She met about 10 soldiers of the Ahk unit in May when she visited the UAE to attend a ceremony marking the installation of a Korean-built nuclear reactor at a power plant under construction in Barakah, some 300 kilometers west of Abu Dhabi.It is the first out of four reactors South Korea plans to provide the UAE under a 2009 deal worth US$20.4 billion that marked South Korea's first export of nuclear reactors.On Thursday, Park met with the Abu Dhabi crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and said the construction of a nuclear power plant ""has become a good starting point for the two countries to welcome the next hundred years,"" according to Park's office.Also Friday, Park met with about 30 South Korean doctors and nurses working in four hospitals in the UAE.Health care has emerged as a new promising area of cooperation between South Korea and the Middle Eastern countries. A health promotion center managed by Seoul's St. Mary's Hospital opened downtown in the oil-rich capital of Abu Dhabi earlier in the day.The move came weeks after the Sheikh Khalifa Specialist Hospital opened in the UAE under a consignment deal with Seoul National University Hospital, one of South Korea's top medical centers.Mohammed bin Zayed told Park that he trusts South Korea in the health care sector and said he would be pleased if more South Korean doctors and nurses come to his Gulf state.More than 1,150 UAE nationals came to South Korea for medical treatments in 2013, costing the wealthy Gulf state US$18 million, according to South Korean data.Later in the day, Park plans to fly to Qatar, the last stop on her four-nation swing that also included Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.

Thursday's attack happened at a performance hall in downtown Seoul where the envoy was to give a speech. The wounds required more than 80 stitches.Kim, 55, said he carried out the attack because he was unhappy about the ongoing military drills between South Korea and the U.S., which he said hampered progress in inter-Korean relations. The Key Resolve and Foal Eagle exercises kicked off earlier this week and are intended to thwart North Korean aggression.Doctors at Yonsei University's Severance Hospital, where Lippert underwent surgery right after the attack, had said there was no irreversible damage to key facial organs like the nerves and salivary glands. There was, however, a minor injury to the nerves in his left pinkie, which they said should recover in about six months to a year.Yoon Do-heum, head of the hospital, said the stitches on his face will be taken out either on Monday or Tuesday and doctors will watch the envoy for another day or two before deciding when he may leave the hospital.Yoon said Lippert barely felt pain in his face, which was the most seriously injured, but told him his left arm and fingers continued to hurt.""But this kind of pain should go away in about two to three days,"" Yoon told reporters in a briefing.The envoy has had no problems moving around within his room, although he wasn't able to sleep until 3 a.m., Yoon said.At one point, Lippert's temperature rose to 37.7 degrees Celsius but has stabilized to normal levels. There were no signs of infections, but the doctors will keep an eye on his temperature to make sure there are no complications, he added.Yoon also said Lippert thanked the doctors in Korean and wanted to express thanks to the South Koreans who looked out for him.Lippert told the doctors he had slept well despite having only gotten four hours of sleep. Yoon said the ambassador appeared to be in better mental condition than the doctors, asking them if they were doing fine.The envoy had previously written on his Twitter account that he was ""doing well and in good spirits."" ""Will be back ASAP (as soon as possible) to advance US-ROK alliance!"" he wrote, using the acronym of South Korea's official name, Republic of Korea.Lippert became the youngest-ever U.S. ambassador to Seoul last year. His wife gave birth to a son here, to whom they gave a Korean middle name. He was formerly the assistant secretary of defense for Asian and Pacific security affairs from 2011 to 2012.

Kim was also behind the first-ever assault of a foreign envoy here when he threw a rock at a Japanese ambassador to Seoul in 2010.Kim had told officers that he plotted the attack to stop the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle exercises that kicked off earlier this week. The exercises are part of Seoul and Washington's efforts to better deter threats from North Korea. Kim said he thought the drills hampered progress in inter-Korean reconciliations. The two Koreas remain technically at war since the Korean War in the 1950s ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.Yoon Myeong-seong, head of the Jongno Police Station leading the investigation, said the arrest warrant was requested for charges of attempted murder, violence against a foreign envoy and business obstruction.A special investigation team has been assembled for Kim's case.The team is comprised of nearly 100 prosecutors and police officers, and will be led by the anti-terrorism bureau of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has asked the South Korean authorities to share information on the investigation.The FBI won't participate in the actual probe but will make requests about the probe's direction, an official at the National Police Agency said on condition of anonymity.Kim had told police officers that he had no intention to kill.But Yoon said the fact his act was premeditated and that he slit Lippert multiples times, including the face, with a 25-centimeter-long knife was enough to show that he at least willfully neglected the possibility.A preliminary probe has shown that Kim had been to North Korea seven times between 1999 and 2007. Kim did not appear suspicious during these trips which were approved by the unification ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs. He also tried to erect an altar at the heart of Seoul in memory of late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il in December 2011 shortly after he passed away.Police were already searching Kim's home and office in the western Seoul district of Seodaemun for documents and hard drives on Friday. They said the items will help them learn how Kim planned for the attack and why. They also intend to illuminate whether he had an accomplice. Police have also been issued a warrant to obtain Kim's phone records.The attack happened just four minutes upon Kim's entry to a breakfast event, where he was not invited and where Lippert was to give a speech. Witnesses said the attack happened as Lippert was telling event participants that he would like to have his second child here.Authorities said the U.S. envoy had not been one of the personnel requiring 24-hour guarding. The U.S. Embassy had also not requested bodyguard service, they added.Lippert, 42, became the youngest-ever U.S. envoy to Seoul last year. His wife gave birth to a son here, to whom they gave a Korean middle name. He was previously the assistant secretary of defense for Asian and Pacific security affairs from 2011 to 2012.

After two deadly shooting incidents south of Seoul in late February, the U.S. ambassador to South Korea was attacked by a knife-wielding assailant on Thursday.Despite the geopolitical risks from the inter-Korean confrontation, Seoul had been assessed as one of the safest cities in the world alongside some Asian cities such as Tokyo and Singapore, especially in terms of firearms-related incidents.The number of guns registered in the country hovered around 160,000 in 2014, less than one in 312 of Korea’s 50 million people. Civic group members hold a rally to denounce the knife attack on U.S. Ambassador Mark Lippert in front of Jongno Police Station, where his attacker is being held custody. (Yeo Jun-suk/The Korea Herald)In Seoul ― where roughly one-fifth of the country’s population resides ― there were only 127 cases of guns being used in major crimes from 2008-2013, according to Rep. Kim Hyun of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy. A report from the state-run Korea Development Institute, however, showed that the country has seen a continuous increase in criminal offenses. About 3 percent of Koreans are victims of crime each year, with subsequent social costs estimated at more than 16 percent of the nation’s GDP.Korea also has higher rates of homicide, sex crimes and theft than the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development average.Watchers also pointed to the need for strengthened security around public figures such as diplomats, to keep in line with the rising risk of terrorism worldwide.Until now, Korean police have not protected U.S. ambassadors. The U.S. Embassy has taken charge of guarding their envoys in an attempt to keep their whereabouts confidential.The police and the National Emergency Management Agency said the authority would bolster guard activities for diplomatic envoys residing in Seoul.Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo called for increased security around key diplomatic facilities including the U.S. Embassy. He said the government would “spare no effort in protecting foreign envoys” while instructing Home Affairs Minister Jeong Jong-sub and National Police Agency Chief Kang Sin-myeong to investigate the attack. Experts, however, underlined that the knife attack, albeit the actions of a delusional individual, shed light on the need for better security.“The assailant claimed to have committed the crime as an act of patriotism. But if that’s the case, he failed to understand that attacking envoys of key countries would cause serious repercussions to the country,” criminal psychology professor Lee Soo-jung of Kyonggi University said.“This means Kim’s thinking ability has been compromised,” he said.Korea, meanwhile, is also facing growing calls to bolster its capacity to cope with gun-related incidents.“In the past, there has hardly been a need to prepare against gun-related incidents because such cases were so few and far between,” said Kwak Dae-kyung, professor at the Police Administration Department of Dongguk University.He pointed out that the official manual in police stations for dealing with gun-yielding situations lacked specific instructions on what to do. In last week’s shooting spree in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province, for example, a police officer was shot dead while approaching the culprit with a taser gun.“Our best available option is to monitor the distribution of bullets. One potential solution could be to let people receive bullets at the hunting grounds and to have them return the unused bullets after hunting,” he said. “Basically, we have to make gun use as inconvenient as possible.”The government is mulling whether to put a GPS tracking device on all firearms, but it is unclear how effective it will be with nearly 5,000 guns unaccounted for.According to data presented by Rep.

(Yonhap)President Park Geun-hye, who was in the United Arab Emirates, the third leg of her four-nation trip to the Middle East, said that the incident was not only an attack on the U.S. ambassador, but also an “unacceptable attack on the South Korea-U.S. alliance.”Later in the evening, Park called Lippert and told him she was shocked to hear about the incident.“President Park said she felt pained and said she fully understood what Ambassador Lippert was going through as she suffered from a similar incident,” said her office. Park was cut with a knife by an attacker while on the campaign trail in 2006.The South Korean president said she would pray for his quick recovery and closely cooperate with the U.S. to prevent the incident from having a negative effect on the South Korea-U.S. alliance.Speaking in Korean, Lippert said he was honored to hear warm words from the president, the office added.Her senior foreign secretary also told reporters in Abu Dhabi that the president was considering taking all possible measures. The presidential office held an emergency meeting with Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and Chief of Staff Lee Byung-kee soon after the incident was reported, he said. The South Korean foreign minister is currently accompanying Park on a nine-day trip to the Middle East. In Seoul, Korean National Security Adviser Kim Kwan-jin held an emergency meeting of National Security Council to seek countermeasures for the unexpected attack. U.S. President Barack Obama called Lippert after the attack to wish him a fast recovery, the White House said.The U.S. State Department condemned the attack, which happened at a performing arts center in downtown Seoul as the ambassador was preparing for a lecture about prospects for peace on the Korean Peninsula, and said Lippert’s injuries were not life-threatening.“We strongly condemn this act of violence,” State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said.Political parties here lamented the unprecedented attack and called for a stern and thorough investigation into the case, including looking into negligence on the part of the Seoul authorities in protecting foreign envoys here.They also echoed concern over the attack possibly hurting the Korea-U.S. alliance in the face of widening cracks caused by Washington taking a bolder stance on resolving historical issues with Japan.The parties, however, were of the view that the attack was an individual act by an apparent pro-North activist.“How can such (an attack) happen in our society,” said ruling Saenuri Party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung. Reiterating President Park’s definition of the attack as “terrorism against the Korea-U.S. alliance,” Kim wished for Lippert’s early recovery and called for a thorough investigation.Saenuri floor leader Rep. Yoo Seung-min said, “I cannot help but be appalled and am worried this may seriously affect Korea-U.S. relations.” He called for the government to deal with the case to prevent it from hurting the bilateral alliance.The main-opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy defined the attacker as a “radical nationalist prone to acting unpredictably.”“No act of violence with political intent can be rationalized,” said NPAD leader Rep. Moon Jae-in.

397,397,Past assaults on diplomats,"Attacks or attempts at attacking foreign envoys here have taken place in the past, raising concerns that better security may be needed to protect foreign dignitaries following the knife attack on U.S. Ambassador to Seoul Mark Lippert Thursday.South Korean police did not deploy security personnel to the conference as the ambassador is not on the government’s list of protected officials.In accordance with the regulati...","Attacks or attempts at attacking foreign envoys here have taken place in the past, raising concerns that better security may be needed to protect foreign dignitaries following the knife attack on U.S. Ambassador to Seoul Mark Lippert Thursday.South Korean police did not deploy security personnel to the conference as the ambassador is not on the government’s list of protected officials.In accordance with the regulations on the protection of key officials, the South Korean president, Supreme Court chief justice, speaker of the National Assembly and important scientists are among the tens of individuals on the security list.Foreign diplomats in Seoul must request police protection to be provided related services, police said.In 2010, Kim Ki-jong, the culprit behind the knife assault against Lippert, was sentenced to two years in prison with a three-year probation after throwing chunks of concrete at then-Japanese Ambassador Toshinori Shigeie at a conference in Seoul. He was not hurt but a female junior diplomat who was translating beside the envoy was treated for a minor injury.But the latest incident sent shockwaves through the country not only due to its sheer cruelty but also the fact that South Korea is known for its relatively low crime rate.A series of incidents took place in the 1980s when anti-U.S. sentiment snowballed in the wake of a democracy uprising, with students occupying or setting fire to U.S. cultural institutes in Seoul, Busan, Gwangju, Daegu and elsewhere. Such provocations have died out and demonstrations have become more peaceful as democracy matured and the economy thrived. In another unusual case, activists hurled plastic water bottles and trash at the vehicle of then-U.S. Ambassador Kathleen Stephens at a rally in downtown Seoul in 2011 during which they unveiled a new monument dedicated to former President Rhee Syng-man. In 2011, a Chinese national named Liu Qiang was sentenced to 10 months in jail for throwing four Molotov cocktails at the Japanese Embassy building here, prompting Seoul’s dilemma in the face of a diplomatic spat between Beijing and Tokyo over his repatriation. “I understand that Lippert has been guarded properly until now, but it seems that the situation today was inescapable. We plan to reinforce security and vigilance for other diplomatic missions here,” an official at the Foreign Ministry said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.

U.S. Ambassador to Korea Mark Lippert hurries into a vehicle while pressing on his wounds after a knife attack before a seminar at the Sejong center for the Performing Arts in downtown Seoul on Thursday morning. (Yonhap)Lippert was attacked by the 55-year-old suspect, Kim Ki-jong, who reportedly ran toward the ambassador, at around 7:40 a.m., with a 25-centimeter-long paring knife. The ambassador had begun to eat breakfast before a speech during the forum organized by the Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation.The bleeding diplomat was rushed to a nearby hospital for emergency treatment and then to another where he received surgery for the cut stretching from his right cheek to his chin and another injury on his left arm. He is in stable condition, medical officials said.Kim was held down by the forum participants right after the attack and arrested. The suspect claimed his attack was aimed at “stopping a war on the Korean peninsula” citing his opposition to the ongoing joint drill by the U.S. and South Korean militaries that is strongly opposed by North Korea.The incident came after the public sentiment against the U.S. deteriorated following U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Wendy Sherman’s recent remarks that suggested Seoul and Beijing were to blame for frayed relations with Japan over history issues.It was the first time a U.S. ambassador to South Korea has been attacked. The incident occurred just about four months after Lippert, a close confidant of President Barack Obama, assumed office at age 41 -- the youngest-ever American ambassador to Seoul.Mindful of possible negative ramifications on its alliance with the U.S., Seoul expressed “shock and deep regrets” over the attack and decided to “sternly” punish its officials in charge of protecting the U.S. diplomat. Police vowed to thoroughly investigate the case and beefed up its security of the U.S. Embassy staff and buildings.Seoul and Washington agreed to closely cooperate to prevent the attack from negatively influencing their alliance, Seoul officials said.During the breakfast conference, Kim was sitting at a table right next to the head table where Lippert was preparing for a speech. Witnesses said the attacker abruptly approached the diplomat, pushed him onto the table and slashed him.Lippert’s surgery lasted for some two and a half hours, and medical officials said that it was “successful.”“The cut on his face was 11-centimeter-long and 3-centimeter-deep, and the cut on his arm was about 2-centimeter-long and 2-centimeter-deep. He received some 80 stitches on his face,” said Chung Nam-sik, head of the Yonsei University Health System at a news conference.“He will need hospitalization for some three to four days. And we will need to watch him carefully, but our concerns for now are about the scars on his face and any aftereffect from the cuts on his wrist,” he added. Other medical officials said that the scars would almost disappear one or two years later. Right after his arrest, Kim, the head of the leftist group, “Urimadang,” shouted, “I carried out the terror attack. I have prepared to disseminate leaflets to oppose the (South Korea-U.S.) military exercise for a war.”In the leaflet, he called for the “suspension of the exercise that blocks inter-Korean dialogue and Seoul’s retaking of wartime operational control (from Washington).”Kim claimed his right ankle broke when the police restrained him He was carried away on a stretcher, and told reporters, “I oppose the military drills, a reason why the two Koreas can’t hold the reunions of separated families.”He also said that he prepared for the attack for some 10 days, and that there was no accomplice or any directives to carry out the attack. “I made a sacrifice myself so as to stop the Key Resolve exercise,” he said.Officials of the forum’s organizer said that Kim was not invited to the event, but they could not block him from entering because he expressed his wish to attend, and the organizers had no authority to block his entry.It was not his first attack on foreign diplomats. In 2010, he hurled blocks of concrete toward then-Japanese Ambassador Toshinori Shigeie during his lecture in Seoul. He was given a two-year jail term suspended for three years.According to intelligence officials, Kim shifted focus from anti-Japan activities to anti-U.S. campaigns after he visited North Korea multiple times. Seoul’s Unification Ministry said that Kim, who served as a member of the state unification education panel, visited the North Korean border city of Gaeseong eight times between 2006 and 2007 on a mission to plant trees.Investigators appear to believe it was his personal decision to carry out the attack. Police plan to raid and search Kim’s house and seek an arrest warrant to detain him for a longer period on charges of attempted murder and possession of a lethal weapon.

Abrasion caused slipperiness between older and newer parts of the safety control system, leading to the accident. The 21-year-old seaman of the 2nd Fleet Command, surnamed Oh, remains in critical condition.The officials also pointed out that several crewmembers failed to comply with safety rules concerning the removal of a piece of ammunition stuck in a malfunctioning gun, resulting in the injury.Oh was hit by a shell fired from the 76-caliber gun on a guided missile warship in the West Sea on Jan. 21. He was standing on the deck near the weapon as other sailors tried to remove the shells loaded in the malfunctioning gun for safety reasons. The gun malfunctioned due to a loosened nut in a component of the gun, officials said.The Navy said that it would take disciplinary action against those who failed to adhere to safety rules, and that it would increase the frequency of the regular overhaul of its warships from once every 12 years to every six years.The gun in question was installed on the warship in the early 2000s following a major overhaul after being used for some 21 years on a different warship.

Under the Philippines’ Anti-Mail-Order Bride Law, which was established in the 1990s, matchmaking agencies that connect Filipino women to foreign nationals for marriage are illegal. Matchmaking services, however, are legal in South Korea and about 2,500 Korean nationals sign up every year in hopes of connecting with a foreign-born spouse. Such matchmaking activities are also illegal in countries such as Cambodia, Vietnam and China, where a large number of foreign spouses in Korea are from. “The Korean law advises those who run such businesses to follow the rules of foreign countries if they choose to work overseas,” said Kim Dae-jung, a Gender Ministry official in charge of the country’s multicultural policies. “If a Korean marriage broker breaks a law overseas and we receive a complaint from the foreign government, the person loses his or her business license immediately.”The Philippine government filed its first-ever complaint in January over Korean marriage brokers operating in the country, Kim said. Last year, more than 80 percent of immigrants and foreign nationals residing in Korea were from Asian countries, the largest number coming from China and Vietnam.

Only those with genuine reasons, such as hunting or target shooting, are allowed to own one, and it must be stored at police substations. Shooting incidents in South Korea, which are rare, have commonly involved military personnel, as all able-bodied men in South Korea are trained how to use guns during their mandatory military service.Government and ruling Saenuri Party officials met to discuss ways to strengthen gun control and agreed to restrict storage of guns to only police stations with jurisdiction over a gun owner's registered address or hunting grounds. Currently, guns can be stored at any police station across the nation.Live ammunition will be available for purchase only near hunting grounds, while any unused ammunition will have to be returned to police stations overseeing the grounds.Currently, guns can be taken out of any police station across the country and those carrying guns are free to go wherever they like. Civilians have also been allowed to possess air rifles with a caliber of 5.5 millimeters or under and up to 400 live bullets.

They were reported to be involved in a financial dispute. The victims’ daughter-in-law fled the scene, injuring her lower back after jumping from the second story of the home where the crime occurred.A construction worker nearby who heard gunshots alerted law enforcement. But the first police officer to reach the scene was shot on arrival by Jeon. The officer was not wearing bulletproof gear. Police cordon off a house in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province, where a man shot and killed himself and three other people Friday. (Yonhap)Jeon killed himself at the crime scene after he was cornered by law enforcement officers, police said.Police later found a letter written by Jeon in his car, claiming Friday’s crime was premediated.“I have written everything down by the book. I am sure no one has found out about my plans,” the letter read, according to authorities.“The letter indicates the crime was most likely planned out,” a police spokesman said. “But we will look into what the specific motive was.”Jeon had frequently threatened his brother and his family when he got drunk, police added. Jeon was reportedly under the influence of alcohol at the time of the killings.On Wednesday, a similar shooting in Sejong left four people dead. The killer had shot three people near a local convenience store, and killed himself a few hours later. The killer, surnamed Kang, set the store on fire after shooting his victims. The victims were the boyfriend and family members of Kang’s ex-girlfriend. Police think Kang committed the crime out of revenge, and disagreements over money with his former partner.Police said they would seek measures to make it more difficult for people to own guns.Both Jeon and Kang used hunting rifles, weapons usually stored at local police stations. Authorized gun owners can take out their guns in only at certain times of the year and certain times of day. Hunting rifles are allowed to be taken out by owners in the hunting season, which begins in November and ends in February.More than 160,000 guns are stored in police stations. They include an array of rifles ranging from air guns to pistols.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","30 killing his brother ,rifle before killing himself ,shot dead two relatives ,killing himself on friday ,shooting man shot dead","['Hwaseong , Gyeonggi Province']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43201676  0.35013837

The country has so far signed 17 FTAs that only deal with products, the ministry said earlier.  The agreement for the service and investment sectors will open up most of Turkey's service market with only a handful of areas excluded from market liberalization, such as including government procurement and airline services, according to the ministry.  It will also prohibit any type of restrictions on market access while also requiring both countries to streamline their regulations with international norms.  Once implemented, the Korea-Turkey FTA for service and investment is expected to help boost the countries' bilateral trade while also raising South Korea's gross domestic product by 0.01 percent over a 10-year period.  ""Since the implementation of the agreement for products in May 2013, trade between the two countries has expanded significantly,"" the ministry said. ""We believe the countries' bilateral trade will further expand once the agreement for the service and investment sector goes into effect.""  The agreement requires approval from the countries' respective legislatures before it can be implemented.  The Seoul government said it will soon submit a ratification bill to the National Assembly to have the FTA implemented at the earliest date possible.

The victim is the elder brother of Kang’s ex-girlfriend surnamed Kim.(Yonhap)Kang also shot Kim’s 74-year-old father residing near her brother’s house. He then moved to a nearby convenience store operated by her current boyfriend, surnamed Song. After shooting him, Kang spread thinner inside the store and set it on fire.All the three victims were immediately transported to a nearby hospital, but died.Kang fled after the shootings, but police found him dead near the Geumgang River some two hours later. Police presume he shot himself with one of the two 18.5 mm-caliber shotguns that he collected from a police station in Gongju, South Chungcheong Province, earlier in the day. The other gun was found in his car.Gun ownership is illegal in Korea. However, Kang gained state authorization to use guns for hunting and left them in the police storage box in compliance with state rules.Kang and his ex-girlfriend were in a common-law marriage before they broke up one and a half years ago. After the separation, Kim moved in with song the owner of the convenience store.Investigators believe that Kang’s shooting rampage was promoted by a conflict over his investment in Song’s convenience store. They also believe Kang premeditated the shootings as he collected his guns from the police station beforehand.Police plan to collect accounts from witnesses and others, and question his former girlfriend.

Indonesia is planning to host the Asian-African Conference from April 22-23 in Jakarta to be followed by a key ceremony in the Indonesian city of Bandung on April 24 to mark the 60th anniversary of the Bandung meeting in 1955. The nonaligned movement emerged from the 1955 gathering. A Taiwanese news outlet reported last month Kim may attend the April meeting, but it has yet to be confirmed. If Kim does so, it would be his first visit to a foreign country since abruptly taking power in December 2011 following the death of his father, Kim Jong-il. The North Korean leader is also reportedly planning to join a ceremony in Moscow in May to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory in World War II.The Indonesian government has also invited President Park Geun-hye to the April gathering although sources said she may not appear at the meeting due to scheduling conflicts. Still, the Indonesian meeting may draw heavy attention for the possibility of the North Korean leaders' contact with South Korean and Chinese officials, with Chinese President Xi Jinping and high-level South Korean diplomats expected to join the meeting. The communist North has apparently made much of the Bandung Conference, attempting to use it for diplomatic campaigns.The North's founding leader Kim Il-sung joined a 1965 ceremony to mark the 10th anniversary of the birth of the conference. The late leader Kim Jong-il accompanied him.A meeting between then South Korean Prime Minister Lee Hae-chan and Kim Yong-nam was arranged in 2005 when the North Korean nominal head attended the 50th anniversary.

The detention, recorded by security cameras, set off a wave of spontaneous demonstrations in middle-class neighborhoods loyal to the opposition and on Friday a few hundred supporters gathered peacefully to denounce Ledezma's ""kidnapping.""The mayor was charged with conspiracy, a crime punishable by 8 to 16 years in jail, and sent Friday night to a military prison outside Caracas where other prominent government foes are being held. The arrest of the 59-year-old mayor, one of Maduro's fiercest critics, comes as the government struggles to avert a crisis years in the making but made worse by a recent tumble in oil prices. The president's approval rating was hovering around 22 percent in January, the lowest in 16 years of socialist rule, as Venezuelans are forced to cope with widespread shortages, runaway inflation and a plunge in the currency that shows little sign of abating. Maduro has taken to the airwaves in recent days to rail against his opponents, accusing them of conspiring with the United States to sabotage the oil-dependent economy, sowing chaos and carry out a coup timed to coincide with the anniversary this month of 2014 anti-government protests that left more than 40 dead.As part of the crackdown, he's also seized control of a major retail chain, jailed several executives and handed more power to the military to control protests and smoke out saboteurs.However, the dire situation hasn't translated into support for the frequently out-maneuvered opposition. Turnout at Friday's demonstration was the largest for an anti-government rally in months but nowhere near the throngs that rocked cities a year ago, a sign of the steep challenge the opposition still faces connecting with mistrustful voters ahead of legislative elections later this year. The government's case against Ledezma appeared to stem from a public letter he wrote with two other hardliners calling for a transitional government. Maduro said the letter, published in an anti-government newspaper, was the green light for a secretly hatched putsch and on Friday said that next week he would present videos and recordings detailing U.S. Embassy involvement in the plot. The U.S. called the accusations ""baseless and false.""  While Ledezma's arrest may be the boldest action against his rivals, it's unlikely to rattle Maduro's core base, which is better organized and more at ease in the throes of the crisis than the opposition, according to David Smilde, a Venezuelan researcher and senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America. ""The 20 percent that are left (supporting Maduro) are pretty hardcore and Ledezma is not a likable character,"" Smilde said. The embattled president could also be gambling that the allegations of a coup will enable him to distract attention from the mounting woes and weaken the opposition enough to allow him to prevail in legislative elections slated for later this year. But the growing crackdown is not without risks. Opponents, who seemed lifeless in recent weeks even as the country's problems have worsened, are enraged and international condemnation of Maduro's human rights record is likely to rise.On Friday, the Obama administration said it is considering additional actions to pressure the government after it expanded this month a travel ban on individuals accused of corruption and abuses. It also called on regional governments to ensure Venezuela lives up to its commitments to democracy. ""Venezuela's problems cannot be solved by criminalizing dissent,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporter.So far reaction has been muted, with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, the U.S.'s top ally in the region, urging that Ledezma's due process rights be respected but stopping short of calling for the mayor's release. Brazil, whose Workers Party government is close to Maduro and a major investor in Venezuela, expressed concern and called on both sides to ""work for peace and the maintenance of democracy.""Foreign ministers from the two countries and Ecuador are expected to arrive in Caracas in the coming days to try and open a channel of dialogue between the government and opposition. Ledezma has been a thorn in the side of the ruling party since he was elected mayor in 2008, beating out a member of the socialist party led by the late President Hugo Chavez. The government subsequently transferred most of his powers to a newly created office run by a loyalist.He was re-elected in 2013 and has been on the attack ever since alongside Leopoldo Lopez, a former mayor whom he'll now join in jail. Lopez was arrested a year ago for allegedly inciting violence at anti-government protests.Despite Ledezma's reputation as a rabble-rouser he's rare among opposition leaders in having family ties to the ruling elite by way of his stepdaughter, who is married to Tourism Minister Andres Izarra, a top government spokesman. Government critics say that as the administration loses strength, it is becoming more dangerous.""The mayor of the capital arrested just like that? That never happens. It's too ugly,"" said Maria Fernandez, who lives in the shadow of the presidential palace and makes her living selling loose cigarettes, candy and pirated movies. ""I'm worried we're going to see more repression.""","arrest of caracas mayor ,broader venezuela crackdown caracas ,in camouflage raided mayor ,crackdown caracas venezuela ,surprise arrest of caracas","['Venezuela', 'AP', 'Nicolas Maduro', 'Caracas', 'Antonio Ledezma']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5165273  -0.06823261

Ex-parliament chief Park Hee-tae convicted of sexual harassment. (Yonhap)The local branch of the Chuncheon District Court sentenced him to six months in jail with a one-year stay of execution and ordered him to take 40 hours of anti-sexual violence education.Park persistently groped the plaintiff, identified only as a 24-year-old caddie, until the ninth hole, Judge Park Byeong-min said in the ruling. And while the plaintiff had withdrawn her accusations, sexual harassment is a serious crime punishable even without the plaintiff’s consent, he added.Still, the judge said he took into consideration that the plaintiff no longer wished to punish the former lawmaker and that she had reached an agreement with Park and withdrawn her accusations.He said he also took into account that Park admitted to his wrongdoing, has no criminal record and is ""of old age.""Prosecutors had called for a fine of 3 million won ($2,721) in addition to the anti-sexual violence education.Park said he will consider whether to appeal but declined to comment further.

Since the once--powerful uncle of Kim, Jang Song-thaek, was executed in December 2013 on charges of treason, corruption and others, North Korea has gradually summoned its businessmen in China who are believed to be royal to Jang. The high-profile execution of Jang, who had played an important role in initiating joint business projects with China, has also taken its toll on work by North Korean businessmen in the Chinese border cities of Shenyang and Dandong because it further dampens the already-fragile confidence of Chinese investors. A source in a northeastern Chinese city, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said only about 30 percent of the North Korean businessmen have returned to China after being summoned. The summonses are also believed to be part of efforts by North Korea to redistribute the ""rights of doing businesses with China,"" a key source of earning hard currency, to its ruling elite, the source said. ""The replacement of businessmen loyal to Jang Song-thaek has been gradually carried out and a lot of North Korean businessmen were summoned until late last year,"" the source said. ""Of those being summoned, only about 30 percent returned to China.""There are no official data on how many North Korean businessmen are working in the Chinese border cities.A second source in another Chinese border city with North Korea said that about 170 North Korean businessmen in the city were replaced over the past year.With Chinese investor confidence eroding over the North's unpredictable behavior, the new North Korean businessmen come under further pressure in building business connections with their Chinese counterparts, the second source said. The North Korean businessmen have also felt the pinch of a slowdown in the Chinese economy, which grew 7.4 percent last year, marking a 24-year low. A third source in the Chinese border city of Dandong said, ""As demand falls and prices decline in the face of an economic slowdown in China, it is difficult for North Korean businessmen to sell goods even at lower prices."" According to data compiled by the Beijing unit of the South's Korea Trade and Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA), North Korea's annual trade with China fell 2.4 percent from a year ago in 2014, marking the first decline since 2009. North Korea's trade with China totaled US$6.39 billion last year, compared with $6.54 billion in 2013, the data showed. Last year, North Korea's exports of coal to China slipped 17.6 percent from a year ago to $1.13 billion, marking the first drop in 8 years, according to the data.

A 45-year-old hotel employee surnamed Park died from carbon dioxide poisoning while working in the underground boiler room at Colon Hotel, the police said. Six others were hospitalized for minor injuries, they added. “The fire alarms suddenly rang while (they were) replacing the insulators, and then there was a leak of carbon dioxide,” the wounded workers testified to police. Investigators suspected that the fire extinguishing system had been damaged while an insulator was being replaced. The fire extinguishing systems of boiler rooms or machinery rooms are not equipped with water but with carbon dioxide due to the threat of electric shocks. While no fire was reported at the scene of the accident, the workers could not evacuate due to an automatic fire-containment door, police said. About 60 hotel guests immediately evacuated from the building, police added. An investigation to determine the exact cause of the accident is underway, authorities said.

The lion enclosure contained a 10-year-old male as well as a 6-year-old female. It is not clear whether Kim was attacked by both of the animals or just one. He was alone with the lions when the attack occurred.The 53-year-old was discovered by a colleague on Thursday afternoon, unconscious and bleeding. He died shortly after being sent to a nearby hospital.According to the Seoul Metropolitan Government, Kim has been working at the zoo for about 20 years, but had only been working with dangerous animals for the past three years. Authorities shut down the enclosure and put both lions in quarantine. The zoo at Children’s Grand Park has been temporarily closed since Sunday since a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza was confirmed in the feces of birds at a nearby stream. First established in 1973, Children’s Grand Park ― which includes hiking trails, a zoo and an amusement park ― has been open to the public for free since 2006. Its zoo owns some 4,100 animals of 95 species, including elephants and chimpanzees.According to the park complex, this was the first time one of its zookeepers was attacked by zoo animals. In 2013, a zookeeper surnamed Shim was attacked by a tiger at Seoul Grand Park Zoo in the city of Gwacheon and died in spite of 15 days of medical treatment.

The pileup occurred at 9:34 a.m. on the Seoul-bound lanes of the Yeongjong Bridge that connects Incheon’s Yeongjong Island ― where the nation’s main airport is located ― to the mainland.Police said the pileup was triggered after an airport limousine bus rear-ended the passenger-vehicle in front of it. Drivers’ visibility was severely limited due to heavy fog, they added.Survivors said they could only see about 15 to 20 meters in front of them because of fog during the time of the accident. The pileup caused a tailback extending for more than a kilometer, hampering emergency services’ access to the site and crippling traffic.According to the emergency services in Incheon, at least two people were killed and more than 60 people suffered injuries. Among the injured, at least eight are said to be in critical condition. The two victims were identified as 46-year-old Lim and 51-year-old Kim, respectively. While Kim’s body was sent to Myongji Hospital in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province, Lim’s was sent to Na-Eun Hospital in Incheon.As of Wednesday afternoon, 19 foreign nationals were confirmed to have been injured. Among them, seven were Chinese, five Thai, two Japanese and two Vietnamese. The victims also included a Swiss, Bangladeshi and Russian, according to firefighters.One of the 19 injured foreign nationals is in critical condition, they added.The injured were sent to three different hospitals near the bridge for treatment.Shortly after the accident, police and firefighters shut down the entire Seoul-bound lanes of the bridge.“We are looking into nearby CCTV footage to determine the exact cause of the accident,” a police officer said. The Yeongjong Bridge, established in 2000, is part of the Incheon International Airport Expressway.

Eyewitnesses have told the local media that the fog had lowered visibility to between 15 to 50 meters at the time of the accident. According to the emergency services, at least two people have been killed and more than 20 people suffered serious injuries, some of whom are said to be in critical condition. A number of people are said to have sustained minor injuries, and the casualties are expected to rise with some passengers remaining trapped inside vehicles at 11:25 a.m. Of the injured, five have been confirmed as being foreign nationals, the emergency services said. The accident caused a tailback extending for more than a kilometer, hampering emergency services’ access to the site and crippling traffic. According to reports, the emergency services were first alerted to a four-way crash, but additional vehicles were unable to evade those involved in the initial accident.The authorities are trying to determine the exact cause of the accident, and attempting to verify witness accounts that the initial collision involved a passenger vehicle and a bus.By Choi He-suk (cheesuk@heraldcorp.com)","incheon on wednesday killed ,dozens injured in yeongjong ,injured dozens the accident ,two dead dozens injured ,dead dozens injured in","['Incheon', 'Seoul', 'Incheon', 'Incheon International Airport', 'Korea ’s mainland.(yonhap)the']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62471431  0.51256794

Last week, Kato filed a lawsuit with the Seoul Administrative Court to have the measure canceled.  Even if the ban is lifted, Kato would still have to return to South Korea to continue standing trial.   If he fails to appear in court, South Korea will issue an arrest warrant and ask Japanese law enforcement to hand him over.  In an online article dated Aug. 3, Kato cited a column carried by the Chosun Ilbo a month earlier, in which South Korea's largest-circulation newspaper said Park's whereabouts were unknown for seven hours. The news sparked rumors in South Korea's financial community that she may have been with a man, Kato reported.  The presidential office refuted the claim, saying that Park ""was inside the presidential compound.""  Kato's indictment has sparked fierce backlash from Japan, which claims the move suppresses freedom of speech and discriminates against foreign reporters.

Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, ringleaders of the so-called ""Bali Nine"" drug smuggling gang, were arrested in 2005 and sentenced to death the following year after being caught trying to traffick heroin out of Indonesia.They lost a legal bid last week to have their cases reviewed, effectively dashing their final hope of avoiding the firing squad. Jakarta has said they will be executed this month.Indonesia last month executed six drug offenders, including five foreigners. On Monday the families of Chan and Sukumaran, who in recent days have been on the resort island of Bali where the men are held, visited Jakarta to appeal for authorities to spare the lives of the men, who are in their early 30s. ""We beg you for mercy for our sons, we beg you to spare our sons' lives, we beg you that they not be killed,"" said Sukumaran's mother Raji Sukumaran, sobbing as she read from a statement signed by her and Chan's mother, Helen Chan.At an emotionally charged press conference, the women called on President Joko Widodo, the vice president, the attorney general and ""the Indonesian people to show mercy on our children"".""I understand the serious crime my son committed. They are both very sorry for this. We are very sorry for this. They are not the same people who committed that crime almost 10 years ago,"" Raji Sukumaran added. She said the pair had been rehabilitated and were now the ""driving force"" behind improving the notorious Kerobokan jail on Bali, through starting programmes that ranged from painting and photography to dance and sewing. Chan's brother Michael, who attended the event, added: ""If we can show the president that these guys have done such an amazing job with what they've had to deal with, I just want them to have that second chance to show that to other people.""Earlier, their lawyer Todung Mulya Lubis said he planned one last attempt to save their lives by challenging in an administrative court Widodo's decision not to pardon them.Both men lost their appeals for presidential clemency in recent months. The legal move has been rarely attempted before, but Mulya said he did not believe Widodo could simply reject the men's pleas on the basis of a drug emergency.Widodo has been a vocal supporter of capital punishment and warned Indonesia was in a state of emergency due to drugs, with dozens of people dying every day.""I don't think the president can use that blanket argument to refuse all the clemency applications,"" he said, adding: ""It is unfair, it is unjust, it is unacceptable.""The lawyer added the challenge was ""probably the only legal recourse left for us"" and he hoped the attorney general would exclude the pair from any executions this month while the legal process was ongoing.","drug smugglers on death ,australians on indonesia death ,two australian drug smugglers ,indonesia tearfully begged authorities ,smugglers on death row","['AFP', 'australian', 'Indonesia', 'Andrew Chan', 'Myuran Sukumaran']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42254943  0.53538561

After reaching a verbal agreement last week, the two companies were scheduled to sign a memorandum of understanding to take part in the project, but ""they appeared to need more time,"" another official said on condition of anonymity. ""The bidding failure today would cause a delay in the project,"" he said. After closing the bid on Monday, the DAPA had planned to choose a preferred bidder next month before a final selection around June at the earliest.Experts and industry watchers expect fierce competition between KAI and Korean Air Line. KAI has a technical edge over Korean Air based upon its experience developing the T-50 Golden Eagle supersonic trainer and the country's utility helicopter, Surion, while Korean Air has larger investment capacity.Airbus would also be able to complement Korean Air in terms of technical issues, they added. The South Korean military decided to use the twin-engine platform over the single-engine one, and Airbus is familiar with the platform after building the multi-role fighter, Eurofighter.

Results announced in December showed that Park had taken testosterone, a substance banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency.But Friday’s indictment appears to support claims by Park that he had never been informed of the doctor’s injection of the material. Park reportedly said he had consistently asked the doctor, identified by his surname Kim by prosecutors, if the injection could cause doping test problems.Kim had assured the athlete nothing would go wrong, according to statements from Team GMP, Park’s agency. Prosecutors added their investigations showed that neither Kim nor Park knew the injected materials violated WADA regulations.The indictment is also expected to affect decisions by authorities at a related hearing to be held on Feb. 27 by FINA, the international governing body of swimming, in Switzerland. The hearing will probe Park’s doping allegations.Despite the indictment that appears to clear Park’s name, FINA authorities may still ban the swimmer from the 2016 Rio Olympics and take away the medals he won in the 2014 Asian Games. Park won one silver and five bronze medals in the competition last fall in Incheon, South Korea.Park has expressed “shock” at the doping test results. The 25-year-old has vowed to continue practicing despite the ongoing investigations.Park’s popularity has only grown in South Korea since he rose to fame in the 2008 Beijing Olympics as the country’s first international Gold-medalist swimmer. He has earned estimated billions of won through commercial endorsements since then.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","swimmer failed doping test ,olympic gold medal swimmer ,medal swimmer failed doping ,gold medal swimmer failed ,korea first olympic gold","['Park Tae - hwan', 'Seoul', 'Park', 'South Korea ’s', 'Park', 'the World Anti - doping Agency']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.30456224  0.1368064

""But the entire system is brutal and inhumane. The way the surveillance is run ... The physical aspect is just one side of the experience."" In a letter to Kim, the commission of inquiry even warned that he could be held accountable. The U.N. General Assembly late last year approved a resolution urging that North Korea's human rights situation be referred to the International Criminal Court. North Korea tried to stop the momentum by raising the possibility of allowing a U.N. human rights visit to the country, but moments after it became clear that the resolution had strong support, its diplomats threatened another nuclear test. Now Pyongyang has shifted its approach. After another prominent defector last month said he had changed important parts of his life story, North Korea declared that anything based on Shin Dong-hyuk's testimony could not be trusted. This week, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Su Yong wrote to the U.N. secretary-general saying the U.N. resolution has ""collapsed"" and is illegal. Human rights groups and the head of the commission of inquiry, retired Australian judge Michael Kirby, say the report and ensuing resolution are based on the testimony of scores of North Korean defectors and remain solid. Jang called the drama over Shin's story ""kind of disappointing,"" saying there is so much more to North Korea's abuses than the questioning over which prison camps Shin grew up in and when. The former propaganda poet pointed to North Korea's pervasive system of surveillance and control. Practically all citizens of the entire desperately poor, nuclear-armed country are sealed off from the Internet. Informers are embedded in every level of society. Entire families can be punished for one person's mistakes or crimes. Jang says he fled North Korea after he lent a classified foreign document to a friend, who then left it on a train by mistake. He soon made it to South Korea, where he founded a news outlet called New Focus, featuring reports on North Korea based on sources within the country. Jang's escape is recounted in ""Dear Leader."" As with other defectors' accounts, many details can be almost impossible to verify. South Korean reports have said his name is a pen name. ""Why would I put my reputation on the line?"" Jang said when the question of changing narratives was raised. But he understands the pressures some North Korean defectors face to make their stories more compelling, perhaps especially as international attention to North Korea's human rights situation has grown. ""It's true that a lot of people are pressured to want to appease people's expectations,"" Jang said. ""But in Shin's case, it was not for money. His motive was just to tell the world. ... It wasn't deliberate fraud. It was more of a mismatch between outside expectations and the world he came from.""

No casualties were reported, but the authorities analyzed security camera footage and searched unearthed vehicles for possible casualties. Residents of the two apartment buildings nearest to the collapsed wall have been evacuated to a nearby school for safety. According to the emergency services, the accident caused about 1,000 metric tons of soil and concrete to spill into the parking lot.Following the incident it was revealed that the structure was not categorized as potentially dangerous despite its age and steep incline, excluding it from Gwangju’s citywide safety check-ups. At a height of 15 meters with a near-vertical incline, the structure was built in 1993 to protect the apartment complex from soil erosion of a nearby hill.According to Gwangju city government, the wall is classified only as an area of steep slope, and it was considered safe enough to exempt it from regular assessments. By Choi He-suk (cheesuk@heraldcorp.com)","gwangju collapsed early thursday ,collapsed early thursday burying ,wall collapsed burying vehicles ,early thursday burying dozens ,collapsed burying vehicles in",[],10,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.06518428 0.02998452 0.28344941],Korea Herald,Social affairs,2,2015,"collapsed early thursday burying dozens ,gwangju collapsed early thursday burying ,thursday burying dozens of vehicles ,high wall collapsed burying vehicles ,in gwangju collapsed early thursday",[],2,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.06518428 0.02998452 0.28344941]

One type of general anesthesia, which induces loss of protective reflexes and requires the use of a breathing tube, accounted for 48 percent of the deaths, the report showed. Sleeping anesthesia, which also induces sleep yet allows patients to breathe unassisted accounted for 37 percent, it added. The latter is known to be relatively safer than general anesthesia but still had a notable accident rate, the report said. The Korea Society of Anesthesiologists, a doctors’ union, pointed out that about 43 percent of the cases would have been “preventable if standard anesthesia care was given.” In case of sleeping anesthesia accidents, more than 90 percent of anesthesia injections were given by surgeons not by anesthesiologists, the report stated. For sleeping anesthesia, an intravenously administered hypnotic agent called propofol was used 90 percent of the time. Propofol is known for its hallucinogenic effects and addictiveness. It has also been reported that propofol is likely to cause more respiratory depression than other types of sedation, experts said.Despite the side effects of propofol, the majority of the concerned institutions did not record information about the anaesthetization of the victims, the report said. Very few hospitals recorded information on the use of anesthesia, it added. Of the victims, about 83 percent were under the age of 60, it added. Based on the report, the KSA is gearing up to urge the government to raise awareness and strengthen regulations on the use anesthesia. By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","16 died of anesthesia ,16 people died of ,anesthesia related accidents died ,105 patients who suffered ,accidents died between july","['Korea', 'Samsung Medical Center ’s']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47758257  0.4796994

No casualties were reported as of 9 a.m.However, the authorities are analyzing security camera footage and searching unearthed vehicles for possible casualties.  Vehicles stand crushed by the collapsed retaining wall in Gwangju on Thursday. (Yonhap)Residents of two apartment buildings nearest to the collapsed wall have been evacuated to a nearby school for safety. According to the emergency services, the accident caused about 1,000 metric tons of soil and concrete to spill into the parking lot.Following the incident it was revealed that the structure was not categorized as potentially dangerous despite its age and steep incline, excluding it from the citywide safety check up Gwangju has been conducting. At a height of 15 meters high with a near-vertical incline, the structure was built in 1993 to protect the apartment complex from soil erosion of a nearby hill.According to Gwangju city government, the wall is classified only as an area of steep slope, and it was considered safe enough to exempt it from regular assessment.

His wife reportedly delivered part of the ransom to them in exchange for the release.  The case was the latest kidnapping targeting South Koreans in the Philippines where violent crime such as murder and robbery aimed at Korean nationals have been on the rise in recent years.  Four South Koreans were set free on Jan. 26 after being held as hostages in the city of San Juan for four days.  Ten South Koreans were killed there last year while 13 Korean nationals were murdered there in 2013, according to the foreign ministry. In 2014, three cases of abduction of South Koreans took place.  The Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao consists of five Muslim provinces. Security in Mindanao remains unstable as Al-Qaeda-linked fundamentalist group Abusayapu and other Muslim extremists have been involved in crime targeting foreigners.  South Korea has imposed a special travel warning on Mindanao as crime targeting South Koreans there has increased. The travel warning calls for immediate withdrawal from the region.  Currently, an inspector-level officer is assigned to Manila's state police agency to handle criminal cases involving South Koreans.

Sadly, less than a year later, Adolf Hitler’s Germany invaded Poland when it would not surrender to German territorial demands. Germany had finally started a real war, World War II. Bruce W. BennettWhat Chamberlain appeared to miss is that the German objective was not to achieve “peace,” but rather to diplomatically undermine the strength and sovereignty of its neighbors en route to German dominance of Europe. For Hitler and other Nazi leaders, negotiations were an alternative means of waging war.We see a similar pattern with the current North Korean regime. It has reportedly declared that 2015 is the “year of a great war for unification.” It undoubtedly recognizes that the relative economic power of South Korea would allow South Korea to dominate any peaceful Korean unification, and therefore that a war of conquest is the only route for North Korea to dominate unification of Korea.But for North Korea to win a war of conquest against the South, the North must undermine the South Korea-U.S. alliance and degrade the readiness of the combined South Korea and U.S. military forces. The North has thus chosen to attack the major South Korea-U.S. military exercises that strengthen South Korea-U.S. military capabilities and cooperation. It has done so by promising not to carry out a nuclear test (which the United Nations has prohibited the North from doing) and by offering negotiations with the South and separately with the United States if the South Korea-U.S. exercises are canceled.For many, the North Korean approach seems reasonable. “The state-run Rodong Sinmun daily on Sunday said if the South Korean government ‘truly wants North-South talks and improved ties, it should demonstrate its sincerity by taking action to stop all the war rehearsals against North Korea,” the South Korean news outlet The Chosun Ilbo reported recently. Yet if this North Korean offer were sincere, wouldn’t the North stop talking of preparing for a “great war of unification” and offer to cancel its own preparations for such a war: its ongoing winter training exercises? But the North has not offered to cancel its winter training exercises. How hypocritical can the North be? If the North is serious about negotiating for improved Korean relations, it should “demonstrate its sincerity by taking action to stop all the war rehearsals’’ against South Korea.Meanwhile, many have complained about the U.S. government position of “strategic patience” with regard to North Korea. Because North Korea has reneged on many of its past-negotiated commitments, the United States has been waiting for the North to demonstrate its sincere intent to denuclearize before the United States returns to the Six-Party Talks or starts other formal negotiations. In practice, few in South Korea expect that the Six-Party Talks will lead to North Korean denuclearization unless the North changes its attitude ― exactly what the United States is asking North Korea to demonstrate. Instead, the North apparently wants the Six-Party Talks to recognize the North as a nuclear power, the opposite of denuclearization; why should the United States and South Korea join such negotiations?North Korea insists on not having to meet preconditions before restarting the Six-Party Talks. Yet the North is insisting that South Korea, in particular, meet preconditions for other negotiations with the North. Is North Korea really sincere about wanting to negotiate improved relations with South Korea and the U.S., or is it seeking to undermine the strength and sovereignty of its neighbor, just as Germany did before World War II?There is, of course, value to negotiating with any state, including North Korea, in part to test whether there is any possibility of peace and improved relations. President Park Geun-hye has properly argued that negotiations with the North will be useful to build trust and test the trustworthiness of the North. But there is little to be gained by meeting North Korean preconditions given the North’s history of not being trustworthy and its current hypocrisy. It is North Korea’s turn to demonstrate that South Korea and the United States should trust it. If the North is unprepared to demonstrate its sincerity, what chance is there that negotiations will amount to anything more than Kim Jong-un’s effort to wage war by another means? Does North Korea seek peace for our time, or dissolution of the South Korea-U.S. alliance en route to conquest of the ROK?By By Bruce W. BennettBruce W.

He plunged off the same bridge last Wednesday.Ham, who also served as an executive at a defense firm, was scheduled to face questioning on the day he leaped to his death. Prosecutors said they considered him a witness, rather than a suspect.The details of the case in which he was allegedly involved were not immediately clear. Ham was once in charge of the Navy's shipbuilding division.In November, South Korea launched a task force made up of prosecutors, military officers and government officials to root out corruption in the defense industry.The move came after an expensive homegrown salvage ship was proved defective at the peak of efforts to save those missing from a ferry disaster last year. The sinking claimed more than 300 lives.

The Navy said they had no other option but to drive them out in order to complete the construction of five four-story apartment buildings that would house essential members of navy operations and their families in the future, timed with the completion of the naval base in December as planned.The military has been constructing a modern military port that would hold up to 20 warships simultaneously, along with two 150,000 ton cruise ships.The military says the Jeju base, if completed as scheduled in December, will give Seoul a launching point for sending naval vessels into the South Sea, a key trade route for South Korea.But the opponents have long staged protests and taken legal steps to halt construction, citing potential environmental damage to the area designated as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.

(Yonhap)A 37-year-old suspect, identified only by his surname Heo, confessed to hitting the 29-year-old victim in Cheongju, North Chungcheong Province on Jan. 10. The victim, surnamed Kang, was on his way home with a bag of custard-filled bread for his pregnant wife who was studying for a state test to become a certified teacher. He died on the spot. Kang called his wife -- who is expecting a child in two months -- just before the accident apologizing for not getting her cake because of their financial difficulties. The final moments of the victim immediately moved tens of thousands of online users, who sympathized with him as “cream-bread dad.”News of the incident stirred a national uproar, but the police had difficulty in identifying the car model and its registered number plate due to the poor quality of image captured by the surveillance camera. The case went viral after a local traffic officer left a message on a popular website after reading the reports. He said that his office operates another surveillance camera installed near the accident site and that it could give a clue.After analyzing the fresh footage, the police on Thursday released that the car model the suspect drove was Chevrolet Windstorm, and requested for any information. (Yonhap)Under pressure, the suspect turned himself in at the police station later in the evening.Heo confessed that he drove after drinking four bottles of soju but claimed that he wasn’t aware of hitting the man at that time, the police said. He came to know of the tragedy from the news coverage, investigators said after questioning him on Friday. The police said they would seek an arrest warrant for the suspect soon, officials said. The suspect said he turned in himself because he “felt so guilty and couldn’t breathe.”Investigators, however, suspect that Heo may have attempted to remove all evidence and cover up the case.The suspect had brought the damaged car to his parents’ house and repaired it with components he purchased, police said. The police also said that the suspect tried to commit suicide but was persuaded by his wife to give himself up.

However, it was extremely unusual that, at least on paper, China sold no crude oil to North Korea for all of last year.In 2014, China's exports of petroleum products to North Korea jumped 48.22 percent from a year earlier to US$1.54 million, according to the data based on Chinese trade statistics and compiled by the Beijing unit of South's Korea Trade and Investment Promotion Agency.""Although final statistics show that China's exports of crude oil to North Korea were counted as 'zero' in 2014, experts suggest that the possibility of China's suspension of crude oil exports to North Korea remains low,"" the agency said in a statement.South Korean diplomatic sources in Beijing have also cautioned against reading too much into the official Chinese trade figures because China has provided crude oil to North Korea in the form of grant aid and such shipments were not recorded on paper.There has been no clear indication that the 2014 trade figures reflect China's willingness to use crude oil as leverage to press North Korea to change course in its nuclear ambition.North Korea conducted its third and most powerful nuclear test in February 2013, straining political ties with Beijing's leadership.Asked about the absence of crude oil shipments to North Korea, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying stressed Beijing's ""normal"" trade relations with North Korea, but sidestepped questions over whether Beijing genuinely stopped shipping crude oil to Pyongyang.Excluding crude oil, bilateral trade between North Korea and China fell 2.79 percent from a year ago to $6.36 billion last year, marking the first annual decline in six years, according to the data.

Nine are still missing. The sinking of the 6,825-ton ferry is one of the deadliest maritime disasters in the country's history, and it triggered widespread calls for an overhaul of the country's maritime safety regulations.Those implicated in the tragedy have been arrested and are on trial, with state prosecutors claiming a combination of ship cargo overloading, poor steering and remodeling of the vessel as the cause of the disaster.Criticism of the government's poor initial response and confusion led to the dismantlement of the Coast Guard.The ministry said that 800 million won (US$742,000) will be used next month to conduct detailed evaluations on the main sea routes around the country, with another 4 billion won to be spent on establishing new safe operational guidelines around the major ports of Ulsan, Gwangyang and Incheon that are used frequently by oil tankers and other large ships.The Sewol ferry had left from Incheon on its ill-fated voyage, with port authorities being blamed for failing to check whether the ship was overloaded.In addition, the maritime ministry said it will follow through on reform measures announced in September that call for the government to directly regulate safety, increase the amount of fines for rule violations from 30 million won to 1 billion won, and reduce the age of vessels that can be used as car ferries from 30 to 25 years.All crew members will be obliged to wear uniforms, and barriers restricting companies from entering the shipping line business will be lifted in June.To ensure that companies make a profit, which is critical for upgrading safety rules and crew training, the government will allow fuel surcharges and flexible fare rates for weekend operations.In addition, the ministry said it will take steps to reduce the number of accidents involving fishing boats, which made up 76.7 percent of all maritime accidents in the past five years.These steps include automatic location tracking systems, compelling crew members to wear life jackets and implementing mandatory safety instruction for people on fishing boats.On the peaceful use of waters surrounding the Korean Peninsula, systematic measures will be taken to better manage the country's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and its continental shelf regions, the ministry said.

Any driver who refuses a passenger will be slapped with a 200,000 won ($185) fine the first time, and a 400,000 won fine and 30 day suspension the second time. Drivers caught turning away passengers three times in two years will have to pay a 600,000 won fine on top of having their permits revoked.The government will also clamp down on taxi companies. For example, a company with 100 taxis will be issued a first warning if its drivers have been caught refusing passengers 20 times, resulting in a 60 day operation freeze. After 40 cases, the authorities will issue a second warning and force the company to reduce its number of taxis. After 60 violations, the company will receive a third warning and lose its license to operate.The number of violations required for each warning will vary in proportion to the size of each company’s taxi fleet.Officials said the new measure was aimed at reducing the inconveniences caused by taxis’ illegal refusal to accept passengers.

He was residing in Europe.The 20-something man was taken into custody for questioning, according to Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency. The suspect was confirmed Monday to be the son of a former aide to National Assembly Speaker Chung Ui-hwa. Police said he called Cheong Wa Dae’s civil affairs office Sunday around 2:39 a.m. and threatened to bomb it. Tourists take photographs with Cheong Wa Dae in the background on Jan. 25, the day the bomb threat was made. (Yonhap)“If you do not show me your willingness by noon, I will blow up Cheong Wa Dae,” he said in his message, without elaborating on what he meant by “willingness.”He made similar threats on Jan. 17 on Twitter, saying he would bomb the residence of President Park Geun-hye and her Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon.His motives were not yet known as of Tuesday, but he is believed to have a history of mental illness.The suspect was accompanied by his father, who on Friday submitted his resignation and headed to France to talk his son into facing authorities here. His father was a Grade-4 assistant at the assembly speaker’s office, and was in charge of arranging external events.Investigators have yet to definitively comment on how plausible the suspect’s threat was, but said there was “very little possibility” that he would have been able to carry out the bombing.The suspect left for France on Jan. 13 without his parents’ knowledge, and is unlikely to have had time to prepare the supposed attack. While Kang specified when of his attacks would take place, nothing actually occurred at the cited times. “As of now, the bomb threats appear to have been a simple prank with no possibility of being carried out. But we cannot conclusively say so untill we’ve questioned him,” said a police official. Investigators are planning to ask Kang about his motives, whether he had any accomplices, his reasons for going to France and what he did there.

""In my mind I wish very much that this wasn't true.""Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe branded the execution ""outrageous and unforgivable"" and called for Goto's immediate release.""I condemn it strongly and resolutely,"" said the Japanese leader.US President Barack Obama condemned the ""brutal murder"" and offered Abe condolences while expressing his solidarity with the people of Japan.British Prime Minister David Cameron decried the Islamic State group's ""murderous barbarity,” and French President Francois Hollande labelled it a ""barbaric assassination.”The United Nations Security Council unanimously condemned the group's ""brutality"" and its ""heinous and cowardly act.”Germany and the EU also condemned the killing by IS, an extremist Sunni Muslim group which activists say carries out near-daily executions, often beheadings, in areas under its control.The group, which originated in Iraq and appeared in Syria's civil war in spring 2013, holds swathes of Syria and Iraq where it has declared an Islamic ""caliphate.”- Western beheadings -======================Since then it has committed atrocities including the beheadings of two US reporters, an American aid worker and two British aid workers.The Amman bombings -- including one that hit a hotel where a wedding party was in full swing -- were claimed by Jordanian-born Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Al-Qaeda leader in Iraq who was killed in a US air raid there in June 2006.His group was a precursor of IS, and Rishawi's brother, Samir Atruss al-Rishawi, who was also killed in Iraq, was one of Zarqawi's top lieutenants.Sunday's radio statement made no mention of the $200 million ransom that the group had initially demanded, but only referred to the release of Sajida al-Rishawi.The 44-year-old woman has been sentenced to death in Jordan, which lifted an eight-year moratorium on capital punishment in December by hanging 11 men convicted of murder.The ransom demand came as Abe pledged, during a trip to the Middle East, a multi-million dollar aid package to countries affected by the militant group's bloody expansion in Iraq and Syria.But Abe has been defiant.""We will never give in to terrorism, and we will actively contribute to the peace and stability of the world together with the international community.

The Ulsan District Court ruled that the sea captain must pay 110 million won ($102,000) to three family members of the defector, who worked for him as a diver, for not taking efficient safety measures to protect his life. The diver, who fled to Seoul in 2011, died of carbon monoxide poisoning while working underwater in 2013. The court, however, ruled that the captain only held 60 percent of the blame, as the diver was partly responsible for his own safety.The suit was filed by the diver’s older brother, who had been the first of the two to escape to Seoul. The brother, who has been the diver’s legal representative, named their parents and the victim’s wife as the plaintiffs.Despite the unprecedented ruling, speculation over whether the bereaved family in the North can indeed receive the compensation remains uncertain amid the strained ties between North and South Korea, legal experts said. Until the compensation is delivered to the plaintiffs, the legal representative is obliged to safeguard it under the court’s supervision, court authorities said. The compensation is not allowed to be handed over without the court’s permission, they added. The court is also allowed to appoint someone else to take care of the compensation if the legal representative is found to have mismanaged the money, court sources said.

(Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)On Jan. 19, 1990, Ilham, an Azerbaijani newlywed, took to the streets of Baku to protest against the Soviet invasion. Unarmed, he yelled, “Stop firing at innocent civilians.” Soviet soldiers shot him dead.Upon hearing the news of his death, his wife Farida committed suicide later in the evening. Their bodies were cremated together the next day and buried at Martyrs’ Lane cemetery in Baku. 25 years since, their graves have been visited by throngs of lovers and couples.Ilham and Farida were among 137 Azerbaijanis who died during the Soviet troops’ violent two-day crackdown on the independence demonstration, which later became known as “Black January.” “Under the authorization of former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, 26,000 troops and tanks stormed our country and killed, tortured and imprisoned Azeris who demanded independence from the Soviet Union,” Azerbaijani Ambassador to Korea Ramzi Teymurov said in a keynote speech at a 25th anniversary memorial at the embassy building in Seoul last Monday. Azerbaijani Ambassador Ramzi Teymurov“The purpose of the heinous attack was to delay the Soviet demise and suppress Azerbaijan’s freedom demands.”More than 130 people were killed and 800 injured. The event only hastened the Soviet collapse, already set in motion by the glasnost and perestroika reforms, Teymurov said. The Soviet justification was to “stop pogroms and violence against Armenians in Azerbaijan,” 50 of whom were killed in an ethnic clash a week earlier on Jan. 13. The Azerbaijani Embassy refuted the claim, saying the Soviet militarily intervened to transfer jurisdiction of the Nagorno-Karabakh region from Azerbaijan to Armenia.Ethnic tensions between Azerbaijanis and Armenians erupted into a full-scale war in 1991. Armenia, backed by the Russian military, gained control of the region. International organizations such as the U.N. General Assembly, Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and the Organization of the Islamic Conference have condemned the Armenian occupation, Teymurov said. In 1994, a cease-fire agreement was signed with no resolution of a peace agreement to date ― a situation similar to North and South Korea, the ambassador added. Through the conflict, over 1 million ethnic Azerbaijanis became refugees and internationally displaced persons. Gorbachev, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1990, apologized to Azerbaijan in 1995 and said, “The declaration of a state of emergency in Baku was the biggest mistake of my political career.”Azerbaijan has since pursued an independent foreign policy track, one characterized by “pragmatism, restraint and a helpful bias toward integration with the West,” a U.S. diplomatic cable was quoted as saying in a New York Times article on Jan. 9, 2015. At the same time, Baku’s current relations with Moscow remain “very positive” as a strategic partnership, the ambassador added. He said that despite the political instability, economic breakdown, social chaos and lack of defense capacity of the early 1990s, Azerbaijan developed rapidly as a sovereign and economically vibrant nation. The “contract of the century” ― aimed at tapping into the country’s rich deep-water oil reserves ― was signed between Azerbaijan’s state oil company and 13 Western oil companies in 1994.Azerbaijan is the third-largest ex-Soviet oil producer. The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline passes through Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey for 1,768 kilometers, supplying Azeri crude oil to the European markets. “We are now trying to diversify our economy by developing non-oil industries,” Teymurov said. “Our government is investing the oil and gas revenues in the information and technology, construction, infrastructure, agriculture and tourism sectors for future growth.” Teymurov noted that more than 40 Korean companies have participated in various public projects in Azerbaijan in the last five years. Total Korean investment stands at $150 million and bilateral trade volume reached $300 million in 2013. Interparliamentary and military cooperation has been active, Teymurov added, affirmed by Korean Prime Minister Chung Hong-won’s visit to Azerbaijan last November. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev visited Korea in 2007, and again in 2012 to participate in the Seoul Nuclear Security Summit.

Japan’s continuing efforts to repatriate the abductees will deter North Korean military provocations this year, experts said in the seminar “Where do the North Korea-Japan relations stand today?” at the East Asia Foundation building in Seoul last Wednesday.“The abduction of Japanese citizens has been a stumbling block to improving relations with North Korea,” said Keio University professor emeritus Masao Okonogi. “Although a credible report has yet to be released by the North ― one was initially due last December ― the first finding will be a lynchpin in normalizing our diplomacy.”The issue has been Japan’s “top priority” regarding the North for the last 20 years; it prompted its participation in the six-party talks and diplomatic normalization efforts with the regime.While the United States and the United Nations have recently ratcheted up pressure on North Korea on human rights and nuclear issues, Japan has engaged in a policy of “pressure and dialogue,” observers say.North Korea has acknowledged having abducted 13 citizens between 1977 and 1983 to provide Japanese language and culture training for its spies. The Japanese government’s official tally is 17.Okonogi said that Prime Minister Abe Shinzo, now in his second term, was able to win the snap election on Dec. 14 on the promise of a “strong Japan” and the vow to settle the abduction issue while in office.“In his first term as prime minister from 2006 (to 2007), he made no progress on the issue and left behind a great burden,” Okonogi said. “Now his second prime ministership hinges on his ‘high-risk, high-reward’ pledge, which is set to determine his political life.”Critics have pointed out that Japan’s conservative politicians have used the issue to arouse nationalism, revise the pacifist constitution and strengthen its military.Japan’s leading scholar on North Korea, Keio University professor emeritus Masao Okonogi, spoke about the abduction issue in the seminar “Where do the North Korea-Japan relations stand today?” at the East Asia Foundation building in Seoul last Wednesday. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)“For Abe and other nationalists, the kidnappings underlined the weakness of Japan’s postwar institutions, which were incapable of ensuring citizens’ safety and territorial integrity,” The Diplomat said in reference to Abe’s “Taking Japan Back” campaign.North Korea had long justified its conduct as “revenge” against Japan’s wartime atrocities against Koreans. However, Ritsumeikan University visiting professor Hirai Hisashi, who participated in the seminar, said, “It also gave Japan a platform to see itself as a ‘victim’ rather than an ‘aggressor.’”At the height of the Cold War, North Korea sent waves of secret agents in high-powered spy boats disguised as fishing vessels to kidnap Japanese citizens. Their prime targets being coastal areas, five of 17 were abducted from the port city of Niigata.Megumi Yokota, then a 13-year-old girl, was abducted in Niigata in November 1977. She has since become a symbol of Japan’s “open wounds.” Her parents have appeared on television, given over 1,400 lectures nationwide and spoken to Japanese politicians and international organizations. When then-Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi visited Pyongyang to resolve the issue in 2002, North Korea said that Megumi had committed suicide in 1994 after being told that she could never return home. A DNA test of her alleged remains in Japan came out negative.Late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il acknowledged the abductions, but shirked responsibility by blaming “some agents who wanted to show their heroism and adventurism.”North Korea opened investigations in 2002 and 2004, and admitted that 13 were kidnapped, and eight had died. But Japan rejected the findings, trusting its National Police Agency instead, which estimated that around 880 had been kidnapped.Five abductees returned home on Oct. 15, 2002. Their children joined them after Koizumi revisited Pyongyang in 2004.In their first major high-level meeting in a decade in Stockholm last May, North Korea agreed to “reinvestigate” the abductions through a special investigation committee. In return, Japan lifted several sanctions last July ― raising the ceiling for money transfers to North Korea from Japan, and easing the ban on the entry of North Koreans and sending of humanitarian goods.Okonogi said that North Korea was unlikely to engage in a military provocation this year, at least until October, when the country celebrates the Workers’ Party’s 70th anniversary.“Public opinion will not be favorable to confrontation. Therefore, the regime will pursue the double-track of nuclear and economic development, while playing cat-and-mouse through negotiations,” Hirai said.Meanwhile, Megumi’s parents, 82-year-old Shigeru and 78-year-old Sakie, continue their search for their daughter, who would be 50 if alive. “Time is running out,” they told the press recently.By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","japan to play cat ,korean family reunion ,abductees will deter north ,abductions while south korea ,inter korean family reunion","['South Korea', 'inter - korean', 'Japan', 'North Korea', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'north korean', 'Nort']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.80922234  0.39591011

Abe, speaking to public broadcaster NHK, said he was ""speechless"" at the ""unbearable pain and sorrow"" that Yukawa's family were feeling. ""Such act of terrorism is outrageous and impermissible, it causes me nothing but strong indignation,"" he said.""I condemn it strongly and resolutely,"" he said as he demanded the immediate release of Yukawa's fellow captive, freelance journalist Kenji Goto.Shoichi Yukawa told of the horror of realising the threats to kill his son had been carried out.""I thought 'Ah, this finally happened' and was filled with regret,"" he said in a statement to media.""I went totally blank, I was only sorry... I had no words to say,"" he said. ""In my mind I wish very much that this wasn't true.""US President Barack Obama led the condemnation of the Islamic State group's ""brutal murder"" of Yukawa. British Prime Minister David Cameron decried the movement's ""murderous barbarity"", and French President Francois Hollande labelled it a ""barbaric assassination"". Japan would continue analysing the images to fully confirm the authenticity of the video, said Abe, but the ""credibility"" of the footage was ""high"". The recording, which lasts nearly three minutes, shows a still image of Goto holding what appears to be a photograph of Yukawa's slain body.It was posted with an audio recording in which a man claiming to be Goto blames Abe for his fellow captive's death after he failed to pay a $200 million ransom.The voice also reveals a new demand from the militants for the release of Sajida al-Rishawi, a female militant now held in Jordan, in exchange for Goto's life.Abe said Japan was in contact with Jordan but declined to comment on whether Tokyo would ask Amman to release the prisoner, who is being held in connection with multiple murders.The appearance of the video was met with initial skepticism, partly because it was not posted on an official IS channel and does not bear their black and white flag. The execution of Yukawa is also not shown.Goto's mother, Junko Ishido, told reporters Sunday that she was left with little hope after seeing the picture of her son, in which he ""looked very tense"".- Mother's appeal for mercy -=============================The hostage saga began on Tuesday when the militants released a video in which they demanded a $200 million ransom within 72 hours in exchange for the lives of the two hostages.On Friday Goto's mother Ishido launched an emotional appeal begging for mercy for her son.""I say to you people of the Islamic State, Kenji is not your enemy. Please release him,"" she said.As the deadline passed Friday, there was an agonising silence from the jihadists until this new video was posted late Saturday.The Islamic State group, which rules large swathes of Iraq and Syria under a strict form of Islamic law, has murdered five Western hostages since August last year, but this is the first time it has threatened Japanese captives.Japanese officials have repeatedly said they are trying to make contact with the militants through various channels.Abe advisor Yosuke Isozaki reportedly said there had been some ""indirect""  communication with the militants, but ""nothing direct"".Tokyo has little diplomatic leverage in the Middle East, but local media had previously said Abe may try to use his close relationship with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to rescue the hostages.The Islamists linked their earlier $200 million ransom demand to the amount Abe said he would earmark to help countries dealing with the influx of refugees fleeing fighting between IS militants and regular forces.Abe was defiant Sunday, saying Tokyo was not intimidated by the murder. ""We will never give in to terrorism, and actively contribute to the peace and stability of the world together with the international community. We are not wavering at all on this policy,"" he said on NHK.The Japanese media has rallied around Goto, a respected and experienced war reporter whose work has appeared on domestic television channels.In video footage he filmed around the time he entered Syria, he explains that he is aware of the risks.""Whatever happens, I am the one who is responsible,"" he says. ""I am asking you, Japanese people, do not place responsibility on the people of Syria. Please. I am sure I will come back alive though.""

Ja Song-nam, as well as So Se-pyong, ambassador to the North Korean mission to Geneva, which called for the suspension of human rights violation charges against North Korea.The U.S. and COI Chairman Michael Kirby came to the defense of the human rights report earlier this week, saying that the report is sufficient enough as evidence of North Korea's deplorable human rights situation.Despite the defense, the North may muster further efforts to discredit testimonies of North Korean defectors, as well as human rights violation charges based on the testimonies, experts said.""So far, the testimonies of North Korean defectors played the key role in formulating the image of North Korea to the outside world,"" said Chang Yong-suk, a researcher at the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies at Seoul National University. ""The country could attempt to capitalize on the recent episode of Shin in order to renew its negative image,"" Chang noted.The COI report, which accused North Korea of ""systemic, widespread and gross human rights violations,"" was the basis of the U.N.'s adoption of a human rights resolution late last year, calling for the referral of the human right situation to the International Criminal Court.North Korea has vehemently resisted the COI report, saying it's a U.S. plot to topple the regime.

Oh was standing on the deck near the cannon as other sailors tried to remove the shells loaded in the flawed system for safety reasons.The accident took place some 6.2 kilometers off the coast of Taean, South Chungcheong Province at around 6.20 p.m. He was immediately transported to a nearby hospital and received emergency surgery that night. “During a live-fire drill on the ship near Uldo Island in West Sea, no shell was able to come out of the cannon for a reason yet to be identified. So, we decided to return to the base,” said a senior Navy official, declining to be named.“Before reaching the port, we had to remove all the shells loaded into the cannon to ensure that the shells did not explode on the ground. The shell, all of a sudden, was fired and hit the side of Oh’s head.”The official added that the fired shell exploded in the air and fell into the sea, and that there were no civilian casualties.The Navy is currently investigating what caused the problem in the cannon, and whether sailors complied with safety regulations concerning the process of removing shells from a malfunctioning weapons system at sea.The cannon was manufactured in Israel and has been upgraded by a Korean defense firm.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","sailor injured in shell ,injured in shell explosion ,shell accidently fired from ,shell explosion navy sailor ,hit by shell accidently","['Navy', 'the 2nd Fleet Command']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.13286789 -0.2227418

Out of the 5,157 names listed on the records, 2,091 were immediately confirmed as bona-fide victims of Japan's forced labor.The records were compiled in 1953 under the Rhee Syng-man administration following South Korea's independence from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule.The confirmation comes as some local labor victims are awaiting a court ruling in a landmark damage suit filed against some Japanese companies that were involved in the colonial-era forced labor.Officials said a court decision in favor of the South Korean labor victims may trigger a flurry of economic and diplomatic issues to be settled between the neighbors. The government estimates that up to 7,820,000 Koreans had been forced into hard labor under the brutal colonial rule of Japan.Only 600,000 so far have been officially recognized as labor victims entitled to state financial support.Japan has long declared that all liabilities toward the South Korean government and individual victims were settled through the 1965 treaty between the two countries, which restored diplomatic ties. In the treaty, Japan provided a large sum of money to the South Korean government.

The ventilation facility was constructed by the subcontractor without a proper license, investigators at the Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency in Suwon, a city just south of Seongnam, said.Police earlier confirmed that the facility was not constructed tightly enough to withstand pressure after one of the two parts supporting the ventilation grate broke and the welded part snapped.The agency said it has booked 17 people, including concert organizers and employees of the company that installed the ventilation grate, for investigation.Police also concluded that the Gyeonggi provincial government and Seongnam city are not liable for the tragedy as the Internet-based business newspaper Edaily and the Gyeonggi Institute of Science and Technology Promotion were the main sponsors of the event.""The actual co-sponsors of the event were Edaily and the Gyeonggi Institute of Science and Technology Promotion,"" said a police officer, adding that the agency will refer the 17 people to the prosecution.Some 700 people attended the concert where various South Korean musicians, including girl group 4Minute, performed.

473,473,‘Missing Korean in Turkey intended to vanish’,"A Korean teenager who went missing in Turkey earlier this month had deliberately planned his trip and disappearance near the Syrian border, the police said Wednesday, raising the possibility of his involvement with the Islamic State militant group. The 18-year-old tourist from Seoul, surnamed Kim, vanished on Jan. 10 after leaving a hotel in the border town of Kilis, according to the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency ...","A Korean teenager who went missing in Turkey earlier this month had deliberately planned his trip and disappearance near the Syrian border, the police said Wednesday, raising the possibility of his involvement with the Islamic State militant group. The 18-year-old tourist from Seoul, surnamed Kim, vanished on Jan. 10 after leaving a hotel in the border town of Kilis, according to the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency and Foreign Ministry. He initially set foot in Istanbul on Jan. 8 and flew to the southern city of Gaziantep before reaching Kilis by car the next day with another Korean surnamed Hong, who reported his disappearance to the Korean Embassy on Jan. 12.After questioning his family and Hong, the police concluded that Kim appeared to have willingly gone to the border region as he had been in contact with a Turkish man via social media, arranged his entire itinerary on his own and concealed the purpose of the trip to Hong and his parents. “So far we have not discovered any link to a possible abduction or disappearance,” Chung Jae-il, head of the agency’s first international crime investigative unit, told a news conference in Seoul. “Although we unearthed a multitude of materials suggesting his interest in the IS, we cannot confirm whether he has actually joined it.” Since October, Kim had chatted with a Twitter user based in Turkey about ways to join the extremist group, the police said. The man gave Kim the phone number of a presumed IS member in Istanbul named Hassan who would “help” him via Surespot, an encrypted messenger service that directly links users’ devices to transmit conversations to boost security. In one Twitter post, a user purported to be Kim said he “wanted to join” the militant group. In another, he wrote he was “ready” to travel to the Eurasian country. He also wrote he sought to “leave my country and family” and “just want to get a new life.” The police also found more than 50 images on his computer of IS fighters and flags and Muslim women, as well as evidence that he had looked up such words as the IS, Islam, Turkey and Syria more than 500 times over the past year, with 65 related websites bookmarked on his browser. On Tuesday, Foreign Ministry officials here said that Kim had ridden with a local man in a vehicle with Syrian license plates that was being used as an unregistered taxi, citing CCTV footage and the Turkish police.The driver told Turkish police that he dropped them off after about 25 minutes near a Syrian refugee camp in Besiriye, some 18 kilometers east of Kilis and 5 kilometers from the frontier. He said the two men had not conversed during the ride, apparently to avoid revealing their identities. But the video failed to help identify the other passenger, who the driver said spoke Arabic and was “ordinary” though he could not specify his nationality.With Turkey and Syria sharing a porous border stretching some 900 kilometers, many foreign terrorist fighters travel from Istanbul to Kilis via Gaziantep to sneak into Syria, experts and activists say. If he has indeed joined the group, Kim would be the first confirmed Korean IS fighter. A Saudi Arabian IS member said in a media interview in September that the group consisted of fighters of various nationalities, including Koreans, but Seoul officials have dismissed the claim as unreliable. Ankara said it has barred entry to Turkey of more than 7,200 people who were thought to be seeking IS membership, while deporting nearly 1,200 would-be jihadists.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","missing korean in turkey ,to vanish korean teenager ,vanish korean teenager ,vanish korean teenager who ,the police said wednesday","['korean', 'Turkey', 'syrian', 'Islamic', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'Kilis', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26577291  0.62718183

""Many materials suggest that he was greatly interested in IS. However, police cannot confirm whether he had actually joined them,"" said Jeong. It would mark the first known occurrence of a South Korean national to join any radical Muslim militant group if Kim were found to have joined the group voluntarily.   After searching Kim's personal computer, the investigator said Kim accessed IS-linked websites and exchanged dialogue with a Turkish friend he met online known as ""Hassan."" Kim's parents allowed him to travel to Turkey, along with a family friend, after he pleaded to make the trip, the official said, adding that they were unaware that Kim had wanted to meet Hassan in person.Also, police said Kim posted on his Facebook account on Jan. 7 that he wanted to leave South Korea to search for a new life.""I want to leave this country and family. I just want a new life,"" Kim said.The SMPA also said that Kim made one phone call on Jan. 9 and another on Jan. 10 before taking a taxi with a Syrian license plate, together with an unidentified man after meeting him in front of the hotel in Kilis.

But police found that he had already possessed the tools for the homicide when he visited the crime scene, said investigators at Ansan Sangrok Police Station. “CCTV images of the adjacent areas (of the crime scene) showed that Kim bought a pair of work gloves at a store near the victim’s home before breaking in,” officials said. They also learned that Kim already had on him the knife he used in the crime when he entered the residence where the victims lived.Although Kim has denied raping his stepdaughter before murdering her, forensic analysis of the girl’s body discovered Kim’s semen and traces of his DNA inside the body. Investigators found that Kim was frequently violent with his wife during the seven years they lived together. “When his wife refused to meet him or talk to him over the phone, Kim planned the cited crime. He believed that he could lure her out by taking the children hostage,” police said. Police profilers have deduced that Kim is a psychopath who is deluded into believing he can control the actions and even thoughts of his wife. They said that he has very little guilt and empathy. He is also very violent and tries to rationalize his crimes, they added.Kim is also being charged with the illegal possession of a Japanese sword. Overall, he is facing 10 different charges including homicide, rape, assault and confinement against one’s will.On Jan. 12, Kim entered the home of his wife’s ex-husband and took the man’s common law wife hostage. When his wife’s ex-husband returned, Kim killed him with a kitchen knife he is thought to have brought from his home. He then took the teenage girls, born between his wife and her ex-husband, hostage. He was caught after police commandos stormed the residence after a five-hour negotiation ended in failure.By Yoon Min-shik, Choi He-suk(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com) (cheesuk@heraldcorp.com)","ansan murderer raped stepdaughter ,raped stepdaughter planned killing ,murderer raped stepdaughter ,murderer raped stepdaughter planned ,stepdaughter planned killing kim","['Kim Sang - hoon', 'Kim Sang - hoon(yonhap)the', 'Ansan', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Kim']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.91598356  0.006927

(Yonhap)The authorities believe that the workers, employees of a demolition contractor, were in the process of detaching the machine room from the 40-ton crane. According to reports, three of the workers were cutting through structures holding the machine room in place, while another was working inside the machine room. A fifth worker assigned to the project escaped unhurt as he was overseeing the operations from the ground. The shipyard was initially believed to belong to Daesun Shipbuilding and Engineering Co., but it was later revealed that the company had sold the facility to Geocheong Shipbuilding Co. in December. Geochung is a supplier of ship parts, and the crane was being dismantled as part of the company’s plans to convert the plot occupied by the structure for a different use. The police plans to question witnesses and officials of the contractor to determine whether safety protocols were followed.

We indeed killed them, as our Lord instructed us in His Book,"" Shekau said in the 35-minute message, which was posted on the video-sharing website YouTube.The militant leader was shown speaking in front of four white pick-up trucks, with eight masked and heavily armed men. But there was no indication of when or where the video was shot.Survivors of the Baga attack, which also saw Boko Haram fighters capture a military base used by Nigerian, Nigerien and Chadian troops, have described how bodies still littered the streets.Shekau dismissed the extent of the slaughter, saying: ""We will not stop. This is not much. You'll see.""Representatives from Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon have been meeting to seek a regional response to the threat from Boko Haram because of increasing fears of cross-border raids.Ghana's President John Dramani Mahama has also suggested a new force, possibly under the auspices of the African Union, to crush the group.But in the video, Shekau dismisses the threat and shows off a huge arsenal of weapons, apparently from the military base, and said Boko Haram would take on all-comers.""The kings of Africa, you are late.

The 18-year-old tourist, surnamed Kim from Seoul, vanished on Jan. 10 after leaving a hotel in the border town of Kilis, according to Korea’s Foreign Ministry and police. He touched down in Istanbul on Jan. 8 and flew to the southern city of Gaziantep before arriving in Kilis by car the next day alongside another Korean, who reported his disappearance to the Korean Embassy on Jan. 12.CCTV footage showed that Kim rode in a vehicle with a Syrian number plate used for illicit taxi services, along with a man speaking Arabic who waved to him at about 8:30 a.m. on that day, ministry officials said, citing the police there. The driver dropped them after about 25 minutes near a Syrian refugee camp in Besiriye, some 18 kilometers east of Kilis. “The Arab man approached the driver at around 7:30 a.m. that day and asked him to come pick him up one hour later near a mosque across the hotel where the boy was staying,” a ministry official told reporters on customary condition of anonymity. The findings are stoking concerns about the teen’s safety and possible ties with the extremist group. The police here have found from his computer images containing IS fighters and flags, as well as evidence that he had been in contact with a purported IS member named Hassan via social networking services such as Twitter and Surespot. With Turkey and Syria sharing a porous frontier stretching some 600 kilometers, many foreign terrorist fighters follow Kim’s itinerary linking Istanbul to Kilis via Gaziantep to sneak into Syria, experts and activists say. “The Turkish police said they have not yet passed a border checkpoint but we’ve not been able to figure out their whereabouts since they reached Besiriye despite all our effort,” the official said. “We cannot determine anything at this point, nor can we rule out the possibility that he has joined the IS, which would mean an extremely worrying situation. We’re working with other related agencies, putting top priority on his safety and immediate return.” The ministry has issued a travel warning for southeastern Turkey, especially within 10 kilometers of the Syrian border. Some Koreans have previously visited the region for missionary or volunteer work at Syrian refugee camps.Seoul and Damascus have no official diplomatic relations.In September, a Saudi Arabian IS member said in an interview that the group consists of fighters of various nationalities including Korean. Seoul officials said the claim was unreliable.Some 3,000 people in Turkey are believed to be linked to the extremist group, a Turkish intelligence report said Saturday, calling for stepped-up surveillance in the wake of the deadly attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris.Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has also said that up to 700 Turkish nationals had joined the IS.

In one Twitter post, a user presumed to be Kim said he “wanted to join” the militant group. In another, he wrote he was “ready” to travel to Turkey.The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency has concluded that Kim is likely to have attempted to slip into Syria and the purpose of his trip was to join the IS.

Seoul officials have dismissed the claim as unreliable. Adding to the concerns, the armed group issued a video online later in the day purporting to show two Japanese hostages, and demanding $200 million from Tokyo in ransom. The clip evoked dreary memories for Seoul, which has also been blackmailed by Islamist militants holding Korean nationals hostage in the Middle East. In 2004, the translator and Christian missionary Kim Sun-il was kidnapped and executed in Iraq by the Jama’at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad group after Korea brushed off demands that it scrap plans to send 3,000 more troops to the country and pull out hundreds of medics and engineers already there.In 2007, a group of 23 Korean Christians was taken hostage in Afghanistan by the Taliban. Two of them were killed during a standoff, while the rest were eventually freed.

Four were killed and 126 injured in a blaze that engulfed three residential buildings on Jan. 10. The city police confirmed from surveillance camera footage that the fire had started from a spark from a motorcycle in a ground-floor parking lot. The motorbike owner, identified by his surname Kim, was booked on charges of accidentally causing a fire and negligent homicide. According to the police, 53-year-old Kim attempted to warm up the motorbike’s ignition switch with a cigarette lighter as the key had gotten stuck in the cold. Investigators suspect that lighter may have melted the wire coating of the ignition box, which later caused the spark.Further investigation into motorcycle incident is underway, the police said. Authorities also booked owners of two of the damaged buildings for violating construction regulations. The nonresidential buildings were illegally turned into apartments by dividing the rooms to accommodate more residents, authorities said. Meanwhile, as part of efforts to tighten safety regulations, the Public Safety Ministry vowed to push for a new regulation that all buildings must have walls built with incombustible materials. Concerns have escalated over construction rules after it was reported that the apartment fire quickly spread to two adjacent buildings due to flammable walls. Currently, incombustible materials are only required for the construction of the outer walls of skyscrapers, public-purpose buildings and factories.

This means the harness was not being used,"" said a TEPCO spokesman.""We are investigating whether safety measures were appropriately observed,"" he added.The tank is one of thousands at the site used to store rain water that may have picked up radiation at the battered site.The worker is the second to die during efforts to stabilise the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant after reactors went into meltdown in the aftermath of a huge tsunami in March 2011.Last March, a worker died after being buried in earth and rubble while digging a hole.While the earthquake and tsunami it caused four years ago killed more than 18,000 people, no one is officially recorded as having died as a direct result of radiation released by Fukushima's broken reactors.In the unrelated incident at the Fukushima Daini plant, which was largely unscathed by the huge natural disaster, a worker died after suffering a severe head injury after being caught in equipment, a TEPCO spokesman said.

Canada is only involved in Iraq operations.Canada sent some 600 air crew and other military personnel -- as well as six fighter jets and other military aircraft -- to the region in November to participate in the air strikes against the Islamic State.The Canadian deployment is due to end in April, unless parliament votes to extend the mission.There are also 69 Canadian special forces training and advising Iraqi troops on the ground, but theoretically not in combat.Most of the instruction, a key plank of Western moves to defeat the emboldened IS group, takes place ""well behind front lines,"" Rouleau noted.The Islamic State group gained international notoriety last August when its fighters and those from other militant groups swept through the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, then overran swaths of territory north and west of Baghdad, threatening to overrun the capital.Western governments fear IS could eventually strike overseas, but their biggest immediate worry was its gains in Iraq and Syria, and the likely eventual return home of foreign fighters.US President Barack Obama has outlined plans for the broad international coalition to ""significantly degrade"" the group in Iraq and Syria.The coalition air strikes in Iraq and Syria have targeted IS fighting positions, heavy weapons and buildings used to store weapons.Lieutenant General Jonathan Vance said the Islamic State ""has been stopped (in Iraq) and they are unable to mount broad offensive operations that would somehow change the situation dramatically.""But, he added, using another acronym for IS, ""a large-scale reversal of ISIL's position in Iraq has yet to come.""Using aerial maps, he pointed out ""relatively modest areas where the tide has turned and Iraqi forces are in control of the area.""

The eldest daughter of the airline owner Cho Yang-ho was indicted on Jan. 7 for five charges including violence and obstructing the crew duty in the New York-Seoul flight, a month after the so-called “nut rage” row stirred public uproar.  Cho Hyun-ah (center) is escorted a holding facility on Dec. 30 after the courts approved her arrest. (Yonhap)The trial hearing mainly focused on whether Cho changed the flight plan upon her authority. According to the prosecution’s probe, Cho had ordered the cabin crew chief to deplane from the Dec. 5 flight when the plane had already been taxiing. This caused an 11-minute delay of the Seoul-bound plane, which was carrying more than 250 passengers.  Prosecutors have suspected that the former airline vice president had forced the cabin crew to return to the gate, even though she had known that the flight was underway. Citing flight safety regulations, they consider the flight starting from the moment the plane doors close. Cho’s attorneys, on the other hand, denied the charges, claiming that she had not known that the plane was moving. They also asserted that the charges were not applicable since the flight was still on the ground, not airborne.If convicted of changing the plane route, Cho could be sentenced to a jail term of one to 10 years. The 40-year-old was also accused of having interfered in the Transport Ministry’s inquiry by having Korean Air officials attempt to cover up the case and manipulate evidence. The ministry had investigated the “nut rage” incident for a week before the prosecution’s probe was launched. Along with Cho, a ministry’s official and former Korean Air employee attended the hearing for having supported the heiress’ alleged misconduct.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","seoul flight month after ,daughter of the airline ,trial korean air heiress ,on flight incident she ,korean air heiress denies","['korean Air', 'Cho Hyun - ah', 'Cho Yang - ho', 'New York - Seoul']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.79011416  0.4428148

488,488,Key North Korean defector 'misled' him on life story,"A prominent North Korean defector who fled a prison camp and became the face of international efforts to hold the country accountable for widespread human rights abuses has changed important parts of his life story. Author Blaine Harden says in a statement on his website that he has pressed Shin Dong-Hyuk to ""explain why he had misled me'' during interviews for Harden's book on Shin, ""Escape from Camp 14.'' North K...","A prominent North Korean defector who fled a prison camp and became the face of international efforts to hold the country accountable for widespread human rights abuses has changed important parts of his life story. Author Blaine Harden says in a statement on his website that he has pressed Shin Dong-Hyuk to ""explain why he had misled me'' during interviews for Harden's book on Shin, ""Escape from Camp 14.'' North Korea tried to discredit Shin late last year as it fought a U.N. General Assembly resolution that backed the findings of a groundbreaking U.N. commission of inquiry into Pyongyang's human rights abuses.  Human rights groups say the U.N. inquiry was based on interviews with scores of North Korean defectors. ""Its findings are still valid,'' said Brad Adams, Asia director for Human Rights Watch. The organization last year gave Shin an award for extraordinary activism and said he is ""regarded as the single strongest voice on atrocities taking place in North Korea.'' Shin was traveling and could not be reached for comment. He was expected to arrive in Seoul from the U.S. on Monday afternoon, said Greg Scarlatoiu, executive director of the Washington-based Committee for Human Rights in North Korea. ""Every one of us have stories, or things we'd like to hide,'' Shin said in an apology for the inaccuracies in recounting his past in his latest Facebook post, giving few details. He said he may or may not be able to continue his work of trying to eliminate North Korea's political prison camps but urged others to keep fighting. ""These will be my final words and this will likely be my final post.'' Shin's story originally drew widespread attention because he said he had lived in a high-security political prison camp in North Korea from his birth until his escape through an electrified fence. He describes himself on Facebook as ""the only known person born in a North Korean prison camp that escaped and survived to tell the tale.'' Harden has described Shin as a reluctant narrator, and a sometimes unreliable one. ""In writing this book, I have sometimes struggled to trust him,'' Harden wrote in the introduction to his book. ""He misled me in our first interview about his role in the death of his mother, and he continued to do so in more than a dozen interviews. When he changed his story, I became worried about what else he might have made up.'' Harden's statement says he passed along Shin's new information to The Washington Post, his former employer. Its report over the weekend said Shin now says he was transferred around the age of 6 to a lighter-security prison camp with his mother and brother. It was there, not the harsher camp, where he informed authorities about an escape attempt by his mother and brother. For that, they were executed. He now says he was later transferred back to the harsher camp. Shin didn't realize that changing dates and places of major events would be important, Harden's statement says. ""The fundamental building blocks of his story have remained the same, although I am fully aware of the differences between (the two camps),'' Scarlatoiu said Sunday. ""Still, born and raised in a camp, he was subjected to forced labor, induced malnutrition and torture. He informed on his mother and brother, who were executed. He escaped from the camp, and lived to tell his story. None of that has changed.'' Shin's earlier account helped drive the international effort to hold North Korea accountable. He and another defector met with then-U.N. human rights chief Navi Pillay just days before she called for the commission of inquiry in early 2013. ""Their personal stories were extremely harrowing,'' she said at the time. North Korea's government denies the existence of the harsh political prison camps, and human rights groups and others rely on both information from defectors and satellite images for information. The North Korean government did not allow the U.N. commission of inquiry to visit the country for its work. A spokesman for North Korea's mission to the United Nations had no immediate comment. The commission of inquiry's report, released early last year, detailed abuses including mass starvation and forced abortions, and it recommended that North Korea's human rights situation be referred to the International Criminal Court. The commission of inquiry also sent a letter to leader Kim Jong Un warning him that he could be held accountable. That alarmed North Korean authorities, and its diplomats circulated a DVD called ""Lie and Truth: Who is Shin Dong-Hyuk?'' in an attempt to discredit him by using footage of his own father speaking out against him and saying the family had never lived in a ""so-called political prisoner camp.'' But Shin said the DVD merely proved that his father was still alive.

The 18-year-old tourist, from Seoul, vanished on Jan. 10 after leaving a hotel in the border town of Kilis, the ministry said. He entered Turkey two days earlier for an eight-day trip with another man, who reported his disappearance to the Korean Embassy on Jan. 12. Turkish daily Milliyet reported that the missing man had been exchanging emails with IS members and might have entered Syria to join the group. “The embassy dispatched officials Tuesday and have since been tracking him down in cooperation with local police,” the ministry said in a statement. “We are not able to confirm that he crossed the Syrian border and are mobilizing all available channels to locate the missing teenager, keeping all possibilities in mind.”The hotel the missing Korean teenager stayed in Kilis, Turkey. (Yonhap)But the ministry denied reports that a man who was recently arrested in Kilis for illegal entry had claimed that he was a Korean national who had escaped from the IS. In Seoul, the missing teenager’s mother said he had a Turkish pen pal named Hassan and had last spoken with the family on the day he vanished. The National Intelligence Service has also secured his computer for analysis, an official at the Geumcheon district police office said. The ministry has issued a travel warning for southeastern Turkey, especially within 10 kilometers of the Syrian border. Some Koreans have previously visited the region for missionary or volunteer work at Syrian refugee camps. Seoul and Damascus have no official diplomatic relations. In September, a Saudi Arabian IS member said in an interview that the group consists of fighters of various nationalities including Korean. Seoul officials said the claim was unreliable. Some 3,000 people in Turkey are believed to be linked to the extremist group, a Turkish intelligence report said Saturday, calling for stepped-up surveillance in the wake of the deadly attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has also said that up to 700 Turkish nationals had joined the IS. Ankara has barred more than 7,200 people who were thought to be seeking IS membership from entering Turkey, while deporting nearly 1,200 would-be jihadists, he added.

The report claimed that the young man, identified as an 18-year-old surnamed Kim, had exchanged emails with IS before arriving in Turkey with another South Korean on Jan. 8.The South Korean Embassy said that the report contains some ""inaccurate"" information. But it did say that when Kim left his hotel in the town of Kilis, he took all of his belongings with him and left his traveling companion alone.The traveling mate, who shared the same room with Kim, reportedly told the Turkish police that he tried to find the missing teenager on his own for three days before contacting the authorities.In Seoul, the teenager's mother said Saturday her son had exchanged emails with his Turkish friend named Hassan, leading to speculation that the two might have set up a meeting in Kilis, which is situated near the border with Syria.Police in South Korea have said an analysis of the missing teenager's phone records showed no evidence that he has had any contact with IS. The mother said South Korea's intelligence officials studied the teenager's computer and found no connection with IS.The teenager's father, who had been in Turkey since Friday in search of his missing son, is scheduled to fly back to South Korea on Sunday. Speaking to Yonhap News Agency at Gaziantep Airport, the senior Kim repeatedly said, ""I have to find my son quickly.""Meanwhile, the top diplomats Turkey offered to fully support the search efforts for the teenager.The foreign ministry in Seoul said Yun Byung-se, the South Korean foreign minister, had a phone conversation with his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu, on Sunday. According to the ministry, Cavusoglu expressed concerns about the missing person case in his 10-minute talk with Yun. The Turkish minister also said the government, police and local authorities have been doing their best to locate the young South Korean and that they will continue to do so, according to the ministry.The ministry added that no particular progress has been made in the search for Kim and that the authorities in Turkey have left open all possibilities.

The measure is considered the most effective U.S. sanction yet on the North.""Frankly, I was in government when it happened. We were all surprised it worked so well,"" Hayden said. ""When you can turn the torque up on elites for luxury goods and the ability to exchange money you do have an effect on the North Korean regime. Those (latest) sanctions ... are not that.""The U.S. later lifted the BDA sanctions to get Pyongyang back to denuclearization talks.Former Congressman Mike Rogers also said the latest sanctions were ""light at best.""""There is no real financial grind that they are going to go into to impact the people who are living well in North Korea,"" said Rogers, who served as chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the primary House committee charged with the oversight of the U.S. intelligence community.""Most people don't even have electricity. One in 10 have access to electricity and that's not for 24 hours a day. So, if you are going to do this, you have to start impacting the people who are enjoying all of the niceties of life with no consequence,"" he said during the forum.Despite such doubts about the latest sanctions, U.S. administration officials have argued that the measures are an ""important new tool"" that gives a ""tremendous amount of flexibility"" against those who provide support for the blacklisted North Korean entities and officials.Meanwhile, John McAfee, founder of anti-virus firm McAfee, said he can say for sure that it is not North Korea that hacked Sony. He claims he has been in touch with the real perpetrators and said the FBI was wrong in blaming the North.""I can guarantee they are wrong. It has to do with a group of hackers -- I will not name them -- who are civil libertarians and who hate the confinement, the restrictions the music industry and the movie industry has placed on art and so they are behind it,"" McAfee said, according to IBTimes UK.Some private cyber-security experts have raised questions about the FBI's finding, claiming the skills employed in the attacks were too sophisticated for the North. They have raised the possibilities that laid-off Sony employees or others might have been behind the attacks.FBI Director James Comey said at a cyber-security conference last week that he is sure that the North was the perpetrator in the Sony hack. The hackers ""got sloppy"" several times and revealed IP addresses that were used exclusively by North Korea, he said.

Officials said the other shark, whose species was not reported, was about three metres.The sharks were seen to be feeding on dolphins.In southern Sydney, a surf carnival at Wanda Beach was cancelled Saturday after two sightings of a shark, Surf Life Saving New South Wales spokeswoman Donna Wishart told AFP.The beach was temporarily closed by lifeguards before being reopened when there was no further sign of the animal during an aerial search, Wishart added.Despite the closures and ""shark sighted: keep out"" signs, and as lifeguards patrolled the waters on jet skis, some swimmers and surfers continued to enter the water as the sunny summer weather drew residents to the beaches.""Surfing is pretty dangerous at the best of times, and I just look at it like I've been swimming with sharks all my life,"" surfer Shawn Ofriel told the Newcastle Herald.""You're always surfing with them because they are always around, but (getting attacked) is pretty rare.""Wishart said it was up to the surfers to decide if they wanted to risk an encounter with a shark.""When we say we close the beach, we can't prevent people from going into the water, and lots of surfers are ignoring our closures,"" she said.""Even if we close the beach, the lifesavers and the lifeguards will remain there and they will actively discourage people from going into the water.""You take a risk going out there and there's not much we can do about that.""A 17-year-old boy was bitten on his hand after he tried to film a shark while spearfishing off Mollymook about 230 kilometres south of Sydney on Friday.The last shark fatality in Australia was in late December when a 17-year-old boy was attacked while spearfishing in the country's southwest.It was the second fatal mauling that month after another teenager died in an attack while swimming off Port Douglas in the northeast.Experts say attacks by sharks are increasing as water sports become more popular.","saturday after two sharks ,beach closures after shark ,after shark sightings newcastle ,repeated shark sightings over ,after two sharks","['NEWCASTLE', 'AFP', 'Newcastle', 'Sydney']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.80326879  0.25700128

She was indicted for jeopardizing flight safety and the incident has tarnished the airline company's brand image significantly, with some customers boycotting its service.According to the data provided by Incheon International Airport Corp. and Korea Airports Corp., Korean Air transported a total of 482,000 passengers through its domestic lines last month, down 6.6 percent from a year earlier.The decline contrasted with a 13.2 percent hike for its smaller rival Asiana Airlines Inc., which flew 358,000 customers last month. The gap between the two largest airlines in terms of passengers narrowed from 158,000 to 76,000 over the past one year.This also comes despite an 11.5 percent on-year increase in the total number of passengers using domestic flights provided by seven carriers.Industry experts attribute the lackluster results of Korean Air to customers' avoidance of its service in the wake of the incident.""It seems that there are not a few passengers opting for other airline services following the incident, given that there are many options available when it comes to domestic flights,"" an industry expert said. Korean Air also underperformed next to other airliners on international lines.The company transported a total of 1.38 million passengers through its international flight services last month, up 2.5 percent from a year earlier. This is lower than the industry-wide 9.2 percent hike in the number of passengers traveling overseas, the data showed.In particular, Asiana Airlines seems to be basking in its rival's setback with the number of international passengers using its flights growing 9 percent. Low-cost carriers also saw their international passengers jump across the board.Korean Air said that there is no marked change in its booking ratio and that there is no relations between the number of passengers and the incident since most of tickets were booked months earlier. It expects that bookings for February and March are about 5 percent higher than last year.

A total of 106,000 people will be affected along with 31,000 facilities.Failure to follow the order could result in a maximum fine of 10 million won ($9,220) or a prison term of less than one year.The ministry said the order has been issued in consultation with poultry farmers and agricultural cooperatives and that the farmers were given time to stock up on feed.“Because poultry farmers actively asked for the measure, we expect they will adhere to it,” said Lee Chun-il, head of the ministry’s livestock policy division.During the 36-hour period, birds, farms and all vehicles that have been used will be decontaminated thoroughly, he said.“The central government urges local administrations to actively participate and enforce decontamination for maximum effect,” he said.The latest move marks the third large-scale effort to decontaminate poultry farms and related facilities since the first case of bird flu was reported late last year.Lee, however, noted that while sporadic outbreaks have occurred, it is too early to say whether bird flu is spreading throughout the country. He speculated that most of the cases are being caused by migratory birds that fly into South Korea during the winter months.The ministry said the movement of cars that move cloven-hoofed animals will be restricted over the weekend as well to help stem he spread of foot-and-mouth disease that has also broken out in the country.

The other two hostages were rescued unharmed. The authorities said the stepdaughter had been stabbed to death at around 9:36 a.m. when the police received a report from Kim’s wife. The unharmed stepdaughter also stated that the suspect killed her sister in the morning as the killer got enraged at his wife for having been out of touch with him, the police said. Kim demanded that his wife come and see him, they added. The police’s announcement came after criticism grew over the police’s rescue operation. Some claimed that the teenage victim could have been saved if the rescue mission had begun earlier. The stepdaughter victim was pronounced dead upon arrival at a hospital. The police said they started intervening in the case from 10:15 a.m. with the police commandos standing by on the roof. The police added the commandos did not storm the scene until 2:30 p.m. because the hostage-taker was highly agitated. Officers said they didn’t know until 12:45 p.m. that the hostages were harmed. Kim showed the body of the victim to her mother through video call at that time, they said. The police also revealed that the biological father was killed at around 9 p.m. the previous day when the killer entered the victim’s house. The 49-year-old victim was with his girlfriend at that time. Two daughters came home later after their birth father was killed in a fight with Kim, the investigators said. The former husband was found dead in a bathroom.The killer confessed to starting the hostage situation because he thought his estranged wife rekindled her relationship with her former husband, the police added.Kim and the 43-year-old married in 2007 but have been separated since August last year. The investigators said they would seek an arrest warrant for Kim on murder charges.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","tuesday after killing his ,after killing his wife ,hostage taker in monday ,nabbed tuesday after killing ,killing his wife ex","['Ansan', 'Seoul', 'Kim']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54426765  0.26021799

A third fire broke out at an apartment in Namyangju, Gyeonggi Province, with four people injured, earlier this week.The party and ministry officials in charge of public safety agreed in a meeting on Thursday that more apartment complexes should be obliged to provide evacuation facilities, which would help residents escape in the event of an emergency. Some presidential aides also participated in the discussions.The coming law revision will focus on wider distribution of hand-operated lifts, which are supported by ropes and carry evacuators. While these have been required for buildings up to 10 stories high, they will become applicable to apartments with 11 or more floors.In addition, the Land Ministry has decided to instruct builders to use high-quality materials for outer walls during construction of apartments. Investigators say that the fire in Uijeongbu caused more deaths and injuries due to the highly flammable outer walls, made of low-quality materials.Governing party Secretary-General Lee Koon-hyon said the revised motion would be proposed at the extraordinary session of the National Assembly, slated for February.He called on Saenuri lawmakers and ministry officials to bolster regulations on fire safety despite the overall policy aim of easing regulations on the business sector.Participants also vowed to come up with new safety regulations to prevent fires from spreading to adjacent buildings.The distance between the affected apartment buildings was only about 1 meter, allowing the fire to spread easily, authorities said. While regular apartment buildings must be over 6 meters apart, this rule has not been applied to buildings containing apartments under 85 square meters in size since 2009. This was part of the deregulation package of the former administration to boost apartment construction to resolve the housing crisis.The public safety officials, meanwhile, said they would soon draft a set of measures to support some 200 displaced residents who are staying at a temporary shelter.In Uijeongbu ― where the biggest of the three fires took place ― the blaze started on the first floor of an apartment building and quickly spread to two adjacent residential buildings, killing four and wounding 126 people.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","fire accidents at apartment ,week third fire broke ,after fire accidents at ,came after fire accidents ,after fire accidents","['Saenuri Party', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Namyangju', 'Gyeonggi Province']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68850851  0.05348404

It said further tests are needed to determine whether they died from the highly pathogenic H5N8 strain of the animal disease.The confirmation marks the first time that Busan has reported a bird flu case since 2008.Quarantine officials said 580 birds at the farm that raised geese, chickens and pigeons were all culled to prevent further spreading of the disease. It said four checkpoints have been set up around the poultry farm to disinfect cars and control the movement of people and animals.In addition to the Busan case, quarantine officials said tests showed birds at a duck farm in Anseong, near Seoul, have tested positive for the H5 strain. They said more detailed test results to determine whether the birds have been infected by the virulent H5N8 strain will come out over the weekend. Besides the latest AI case, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, which has been struggling to control the spread of foot-and-mouth disease in the country, warned that more outbreaks could occur in places such as Hongseong, Hwaseong, Gongju and Chungju, in the central part of the country.It said the assessment comes as pigs that had shown symptoms of the highly contagious animal disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals, were moved and may have contaminated slaughterhouses and vehicles that were used to carry other livestock. The ministry said the vehicles were used to ferry animals to and from the four areas cited.“It is unlikely that FMD will spread across the country as in 2010, but newer cases are still possible,” an official source said.He said that in order to counter such threats, the country plans to import enough vaccine for about 1.6 million animals this month.Besides such measures, the ministry said it will keep data on all farms reporting outbreaks and take action against those that have been affected by the animal disease time and again.It said quarantine inspections at airports and port terminals will be strengthened, and more will be done to develop FMD vaccines in the country.Since Dec. 3, 50 cases of FMD have been reported in 13 cities and counties across the country, resulting in the culling of 44,313 animals so far.

Eleven residents were seriously injured, officials said. While a probe is underway into the exact cause, investigative authorities are reportedly downplaying the possibility of an arson at the present stage. “The ministry will push to require all outer walls of buildings to be built with incombustible materials,” the Ministry of Public Safety and Security said. An investigator takes photos of a scorched apartment building in Uijeongbu, Gyeonggi Province, Monday, as part of efforts to determine the cause of the fire on Saturday that left four residents dead and 126 others wounded. (Yonhap)Currently, only skyscrapers, public-purpose buildings and factories are required to construct outer walls with incombustible materials.Critics suspected that the inflammable outer walls of the apartments caused the deadly fire to spread.Built by a method called Drivit the inner concrete walls of the Uijeongbu buildings were covered with expanded polystyrene. While this maximizes thermal insulation and reduces construction costs, it is inflammable and releases toxic gases when it catches fire, experts said.The ministry also vowed to come up with new safety regulations to prevent fires from spreading to adjacent buildings.The distance between the apartment buildings was only about 1 meter, allowing the fire to spread easily, authorities said.

Of the injured, 11 are in critical condition, officials said.The fire broke out from a motorcycle spark at a parking lot on the first floor of the apartment, the Uijeongbu Police said after analyzing the building’s surveillance cameras. Having started from the spark, the blaze soon spread through the apartment complex and to two other adjacent residential buildings, resulting in property losses of at least 9 billion won ($8.2 million), they added. A fire broke out at an apartment in Uijeongbu, Gyeonggi Province, early Saturday, leaving four people dead and over 100 residents injured. (Yonhap)The investigators conducted a first round of inquiry with the owner of the motorcycle to gather further details. The possibility of an arson attack is low, the police said.The police also said no measures were taken in the first 17 minutes, allowing the fire to further spread. Some victims claimed that the flame spread to other buildings due to the wind from firefighting helicopters. “The fire was almost put out in 30 minutes in the first apartment but the helicopter propellers led the flame to spread to other buildings,” a group of the concerned residents was quoted as saying by Yonhap. Two helicopters were at the scene to help evacuate a dozen residents waiting on the rooftop. Of these, only four were rescued by the helicopter while others escaped using emergency stairs. The fire was brought under control in about two hours.Fire officials, however, refuted such claim, saying that evacuating people with a helicopter at a fire scene is a basic rule. They also stressed that the blaze quickly spread because the apartment walls were made of highly combustible materials. Uijoengbu police authorities vowed to look into any illegalities concerning the affected buildings, including violation of construction law and fire safety law. Meanwhile, Uijoengbu city government said that it would seek for a “special disaster region” declaration as part of its efforts to better support the accident victims. More than 220 apartment residents have become refugees and are staying at a temporary shelter set up at a local elementary school. Once the city is declared a special disaster region by the government, the city is allowed to receive special assistances ranging from finance to medical treatments. The city also vowed to provide the refugees with an urgent subsidy of about 600,000 won per person. For the medical expenses, the municipality will pay the full cost first and seek reimbursement later from the building owners or insurance companies, it added.

The bodies were moved to a nearby morgue, but family members refused to take them, demanding apologies from the government and the operator of the ill-fated fishing boat as well as proper measures to search for those still missing.Late last month, six Filipino and Indonesian survivors of the boat tragedy arrived in Busan, along with the bodies of 21 foreign victims.South Korea, the United States and Russia had conducted the search for the missing crewmen, but no major progress was made due to inclement weather.The South Korean government officially terminated the search last week, sparking protests from the bereaved families, who demand that all missing South Koreans be retrieved before they can be reunited.

Its absence is one of the defining characteristics of barbarism,"" he said.

A fourth suspect – the common law wife of the market attacker – was still at large and believed to be armed.Medical teams evacuate a person on a stretcher as members of the BRI police elite unit launch an assault on the HyperCasher supermarket at Porte de Vincennes in Eastern Paris on Friday. YonhapAl-Qaida's branch in Yemen said it directed the attack against the publication Charlie Hebdo to avenge the honor of the Prophet Muhammad, a frequent target of the weekly's satire.The brothers were not unknown to authorities: One had a terrorism-related conviction for ties to a network sending fighters to battle American forces in Iraq, and both were on the U.S. no-fly list, according to a U.S. official.President Francois Hollande urged his nation to remain united and vigilant, and the city shut down a famed Jewish neighborhood amid fears of more violence.``The threats facing France are not finished,'' Hollande said. ``We are a free people who cave to no pressure.''The drama, which played out on live TV and social media, began with the brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi methodically massacring 12 people Wednesday at the Charlie Hebdo offices, stopping to shoot a wounded police officer in the head before escaping by car.On Thursday, a gunman police identified as Amedy Coulibaly shot a policewoman to death south of Paris, although authorities were not sure at first if it was related to the Charlie Hebdo shootings.It all ended at dusk Friday with near-simultaneous raids in two locations: a printing plant in the town of Dammartin-en-Goele, northeast of Paris, where the Kouachis were holed up, and the Paris supermarket where Coulibaly killed four hostages and threatened more violence unless the police let the Kouachis go.As scores of black-clad security forces surrounded both sites, booming explosions, heavy gunfire and dense smoke heralded the news that the twin sieges finally had ended.The three gunmen were dead – but the authorities also discovered four dead hostages at the market. Sixteen hostages were freed, one from the printing plant and 15 others from the store.The attackers had ties both to each other and to terrorist activities that reached back years and extended from Paris to al-Qaida in Yemen. They epitomized Western authorities' greatest fear: Islamic radicals who trained abroad and came home to stage attacks.After the killings at the Charlie Hebdo offices, Cherif Kouachi, 32, and his 34-year-old brother Said led police on a chase around northeastern France, robbing a gas station and stealing a car before ending up at the printing plant in Dammartin-en-Goele, near Charles de Gaulle airport. One of the brothers was wounded in the neck at one point during a shootout with police after he commandeered a car, Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said.Authorities said the brothers temporarily took a man hostage at the plant but let him go, and a second man was later discovered to have been hiding inside the building.A member of the al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula gave a statement in English to The Associated Press saying the group's leadership ``directed the operations and they have chosen their target carefully.''The attack was in line with warnings from the late al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden to the West about ``the consequences of the persistence in the blasphemy against Muslim sanctities,'' the member said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the group's regulations do not permit him to give his name.He said the group has delayed its declaration of responsibility for ``security reasons.''The brothers were cornered there for much of the day before the explosions and gunfire rang out in the twilight and a police SWAT team clambered onto the roof. ``They said they want to die as martyrs,'' Yves Albarello, a local lawmaker inside the command post, told French television station i-Tele. At the kosher grocery near the Porte de Vincennes neighborhood of the capital, the gunman burst in shooting just a few hours before the Jewish Sabbath began, declaring ``You know who I am,'' the official recounted. The attack came before sundown when the store would have been crowded with shoppers, and Hollande called it ``a terrifying anti-Semitic act.''Coulibaly killed the four people in the market shortly after entering, Molins said.Several people wounded in the grocery store were able to flee and get medical care, the official said. About 100 students were locked down in nearby schools and the highway ringing Paris was closed.The mayor's office also shut down all shops along Rosiers Street in the city's famed Marais neighborhood in the heart of the tourist district. Hours before the Jewish Sabbath, the street is usually crowded with shoppers. The street is also only a kilometer from Charlie Hebdo's offices.Charles de Gaulle airport, not far from the standoff in Dammartin-en-Goele,  briefly closed two runways to arrivals, and Hollande held a series of crisis meetings with his security team throughout the day.Police released a photo of Coulibaly and his wife, Hayat Boumeddiene, described as an accomplice.Authorities increasingly grew to see links between the attackers after they discovered that Boumeddiene and the companion of one of the Kouachi brothers had exchanged about 500 phone calls, Molins said.He added that several people have been given preliminary charges in the investigation. They include relatives of the three gunmen. Several people who were wounded when the gunman opened fire in the grocery store fled and got medical care, the official said. Minutes before police stormed both sites, Coulibaly had threatened more violence if authorities launched an assault on the two brothers, a police official said. A group of people holed up in the supermarket's freezer _ apparently unbeknownst to the gunman.BFM also said it spoke with Coulibaly, who said he and the Kouachis were coordinating their actions, and that he was with the militant Islamic State group. The organizations are normally rivals. The TV station said Coulibaly didn't hang up properly after the phone call and that this allowed police to hear him saying a final prayer before his death, perhaps suggesting that this prompted the police raid.In the final assault, phalanxes of security forces converged on the store entrance behind a flash from a stun grenade _ and fired inside. Frenzied civilians _ one of them carrying a toddler _ scurried out under escort by helmeted police in body armor. Police said Coulibaly had been a co-suspect with Cherif Kouachi in a court case involving terrorism that never made it to trial.Cherif Kouachi was convicted of terrorism charges in 2008 for ties to a network sending jihadis to fight U.S. forces in Iraq. According to a Yemeni security official, Said Kouachi is suspected of having fought for al-Qaida in Yemen. Another senior security official added that Said was in Yemen until 2012. Both officials spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because of an ongoing investigation into Kouachi's stay in Yemen. Both brothers were also on the U.S. no-fly list, a senior U.S. counterterrorism official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss foreign intelligence publicly.The attacks in France as well as a hostage siege last month in Sydney and the October killing of a solder near Canada's parliament prompted the U.S. State Department to issue a global travel warning for Americans. It also cites an increased risk of reprisals against U.S. and Western targets for the U.S.-led intervention against Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq.Authorities around Europe have warned of the threat posed by the return of Western jihadis trained in warfare. France counts at least 1,200 citizens in the war zone in Syria _ headed there, returned or dead. Both the Islamic State group and al-Qaida have threatened France, home to Western Europe's largest Muslim population.The publication Charlie Hebdo had long drawn threats for its depictions of Islam, although it also lampooned other religions and political figures. It had caricatured the Prophet Muhammad, and a sketch of Islamic State's leader was the last tweet sent by the irreverent newspaper minutes before the attack.Eight journalists, two police officers, a maintenance worker and a visitor were killed in the newspaper attack, including the paper's editor. Charlie Hebdo plans a special edition next week, produced in the offices of another paper.

""They should make clear on their stand on the problems.""  The leaflet campaign, often led by North Koreans who fled their home country to settle in the South, has long been a major source of tension between the two Koreas, as it aims to stir up dissent against the regime. Seoul has dismissed Pyongyang's demands to ban the campaign, citing freedom of speech. The North Korean spokesman also raised suspicions over Seoul's intentions to seek peace, denouncing the South Korean military for its pledge to ""continue nuclear war exercise against North Korea.""South Korea and the U.S. have conducted joint military drills which are ""defensive in nature"" on a regular basis, while Pyongyang calls it a rehearsal for the invasion of the communist country.""The DPRK will watch the future movement of the South Korean authorities with vigilance,"" the statement said. The DPRK stands for the North's official name of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.In response, South Korea issued a brief statement calling on the North to stop ""making claims not conducive to inter-Korean dialogue and to come forward for talks to practically improve theinter-Korean ties.""  Stressing its repeated proposal to have inter-Korean talks, the South Korean government once again expressed its willingness ""to improve the bilateral relations and to usher in the new era of national reunification.""Seoul's defense ministry said it will continue to carry out joint drills with the U.S.""As long as the current Seoul-Washington alliance structure exists, the joint drills should go on,"" ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok told a regular briefing. ""North Korea's claims do not make sense, as all drills our military conducts are aimed at defending national security.""Meanwhile, government sources here said North Korea filed a complaint with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) against South Korea's leaflet launches in November last year, claiming they pose a threat to aviation safety.Despite its long-held stance of prioritizing freedom of speech, the Seoul government hinted that it would take action to foil a local civic group's alleged plan to send DVDs of the U.S. movie ""The Interview"" over the border in balloons, which depicts a plot to assassinate the North Korean leader.""The government needs to act to guarantee public safety as such a move would lead North Korea to make good on its threats that would hurt our people,"" said a unification ministry official, requesting anonymity.""In response to expected threats from North Korea, we will take necessary measures firstly for the safety of the civic group members, and that could eventually prevent them from launching the campaign,"" he added.Pyongyang has expressed fury at Sony Pictures over its comedy film and is suspected of hacking the company's servers.

He supposedly received the information from a South Korean defense broker surnamed Kim, and forwarded it to other officials at his company’s headquarters in France. The leaked documents were grade-three secrets that were presented at the Joint Chiefs of Staff Council meeting, including data related to military satellites, long-distance surface-to-air missiles and an antijamming system, which blocks signaldisrupting offensives. Prosecutors also indicted a high-ranking official of a Europe-based defense firm for illegally securing classified military information from Kim, including information on the military’s harbor underwater surveillance system and submarine program. Investigators said Kim handed over the secrets to the Europe-based companies while he was working as a consultant for them.Kim was arrested in July on the charge of violating the military secret protection law. Kim is purported to have bought a total of 31 grade-two and grade-three military secrets from officers, including an Air Force lieutenant colonel and an Army major who were indicted on the charge of leaking the secrets.He is also believed to have been linked to a similar case in November, when a local defense contractor was indicted on the charge of illegally collecting military secrets about a military project to improve the Navy’s submarines and leaking them to a German firm. The leak of classified documents was the latest in a series of recent military-related corruption scandals that have sent shockwaves across the country. Last month, two officials of the state-run Defense Acquisition Program Administration were arrested on charges of taking bribes from a local company in exchange for granting rights to exclusively provide parts to a Navy rescue and salvage ship.An annual integrity scale by the Anti-Corruption & Civil Rights Commission showed that DAPA was one of the most corrupt government bodies in Korea.By Yoon Min-sik and news reports(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","frenchman indicted for smuggling ,illegally acquired military secrets ,indicted for smuggling defense ,indicted for smuggling ,for smuggling defense secrets","['korean', 'France', 'korean', 'the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ’ Office']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59087116 -0.26323897

""The relations between China and North Korea should be exercised with common sense in state-to-state relations,"" the newspaper said.

The man, identified by his surname Kim, was convicted of smuggling 5 kilograms of methamphetamine into China in April 2012, a senior ministry official told reporters on customary condition of anonymity. A higher court upheld the ruling six months later. He was arrested in May 2010. Under Chinese law, producing, carrying or selling 50 grams or more of heroin or methamphetamine is punishable by death. Kim was also believed to have previously been found guilty for smuggling narcotics three times and carrying them one time. The execution took place on Dec. 30 in Beijing. Seoul lodged a protest for the six-day delay in delivering the information. “The government regrets that the execution was carried out despite our repeated requests not to do so from the humanitarian and reciprocal points of view,” the ministry said in a statement, referring to growing international calls against capital punishment and a virtual moratorium on executions at home. “We will continue to strengthen cooperation not only between related authorities here but also with relevant countries to prevent our citizens from being implicated in drug crimes.” Kim is the fourth South Korean drug smuggler to be executed since August and the fifth since 2001. Some 20 South Korean citizens are currently on death row in China, mainly convicted of drug trafficking or murder. Many of them have been granted a reprieve, officials said.China has executed several other foreigners over drug-related crimes in recent years.

""The Chinese side expressed gratitude for the decision.""   In March last year, the South Korean government returned the bodies of 437 Chinese soldiers killed on Korean soil during the war on humanitarian grounds, after President Park Geun-hye made such an offer during a 2013 summit with her Chinese counterpart.    During the Korean War, China fought alongside North Korea against the U.S.-backed Allied forces. Historical records show that more than 1 million Chinese soldiers were killed in the three-year conflict.

""We plan to beef up cooperation with related countries to prevent Korean nationals from being involved in drug-related crime.""   Separately, the Korean government said it has protested to China over its delayed notification of the execution to Seoul.   Kim is the fourth South Korean that China has executed for drug offenses since last year. In early August, three South Korean nationals were executed in China for smuggling and trading drugs.   In 2001, China executed a South Korean drug dealer, identified only by his surname Shin.   Smuggling, producing or trafficking more than one kilogram of opium or 50 grams of heroin or methamphetamine is subject to capital punishment in China.   A foreign ministry official said the Chinese government on Dec. 16 notified South Korea of its decision to execute Kim.   Seoul had repeatedly asked for a stay of execution on humanitarian grounds, but Beijing rejected the plea, the official said.   He said the government will come up with measures to prevent South Koreans from committing drug offenses in China, which are mainly committed in the country's three northeastern provinces, including limits on drug offenders' overseas travel.

Experts believe the Ebola virus can stay dormant in the human body for up to 21 days. The South Korean has not yet shown symptoms of infection.The health worker had been dispatched by South Korea to Sierra Leone, to join a British team treating local patients there. The South Korean may have contracted the virus last Monday while treating a patient.Berlin city officials and doctors announce Saturday at the city’s Charite hospital that a South Korean health worker who was taken to Germany with a suspected Ebola infection after volunteering in the Republic of Sierra Leone has tested negative for the virus. (Yonhap)The health worker was flown to Berlin, Germany on Saturday for possible treatment and monitoring and not to Seoul, in order to protect the patient’s anonymity. Officials have not disclosed the medic’s gender, age or profession.“First of all it’s good from a transportation point of view to come here and secondly it’s better for the person’s anonymity to be treated here in Europe,” Dr. Frank Bergmann, the official overseeing infectious patients said at the Charite hospital in Berlin on Saturday.The South Korean health worker was using a hypodermic needle to draw blood from a patient when the patient reportedly jolted, causing the needle to penetrate the South Korean medic’s protective gloves. The syringe apparently contained the local patient’s blood.“The patient had a very high viral load and died the next day, which means that there was a very high risk of infection,” Bergmann said.The South Korean is under quarantine at the Berlin hospital.Medical officials appear optimistic though. The South Korean is taking the situation well in a professional way, Bergmann said. The doctor added that there have been multiple cases of high-risk exposure health workers turning out not to have been infected.A U.S. doctor exposed to Ebola through a needlestick injury was released in October last year after a medical team at the U.S.-based National Institutes of Health monitored him for a few weeks.Close to 8,000 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of death due to the latest Ebola virus outbreak have been reported, according to the World Health Organization. The disease can be transferred through contact with the blood, sweat, saliva, or other bodily fluids of an infected patient.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","ebola south korean medic ,ebola virus while treating ,tests negative for ebola ,korean medic tests negative ,for ebola south korean","['south korean', 'West Africa', 'Berlin', 'Germany', 'south korean']",10,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.23835339  0.59904766
