Enraged by what they called political collusion between the two countries, nearly 1,000 people jammed into a narrow downtown street to participate in the 1,211st weekly rally held by the former sex slaves and their supporters.  (Yonhap)The Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan has staged the rally for nearly 24 years to demand Japan’s acknowledgement of its responsibility for forcing up to 200,000 young Korean women into sex slavery and legal compensation. But Monday’s much-hailed settlement was far from what the victims and their rights groups have cried out for, they say. “What sins did we commit? Our only sin was that we were brought up as a daughter of this country. Why did I have to serve as a sex slave?” 88-year-old victim Lee Yong-soo shouted at the rally, shedding tears. “We have cried out for an official apology and legal compensation from Japan for all these years, but Japan still denies its wrongdoing,” Lee said, calling herself “living proof” of Japan’s atrocities. Lee also lashed out at her own government, saying she cannot trust Korean authorities. “This country killed us one more time. We were not informed at all about the deal. However old and powerless we are, we cannot just die like this,” she said. “As long as you are here to support us, our fight will begin again here.” The Wednesday rally began at around noon with a silent tribute to nine of the euphemistically called “comfort women” who died this year. Out of 238 Korean victims who came forward, only 46 are still alive, with their average age at 89.The participants in unison pledged not to forget about the pains the victims had to endure for more than two decades, with many of them holding photos of former comfort women and placards reading “Protect girls” and “Opposition to the relocation of the comfort women statue.”“I couldn’t stop crying after hearing about the ridiculous deal. I don’t know who the foreign ministry is working for,” said 41-year-old activist Park Hee-jin, who has attended the rally more than 10 times. “If the government fails to protect us, then we should protect each other.” The demonstration, swelling with more people than usual following Monday’s diplomatic settlement, came amid growing criticism that the Korean government failed to represent the interests of the victims. The surprise deal, which both countries called “final and irreversible,” includes Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s apology and 1 billion yen ($8.3 million) in payment to help support the 46 surviving victims. But the victims and civic groups lamented that the Korean government did not consult with them in advance and that Japan had refused to recognize the deal as legal compensation for past atrocities. Despite the international community hailing the settlement, Cornelia Schmidt was not convinced as to whether the victims’ grievances were really healed through the deal. “The deal Korean government made with Japan doesn’t seem to solve the issue,” the 23-year-old German student said. “I cannot blame Japanese people, but I think their government should make more efforts to make up for what they did in the past.”  Many of the crowd were seen paying a tribute to the life-size bronze statue of a young girl representing a comfort women sitting in front of the Japanese Embassy. They put gloves, scarves and blankets next to the statue in a gesture to make it feel warm and less lonely.The bronze statue, built in 2011 by victims and their supporters in front of the Japanese Embassy, has sparked fury from Tokyo, leading it to pressure Seoul to remove the statue. South Korea has indicated it would try to relocate it through consultations with relevant civic groups as part of the deal, adding fuel to the public backlash.In a survey conducted by pollster Realmeter, 66 percent of South Koreans opposed the relocation of the statute, while 19 percent favored it. Cho Hye-won, 45, led her child to cuddle the statue ahead of the rally. “I brought my child because he needs to learn that this is history we should never forget nor repeat,” she said. “For that purpose, the statue should stay here.”Earlier in the day, a union of civic organizations and students groups held press conferences to voice their objection to the settlement, denouncing it as indulging Japan.  Some of the opposition lawmakers from the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea also joined the rally, paying their respects to the victims and raising their voices against the settlement.The council for the victims said it plans to launch a global campaign to bring justice for the human rights abuses by Japan by continuing to hold the rally every Wednesday in front of comfort women statues across the nation. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","victims protest sex slavery ,wednesday to condemn seoul ,enslavement of korean women ,the 211st weekly rally ,protest sex slavery deal","['South Koreans', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'korean']",14,"[ 1.          2.          1.         ... -0.068631    0.26099911

Han, chief of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, was taken to Namdaemun Police Station for questioning Thursday as he voluntarily walked out of Jogyesa Temple in central Seoul, where he had been taking sanctuary to avoid arrest for 24 days. (Yonhap)Police questioned Han overnight for a total of eight charges, four of them related to the Nov. 14 rally in central Seoul that saw clashes between the police and protestors. In South Korea, an arrest warrant can detain a suspect for up to 48 hours for questioning, then police need a formal detention warrant issued by the court to further take the suspect into custody.The police accuse Han of holding a banned rally, staging a demonstration in an unpermitted place, disrupting traffic, disobeying the police order to disperse, damaging public property and obstructing the execution of police duties in nine protests held this year.  Police are considering additionally charging Han with allegedly inciting violence during the Nov. 14 rally and plotting to pose a threat to public security, which carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison and a financial penalty of up to 15 million won ($12,700).The decision is set to be made after a detention warrant is issued for Han, police officials said. “There are already too many things to investigate to apply for a detention warrant, so it is not realistic to consider adding the sedition charge right now,” a police official said prior to seeking the detention warrant. It has been rare for prosecutors to file sedition charges against protestors. The last time prosecutors applied the charge was in 1986 during the authoritarian Chun Doo-hwan administration when pro-democracy activists threw rocks and firebombs at riot police. Han has remained silent during the probe, the KCTU said in a statement, in the face of what it called a malicious investigation. It said that the police tried to steer the probe in an unfair direction for its leader by accusing him of mobilizing labor union members capable of organizing violent demonstrations. Han has been staging a hunger strike for 12 days.Following the chief’s arrest, the KCTU renewed its pledge to stage an all-out strike on Dec. 16 to oppose the government’s push for labor market reform bills. Another antigovernment street rally is scheduled in central Seoul for Dec. 19. The probe into protestors suspected of committing violence during the Nov. 14 rally has picked up pace, with police having raided the KCTU local branches to collect evidence. So far, police have investigated 731 people related to the Nov. 14 rally, detained 10 and booked 204 without detention.One of the detained is the head of the nation‘s democratic taxi labor union, identified only by his surname Koh, who allegedly smashed windows of police buses and attempted to set fire to the buses. With its chief being detained for police investigation, Choi Jong-jin, a deputy chief of the labor union, will serve as the acting leader, the KCTU said. The nation’s two umbrella labor unions -- KCTU and the Federation of Korean Trade Unions -- have fiercely opposed the government’s labor market reform bills, viewing them as expanding temporary jobs, giving businesses more leeway to dismiss workers.  The government has claimed, on the other hand, the measures are necessary to ease labor regulations, boost the economy and create jobs for the young.At the National Assembly, the rival parties continued to lock horns over the five labor market bills.The ruling Saenuri Party has presented the bills related to labor conditions, insurance for employment and industrial accidents, and temporary workers.The bills stipulate a reduction in working hours, improvement in benefits for the unemployed, extension of hiring of irregular workers, expansion of sectors that can employ temporary workers and adoption of the peak wage system.

This is part of the city’s five-year measures for supporting the employment of young people.  Seoul City Mayor Park Won-soon (second from right) eats sandwiches with NPAD chairman Moon Jae-in and other participants representing the youth at a forum on youth policies on Nov. 19. (Yonhap)About 3,000 of those aged between 19 and 29 in the low-income bracket will benefit from the scheme starting from next year on a trial basis. They will be selected upon review of their applications, officials said. Seoul City said it would inject about 9 billion won into the program in the first year. The city emphasized that the new scheme will work as a social safety net and pave a firm path for self-support for job seekers. According to the city, about 35 percent of Seoulites in their 20s, or 502,000, are either part-time employees or unemployed.Scheme sparks political debateSeoul City’s announcement, however, immediately sparked debate in the political arena, with the ruling party arguing that the new measure is a “populist” measure with political motives ahead of the general elections slated for next year. Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon is a member of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy. While Park will serve as mayor until 2017, he holds heavy sway among liberal voters. The NPAD considers cooperation with Park a key strategy to woo voters.“Although I agree that youth unemployment is a solution-needed issue, ‘purchasing’ the youth’s minds with an allowance is typical populism that is seriously improper,” Saenuri Party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung said. “I warn that the act of buying voters with taxpayers’ money will ultimately return like a boomerang and be judged by residents,” he added. Kim also blasted a similar project pushed by Seongnam City in Gyeonggi Province led by progressive mayor Lee Jae-myung.Earlier this year, Seongnam City vowed to offer 1 million won throughout one year for all youth aged between 19 and 24 who have lived in the city over three years in an aim to support the job-hunting process.Many raised speculations that the ruling party is intentionally criticizing the two city representatives to contain their influence in upcoming elections. Park has competed for the top ranking with Kim in public opinion polls on potential presidential candidates. Seongnam’s Lee has also recently been added to the list of potential candidates after he drew public attention with a series of welfare project proposals, such as free school uniforms for students and free postpartum care centers for mothers. Seoul City, however, refuted the “populist” claim. It argues that, for one, the new project is different from Seongnam’s, as the capital would selectively implement the program based on need, while Seongnam will universally support all young job seekers. Some supporters of the allowance program also assert that a similar welfare benefit scheme was considered by President Park Geun-hye when she led the Grand National Party in 2011. The then-ruling party had contemplated providing 300,000 won subsidies to young job seekers for up to four months.The central government, however, has warned the capital city that such welfare measures should not be unilaterally pursued by the city and must be discussed with the Welfare Ministry. Under social security regulations, municipal heads are mandated to consult with the central government over introducing or changing welfare schemes. Seoul City rebukes the notion.Political tensions escalated last week after the central government revised an ordinance that would pose hurdles to Seoul City’s allowance plan. Under the new rule, the state would be allowed to cut local subsidies if municipalities unilaterally introduced or changed social security schemes without negotiating with the central government first, the Interior Ministry said. “While negotiating welfare measures with the central government is mandatory under the ordinance, there was no penalty for not following the rule. To ensure the effectiveness of the social security regulations, (the government) decided to revise the ordinance,” said Interior Minister Chong Jong-sup. All municipalities receive various subsidies from the state ranging from general and special budgets to real estate subsidies.This year, about 32 trillion won in subsidies have been distributed to cities nationwide, with the majority in general subsidies. This indicates the cities’ heavy reliance on the state’s financial support. Seoul City, however, does not receive general subsidies due to its financial independence. The Seoul Metropolitan Government has expressed “deep regrets” over the government’s move, claiming that such a new rule may breach the local subsidy law. “This is an act that cuts the ‘sprouting’ of grassroots democracy. Local welfare is needed in places the central government is unable to reach,” said Seoul City spokesperson Kim In-cheol. The city claimed that controlling local welfare measures by linking them to local subsidies breaches the core of the local autonomous government system. Under the local subsidy law, cities should return the state’s financial subsidies only if they excessively spend them by violating regulations. The NPAD also expressed concerns.“The ordinance that threatens municipalities with subsidies is apparently unconstitutional and sets back the welfare system,” said NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in on Dec. 2. One day later, however, the Ministry of Government Legislation rebutted Moon by analyzing the legality of the controversial subsidy plan. It concluded that the allowance measure should be discussed with the Welfare Ministry as the idea of the plan is part of the social security concept that universally defines the constitutional ideas of a modern social welfare country. “As the purpose of the youth allowance scheme is to support the youth’s capacity and social participation, it must be considered as part of social services under the social security basic law. While the ministry’s interpretation is not law-binding, it can pose a burden to Seoul City, critics said.Since the interpretation, Seoul City has remained cautious, saying last week that it would independently review the legality of the controversial scheme and that it would take proper steps afterwards. Public divided over allowance plan As the political dispute continues over the city’s youth allowance plan, the public has also been split over the measure’s efficacy. The business sector insists that providing 500,000 won will only waste the people’s money with little positive impact.“Although some claim that (the authorities) should promote youth employment through the allowance, it is difficult to alleviate the youth unemployment rate by sharing money. Youth unemployment originates from the unfair system and practice of the labor market rather than the youth’s financial hardships,” said Ryu Ki-jung, director of the Korea Employers Federation. Even if the new scheme encourages young people to proactively look for jobs, it will likely be difficult to properly monitor the overall process, from selection to proceedings, he added.Youth organizations, on the other hand, sided with the city government’s plan, arguing that it would help those about to give up job-hunting amid the unemployment crisis. Civic group Youth Community Union stressed that the policy support and social safety net are currently severely insufficient in Korea, leaving youth in a dilemma between staying out of work and choosing unwanted jobs.“The most wanted social safety net that the youth seeks is that of recruitment. The government should help the youth whose social connection is weakening over job-hunting challenges,” said policy chief Chung Jun-young at YCU. Some European countries have already run similar programs, he said. In France, for example, the government introduced an allowance scheme in 2012 for young job seekers aged 18 to 26 upon their participation in job training programs. About 50,000 young people in France are expected to have benefitted from the program by the end of this year. In order to ensure the efficacy of the welfare measure, however, sufficient step-by-step employment services must be provided, ranging from counseling to job training, Chung added.

The Seoul Metropolitan Government said it verified circumstantial evidence that the Gangnam district government had systematically posted slandering online comments against the city government while advocating Gangnam district Mayor Shin Yeon-hee from October to November. A total of 11 district officials posted slandering comments on portal website Naver, with six of them each posting over 70 malicious comments, the city claimed. The city said it would conduct another round of probes and consider taking legal measures against the district depending on the results.The city’s move came after a local news outlet reported Tuesday that the Gangnam district office had attempted to sway public opinion online over controversial city projects that have clashed with each other. The district office, however, denied the allegations, claiming the officials merely posted their personal opinions. Since 2012, the city and the district have been at odds over how to develop the slum village Guryong, which is located within Gangnam. The confrontation escalated last year over another project, when the city said it would share the public fund to a neighboring region that the city received from Hyundai Motors after the carmaker purchased the land in Gangnam. The company had offered to pay 1.7 trillion won ($1.44 billion) in public contribution fees in return for changing the legal use of the site. While the city insisted that the majority of the fund would be used on Hyundai Motors’ land as part of its plan to transform the district into a hub for the meetings, incentive tours, conventions and exhibitions industry, Gangnam has argued that the fund should only be used on its region, as it originated from its land. They are also currently clashing over building a second municipal community center in an exhibition center in the district.

He attended a massive anti-government protest that led to a clash with police on Nov. 14 and took refuge in Jogye Temple in downtown Seoul as police began to tighten their siege. ""There is a number of ways, such as officially requesting to Jogye Temple that we be able to execute the warrant or mediate behind the scenes,"" National Police Agency Commissioner Kang Sin-myeong told reporters.The remarks came hours after Han announced that he would stay there longer until the situation gets better.""I cannot abandon the 20 million laborers' wish to stop the labor reform,"" Han said in a statement released Monday, seeking understanding on his position. Currently police are surrounding the temple to prevent Han from fleeing. In the worst scenario, the police could force their way into the temple, the chief said.The police, meanwhile, said they have arrested another KCTU member on suspicion of aiding Han's escape on Nov. 14.The suspect, identified only by his surname Lee, is suspected of acting as a personal bodyguard of Han, along with at least eight others who have been placed in police custody for physically blocking police forces out from the Seoul Press Center where the labor leader held a press conference.Along with the nine people already in police custody, 126 others have been booked on charges of aiding Han's escape or staging violent protests while an additional 454 have also been asked to face interrogation over similar charges.","organizing illegal rallies he ,massive anti government protest ,for organizing illegal rallies ,organizing illegal rallies ,illegal rallies he attended","['Han Sang - gyun', 'the korean Confederation of Trade Unions']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.18105394  0.04981588

The rally turned violent as some protesters brandished metal pipes and police fired water cannons.A 69-year-old farmer suffered a brain hemorrhage after being knocked down by a police water cannon and still is in a critical condition. The Saturday rally to criticize police and support the farmer was originally banned by the police, but a local court on Thursday ruled that the ban was ""unjust,"" giving the event the greenlight.A farmers' association will also hold a cultural event at Gwanghwamun Plaza, hoping for the 69-year-old's recovery.Civic groups have vowed multiple times to hold a peaceful rally.Police said they would not have water cannons or barricades at the rally, but may utilize them if it turns violent, for instance, if demonstrators attempt to march toward Cheong Wa Dae, the presidential office.""(We) must root out illegal, violent protests by certain people, which many citizens are concerned about recently, in order to establish rule of law,"" Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn said Friday at a commencement ceremony at the Korea National Defense University.A survey by Gallup Korea showed that 60 percent of respondents approved an amendment banning the use of masks during rallies or protests, about double those who opposed the bill, which remained at 32 percent. The poll also showed that 48 percent were opposed to the use of police vehicles to create barricades during street rallies, slightly above those who support the use, which was 42 percent.A rough majority of people who voted positively to the mask bill also supported prohibiting the use of police buses during protests.""Apart from ideology, (it seems like people) are supportive of non-violent protests in terms of demonstrators and a police reaction (that does not ignite) controversy over excessive use of force,"" an official from Gallup said. The survey was conducted on 1,005 adults between Tuesday and Thursday, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.Last month, some 30 ruling Saenuri Party lawmakers, led by National Assembly Vice Speaker Jeong Kab-yoon, proposed an amendment to the law on assembly and demonstration, banning participants in violent rallies or protests from wearing masks or other apparel that hides their identity.(Yonhap)","downtown seoul to protest ,seoul this weekend police ,massive anti gov rally ,seoul to protest ,friday following court ruling","['Seoul', 'Seoul']",14,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.35481226  0.2514126

The rally turned violent as some protesters brandished metal pipes and police fired water cannons at them. A farmer was in a critical condition after being knocked down by a water cannon.On Sunday, a task force composed of civic groups against the ""state violence"" during the previous rally reported its plan to have some 7,000 protesters march through the heart of Seoul on Dec. 5 in protest of the farmer's injury.After police banned the protest citing fears that it may hurt public safety, they filed the lawsuit asking the court to suspend the effectuation of the ban.""The organizers have repeatedly promised to make it a peaceful rally, and the Nov. 28 rally they had following the first massive rally proceeded peacefully although it had the same purpose with the recently proposed one,"" Judge Kim Jeong-sook of the court said in a verdict.One cannot say the organizers of the two rallies are the same simply because some of the participating groups are the same, it added.After the court ruling, police said that it has no plans to intervene in the upcoming rally unless the organizers breach the laws.""But if they occupy roads or march toward Cheong Wa Dae under the excuse of holding 'a peaceful rally,' we'll take measures to recover order on the scene,"" a police official said, requesting not to be named.The ruling came hours after the police disallowed a separate rally planned by the Civil Society Organizations Network in Korea, an association of 490 liberal civic groups across the country, on the same day in downtown Seoul.Police said it appears to be the same one planned by the main organizers of the Nov. 14 rally. The association said they will file a similar lawsuit to hold the rally as planned.

It said it would spray paint into the crowd at the upcoming rallies to better distinguish protestors committing violence and arrest them on the spot while setting up roadblocks with police buses. The move came two days after the police banned the forthcoming antigovernment demonstration planned in Seoul this weekend and a day after the rally organizers ― Korean Confederation of Trade Unions and Korean Peasants League ― pledged to go ahead with the protest despite the ban. The police did not allow the organizers to hold the protest near City Hall, citing violence that could possibly break out during the event. But the nation’s second-largest umbrella labor union and farmers’ group lashed out at the decision, accusing the government of denying constitutional rights and slipping back into past authoritarian rule. Under the Constitution, the freedom of expression and rights to hold assemblies are stipulated as basic rights for citizens, with authorities required to grant the permit for a “lawful” protest upon declaration. But a lower law stipulates that the police can ban any rally that could “clearly disrupt public order and inflict damage upon the people via violence, threat and arson.” But the police’s heavy-handed measures, coupled with President Park Geun-hye’s pointed remark against masked protesters last week, appeared to be backfiring, with netizens taking to social media to lampoon her remarks and graffiti satirizing the president ― a daughter of former dictator Park Chung-hee ― popping up across the nation. Shortly after her calls for a ban on mask-wearing protestors, netizens posted comments like “Let’s hold a dance party wearing masks in the upcoming rally. It only costs 8,400 won per mask!”President Park Geun-hye led the campaign against what she denounced as illegal, violent rallies by calling for a ban on masked protests and likening the masked participants to Islamic State group terrorists. A well-known novelist Lee We-soo said in his tweet, “If the bill barring protestors from wearing masks passes, will the Mask King also be abolished?” he said, referring to the popular TV singing competition in which professional singers stage a performance while wearing masks to hide their identity. On Monday, graffiti of a masked person appeared on the walls in various locations in western Seoul near Hongik University and Sinchon Station. In the painting, the woman covers her whole face with a mask, with the number 51.6 percent underneath her. The graffiti appears to depict President Park as she earned 51.6 percent of the votes in the 2012 presidential election. Progressive Seoul City Mayor Park Won-soon also joined the fray, saying the government blocking rallies by police vehicles or banning use of masks posed questions over the country’s democracy level.“The most basic part of democracy is the freedom to express and think. And only through that can an individual’s creativity shine,” Park said in a speech at Seoul National University. “It is only right that the central government take on a more open approach, and rather than banning them through oppression, seek the reason and fix the cause of why these people are rallying and protesting.”In a survey conducted by pollster Realmeter, 54.6 percent of the respondents were against the bill barring protestors from covering their faces with masks, with 40.8 percent supporting such a policy. About 5 percent of them did not have clear opinions. The Dec. 5 rally followed a mass protest held on Nov. 14, the largest in more than seven years, by labor, civic and farmers’ groups. Some 70,000 people took to the street to oppose the government’s push to reintroduce state-issued textbooks, open agricultural markets and reform the labor sector. The demonstration spiraled into violence, with police firing tear gas and water cannons to stop protestors from marching toward the presidential office, which divided the nation over who was to blame for the violent protests. The police directly aiming a water cannon at a protestor trying to pull down police bus barricades left Baek Nam-gi, a 69-year-old farmer, to remain unconscious as of Monday. On the other hand, the police claimed that the violence during the rally incurred 389 million won ($340,320) worth of damage to police equipment and injured 113 officers. Since the protest, the police vowed zero tolerance for any violence committed during rallies, raiding the Nov. 14 protest organizers’ offices and bringing in 401 people for questioning on charges of leading what it called illegal rallies. Following the president’s criticisms against masked protesters, Rep. Jung Gap-yoon of the ruling Saenuri Party scrambled to table a bill to legalize the ban on protestors wearing masks during demonstrations. The bill was presented as protestors wearing masks make it difficult for the police to check their identities and collect evidence to arrest them, the lawmaker said. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","violent protestors amid mounting ,upcoming dec antigovernment rally ,to nab violent protestors ,public backlash the police ,rally the police renewed",[],14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53983396 -0.05445232

They are also calling for the government to cancel a controversial scheme to impose state-issued history textbooks in schools.    The protests on November 14 -- involving more than 60,000 people -- led to violent clashes with police, who sprayed water cannons and pepper spray at demonstrators.    Police have come under fire for what critics describe as excessive use of force that left dozens injured and one protester in critical condition after he was hit by a water cannon.   President Park condemned the rally as an effort to ""deny the rule of law"" and urged strong measures against those identified as inciting violence.   Park also called for a ban on wearing masks during demonstrations, drawing parallels between masked protesters and the Islamic State group -- prompting angry reactions from opponents.

The move by the KCTU came on the heels of the police banning another massive rally by the Korean Peasants League. The KPL had given notice of a plan to hold a rally drawing some 10,000 participants near City Hall in Jung-gu, central Seoul to police, who shot it down Saturday, citing the possibility that violence could break out at the event.Although Korean law stipulates that authorities must grant the permit for a “lawful” protest upon declaration, it also states that any rally that “will clearly disrupt public order and inflict damage upon the people via violence, threat, arson” can be banned. Police said as the KPL was one of leading groups of the Nov. 14 antigovernment rally ― which the government has labelled a “violent and illegal” protest ― its December demonstration is likely to turn violent as well.The KPL has pledged to proceed with the protests as scheduled, seeking a court injunction to overturn the police ban. Both the government and the ruling Saenuri Party has moved to ban the KCTU’s protests as well. Saenuri leader Kim Moo-sung claimed Friday that authorities should not allow the protests, and said that the country’s per capita income would have already exceeded $30,000 “if it were not for KCTU that frequently carries out radical illegal protests.”The KCTU chimed in to denounce the police ban on the KPL protest, calling it a “dictatorial” move and a “blatant denial” of the right to assembly stipulated in the Constitution.The Dec. 5 rally is a follow-up to the November protests that decried the government’s much-disputed policies of reinstating government-issued textbooks, opening agricultural markets and reforming the labor sector. The government and the Saenuri remain at loggerheads with the participating groups and the opposition over who is to blame for the escalation of violence at the rally and scores of injuries suffered by both the police and the protesters, the worst of which was suffered by a 69-year-old farmer who remained in a coma as of Sunday.Last week, Park called for a ban on masked protests and warned she would not tolerate “illegal protests.” But her comparison likening the masked participants to Islamic State group terrorists touched off a furious reaction from civic groups and opposition lawmakers alike.Another controversy erupted recently after unconfirmed claims that a police water cannon deliberately aimed at an injured protester being carried from the scene in an ambulance. An association of local medical students is planning a collective action in protest of the alleged abuse by law enforcement.In addition to saying it would push ahead with protests, the KCTU also expressed concern over recent reports that police are planning to raid a Buddhist temple to arrest KCTU chief Han Sang-kyun ― who took refuge there on accusations of his part in leading what police claimed were an illegal protest. The umbrella union also warned against the National Assembly discussing labor reforms, which encompass thorny issues such as the definition of regular wage and expanding scope of temporary work. It vowed to initiate a general strike on the event of Han’s arrest or the labor reforms bill’s deliberation.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","labor union vows protest ,antigovernment rally on dec ,host mass antigovernment rally ,umbrella trade unions sunday ,union vows protest regardless",['South Korea ’s'],14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37412438  0.09055156

According to the NPA, 113 police officers were injured during the protest, 50 police buses were damaged and 231 items of police equipment, including walkie-talkies and rain coats, were lost or broken.

Reacting to the demonstration, President Park Geun-hye on Tuesday called for a ban on wearing face masks during protests, likening the masked protestors to IS terrorists.But Park’s tough rhetoric ― which came as police mulled banning a second mass antigovernment rally on Dec. 5 ― appears to have backfired, with civic groups and the opposition accusing the leader of “waging war on her people.”Park Ju-min, a member of the Lawyers for a Democratic Society also known as Minbyun, said in a radio interview that her comments were “inappropriate as a leader of a democratic nation.”“These people took to the streets to exercise their fundamental rights, and it is not appropriate to compare them to terrorists. ... I felt that (Park administration) is moving toward the direction of repressing the people’s rights to express their will,” he said. Two protesters look after a farmer lying on the ground after he was sprayed by a water cannon during the Nov. 14 antigovernment mass rally in Jongno, Seoul, in this file photo. (Yonhap)The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy accused Park of “using politics to induce division and confrontation (of people)” while the minor opposition Justice Party said Park is regarding her own people as “an object of repression.”Choi Seung-gun, a 20-year-old student who participated in the rally, said that Park’s comments likening them to the IS was just “ridiculous.”“Because of all the tear gas, many of us has to wear the masks. Yes, the IS hides their faces. Well they eat, too, so does that mean we can’t eat? That just shows you our president’s class,” he said.Last week, Choi garnered media attention after claims that he was shot by water cannons while being carried off by medical staff. The “attack” on Choi, coupled with an incident where a 69-year-old farmer Baek Nam-gi was knocked down by a water cannon blast ― mixed with tear gas ― and remains unconscious as of Wednesday, touched off a blame game over the legitimacy of the police force used during the rally. While the local human rights watchdog labeled it “an attack against civilians” police said that it was an “unfortunate accident” that occurred during necessary use of water cannon to disperse violent protestors.According to the National Police Agency, the protests caused 389 million won ($340,320) worth of damage to the police equipment, while 113 officers were injured by protesters. It accused 594 protestors of using excessive violence in the demonstration. But protestors, along with eyewitnesses, blame the police for crossing the line while containing the protests. Goh Eun-san, a medical student at the Yonsei University Wonju Campus, said the attack on Choi was particularly uncalled for, as he was attacked while being carried off to a hospital. He said in an online posting Friday that the ethics and pride of practicing medicine was “trampled” when an injured man was attacked.Citing a medical law prohibiting any form of attack against an emergency patient, he urged action against what he called “an act against humanity.”“Right now we are gathering signatures to convene an emergency meeting of the Association of Medical Students. We may hold the meeting next week,” he said. The association is expected to discuss Choi’s incident at the meeting, and urge the government to punish those involved and make sure that such incidents do not reoccur.Kang Sin-myeong, the chief of NPA, denied that the water cannons were aiming for the patient. But Choi said Kang’s explanations were unlikely as the supposed spraying went on for at least a minute.The civic demonstration on Nov. 14, the largest since 2008, was organized by civic groups across the country to protest the government’s recent decision to reform the labor sector, open the agricultural market and reinstate the government-issued state textbooks for secondary education. Controversy over violent rallies is expected to persist as the opposing parties are at loggerheads over Park’s emphasis on banning masked protests. Rep. Jeong Kab-yoon of the ruling Saenuri Party proposed a bill which bans participants from wearing masks during violent protests. Non-violent protests or demonstrations where participant have a legitimate reason to wear masks ― such as illness ― are allowed. Violation can result in a maximum two years behind bars or 3 million won in fine. The bill also stepped up the regulation on weapons. The previous law only punished those who used them but an amendment will discipline anyone who makes, transports and stores weapons. It also restricts protests when colleges hold the admission process, such as interviews or essays.“Although freedom of assembly is a constitutional right, the violent and illegal protests are disturbing the social order each year. The purpose of the bill is to establish a culture of law-abiding demonstration by putting our foot down on violent protests,” he said.Rep. Kim Young-nam of the same party pointed out that even many European countries which have advanced laws to protect human rights regulate wearing masks during demonstrations.But Park of Minbyun said that violence at Korean protests are different from those in countries where masks are prohibited.“In those countries, protestors are reported to have committed robbery or arson. There haven’t been any reports of such cases in Korea. The physical altercation (for Korea) usually occurs between protesters and police attempting to disperse them,” he said.Rep. Kim Kwang-jin of the NPAD said that the Constitutional Court in 2003 has already ruled that choosing one’s own attire is part of the freedom of assembly.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","to protests sparks backlash ,masks during protests ,protests sparks backlash ,protests sparks backlash when ,protestors to is terrorists","['Park Geun', 'Park']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56416357  0.05180227

Co-chairs of the group are Lee Jasmine from South Korea; Mike Honda from the U.S.; Yonah Martin from Canada; Melissa Lee from New Zealand; Fiona Claire Bruce from Britain, and former Canadian lawmaker Joy Smith.  ""IPCVSS shares the views that restoration of honor and dignity of victims is mandatory. Countries and non-state actors shall be encouraged to officially apologize for historical and/or current sexual violence perpetrated by its armed forces,"" the lawmakers said in a prepared statement read during the news conference.  The coalition's ""first action will be to seek to unearth facts and call on responsible governments to officially apologize for the acts of abducting by force or mobilizing and deceiving girls and women from the Asia Pacific region as sexual slaves, the so-called comfort women, for its own military during World War II,"" they said.  ""The resolution of the Japanese military's comfort women issue will serve as a model for addressing the issue of girls and women's wartime human rights for future generations,"" the lawmakers said.  The coalition plans to hold an international conference on the issue next year.  Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mainly from Korea, which was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. But Japan has long attempted to water down and deny responsibility for the atrocity.  The sexual slavery issue has been the biggest thorn in frayed relations between Japan and South Korea, with Seoul demanding Tokyo take steps to address the grievances of elderly Korean victims and Japan refusing to do so.  Early this month, South Korean President Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe held the first summit talks between the two countries in more than three years and agreed to accelerate negotiations to resolve the issue.

As the police targeted the face and upper body of protestors, many sustained fractures and bleeding.Citing the recent research, the civic group also pointed out that spraying the water mixed with tear gas on the human body may cause serious problems, including skin rashes, hives, irritation and temporary blindness. In response, the police argued that it was inevitable to use the water cannons to stop protestors committing violence and did not plan to stop using the 19 water cannons to break up “violent” protestors.“It is unfortunate that Baek sustained an injury, but it was a rare accident that took place while stopping violent protests,” the police said.  National Police Agency chief Kang Sin-myeong (right) attends a parliamentary meeting Monday on security and public administration. (Yonhap)The police also cited the data that shows a significant drop in the number of “violent” protests and injuries for police officers since it began employing the water cannons in 2005. The number of rallies that spiraled into violence halved from 128 in the 1999-2005 period to 52 in the 2006-2014 period, with the number of police injuries also having decreased from 614 to 281 during the same period. The police also defended the decision to set up bus barricades to shut down Gwanghwamun Square and bar protestors from marching toward the presidential office. “The police bus barricades were not used to deter the protestors from marching, but they were employed to prevent occurrences of violence,” Kang Sin-myeong, the National Police Agency commissioner general, said at a parliamentary meeting held Monday.“Protestors destroyed the police line and tried climbing up the buses, and they attempted to cross into the area they were banned from,” he said. But opposition lawmaker Rep. Jin Seon-mi of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy slammed the police for overusing force, citing a ruling made by the Constitutional Court in 2009. The 2009 ruling outlawed the use of police bus barricades, as they severely disrupt the free movement of the public. The rival party lawmakers, meanwhile, each introduced revision bills for the Demonstration and Public Assembly Act, with the ruling Saenuri Party defining the rally as a “violent protest,” while the NPAD accused the police of cracking down on the public’s freedom of speech.Rep. Jin of the opposition party, along with 16 other lawmakers, presented a bill banning the police bus barricades. “The police are abusing their power to set up police barricades with buses, as there are no clear rules stipulating the use of the barricade. The bill will guarantee the public freedom of holding public assemblies by barring the police from stopping them with the police buses,” she said. Rep. Jung Gap-yoon of the ruling party, meanwhile, plans to submit a revision Tuesday that forbids protestors from covering their faces with masks. Meanwhile, the KCTU, the nation’s second-largest umbrella union group that led the Nov. 14 rally, hinted at another mass rally in central Seoul on Dec. 5. Accusing the government of steering public opinion against the labor union to dodge responsibility for the deadly crackdown, it vowed an all-out war against the oppressive government in a press briefing held near Cheong Wa Dae. “We are determined to defy the crackdown and maintain our posture to fight against the government’s plan for labor market reform,” the press release read. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","at rallies the police ,violence at rallies ,in central seoul controversy ,bus barricades by police ,violence at rallies the","['Seoul', 'Baek Nam - gi']",14,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.45770782  0.00605576

One protestor remains in critical condition. Police officers seize evidence from the office of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions in Seoul on Saturday. YonhapThe union officials are suspected of premeditating and leading the violent protest in the rally with plans to assault the police with metal pipes and break police equipment, according to police.The police had confirmed that three cars from the KCTU’s office transported the attack items such as ladders, ropes and metal pipes to the protest site. The police said they secured documents, computer drives and several items, including ladders, hammers and metal pipes, from the KCTU’s headquarters. They said they also seized a police walkie-talkie and helmet in the office. The investigators said they would probe the seized items and look into if there were any conspirators or masterminds for the violent clash, they added.The labor union resisted the search and seizure, claiming the police were attempting to water down the rising public criticism over the police’s excessive use of force after a 69-year-old farmer was seriously injured in the rally.“When the police do not offer any apology to the protestor who is hovering between life and death because of the police’s water cannons, they are trying to avoid public criticism by suppressing the public,” said the KCTU. “The government will face strong costs.”The labor union argued that publicizing the seized items is the government’s attempt to manipulate public opinion by making the organization appear to be a violent group. It claimed that hammers, ropes, walkie-talkies and other equipment were not used in the massive rally. This is the first time the KCTU’s headquarters have been raided since it was established in 1995. On Nov. 14, over 130,000 demonstrators from 53 labor unions and civic groups took to the streets against the government’s moves to adopt state-issued history textbooks and institute labor reform. The rally turned violent as riot police armed with water cannons clashed with demonstrators holding metal pipes, leaving one protestor in a coma after he was hit by the water attack. On Friday, the police also launched a task force to file a compensation lawsuit against the labor union for damages incurred in the demonstration, authorities said.Last week, investigators arrested six protestors for aggressively destroying police equipment in the rally and assaulting police officers. An arrest warrant was also issued for KTCU head Han Sang-gyun, who has taken shelter at the Jogye Temple in the capital to avoid arrest.As the standoff has continued between the police and Han, the temple monks said they would intervene in the case upon Han’s request. The temple’s conflict resolution committee will hold a discussion on how to help the two sides solve the confrontation, the temple said. The committee was launched in 2010 as some protestors have tended to seek shelter in the temple to avoid arrest since the mid-2000s.

The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy accused the authorities of using “excessive violence against the people” and illegal counteraction.Both vowed to take stern measures against those responsible as the political standoff aggravated over a number of contentious issues including security, education and economy as the parties head toward the parliamentary race next April.“These so-called professional demonstrators who aim to push society into confusion made the Gwanghwamun area, the heart of this country, into a lawless world,” Saenuri chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung said.  Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn pays a visit to a police conscript who was injured during the Saturday rally at a hospital in Seoul, Monday. (Yonhap)Saenuri floor leader Rep. Won Yoo-chul questioned their motive citing the distribution at the site of papers that were written with phrases like “Oppose dissolution of the UPP” or “Release Lee Seok-ki.” The Unified Progressive Party was dissolved by the Constitutional Court last year citing its plot for a rebellion. UPP lawmaker Rep. Lee Seok-ki was convicted of plotting to overthrow the government in the event of a war with the communist North.“We must firmly trace whether there were any rebellious forces behind the rally,” Won said.Their remarks were echoed by other senior and rookie members of the party with some likening it to a “riot,” and some comparing it to last week’s Paris terrorist attacks by saying, “Violence that is controlled by radical antiestablishment forces must be removed fundamentally.”The NPAD, meanwhile, called the incumbent government “abnormal” for dealing with “innocent people with violence.”“This government only excels in killing the people’s livelihood and oppressing the public,” said NPAD chairman Moon Jae-in. “It must listen to the outcry of the people against youth unemployment, the retrogressive revision of the labor law and price slump of agricultural products.” NPAD lawmakers watch a video footage of a protestor being doused with water cannons during the Saturday rally at a party meeting on Monday. (Yonhap)NPAD Rep. Joo Seung-yong citied the 2011 ruling by the Constitutional Court that found police buses barricading the Seoul Plaza as unconstitutional for blocking citizens’ right for free movement, calling the latest barricade unconstitutional.The party’s floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul said the serious injury suffered by demonstrator Baek Nam-gi, who underwent brain surgery after he fell as police doused him with water cannons, was equivalent to the Sewol ferry captain “murdering” the passengers -- referring to Lee Jun-seok, who was sentenced to life imprisonment for neglecting his duty to evacuate passengers when the ferry sank off in April 2014, killing 304. The protests, arranged by the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions and joined by labor, civic and farmers’ groups, turned violent on Saturday afternoon as police clashed with demonstrators attempting to march through Gwanghwamun Square toward the presidential office by pulling down barricades set up by police buses. The clashes left one critically injured, 51 arrested and 50 police buses damaged. Some 113 police officers were wounded while the KCTU claimed at least 500 were injured by the “excessive police force.” A total of 182,000 liters of water and 651 liters of capsaicin were used.From news reports","violence at mass rally ,an illegal political rally ,left dozens of protesters ,the violence at rally ,violence at rally","['Seoul', 'Saenuri Party']",14,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.33899039  0.04881797

Looking frightened, they confronted protestors of similar age who took to the streets against the government’s push to reintroduce state-authored history textbooks. “I was too afraid to be there. ... I was pushed for one hour by angry protestors while trying to block them. Water mixed with tear gas dropped on my head. ... I just wanted to get away from the scene,” a conscript who was at the scene said on the condition of anonymity. “They could be my friends, you know?”  A citizen washes tear gas from the face of a conscripted policeman during a mass rally in Gwanghwamun, Seoul, Saturday. The picture posted on Twitter has been shared among numerous social media and online communities. (Twitter)He is one of the young conscripts who chose to serve their 21-month mandatory national service in the police rather than in the military. The conscripts recruited by the National Police Agency are mostly dispatched to help maintain public order at protest sites across the nation. In the rallies held at various locations in Seoul from Saturday afternoon, some 70,000 demonstrators, led by labor, civic, student and farmers’ groups, gathered to protest the government’s plan to adopt state-issued history textbooks, reform labor regulations and open up the agricultural market.The demonstrations turned violent as the protestors tried to pull down the police bus barricades in order to march through Gwanghwamun Square to the presidential office. The police, which earlier refused to allow the march citing traffic disruptions, used water cannons to spray water mixed with tear gas to break up the crowd. Enraged by the police crackdown, some protestors swore at the police officers, urging them to open the road toward Gwanghwamnun Square. “You bastards! Open the way! Don’t you have a mother or father? Stop firing the water cannon.”As the violence reached its peak at 9:30 p.m., the angry crowd attempted to bring down the police bus barricades by tying ropes to the vehicles and hitting police officers on the top of the buses with poles. Tainting most demonstrators’ wish to hold peaceful assemblies, some radical protestors went as far as attempting to set fire to a police bus, physically abusing police officers and arousing anger in the crowd. Such actions were largely frowned upon or ignored by fellow demonstrators, many of whom appeared to sympathize with the mostly young conscripts stuck in the middle of official demands for public order and the protesters’ determination to march forward. Some of the demonstrators shouted, “Police officers, please come down (from the top of the buses)! It is too dangerous up there.” A 35-year-old office worker, who participated in the rally, also told The Korea Herald that the police officers were not to blame. The government should take the blame. “I feel so sorry for them. They are just following the orders. They are suffering from what adults have done wrong. I feel like they are putting the young at the forefront of the adults’ ideological war,” he said. “The youth are being sacrificed in vain.” An American national, who only wanted to be identified as Patrick, said that he saw a lot of fright in all their eyes while observing the protest scene for hours. “Some of them seemed to hate what they were doing. Many might have friends out there I imagine. The looks on their faces said it all.”The Korea Herald also witnessed a woman weeping at the corner of a police bus parked near Gwanghwamun Square. The windows of the bus were smashed, though conscripts were still inside on standby in case of emergencies. The woman talked into the bus windows covered by shields, “My son is also a conscript. … Please don’t hurt our children. … Please, stop this violence.”Two days after the violent protest in central Seoul ended, a photo from the scene went viral showing a protestor washing tear gas from a conscript’s eyes. After seeing the picture, which was quickly spread on social media, a netizen said in a tweet, “Why do we have to fight like this?”By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","protests on chilly saturday ,violent protests on chilly ,blame for violent protests ,largest rally held in ,frightened they confronted protestors",['Seoul'],14,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.38113922  0.06297532

""The courts should feel responsible for letting illegal rallies continue by handing down soft punishments to the defendants,"" Kim added.  As the Saturday rally continued into the late night, it turned more violent with protesters brandishing metal pipes and police firing water cannons at the protesters.Criticizing the violence during the demonstration, Rep. Suh Chung-won of the ruling party said illegal rallies with iron pipes and torches should be eradicated by the Park Geun-hye administration.  The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy denounced the excessive use of force by the police, calling it a ""deadly suppression"" of citizens.During the crackdown, some 182,000 liters of water were used, which is about 45.5 times more than the amount used by the police in similar situations last year, according to Rep. Jung Chung-rai of the NPAD.The violent demonstration caused 29 protesters to be rushed to hospitals after sustaining injuries, according to reports. Among the injured was a 69-year-old farmer, surnamed Baek, who suffered a brain hemorrhage after being knocked down by a police water cannon. He was taken to Seoul National University Hospital and underwent surgery but remains in critical condition.Some police officers also sustained injuries although the exact number is not available.Rep. Joo Seung-yong of the NPAD also noted the illegality of using police vehicles to create barricades during a street rally, making it difficult for citizens to pass through the area.In 2011, the Constitutional Court ruled that it is unconstitutional for the police to surround Seoul Plaza with riot buses because it violates the citizens' right to freedom of movement.""The government should listen to the outcry from the citizens over youth unemployment, labor reform and the plunge in agriculture prices,"" NPAD Chairman Moon Jae-in said. Around 130,000 demonstrators from 53 labor unions and civic organizations took to the streets Saturday.

The protest organizers projected that as many as 130,000 gathered for the protest that stretched late into the night.Riot police fire water cannons at protesters during a rally in Gwanghwamun Square, Seoul, Saturday. (Yonhap)The protests started to turn violent at around 4:30 p.m. as police clashed with demonstrators attempting to march through Gwanghwamun Square toward the presidential office by pulling down barricades set up by police buses. The clashes left one critically injured, 51 arrested and 50 police buses damaged. Some 113 police officers were wounded while the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, one of the nation’s two major umbrella groups, claimed at least 500 were injured by the “excessive use” of police force. Baek Nam-gi, a 69-year-old farmer, underwent brain surgery at a hospital after he fell and hit the back of his head as police doused him with water cannons near City Hall, according to the Korea Peasants League. He was pulling the rope to move the police buses at the time. On the road from Jonggak Station toward Gwanghwamun Square were mostly young students and citizens holding candles, demanding the government salvage the Sewol ferry as soon as possible and withdraw its plan to adopt state-issued history books. The state-authored history book has triggered an ideological feud, with critics denouncing the government’s plan as an attempt to beautify the past dictatorial governments and bloody transition toward democracy in the 1980s. Conservatives argue the current history books are biased toward left-wing ideology. “I made my way to show my objection to the government’s plan for history textbooks. A history textbook should not be a script that can be written by a winner,” Lee Hyun-ju, a 19-year-old student in a school uniform, told The Korea Herald.“I am not sure my participation can change anything, but I had to do something,” said Lee, who took the national college exam Thursday. “But I cannot find a way into the rallies because police buses blocked all the paths.” On the other side of the police barricades, hundreds of citizens, blocked from joining the march, watched from a distance as the police fired water cannons into the crowd from the tops of their buses. Many of the protestors shouted in anger, “Don’t shoot the water cannon,” “Stop the water cannon” and “Violent police, step back!” as the police continued to order the crowd to disperse and spray the water mixed with tear gas. The police said it mobilized about 22,000 police officers, 700 police buses and water cannons to shut Gwanghwamun square from the protestors. The police earlier this week banned the march, citing the traffic disruption, and pledged stern action against what it called any “illegal acts” during the protest. On Sunday afternoon, Justice Mister Kim Hyun-woong vowed stern action against protestors who led what he called “violent, illegal” rallies. “Our concern became reality as violent, radical protests took place at the heart of Seoul,” he said. “We allowed legal, peaceful assemblies to a great extent, but some protestors committed violence by using illegal weapons like steel pipes to beat the police.”Throughout the hours-long stand-off between police and protestors, the police made a series of announcements, saying, “You are causing a serious traffic disruption here, which is illegal under the Korean law. We are officially taking pictures of your faces to arrest those who commit illegal acts. Don’t push police officers or beat them.” Despite the government’s denunciation on violent protesters, controversy also brew up over the “excessive” police force.According to the law, water cannons and dangerous chemicals like capsaicin, a chemical that can cause irritation and burns, can only be used at the minimal level to enforce the law. Using police buses as barricades was ruled illegal by the Constitutional Court in 2011. The court said surrounding the protest site with police buses violates public rights for free movement.The United Nations Human Rights Committee expressed concerns about what it called “severe restrictions” placed on the right to peaceful assembly including the use of bus blockades in its recent recommendations for the Korean government. Maeng Haeng-il, 73, accused President Park Geun-hye administration of breaking the Constitution by stifling freedom of expression and mobilizing the police for its own sake. “I feel like we are in the 1970s again. President Park is doing exactly the same thing as her dictator father did during his presidency,” he told The Korea Herald, referring to her late father and former President Park Chung-hee. “Democracy is backtracking,” he said, holding a candle as he watched the protestors on the other side get drenched with water. “The traffic disruption cited by the police is just an excuse (for the crackdown).” Near City Hall, another group of protestors, mainly composed of civic groups, labor unions and farmers’ groups, carried flags and banners and chanted “Park Geun-hye, step down” and “No layoffs” in protest against the government’s labor reform plan. The Park administration has been pushing for reforms to make the market more flexible, to create more jobs for youth and boost the nation’s sluggish economy.Labor groups, however, have been fiercely opposing the government plans to allow employers to lay off workers more easily, adopt a peak wage system and extend the length of hiring period of irregular workers, viewing them as only benefiting businesses. Many of them, masked and wearing raincoats, the protesters responded more violently to the police action, demanding the government to open the path toward Gwanghwamun Square. Some of the radical participants went as far as pulling down some of the police buses by tying ropes to the vehicles, smashing their windows, throwing bricks at the police and attacking officers with steel pipes and poles. Some protestors coughed due to the tear gas, desperately asking for water from people around while continuing their attempts to break the police barricades. “Don’t shoot the water cannon in people’s faces,” a protestor shouted. A 23-year-old student at the University of Cambridge said she had collapsed after being hit by the tear gas-mixed water and had to crawl out of the mass. “I cried out, ‘rescue me,’” said Park Eun-young, who came with a group of students to join the rally against the state-issued textbook scheme. “I should get home now to clean off the tear gas, but I cannot get out because of the police buses.” The protests reached a peak at around 9:30 p.m. when a group of labor union members appeared with torchlights. One of them attempted to throw the firebomb into the police, while others just held it amid cheers from fellow demonstrators. Many citizens had to detour to pass through central Seoul during the day as the police set up the barricades early in the morning, with some of them complaining about the disruptions. Police officers wearing a vest with distinctive orange signs helped the citizens find a way to get around. “With the oil leaking from police buses, the pavements are extremely slippery,” a 20-something office worker said on the pavement in the closed Gwanghwamun Square. “I had to walk for hours to find an exit, but I cannot complain because I agree with what protestors do.”By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","detained after violent protests ,protests the largest protests ,violent protests the largest ,after violent protests the ,after violent protests",['Seoul'],14,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.77608669  0.00215389

He was joined by ministers and vice ministers of agriculture, interior, labor and education.Justice Minister Kim Hyun-woong. YonhapThe Korea Confederation of Trade Unions, the more militant of the country’s two major umbrella labor unions, estimated that at least 100,000 students, farmers, laborers, public servant union members and activists will gather to rally against labor reforms, free trade agreements and the history textbooks.National Police Agency chief Kang Shin-myung had also vowed Thursday to block any attempt by protesters to approach Cheong Wa Dae, such as by barricading all roads in Gwanghwamun with police vehicles. The prosecutor’s national security department also vowed to crack down on any participation by those deemed “antistate,” such as by supporting North Korea.The education and interior ministries in the statement urged government workers and teachers not to participate in the protest, saying the rally would cause traffic jams on a day when students are to take an essay test as part of the college entrance exams.“The policies pushed by the government such as labor reform, Korea-China FTA and normalization of history education are imminent reform tasks that must be achieved for sake of the country’s sustained development. ... But there continue to be baseless denunciations and misleading of public opinion,” the statement read.The KCTU said that the rally is aimed at condemning the government for lax communication in its attempt to overhaul rules on business sectors that are designed to enable more flexible use of nonregular workers glorified as ways to create jobs for the young.Korea has been roiling in controversy over some of the administration’s key policies, namely the reinstatement of state-authored history textbooks despite vehement opposition from progressives and opposition parties.The KCTU also released a statement Friday urging test-takers to support their rally and asked them to travel to the exam center earlier than scheduled due to traffic concerns.“Eleven of the 12 universities that are holding the essay exam are located far away from the site of the rally and will not be influenced.

There were no arrests.Protesters also gathered at Taipei's Songshan airport where Ma gave a brief address to reporters before boarding his flight Saturday morning.The demonstrators tried to burn images of the two leaders with slogans calling Xi ""Chinese dictator"" and Ma a ""traitor"" with 27 arrested after they tried to tried to push their way through a guarded side gate.They included student leader Chen Wei-ting a key figure in last year's Sunflower Movement which occupied parliament for almost a month over a controversial trade pact with China.Television footage showed Chen dragged into a police van while officers with riot shields scuffled with protesters. ""As a president who doesn't represent public opinion, Ma doesn't have the right to meet with the leader across the strait,"" one 35-year-old protester, also named Chen, told AFP.A TSU spokesman in Taipei said legislative candidate Hsiao Ya-tan was ""taken away by police"" from a hostel in Singapore in the early morning, along with two of her assistants. ""They are being questioned... that's the only information we have,"" said spokesman Liu Ching-wen.  Speaking to reporters at the airport, Ma said the purpose of the summit was to ""reinforce peace across the strait and maintain (the) status quo"".Critics have accused Ma of arranging the summit in secret as a bid to boost the ruling Kuomintang's chances at January elections, which it is tipped to lose.Support for the KMT and for Ma personally has plunged, partly due to a China-friendly policy.","taipei afp angry protesters ,protests in taiwan ,storm parliament in taiwan ,protests in taiwan as ,protesters tried to storm","['TAIPEI', 'AFP', 'Taiwan', 'Ma Ying - jeou', 'Singapore', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'TSU', 'Singapore']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52134532 -0.11793312

In 2007, more than 120 South Korean victims were alive, but the number has since dropped to 47, with their average age standing at nearly 90.  Historians estimate that more than 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were sexually enslaved by Japanese troops during the war. Korea was a colony of Japan from 1910 to 1945.        In the current situation, the summit dealing with the potential entry of Japanese self-defense forces into the Koreas is inappropriate, the groups said.   Associations of bereaved families from the colonial victims also held a press conference in front of the former Japanese Embassy building in central Seoul, demanding Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe apologize to and compensate the forced Korean laborers during the period.  Many Koreans were conscripted into the Japanese military or drafted to work in the military industrial sector, being deployed to Japan and other countries against their will.  Many of them returned home after the Korean liberation, following Japan's defeat in the war, but others remained abroad. Many are believed to have died during the war.  It is unclear how many people were mobilized for forced labor and died.

39,39,Seoul’s new slogan ridiculed,"“I.SEOUL.YOU”This is the new slogan the Seoul city government chose, after debating between “Seoulmate” and “SEOULing.”The government officials, and people who voted for the new slogan, probably had in mind some successful campaigns overseas, such as “I Love (heart) New York,” which has proven its global appeal.

However, the slogan may not be going down so well, at least on the initial impression. People are making parodies of the sentence by using it in different photos and conversations. One Twitter user wrote “I will find you, and I will Seoul you” over a photo of Liam Neeson in a scene from the hit action thriller “Taken.”Many others added their own twist to Seoul’s new slogan. Referring to the Park Geun-hye government’s failed attempts at lowering the cost of housing, one Twitter user wrote “I. SEOUL. U (Korean: I will raise the jeonse price).” Jeonse refers to a lump-sum rent deposit.Another Twitter user posted a fictional conversation between a tenant and home owner -- “Hello, it’s me. I Seoul you (Korean: Hi, your jeonse contract is almost over. And we would like to raise the price.).” The tenant responds, “Don’t Seoul me please (Korean: Can you please reconsider that).”Comparing it to the infamous Bucheon slogan, “Bucheon Hands Up (Put your hands up),” one Twitter user said, “Maybe it’s time for us to reevaluate the Bucheon slogan.”One expat commented, “Don‘t Seoul Me,” while another said, “Don’t you Seoul me young man.”Seoul, and the Korean government, have been ridiculed in the past for slogans that were awkward at best. In 2009, there was the slogan “Infinitely Yours,” which has zero connection to the city or the country. There was also the widely ridiculed “Korea, Sparkling” and “Seoul, my _____,” a highly risky tactic for anyone in any way you put it.By Suk Gee-hyun (monicasuk@heraldcorp.com)","seoul new slogan ridiculed ,new slogan ridiculed seoul ,new slogan the seoul ,seoul new slogan ,after debating between seoulmate","['Seoul', 'New York']",14,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.8835988   0.26043567

Earlier that month, a practice projectile was found in a pine field following three similar cases of ricochets in proceeding months. ""Day and night, the sounds of firing never cease in Pocheon, the home to dozens of military bases, camps, a military airfield, ammunition dumps and the Eighth U.S. Army's Youngpyoung (Rodriguez) firing range as well as the South Korean Army's ranges,"" the villagers' committee on the ricochet issue said in protest. The residents near the range started to desert their hometown in fear of stray bullets, they claimed in the protest rally near the U.S. military range.Protesters set fire on straw bundles they brought to the protest area where smoke grew steadily and filled the dusky sky. The villagers' committee was launched last week, demanding the local government take countermeasures on the issue.  Some of the protests carried a funeral bier with banners that read ""Death awaits outside the door"" and ""We want to live,"" in demand of resolution. Encompassing some 13.5 million square meters in the town of Youngjung in Pocheon, it is the U.S. military's biggest shooting practice complex in Asia. Severe tremor and unceasing noise have often been sources of severe protests from villagers.Speaking on the issue in a recent news conference, Theodore Martin, the commanding general of the Second Infantry Division which uses the range, said the division is working closely with the city of Pocheon.

The police said that residents living and doing business in the area had handed in a petition, asking for a prohibition on the demonstration.Under the current Assembly and Demonstration Act, the police can ban assemblies when a petition is submitted against such a move. The court admitted that the demonstration could disturb the neighborhood, but invalidated the police ban, citing a lack of evidence to prove that the petition is authentic and submitted by the residents themselves. The petition only included personal profiles and signatures of some 80 residents living near the demonstration venue without specifying the date and place of the demonstration they opposed and reasons for such a petition. During the trial, two residents who signed the petition reportedly could not testify what it was about and why they submitted it, raising questions over the authenticity of the document. “It is very doubtful that the residents were opposed to the demonstration and asked for protection from the police,” the court said in the ruling. The verdict came amid mounting concerns that an increasing number of police bans are placed on demonstrations and protests over politically sensitive issues, citing traffic disturbances and harm to public order. Another recent controversial police ban on an assembly came in May when organizers of the gay pride parade applied for a permit to hold the annual event. The police rejected the application, taking issue with possible traffic disruptions and clashes with antigay activists during the parade. The decision sparked heated debate and overturned when the court ruled in favor of the LGBT activists. “Assemblies can be prohibited only when they pose a direct and clear threat to public order,” the court said in the ruling. “Banning assemblies should be used as a last resort when there are no options left.”Traffic disruption has been the most cited reason for the police to forbid a protest, according to data released by the National Police Agency. The number of police bans on assemblies stood at 281 last year, with traffic disruption accounting for 45.6 percent of the reasons. Disruption to neighborhood came in second at 32 percent, followed by multiple applications for a single venue at 12.8 percent. A human rights lawyer hailed the court decision as the first step to deter the police from abusing their authority to forbid demonstrations and protests, which he called the backbone of democracy. “While the past court rulings seemed to lean toward the police, this time, the court thoroughly examined the petition. In the past, many petitions seemed rather dubious, raising doubts that sometimes the police led residents to submit them,” Park Ju-min, a lawyer for Lawyers for a Democratic Society, told The Korea Herald. “It seems like the police is making various excuses to ban demonstrations, especially when they are politically oriented and to criticize the government in power,” Park said. “I think the ruling will stop the police from insensibly issuing bans on assemblies.”By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","to block protests seoul ,protests seoul court ordered ,the police on tuesday ,block protests seoul court ,decision to ban demonstration","['Seoul', 'Seoul', 'the Seoul Administrative Court', 'Kim']",14,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.50373685 -0.14322197

(Yonhap)Park also urged lawmakers to end political confrontation over her plan to introduce the state-authored textbooks for secondary education and stop driving the nation into chaos. “Distortion, confusion should be stopped for textbooks that have not been written yet -- things that should not happen.“Correcting the history should not be and cannot be the subject for political wrangling,” she said looking directly at opposition lawmakers.Opening the speech in a rather relaxed tone, Park touched widely on her achievements on state agenda on the economy, inter-Korean relations, labor and public services. The president, however, wrapped up her speech by raising her pitch on state-authored textbooks, a rare gesture seen as clarifying that she has no intention to call the plan off despite the intensifying ideological and political standoff. The opposition members sit with their laptops holding up signs denouncing her textbook plan while Park delivers her speech. (Yonhap)In her 41-minute-speech, Park also urged lawmakers to ratify free trade deals that South Korea had concluded with China, New Zealand and Vietnam. Stressing that the year 2016 was crucial to her government’s completion of a three-year economic innovation plan, the president also urged the parliament to approve bills designed to overhaul the nation’s labor sector and other economy-related bills within this year. She also urged lawmakers to pass the budget bill by the legal deadline of Nov. 30 to help her administration to effectively implement plans to revitalize the economy. The president added that the government would set aside 14.8 trillion won ($13 billion) to strengthen measures for public safety. More than 30 percent of the 386 trillion won budget drafted for next year will be spent in the welfare sector. On North Korea, Park pledged to strengthen defense readiness to better deal with Pyongyang’s possible provocations. Seoul will keep the door for dialogue open and continue efforts to promote exchanges of civilians, such as the reunions of separated families, she said.The president also spent a large portion of her speech stressing the need to secure stable jobs for young people. To open a bright future, South Korean should implement a series of radical reform measures to eradicate abnormal practices that remain hurdles for young people, she said.“Bills aimed at revitalizing the economy and creating jobs for young people remain pending at the parliament for years. As president, it is regrettable. “Even though it is a difficult task, we can only create good jobs for young Koreans only if we go through structural reform,” she said. Her speech was delayed for 14 minutes as rival parties tussled over the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy’s unexpected way of showing their opposition to Park. The NPAD lawmakers placed signs on the back of their laptops that read “No to state-authored textbooks” and “Stabilize people’s lives first.”National Assembly Speaker Chung Ui-wha urged opposition lawmakers to remove the signs before Park enters the parliamentary chamber. The NPAD lawmakers, however, rejected Chung’s demand and sat on their hands throughout Park’s entire speech.The ruling Saenuri Party chairman Kim Moo-sung hailed Park’s speech, saying that it would help the party set a new vision.Expressing frustration, NPAD leader Rep. Moon Jae-in lashed out at Park that she had ignored the people’s demand to focus on the economy and withdraw her plan to introduce the textbooks.“She gave no answer to questions on how to improve the people’s livelihood. There was no self-reflection at all on the government’s failed drive to revive the economy.”Later in the afternoon, the NPAD held an outdoor rally at Seoul Plaza in association with progressive civic groups for first time in 14 months after the party launched a sit-in protest against the government’s botched rescue mission on Sewol ferry that sank off in April, last year. The opposition party also plans to hold a joint debate session with other minor progressive parties and a bus tour to expand public criticism on the textbook plan.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","lawmakers silent protest president ,denouncing her textbook plan ,over history textbooks unrattled ,signs denouncing her textbook ,opposition lawmakers silent protest","['Park Geun', 'Park']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26068696 -0.11809937

Upon the decision by the Korea Educare Association, parents, particularly those of double-income families, struggled to find places that can look after their kids during the shutdown.“Even though I haven’t heard anything from the child care center that my kids attend, I am thinking about taking a few days off or asking my parents or friends to take care of my children for the next week,” said Song Ki-eun, the 30-year-old mother of a 2-year-old boy. If the KEA, an interest group for privately run child care centers with about 14,000 registered entities, goes ahead with its plan, officials estimate that 700,000 children would be affected. The KEA expected that half of its member child care centers would join the move. Teachers at child care centers protested on Friday over the government`s decision to cut its budget for child care programs. Yonhap.The shutdown came as a part of the child centers’ attempt to block the government’s move to freeze subsidies for centers looking after infants aged 0 to 2. The centers claim that the government had promised to increase the budget by 3 percent in 2016. The caregivers also protested over the government’s failure to fund its free child-care policy, known as Nuri Curriculum, which provides preschools and child care centers with subsidies that help them implement the free welfare policy for children aged 3 to 5. As the opposition grew, the Ministry of Health and Welfare said Friday it would work with lawmakers to increase the subsidies, while trying to encourage municipal governments to fund the Nuri program. But the prospects for funding of the Nuri Curriculum, one of President Park Geun-hye’s key pledges in her presidential campaign in 2012, looked grim as the central government and municipalities continued to clash over which agencies were responsible for funding the free child care initiative. The government has mandated that provincial and municipal education offices should fund the program through their own budgets, while the offices have rejected the government’s demand and insisted that the program be funded by the central government. Meanwhile, the Welfare Ministry has urged the caregivers to withdraw their push to shut down the day care facilities and warned that those involved would be held accountable.“I am sick and tired of the struggles over welfare policies. Their fight over their own vested interests only ends up leaving the parents and the children suffering the most,” said Song.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","strike over budget debacle ,on strike over budget ,strike over budget ,protest over the government ,budget debacle major",['the Korea Educare Association'],14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33251184  0.03726267

Yonhap“I am taken back and even flabbergasted,” said Rep. Kim Yong-tae of the Saenuri Party on Wednesday in an interview with a local broadcaster. “(The government) acts as if the state-authored textbook scheme is the only option and forces us to follow its lead. … I believe there is no consensus among the public,” said Kim. The second-term lawmaker elected from Yangchun-gu, Seoul, cautioned that the party would lose voters in the capital city and neighboring metropolitan areas, highlighting that the constituents would oppose the move at worst or have marginal interest in the issue at best. Kim’s criticism followed that of a fellow Saenuri lawmaker from the metropolitan area. Rep. Chung Doo-won, the three-term lawmaker for the constituency of Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, dismissed last Thursday the government’s move as a “backward” policy that hurts democratic diversity. While saying that the current textbooks’ left-leaning bias must be addressed, Chung, who once served as vice mayor of Seoul City, asserted that the governments should follow the norm where nations refrain from monopolizing textbooks. The escalating voice of opposition within the ruling party was seen to reflect the lawmakers’ concerns toward aggravating public opinion especially in the metropolitan area.According to a Gallup poll released on Oct. 16, 45 percent of Seoul residents and 46 percent of Incheon and Gyeonggi Province residents opposed the adoption of the state textbooks. Nationwide polls, meanwhile, were equally split with 42 percent each for and against the textbook change.Meanwhile, other political heavyweights from the ruling party also spoke out against the government’s plan to publish state textbooks. National Assembly Speaker Chung Eui-hwa on Tuesday expressed his regret at the lack of communication by the government to convince the public of the need for state-authored textbooks.“(The government) should have first convinced the public about how ideologically biased the current textbooks are and then discussed whether it would push to issue state-authored textbooks or reinforce the government’s monitoring system. Though belated, we should address those procedural issues,” said Chung.Gyeonggi Province Gov. Nam Kyung-pil also expressed his opposition to the move. In an interview with a local daily, Nam said that the government should have published better textbooks and let the public select what they consider appropriate, and not force them to choose what the government sees as right.

The previous evening, it explained that Hwang’s comments were in line with his emphasis on the importance of investing in history education.“The comments were the personal opinion of one university chief. The quote in the article does not even fit the context,” the ministry said. Hwang, who doubles as a lawmaker for the ruling Saenuri Party, has been the front man of the administration’s push to take back publishing rights for secondary school history textbooks from private publishers. Last week, the Education Ministry announced the revival of state-authored history textbooks because current textbooks are left-leaning. Progressive educators, students and the opposition parties responded with protests and statements decrying the decision. Professors from at least 35 universities across the country have announced their intent not to participate in the state history textbooks as of Wednesday. By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","the nationwide student protests ,state authored history textbooks ,textbook dispute controversy over ,history textbooks further escalated ,nationwide student protests",['Hwang Woo - yea'],14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39361385  0.50708616

A.J. Garcia, the U.S. branch president of civic group Coexistence of Animal Rights on Earth, had launched a hunger strike in front of the Seoul mayoral residence from Oct. 9, claiming that 33 auctioned animals including goats and deer were actually sold to a slaughterhouse. He urged the zoo to repurchase the remaining animals.Seoul Zoo had denied Garcia’s claim, arguing that the first buyer of the animals appeared to have sold the animals to a slaughterhouse without their knowledge. It also stressed that the sale of animals was part of the zoo’s long-term reform to control the number of species while concentrating on raising endangered and wild animals. The zoo has regularly put excess animals up for auction once or twice a year since 1986 to control the number of animals.Following the decision, the 30-year-old activist stopped his hunger strike on Saturday.The repurchase cost will be shared by the zoo and two animal rights group, including CARE. The animals will be sent to other zoos or farms, officials said.

His demand to the mayor is simple: Stop selling public zoo animals to slaughterers. A.J. Garcia, U.S. branch president of civic group Coexistence of Animal Rights on Earth, argues that Seoul City is using the overpopulation of animals as a means to draw profits. The Seoul Metropolitan Government runs the Seoul Zoo to the south of the capital in Gwacheon, Gyeonggi Province.  A.J. Garcia stages a hunger strike Wednesday for the sixth day in front of the Seoul mayor’s residence in central Seoul. (Lee Hyun-jeong/The Korea Herald)“What Seoul Zoo does is that it sells any animals, including dogs, at auction and lets anyone buy them. It has become profits for the zoo. It doesn’t properly check where they are selling to. This is insane,” the 30-year-old told The Korea Herald on Wednesday. His battle with the city started in August when CARE officials found that dozens of deer and black goats from the Seoul Zoo were being taken to a slaughterhouse after being put up for auction. One black goat was immediately slaughtered on the first day, CARE said. The hunger strike was the last option left for him to save the animals, Garcia said. “We kept asked the city to take action for two months, but nothing changed,” he said, adding that the mayor has yet to acknowledge him, though he has been sitting next to the door of his residence for six days.Seoul Zoo, however, flatly denied Garcia’s claim.“In August, the zoo sold the animals to one who didn’t have anything to do with the slaughterhouse. But the first buyer apparently resold them to a slaughterhouse,” a zoo official said. Seoul Zoo has regularly put excess animals up at auction once or twice a year since 1986 to control the number of animals.It also refuted the claim that the animal sales were for business purposes, saying that it was to control the number of animals. In the case of other countries, such as the U.S. or some European states, contraception or euthanasia is often used to control the number of “surplus” animals in the limited space.“The zoo’s annual budget is around 18 billion won ($15.9 million). It drew only about 15 million won for the animal sales this year. Earning such an amount from the auction gives little financial help,” the official added. The animal rights activists urged the zoo to buy back the animals, but it refused the demand, citing insufficient space. The official stressed that the zoo is currently rearranging animal types as part of a restructuring plan released last year. In the long term, the zoo is aiming only to focus on endangered species and native animals, officials said. Acknowledging the concerns over animals being sent to slaughterhouses, however, the zoo vowed to map out a guideline to prevent similar cases and limit the eligibility of auction participants.

The activists said they are bringing the particular issue to the U.N. Women, during a scheduled meeting with the organization’s policy director Dr. Purna Sen on Oct. 27 in New York.The protesters, some 20 of them, included lawyers and activists for women with disabilities and victims of sexual violence. The participants, representing 12 NGOs, were initially scheduled to meet with Gender Ministry officials after holding a press conference, but the ministry canceled the meeting at the last minute on Tuesday night. A group of human rights and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex issues activists protest Wednesday in front of the central government building in Seoul against the Gender Ministry’s recent order for Daejeon Metropolitan City to delete articles that guarantee LGBTI rights in the city’s newly revised charter of gender equality. (Claire Lee/The Korea Herald)The reason for the cancellation was, according to the ministry, that the officials thought the meeting was “going to be a private event” and the activists organized a press conference without consulting the public servants. “This is both disrespectful and absurd,” said Na Young-jung, one of the protesters who participated in the rally. South Korea’s Women’s Development Act, implemented in 1995 to protect women’s rights and combat discrimination against women, was renamed in July to expand the scope of protection against discrimination of both genders. In June, Daejeon Metropolitan City revised its municipal charter of gender equality, based on the renamed Gender Equality Act, and newly introduced articles that protect the rights of the LGBTI community. The revised charter stipulated that the mayor of Daejeon is responsible for coming up with and implementing measures that guarantee equality of opportunity and diverse family life for LGBTI individuals. However, after receiving complaints from gay rights opponents including religious group members, the Gender Ministry in August sent the municipal government of Daejeon an official order to delete the particular articles on LGBTI rights in its charter. The ministry claimed the revised Gender Equality Act in fact does not specifically include any articles on LGBTI rights, and therefore it is incorrect to state that the articles in the charter are based on the Act. The Daejeon municipal government eventually scrapped the articles in the charter. “We had been planning to delete the articles even before the Gender Ministry sent us the request,” said Kwon Jun-sik from the Daejeon Metropolitan City. “We received a lot of complaints from citizens. We first assumed that the Gender Equality Act includes the concept of protecting LGBTI rights, but it turns out the Act does not specifically state that.”The protesters demanded that the government must recognize and validate LGBTI issues as gender issues. “Am I not a woman?” said Song Jeong-yoon, representing a group of sexual minority women at the rally. “This question was asked by black women about 160 years ago. They asked (while forced into slavery), ‘Are we not women?’ ‘Are we not human beings?’ I did not think I’d be asking this question in 2015. How can the Gender Ministry, a government body responsible for women’s rights, voluntarily exclude sexual minority women from benefiting from policies and measures for women?”Bae Bok-ju, the head of a group of women with disabilities, also criticized the ministry for discriminating against LGBTI community.“How is this (what the ministry has done) different from saying, ‘Women with disabilities shouldn’t be entitled to benefit from policies for women’?” she said at the rally. Last month, a total of 12 United Nations entities, including UNHCR, U.N. Women and WHO, released a joint statement calling for an end to violence and discrimination against LGBTI people, asking governments to do more to tackle the issue. “We remain seriously concerned that around the world, millions of LGBTI individuals, those perceived as LGBTI and their families face widespread human rights violations,” the statement said. “The statement is an expression of the commitment on the part of U.N. entities to support member states to (end violence against them).”However, an official from the Gender Ministry, who did not wish to be named, said “the public has to be convinced first” in order to implement measures for LGBTI individuals in Korea. “We still don’t even have antidiscrimination laws,” she said. She also claimed that the Human Rights Commission is in charge of LGBTI rights in Korea, not the Gender Ministry. “The LGBTI rights are protected under the National Human Rights Commission Act, not the Gender Equality Act,” she said.According to a 2013 study conducted by the local think-tank Asan Institute for Policy Studies, only 21.5 percent of 1,500 surveyed Koreans said they had little or no objection to homosexuality. Ryu Min-hee, an attorney at the Korean Lawyers for Public Interest and Human Rights, said the particular incident involving the Gender Ministry will be addressed at a meeting with U.N. Women’s Dr. Sen in New York later this month. At the meeting, the policy director is scheduled to meet with representatives of LBTI groups around the world. “The U.N. entities have encouraged governments to do more to end discrimination against LGBTI community members. What the Gender Ministry is doing is the opposite of what’s been asked,” Ryu said. “We have our representative residing in New York and she will be discussing this matter at the meeting.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","activists on wednesday protested ,blasted for denying lgbti ,for denying lgbti rights ,protested against the gender ,rights activists on wednesday","['south korean', 'LGBTI', 'the Gender Ministry ’s', 'LGBTI', 'LGBTI']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57690632  0.01880432

The Cabinet approved the revision that will be handed over to the National Assembly for final approval.Up until now, it was difficult to crackdown on unfair cases during pregnancy and upon childbirth unless the employee filed a report.With the change, the ministry will be able to investigate the case when an employee changes the employment status for “involuntary” reasons during one’s pregnancy or post-childbirth.The ministry will also be able to look into cases where an employee fails to apply for paid parental leave even when the due date has well passed.The employment insurance currently gives up to 1.35 million won ($1,140) monthly for one to three months for a worker on baby break.Last year’s health insurance statistics showed that while 105,633 employees gave birth, only 88,266 were counted as those on parental leave based on the employment insurance tally. This means about 17,000 workers failed to receive due paid leave or were forced to leave the company.Based on the Labor Standards Act, an employer can face up to five years of imprisonment or fine of up to 30 million won for dismissing an employee during one’s pregnancy or soon after childbirth. Those that refuse to give paid child care leave are subject to up to two years in prison or penalty of up to 10 million won.From news reports","treatment to pregnant workers ,ministry to enhance crackdown ,discrimination against pregnant workers ,labor ministry said wednesday ,crackdown on businesses giving","['the Employment and Labor Ministry', 'the Welfare Ministry', 'the Labor Ministry', 'the Health and Welfare Ministry']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.21160918  0.07744677

The move came a week after over 15,000 educators across the country had protested what they claimed was a policy that “downplays democracy and creative education.”Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea has been pushing to give the government the exclusive rights to publish school history textbooks. Currently, eight local publishers author the textbooks, which are certified by the ministry before they hit the market.“The current textbooks are based on the universal historical viewpoint of academic circles and follow ministry guidelines. An attempt to reinstate state history books is an attempt to impose the historical interpretation of those in power (on students),” 132 Yonsei professors said in their statement.“Forcing a monolithic view of history upon students infringes upon the impartiality and autonomy of education stipulated in the Constitution,” they said.The joint statement follows a protest against the state textbooks by 160 professors from Korea University last Wednesday, another prestigious Seoul-based higher education institute. Late last month, 34 professors of history-related departments at Seoul National University also decried the ministry’s move.The efforts to reinstate history textbooks for secondary education was put on overdrive last year, after privately authored textbooks had been accused of being inaccurate and ideologically biased. Hwang, upon taking office in August last year, has repeatedly stressed that students should be taught with “a single version of history.”But such attempts have prompted fierce opposition, particularly from liberal educators. The left-leaning Korea Teachers and Education Workers Union last week announced that 15,701 teachers had signed a petition against the government pushing ahead with the contentious policy.Proponents of the policy say teaching one version of history can contribute to reducing ideological standoffs among people. The Parents’ Association for Reviving Public Education claimed that many of the eight historical textbooks in the market were biased in favor of liberals, and accused the university professors who opposed state textbooks of also having bias and being “unqualified as educators.”The standoff over history textbooks was noticeable during the ongoing parliamentary audit of government organizations. Members of opposition parties pointed out that state history textbooks were used to whitewash the dictatorial rule of former President Park Chung-hee in the 1970s, raising concerns that the books are likely to cater to demands of those in power. But the ruling Saenuri party said that state textbooks would actually help history lessons remain politically neutral. The government is expected to reach a decision on publishing a system of middle and high school history textbooks next month. By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","professors campaign against state ,yonsei professors campaign against ,professors campaign against ,state history textbook professors ,against state history textbook","['Yonsei University', 'Hwang Woo - yea']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38525242  0.29955733

Since 1995, the North has held an event to mark National Foundation Day.  South and North Korea held joint celebratory events in 2002, 2003 and 2005. Last year, a group of South Koreans visited Pyongyang to take part in the North's celebration.  The North has recently made missile and nuclear threats as it vowed to launch satellites near its anniversary, which outside analysts view as a cover for ballistic missile tests.

Along with the new bill which took effect on Jan.1, the Health Ministry announced that it would support up to 70 percent of the cost of aid and medication for nicotine replacement therapy.However, the report released by Rep. Rhee Mok-hee of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy showed that the number of smokers who received the treatment dropped significantly from 39,718 in February to 18,334 in June. 123RFDue to the programs’ unpopularity, the ministry and the National Health Insurance Service has so far spent only about 8 percent of the 93.4 billion won budget allocated for the service this year, according to Rep. Lee. Some blame the complicated registration process to receive allowance for the medication and aid for nicotine replacement therapy -- such as nicotine gum and nicotine patches -- for the low use of the service. As the medication and aid are currently not covered by the national health insurance, those who wish to get support from the government are required to file a separate form online. The Health Ministry initially planned to have the aid and medication covered by the state insurance starting October, but the plan was delayed partly because of the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome which hit the country in late May. The government is to announce its revised plan regarding the insurance coverage later this week. It is estimated that the government collected some additional 1.2 trillion won worth of tax money by raising the cigarette prices in the first half of this year. However, its next year’s budget for antismoking programs, including nicotine replacement therapy, has been cut by 16 billion won -- from this year’s 147.5 billion won to 131.5 billion won. While the government has been insisting that the only reason it raised tobacco tax was because of the nation’s high smoking rate that poses a threat to the NHIS and the economy, the move has been criticized as a sly way to increase taxes particularly paid by the nation’s low-income population, whose smoking rate is higher than high-income earners.“Only about half of all medical clinics (nationwide) are participating in antismoking programs and offering treatment options,” Rep. Lee said. “If the government is really determined to curb smoking, it has to come up with better ways to make sure more smokers can benefit from nicotine treatments.”Meanwhile, the Health Ministry is establishing a think tank to research on the damage caused by tobacco next month. One of its main goals is to determine if local tobacco makers use additives, such as ammonia, sugar and cocoa beans, to make their products more addictive.Sugar, for example, is known to generate aldehydes when pyrolyzed. The combination of aldehyde and nicotine is known to be more addictive than nicotine by itself.The establishment of the think tank is one of the measures to support the NHIS’ high-profile, on-going suit against major tobacco firms -- including KT&G;, British American Tobacco and Philip Morris -- seeking damages of 53.7 billion won for payouts over tobacco-related diseases especially lung cancer.

LLabor reportedly is demanding a 159,900 won ($135) hike in each worker's base salary.A Kia Motors official said that the company will have ""sincere"" negotiations with the labor and work hard to finalize talks ""as quickly as possible.""Last week, unionized workers at Hyundai Motor Co, an affiliate of Kia Motors, voted in favor of a strike after they failed to iron out differences with the management over a wage hike and other working conditions. In a yes-or-no vote, 77.9 percent of its 48,000 unionists gave the green light to their leaders to stage a strike.The labor dispute came as Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors, the country's two largest carmakers, are struggling to meet their annual sales target for this year in the face of tough market conditions at home and abroad. Sales have been falling in the face of fierce competition and the overall downturn in emerging markets. According to their latest data, the combined sales of the two carmakers during the first eight months of this year came to 5,102,649 units, a 3 percent decline from the previous year's 5,262,741 units.

Some members of the Federation of Korean Trade Unions stage a rally opposing the compromise reached on labor reforms during a cetral executive committee meeting Monday in Seoul. YonhapThe compromise came after months-long negotiations, with the trilateral committee agreeing on the broad picture of the labor market reforms and the labor bloc backing down from its initial stance. But the panel left most of the major contentious decisions to the National Assembly, hinting that the reform plans still had a tough road ahead.Though the government, the ruling Saenuri Party and businesses hailed the agreement as a breakthrough, some radical unionists under the Federation of Korea Trade Unions opposed the plan, casting a shadow over the prospects of a smooth implementation. The FKTU held an executive meeting Monday to endorse the deal, which was strongly opposed by some of its members.Some 100 union members rallied in protest at the umbrella union’s “compromise” with the government, holding up placards that read “We can never approve the agreement that enslaves 20 million laborers.” The meeting was thrown into further disarray when Kim Man-je, head of its metal union, poured paint thinner onto his body and the floor at around 3:30 p.m. to express resistance. Another unionist near him reportedly stopped him from setting himself on fire with a fire extinguisher. As of 6 p.m., the union meeting resumed, but the officials were nowhere near reaching a conclusion, a source from the trade union said.The labor and business blocs had locked horns over the employers’ call for reduced protection of workers. According to the plan, the government will set up administrative guidelines designed to ease restrictions for employers to dismiss underperforming workers and change company rules without union approval.In an apparent attempt to contain the labor circle’s concerns, the committee stipulated in the draft plan that the government should sufficiently consult with the labor and business blocs when employing measures to reform the labor market.Until such guidelines are established, employers will refer to past court rulings to decide under what conditions employees can be dismissed and rules changed.The plan would lay the groundwork for employers to push to change the employment contracts or salary system without union approval, giving a boost to expanding the government-backed wage peak system in the private sector.The government pledged to offer financial and policy support to the companies adopting the system in the proposal, with the committee vowing efforts to use the money saved from the wage peak system to create jobs for the young. Under the wage peak system, companies pay senior employees reduced salaries after the workers reach a certain age, generally between 55 and 60, in return for extending the retirement age. With the official retirement age set to rise by two years to 60 next year, the government has pushed for the revamp in the overall wage system. Regardless of the FKTU’s approval, the government and the ruling Saenuri Party will likely forge ahead with attempts at market reforms. They held a consultative meeting to map out plans for legislation earlier in the day.Lee Jang-woo, the spokesman for the ruling party, called the agreement “belated but extremely fortuitous.” Lee urged “active” participation from the opposition party. The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, however, expressed regret, saying that there is still a long road ahead for the agreement. The ruling party is set to submit the reform bill to the Assembly on Wednesday in a bid to pass it though the parliament within the upcoming regular session. Led by the tripartite commission head Kim Dae-hwan, the top negotiators from each side -- the FKTU head Kim, Korea Employer’s Federation head Park Byoung-won and the Labor Minister Lee Ki-kwon -- have tried to draw a compromise on the reform plan since the labor union returned to the three-way dialogue in late August. The negotiations faced a number of hurdles, with the trade union fiercely opposing the government’s plan to ease restrictions on dismissing underperforming workers and give companies more discretion to change their rules without union approval.The talks among management, labor and government came in line with President Park Geun-hye’s campaign for labor market reforms, a top priority on her policy agendas in the second half of this year. The government has vowed to implement the reforms within this year, even without workers’ approval, to inject flexibility in what it has called “rigid” labor market.

Rejecting the claims, the Seoul Central District Court said most of the plaintiffs were found guilty of obstruction of traffic and thus the arrests were legitimate.""Even if the suspect was acquitted later in a trial, if police arrested him or her on reasonable grounds, the arrest shouldn't be deemed illegal,"" Judge Shin Young-hee said, referring to one plaintiff who was later found not guilty of the charges.""While the plaintiffs were freed 33 hours after the interrogation was done, it's understandable considering the time it takes to decide whether to request an arrest warrant,"" Shin added.The former Lee Myung-bak administration, seeking to advance the bilateral free trade agreement process with the United States, resumed American beef imports in April 2008. Seoul had initially banned the imports in 2003.

The festival will run until Sept. 12.""This partial opening is greatly meaningful in that it can show the process of filling the country's largest cultural facility together,"" Bang Sun-gyu, the ACC's acting chief, was quoted as saying in a release.

""It also raises questions over whether the loudly proclaimed 'pivot' to Asia is, in fact, no more than a pirouette.""Last week, U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense David Shear told reporters that the annual Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercise had been temporarily suspended and then resumed as the two sides needed to do some coordination over an exchange of artillery fire with North Korea.Halpin said the decision was similar to the 1992 cancellation of the Team Spirit exercise, which was made in order to remove an ""irritant to North Korea"" after the two Koreas issued a landmark joint declaration on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. ""So, how did Pyongyang's leaders interpret the suspension in 1992 of the Team Spirit exercise, a defensive exercise held both for military preparedness and to reassure our South Korean allies of our commitment to security and peace on the Korean peninsula?"" the expert said.Rather than seeing the decision as an act of good will, the North responded with defiance, blocking International Atomic Energy Agency inspections and threatening to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, he said.""Brinksmanship is the modus operandi for North Korea's Kim family.

(Yonhap)The celebratory event kicked off at 7 p.m., with Rai chanting “We won!” in front of the Seoul office of the Ministry of Employment and Labor, where Rai and the union members staged a sit-in day and night for three weeks in the blazing heat.“(As the union is now officially registered,) let’s not hesitate to mobilize ourselves to fight abusive employers and discriminatory treatment,” Rai said. “Now, the day to achieve basic labor rights for migrant workers is nearing. Let’s fight together through collective action.”The crowd, consisting mostly of human rights activists and civic groups, erupted in cheers as a four-member Pakistani band took the stage to perform. As the night went on, the street next to the ministry building turned into a party venue, with participants sharing food and drinks. The authorization came nearly two months after the Supreme Court legalized the union, and a month after the labor ministry refused to issue a permit for the establishment of the MTU, taking issue with what it called “politically oriented clauses” in the union’s bylaws.“In the labor union’s original rules, there were some contents against the upper law,” Oh Yeong-min, an official from the ministry, told The Korea Herald. “The purpose of setting up a trade union shouldn’t be politically motivated.” The ministry demanded that the union water down phrases like “legalization of unregistered migrant workers in Korea” and “abolishment of the Employment Permit System,” which prompted the union to launch an around-the-clock sit-in protest.Under the EPS, unskilled workers from 15 nations are allowed to enter Korea to work for up to three years. But migrant workers and civic groups have accused the system of favoring employers, giving them leeway to exploit migrant workers. According to government data, the number of migrant workers legally staying in Korea on the EPS visa stood at more than 270,000 at the end of last year, with 52,760 in the country illegally.Suk Kwon-ho, an official from the nation’s second-largest trade union, the Korean Confederation of Trade Union, said that behind the refusal was the government’s “allergy” to trade unions and the mobilization of workers. “Mobilizing workers and founding a labor union are, of course, political activities to have our voices heard in the Korean society,” Suk told The Korea Herald. “The government was just afraid of laborers being mobilized to fix a flawed structure and institution.” Indeed, a significant number of KCTU members were present at the rally, supporting the foreign workers’ fight in the name of “solidarity.”“Laborers, regardless of nationality, should join forces to fight against capitalists’ low-income policy,” Suk said. “Migrant workers here are at the bottom of the income ladder, with many of them being enslaved by employers.” The Supreme Court’s ruling was historic, as it stated that migrant workers residing in Korea, could set up and join a trade union, whether they were here legally or not. The court recognized foreign workers that were in breach of immigration law as being entitled to labor rights in accordance with the nation’s labor law, 10 years after the group filed a lawsuit in 2005.Celebrations after the ruling were quickly subdued following the ministry’s refusal to recognize the union. While the MTU was “disappointed,” it decided to change what was viewed as “politically oriented” to gain legal status. “We have fought for 10 years, and if we didn’t compromise, it could take 10 more years to establish a trade union,” Shekh Al Mamun, a deputy head of the MTU, told The Korea Herald. Some radical civic groups voiced concerns over the MTU’s decision, viewing it as a compromise. But the MTU said it pushed for changing the phrases to move forward.“When the conventional way of protests doesn’t work, there needs to be a change in the technique,” Mamun said. The ministry finally accepted the application after the MTU changed its purpose of establishment to “improving the social and economic status of migrant workers,” shelving the goal to abolish the EPS system and grant amnesty to illegally residing migrant workers, at least on paper.“The rephrased statements in the bylaws, however, don’t change what we stand for or erode our spirit for resistance,” he said. The MTU wrote a new chapter in migrant workers’ history in Korea, but the union members said it was only the beginning, expecting a tougher road ahead to dispel negative perceptions toward foreign laborers here. The unusual scene, with foreign workers’ voices blaring from the loudspeakers at the sit-in protest in central Seoul, was enough to turn many heads, but passers-by walked indifferently past the campaigners. “Koreans pity us, but don’t respect us,” the union leader Rai pointed out. “Many of them think we are poor and try to help us, but when we raise our voices, they point a finger at us.”According to the 2010-2014 World Values Survey of 1,200 Koreans, 34 percent of respondents had hostile feelings about multiethnic residents, and 44 percent felt negative about migrant workers in Korean society. The level of Koreans’ acceptance of other races ranked 51st out of 59 surveyed countries.But Rai remains hopeful as the growing levels of both support and dissent mean there has been progress in raising awareness of migrant workers in Korean society. “It was unimaginable to hold a sit-in in front of the government building 10 years ago.”Another challenge facing the MTU is to diversify its membership to increase its representation. The MTU currently has some 1,100 members mostly from Southeast and Central Asia. “We have fought hard, but could not reach out to migrant workers from various backgrounds, though a trade union is driven by the power of union members,” Mamun said.The MTU plans to travel across the nation to meet with migrant workers, educate them about their labor rights, and persuade them to join the union to garner support for the greater collective action.“We will continue the fight until the day we are recognized as part of society by more actively raising voices for migrant workers as well as the marginalized in society,” Mamun said. “We have a long road ahead.”By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","the heat thursday udaya ,union gave victory speech ,heat thursday udaya rai ,gyeonggi incheon migrants trade ,heat thursday udaya","['Udaya Rai', 'the Seoul - Gyeonggi - Incheon Migrants ’ Trade Union']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.30019671  0.54726332

The court invalidated the ban, recognizing the unregistered migrants as “workers” in accordance with labor law if they offer labor in return for wage. (Ock Hyun-ju/The Korea Herald)Following the ruling, the MTU requested an authorization permit from the ministry. But the ministry rejected its application twice in the past two months, taking issue with what it called “politically oriented clauses” in the union’s bylaws. “In the labor union’s original rules, there were some contents against the upper law,” Oh Yeong-min, an official from the ministry, told The Korea Herald. The current labor law stipulates that an organization cannot be authorized as a trade union if its activities are politically motivated. The MTU’s bylaws had included that it would pursue legalizing unregistered migrant workers in Korea and abolishing the Employment Permit System, which led the ministry to demand the union to water down the clauses in question. “Such clause was viewed as politically oriented, as it had nothing to do with improving their working conditions,” the official said. The ministry finally accepted the application after the MTU changed its purpose of establishment to improving the social and economic status of migrant workers here, rather than to abolish the EPS system and grant amnesty to illegally residing migrant workers. Under the EPS, unskilled workers from 15 nations are allowed to enter Korea to work for up to three years. But migrant workers and civic groups have accused the system of being employer-friendly, giving leeway to Korean employers to exploit migrant workers. The MTU has some 1,100 members mostly from Southeast and Central Asia. It belongs to the nation’s second-largest labor union, the Korean Confederation of Trade Union.According to government data, the number of migrant workers legally staying in Korea on the EPS visa stands at 553,000, while 208,778 are thought to be residing in the country illegally.By Ock Hyun-ju(laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","korea authorizes first migrant ,korea herald our weeks ,seoul gyeonggi incheon migrants ,migrant workers union thursday ,incheon migrants trade union","['Seoul', 'Nazmul Hossain', 'the Korea Herald']",14,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.17486539  0.28640932

The green tide advisory is raised when the chlorophyll-A concentration exceeds 15 milligrams per cubic meter and the number of blue-green algal cells is over 500 cells per milliliter based on two sets of test. This is the fourth advisory for Paldang Lake in the last five years. The lake, artificially constructed in 1973 to run Paldang Dam, serves as one of the capital’s main water sources. Over 244 million tons of water is stored there. The low rainfalls and high water temperatures amid the heat wave have contributed to the algal bloom reoccurrence, the ministry said. The advisory was also raised for the Hangang River as of Tuesday afternoon, 18 days after Seoul Metropolitan Government had lifted the alert. The river is linked to Paldang Lake. In late June, the city issued a warning for the entire downstream section of the river for the first time in 15 years. The alert lasted for a month. As part of its efforts to alleviate the green tide, the city said it would temporarily open Singok weir, a small dam, in the mouth of the river in Gyeonggi Province, which has recently been pointed to as a culprit of the green tide by civic groups. While the weir was constructed to control the water flow and prevent floods and back flow of sea water, activists have called for it to be torn down, claiming that it actually slows down the natural water flow, thereby causing ecological problems. Seoul City also urged the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport on Tuesday to contemplate whether to demolish the weir. The ministry has the authority to make the decision as it owns Singok weir. Based on a long-term study of the weir’s efficacy, Seoul City concluded earlier this year that it is economically more beneficial to tear down the small dam. The city sent the study report to the Environment Ministry and Land Ministry in May, but no responses had been received, city officials said. The Land Ministry has reportedly been reluctant to pull down Singok weir, citing the benefits of keeping the water level steady. If no rain is forecast by next week, Seoul Metropolitan Government will temporarily open the small dam and monitor the ecological differences for three days, authorities said.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","green tide threatens seoul ,green tide advisory wednesday ,000 blue green algal ,ministry issued green tide ,seoul water safety again","['Seoul', 'the Environment Ministry', 'Gyeonggi Province']",14,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.451121    0.0640545

(Yonhap)The government reportedly presented a toned-down proposal to the labor bloc on Sunday, three days ahead of the slated meeting of 52 key officials belonging to the Federation of Korean Trade Unions on Tuesday to decide whether to return to the negotiations.The trade union has been refusing to even discuss the new layoff plan on the bargaining table, boycotting the talks unless the trilateral committee scraps the agenda from the negotiations. In the government proposal, only symbolic statements for the easing of firing regulations and recruitment guidelines would be included, in an attempt to temper the controversial points to push ahead for an agreeable market reform that also include ordinary wages, working hours and an extension of the retirement age.The suggestion came over a week after Kim Dae-hwan, head of a tripartite committee of government, labor and management, returned to his post, pledging to resume the dialogue as soon as possible. Kim had offered to resign in April, taking responsibility for the collapse of the trilateral talks on reforming the labor market. The government’s stepped-up efforts to resume the talks comes in line with President Park Geun-hye’s campaign for labor market reforms to increase flexibility in what she calls a “rigid” labor market.Park set labor reforms as the nation’s top priority in the second half of this year to help boost the nation’s sluggish economy and generate jobs for struggling youth.If the labor bloc accepts the suggestion, the trilateral consultative body is expected to avoid contentious topics and to draw conclusions on agreeable items including ordinary pay, the wage peak system and protection for irregular workers.“It is important to stick to a principle, but it is necessary to protect the labor bloc’s rights in the consultative body’s framework,” an FKTU official said, raising possibility of the union accepting the proposal.However, the union itself is expected to face the daunting task of persuading its union bodies as some of the members including a trade union for metal workers vowed not to accept the suggestion.The metal union is the biggest body under the FKTU with 130,000 members, allegedly retaining a great deal of organizing and leveraging power within the union. It pledged to block the union meeting from taking place Tuesday. The labor union is scheduled to hold mass rallies across the nation to resist the government’s push for labor market reforms on Aug. 22.

The guidelines also completely ignored sexual minorities, saying sexual abuse can lead to “defects” like questioning one’s sexual orientation. It also described women not paying the bill on dates as being one of the reasons behind date rapes, and that women “have to be careful” and “firmly say no” to avoid date rape. “Not only do the guidelines generalize the misperception about men’s sexual desire, thereby justifying sexual violence, it leads students to have strings of prejudice related to sex,” said an official from the KSVRC.The ministry explained the following day that it ordered the officials to revise the part about date rape and is planning to consult with experts on the part about men’s sexual urges. Despite the ministry’s prompt reaction, the guidelines -- distributed earlier this year -- raised questions about sexual education in schools, or lack thereof.Bae Jeong-weon, a sex education counselor who heads the Center for Sexuality and Harmonious Life, said that lack of proper sexual education is damaging students’ perceptions of sex, making it harder for students to understand what is appropriate and what is not.She pointed out that sex education in high school is being conducted as one of six categories under the public health classes, which is insufficient to provide adequate information. Law mandates that all elementary, middle and high schools conduct sex education. But important details, such as about safe sex and contraception, are also often glossed over, while the guidelines sternly warn students about the negative side effects of sex, such as unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.Talking about teenage sex has been frowned upon in conservative Korean society. According to a recent survey by seven sex education institutions in Seoul, over half of middle school boys in Seoul do not consult anyone about sex-related problems.Teenagers say such taboo is driving them further away from understanding the basic concept of sex. “Teachers just say sex is something that we simply should not do. It is a natural thing between people that love each other, but they don’t talk about that,” said a 16-year-old girl who left home last year and is currently living in a shared home with fellow runaways.  Students at a Seoul-based high school attend a class in this file photo. (The Korea Herald)With the authorities tip-toeing around the issue, students may have the misperception that breaking the taboo is “cool and hip,” Bae said, pointing out that such misperceptions about sex may have fueled sex-related incidents among college students.Most colleges and universities conduct a “welcoming workshop” for freshmen students, during which freshmen and older students go on a trip to drink, play games and get to learn more about college life. But such release of the stress accumulated through years of preparing for college while being relatively unaware of sexual boundaries is also blamed as part of the reason for an increase of sexual harassment during these events.Earlier this year, several male students at Sogang University were slammed for using sexually offensive terms in allocating rooms for first-year students. While the incident sparked nationwide furor, students say this is not uncommon during the events.A 24-year-old student surnamed Yoo at a Seoul-based university shared an incident that happened during his freshman year, where a 20-year-old sophomore made inappropriate contact with younger female students. “It wasn’t like he had a reputation for being a pervert or anything. He just didn’t know better. Now that I think about it, it could have happened to me, too,” Yoo said. Bae said sex education in schools should be more detailed and informative. Instead of just telling students not to have sex until adulthood, the sex classes should help students understand the changes they are going through, she said. Parents should also be involved, Bae added.“Parents have trouble talking about it because they think of it as sexual intercourse, but it is more about teaching ways of life. They need to constantly discuss the issue with their children,” she said. Yoon Hee-sang, a 22-year-old student at Ewha Womans University, said that reoccurring cases of sexual abuse by students had her wondering if Korean education was headed in the right direction. “Students -- even those who criticize the professors about the incidents -- don’t hesitate to tell sexual jokes among their peers,” she said. “These actions by the so-called elite students, particularly at an official school event, make me wonder if our education system is overly emphasizing the academic achievements and overlooking the character development of students.”By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","the korea sexual violence ,condemning the education ministry ,discrimination against sexual minorities ,korea sexual violence relief ,korea sexual violence","['the Korea Sexual Violence Relief Center', 'Korean Women ’s', 'the Education Ministry ’s']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.21362297 -0.06061099

(Yonhap)As the flames went up during a performance to commemorate the victims coerced into sex slavery, people at the scene scrambled to douse it with fire extinguisher and placards they were holding, witnesses said. Choi was rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment. He allegedly suffered three-degree burns, but remains conscious. Yoon Mi-hyang, a head of the rally organizer, Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery, said that Choi had worked for the victims in Gwangju and come to Seoul to join the protest at least once a month. The police is set to launch a probe to determine the reason behind Choi’s self-immolation attempt. The rally was the largest in scale this year, ahead of the 70th anniversary to mark the end of Japan’s 1910-1945 colonial rule over the Korea Peninsula. Liberation Day falls on Aug. 15.The sex slavery victims and their supporters have rallied since 1992 outside the Japanese Embassy every Wednesday, demanding an apology and compensation from Japan for its wartime atrocities.

He was arrested by Japanese military police in 1928 and died at a prison in China in 1936.   During Japan's 36 years of colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula from 1910, many Korean independence activists like Shin moved to China to continue their anti-Japanese resistance movement.   The Shideng temple, which already had been demolished during Beijing's rapid urban development, is a reminder of the vanishing relics where Korean independence activists once worked.  Lee Deok-nam, a 71-year-old daughter-in-law of Shin, has been living in Beijing since the mid-2000s, and said it was ""deeply regrettable"" that such aging buildings were knocked down by developers.   ""Until the early 2000s, there were some places (where Shin once worked) in Beijing. But, for now, there is nothing left due to reconstruction projects,"" Lee said.Near the Wangfujing shopping street in Beijing, there is another aging building, which was used by the Japanese military police as a prison where Yi Yuk-sa, one of Korea's most famous poets and an independence activist, died.   Universally known by his pen name, Yi's works symbolize the spirit of Korean independence movements against Japan's harsh colonial rule.   In the 1930s, Yi studied in China, while making frequent contacts with a number of Korean independence activists.   Yi, who suffered symptoms of lung disease, was arrested in 1943 and transferred to the prison of the Japanese military police in Beijing, where he endured brutal torture. In 1944, Yi died in the prison.   The former prison is also facing demolition. Park Han-yong, an official at the Seoul-based Institute for Research in Collaborationist Activities, said, ""Along with Shanghai, Beijing was one of the centers for anti-Japanese independence movements for Korean activists.""   ""But efforts to preserve historical sites in Beijing have been neglected, compared with Shanghai,"" Park said. The institute is conducting research work on Koreans who gained by collaborating with Japan during the colonial rule.

The explosion nearly severed the ankle of 23-year-old Kim and the wider part of both legs of 21-year-old Ha.Following a two-day joint probe through Aug. 7 with the United Nations Command, the JCS has concluded that steel springs, firing pins and other perceived debris of the detonated devices collected from the scene corroborate with the wooden-boxed mines used by the North Korean military.“The incident has been found to be a clear provocation in which North Korean soldiers illegally breached the Military Demarcation Line and intentionally emplaced wooden-boxed mines,” said Koo Hong-mo, a senior JCS official in charge of operations, issuing condemnation over what he called a “nasty act that any normal military cannot even think of.” “Our military gravely urges North Korea to apologize and penalize those responsible.

The issue has long been a constant source of tension between the two Koreas, which are still technically at war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.South Korea has said there are no legal grounds to prevent its activists from floating the leaflets, citing freedom of expression.A local court ruled earlier this year that South Korean authorities can intervene and stop the leafleting campaign if there is a clear threat to the safety of South Koreans.In October, the two Koreas exchanged machine gun fire across the border after the North apparently tried to shoot down balloons carrying anti-Pyongyang leaflets.

Pedestrians pass by the renewed Sewol protest site in Gwanghwamun Square in central Seoul, Sunday. YonhapFamily members of the victims have been staging a tent protest in Gwanghwamun Square since the father of teenage victim Kim Yoo-min started a hunger strike last year to urge the government to thoroughly investigate the deadly accident. While Kim ended the hunger strike after 46 days, the stay-in strike in the heart of Seoul has become a symbol of their fight as tens of civic activists, religious figures and even some politicians have joined the movement. Pope Francis also visited the site to comfort the bereaved families last year during his trip to Korea. Some right-wing activist groups, however, have continually urged the Sewol families to stop the demonstration, claiming that they are illegally occupying public space. The dozen tents set up in the square have blocked the area and the fountain that typically operates from April. Tens of activists, religious groups and a few family members of the victims still spend their days and night in the tents. “The rules and regulations must be equally imposed to all. Allowing the occupation over a year for those who didn’t get the official permit is problematic. The Sewol people monopolized the square where everyone should be able to enjoy their freedom of speech,” said conservative group Citizens United for Better Society. Under the law, the Seoul Metropolitan Government has full authority to allow public events or strikes in Gwanghwamun Square. Anyone wishing to hold an event is required to submit an application seven days prior. Technically, the bereaved families have never been permitted to stage the strike in the public site. The city government, however, practically approved of their actions. It even provided 13 tents to the families, citing safety concerns last year.Some extremist groups sued Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon and two other city officials in August last year, arguing that allowing the strike is “dereliction of their duty.” The probe is still underway. Despite the growing opposition, Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon has defended the demonstration.“I don’t understand what the big deal is about allowing the tent strikes, considering the agony and deep sorrow of the bereaved families,” Park said in a press conference in May. As part of the efforts to reduce the public inconvenience while keeping the spirit of the Sewol protest, the city and the protest participants agreed to remodel the protest site. Starting from Saturday, the main protest area blocking the public fountain site was cleared. Tents that had mostly been used for the stay of the protestors transformed into a place for a public altar, exhibitions of Sewol photographs and videos and a space for other events to remember the tragedy. “The remodeling aims to return Gwanghwamun Square to the public while keeping the protest spirit. We didn’t expect the protest would continue this long. The fight will go on until the Sewol issue is solved,” an official of the protest-leading civic group 416 Solidarity told The Korea Herald. Gwanghwamun Square is not the only place where the bereaved families face opposition. Dozens of residents in Paengmok Harbor in Jindo, South Jeolla Province, which is near the shipwreck site, filed a complaint to the Anticorruption and Civil Rights Commission late last month to ask for the removal of the vestiges of the Sewol tragedy in their neighborhood, citing business damage. Since the deadly accident happened, a group memorial altar was set up and yellow ribbons were hung along the port to mourn the deaths of the victims. Residents argued that the more than a year of mourning has significantly affected their businesses, adding that the government needs to ensure their mental and financial compensation. Despites such opposition, the Sewol victims’ family members continue their fight to investigate the cause and poor management of the tragedy. The controversial Sewol bill aiming to conduct a special probe into the deadly accident finally passed the National Assembly last November, but new controversy arose over a decree in the bill that protesters claimed would enable the government to possibly meddle in the investigation. Debate also brewed over the budget for the special Sewol committee.Activists have strongly lambasted the government for failing to allocate a budget for the special committee.The committee, which began operation this January, had been running on expenses provided by the maritime ministry until the subsidies were suspended in April, according to news reports. On Friday last week, the parliamentary committee on agriculture and maritime affairs agreed to allow a supplementary budget of 64 billion won ($57 million) for the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries only if the budget for the Sewol special committee is allocated, although Saenuri Party members initially opposed the idea.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","seoul sunday yonhapfamily members ,april last year pedestrians ,central seoul sunday yonhapfamily ,seoul sunday yonhapfamily ,families stay in protest","['Seoul', 'pedestrian', 'Seoul', 'YonhapFamily']",14,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.36390784  0.11657314

More than 200,000 Korean and other Asian women were coerced into sexual servitude for Japanese troops at that time, according to historians. The victims are euphemistically dubbed ""comfort women.""  ""I can't even die without receiving an apology from the Japanese government,"" Kim said. ""Japan should not just sit back like that after having deceived young women to serve as slaves.""  She urged the Shinzo Abe administration to come clean on the matter.  The demonstration was 1,185th of its kind, organized by a Seoul-based civic group that calls itself the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan.  Every Wednesday, a handful of elderly Korean comfort women and supporters gather across the street from the Japanese Embassy in Seoul to voice their protest against Japan's lukewarm attitude on the issue.  It was the first time that a comfort woman held such a rally in front of the Japanese Embassy in Washington. It was co-organized by the Washington Coalition for Comfort Women Issues.     Japan claims that all legal responsibilities for its 1910-45 colonial rule of Korea were settled in a 1965 pact to normalize its relations with South Korea.  South Koreans, however, believe the Japanese administration has yet to offer a sincere apology and appropriate compensation for the victims.  ""We have to make efforts, along with the international community, for the punishment and implementation of legal responsibility for the crime, an issue that was not resolved 70 years ago,"" Yoon Mi-hyang, head of the Korean Council, said in the Washington rally.  The protesters also entered the embassy and held a protest rally. Ambassador Kenichiro Sasae refused to meet them in person.  Korean activists in California plan to organize similar demonstrations in other major U.S. cities where Japan's consular offices are located.

(Ock Hyun-ju/The Korea Herald)As the final event of celebration for sexual minorities kicked off at 11:00 a.m., thousands of sexual minorities and spectators flocked to the Seoul Plaza where nearly 90 gay rights groups, embassies and global companies set up their booths to campaign for equal rights. Mark Lippert, the U.S. ambassador to Korea, also visited Seoul Plaza to look around the booths, take pictures and send a supportive message for the festival organization.The day’s festivities began at around 3:00 p.m. with a performance of a man in a black glitzy costume dancing to Madonna’s signature song “Like a Virgin.” Loud cheers erupted in the sea of people waving rainbow-colored fans. “We came here today to overcome and cure voices of hatred,” said Kang Myeong-jin, a leader of the festival organization committee in an opening speech. “Please help us to conclude the festival in a good manner.” Antigay groups hold placards that read ""Holy Korea"" and ""Homosexuality Out"" in Seoul Plaza, central Seoul, Sunday. (Ock Hyun-ju/The Korea Herald)Around the corner, hundreds of anti-LGBT campaigners, mostly right-wing and Protestant groups, beefed up their opposition against the event, with some calling for “Jesus,” singing gospels and holding up placards that read “homosexuality is against nature” from the early morning. They also set up a booth to collect signatures for a petition to outlaw homosexuality in Korea.Dozens of police buses were stationed around City Hall, with hundreds of police officers at the scene to prevent possible clashes between the LGBT groups and their opponents. A high school student Park So-young, who is lesbian, finally made her way to the parade for the first time after hesitating for several years due to her parents’ opposition against her sexuality. “I hesitated to come here at first, but I feel more confident to show my true self here after seeing many people like me and those who support gays,” said the 18-year-old, who was met with hostility and had to drop out of middle school after coming out at the age of 14. Park said that she felt sad about the antigay groups, pointing out that there is still a lot of work to be done to raise awareness on sexual minorities in the country.LGBT rights activists march forward holding a banner that read ""Seoul Against Homophobia"" at the pride parade in central Seoul, Sunday. (Ock Hyun-ju/The Korea Herald)The big day for the local LGBT community and its advocates was made even bigger with the Friday ruling in the U.S. that legalizes same-sex marriage across the nation.“The U.S. ruling indicates that countries around the world are slowly becoming more accepting of homosexuality,” she said, echoing hope for a change in Korea, too. Steve, an Irish national, who only wanted to be identified by his first name, said he came all the way from Chungcheong Province to celebrate Friday’s “monumental” ruling together with others in the gay pride parade. “The U.S. ruling is monumental because it means that gays are now more accepted in the world. I feel like it is an end of a battle for gay rights,” said the 25-year-old English teacher. But in Korean society Steve still feels “invisible,” as he still remains a “straight” guy at work out of fear for how Koreans would react to his sexual identity. “I am afraid to come out because there seem to be no regulations that can stop people from despising and discriminating against gays.” Marchers wave rainbow-colored flags at the pride parade in central Seoul, Sunday. (Ock Hyun-ju/The Korea Herald)The festival organization committee also tightened security for the event by issuing permits to take pictures at the scene only after checking ID cards. It also did not reveal the route for the Sunday parade until the last minute, citing the possibility of antigay protestors blocking its march forward. The pride parade faced a series of challenges before finally being staged Sunday afternoon, as antigay organizations attempted to prevent the parade from taking place.Christian groups began booking out the likely venues for the parade in May. They also camped out in front of Namdaemun Police Station to block the parade organizers from applying for a necessary permit to hold the event in central Seoul. When the Queer Cultural Festival opened on June 9, the festival participants were outnumbered at the event venue by protesters holding signs with slogans like “Stop Same-Sex Marriage” and “Gays Out: Homosexuals have no human rights.”At the height of the Middle East respiratory syndrome scare, the organizers admitted only 50 staff members to the opening show, urging others to follow by live broadcast on YouTube.  After the two-hour opening ceremony, thousands of participants started to march through central Seoul at around 5 p.m. in what organizers called “Korea‘s biggest pride parade in history.” Marchers follow a decorated truck carrying dancers and banners reading “Solidarity under the rainbow” in central Seoul, Sunday. (Ock Hyun-ju/The Korea Herald)The marchers followed dozens of decorated trucks carrying performers and banners reading “Marriage Equality” and “Solidarity under the Rainbow,” waving rainbow-colored banners, dancing and singing along to mostly K-pop music. They often confronted antigay campaigners who stood on the sidewalks of major streets shouting at marchers and holding placards that read “You are born by a mother and father,” “Come back to your beautiful family” and “Repent. Homosexuality is sin.” Antigay campaigners holds placards on a sidewalk, with dozens of police officers stationed in central Seoul, Sunday. (Ock Hyun-ju/The Korea Herald)The paraders cheered and shouted “We love you” in the faces of their opponents.One of the Christian groups tried to block the march by parking a bus on the route, but the police soon ordered the vehicle’s removal. The parade continued smoothly without major clashes. The police estimated about 6,000 people took part in the hour-long parade, but organizers said the number may have topped 20,000.Organizers said this year’s pride parade carries greater meaning as it marks the first time the parade was held in the heart of Seoul. The annual queer festival first took place in 2000 in Daehangno, an area popular with young people.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","fight lgbt activists parade ,activists parade in seoul ,lgbt activists parade in ,lgbt activists parade ,long fight lgbt activists","['U.S.', 'Seoul', 'korean']",14,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.12144888  0.22444174

Pyongyang announced the decision late Friday via email under the name of Jon Kuk-man, chairman of its university sports association. It had planned to dispatch 75 athletes and 33 officials to the competition set for a 12-day run from July 3. “The letter cited political reasons resulting from the establishment of the U.N. human rights office in Seoul,” Kim Yoon-suk, secretary-general of the steering committee, said at a news conference. “We’re working to verify the true intentions behind the email in cooperation with the Unification Ministry. … It is still premature to conclude that North Korea’s pullout has been confirmed.” Yoon Jang-hyun, mayor of Gwangju and president of the panel, expressed regret but expressed his hope of a possible turnaround in Pyongyang’s decision. “With an open mind, we will hope for and request North Korea’s participation until the last minute.” The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights is scheduled to open the field structure here on Tuesday to monitor and document the oppressive regime’s rampant rights breaches in line with a recommendation in February 2014 by the Commission of Inquiry. The project has incurred the wrath of the Kim Jong-un regime as the COI’s landmark report brought global attention to the issue to a new height. In its wake, the U.N. Security Council formally set North Korea’s dismal human rights situation as a standalone item on its agenda for the first time last year, paving the way to bring perpetrators including the young ruler to justice. “Human rights is a universal value, and it should not be a problem to host an office of international organizations such as one for human rights,” ministry spokesman Lim Byeong-cheol said at a press briefing. Even in times of heightened tension, sports events have long set the rare stage for inter-Korean people-to-people exchanges, especially given Kim’s widely reported affection for them. The communist neighbor also took part in the Daegu Universiade in 2003, and the Asian Games in 2002 in Busan and 2014 in Incheon.Pyongyang’s latest announcement marks yet another setback to Seoul’s efforts to break the long-festering cross-border standoff and bring about a thaw as the two Koreas celebrate the 70th anniversary of the peninsula’s liberation from Japanese colonial rule this year. Under its initial plan unveiled in March, North Korea sought to compete in athletics, diving, artistic gymnastics, rhythmic gymnastics, table tennis, judo, women’s football and handball. But the outlook for its participation had grown murky in recent weeks after it repeatedly missed the deadlines for formal registration. The regime’s about-face is also likely to set a hurdle for the competition because some events such as women’s football and handball may have to redraw lots.

It's the role of a country of laws. It's the role of a trading nation. It's a role of a country that has flourished under the international system,"" Russel said during the seminar co-sponsored by Center for Strategic and International Studies and the Korea Foundation.""The fact that, like the United States, the Republic of Korea is not a claimant, in my view, gives Seoul all the more reason to speak out because it is speaking not in self-interest, but speaking in support of universal principles and the rule of law,"" he said.It was the first time that a senior American official has publicly asked South Korea to play a role in the territorial dispute.

With public criticism mounting, the president held an emergency meeting with ministers and medical experts for the first time Wednesday to seek measures to contain the MERS virus that had killed two and infected 30 as of Wednesday afternoon. The president said she would form a task force team after the meeting to identify the starting point of the virus and the route of the infection. The government would disclose the findings to dissolve public fears, she said. Despite Cheong Wa Dae‘s efforts to curb the growing fears, grumbling that the nation’s top office has been sitting back and ignoring the severity of the situation has been escalating.Earlier in the day, both major political parties blasted authorities for failing to block the deadly virus in the early stages and causing public panic by lackadaisically handling the crisis.The main opposition party leader slammed the Health Ministry saying it has already lost public trust for its “incompetent response,” and also demanded Park’s office to directly take charge of the response measures. “The president should handle the matter herself and have Cheong Wa Dae take the role of a control tower,” said New Politics Alliance for Democracy chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in.He also urged the government to form a pan-governmental organization to effectively contain the virus and take necessary measures to reassure the public.NPAD floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul also attacked Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo, holding him responsible for worsening the situation. “The crisis appears to have worsened partly because the health minister and vice minister are not experts on medical and public health,” he said. “The government needs to take countermeasures by listening to health experts and organizations before it becomes too late.”The minister is a former scholar on pension systems. The opposition floor leader also claimed that the government is poorly handling the matter like it did with the sinking of the Sewol ferry that killed more than 300 passengers last year.“The government shows no willingness to take charge of the crisis like how it was with the Sewol crisis. It still looks confused,” he said, referring to vast criticism the government faced for failing to save most of the passengers with belated rescue operations.The ruling Saenuri Party also stepped up criticism of the government’s botched MERS response and urged the government to proclaim a state of emergency in order to take every possible measure to contain the virus.“The party, the government and the presidential office together need to declare a state of emergency over the MERS crisis and concentrate all efforts to resolve the matter,” said Saenuri floor leader Rep. Yoo Seung-min.He also demanded the government consider disclosing relevant information on the disease to dispel public anxiety on the virus. The Health Ministry has been rejecting calls to share the names of medical hospitals where confirmed MERS patients either stayed or visited, despite strong public demand. The ministry said it would, instead, start releasing the list of all suspected and confirmed patients only to hospitals and health care workers in the country on Wednesday. Rumors have been swirling on social media in South Korea that the authorities have already failed to place a number of patients suspected of the disease under quarantine, allowing them to move around the country. Hundreds of schools and kindergartens across the country have decided to suspend classes, many at the request of parents concerned about the health of their children.The Health Ministry said Wednesday that more than 1,300 people are being monitored for possible infection.

The bill was endorsed early Friday in line with an ongoing debate over the government enforcement decree of the special Sewol bill that dictates the government’s investigation into the Sewol ferry sinking in April 2014.Cheong Wa Dae expressed objections to the bill, saying that the revision would violate the constitutional separation of powers among the legislative, executive and judiciary branches.“(The bill) would paralyze the executive branch’s work,” said Kim Sung-woo, senior presidential secretary of public affairs. “The revised bill allows the legislature to control the government’s enforcement decree, which resides in the executive branch’s own authority,” said Kim.The revision has been a sticking point during last-minute negotiations between the rival parties as the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy held up endorsements of other bills, including the civil pension reform, unless the ruling Saenuri Party agreed to the fortified legislative control of the government decrees.The decree on the Sewol probe announced on May 11, allows the government to name key members of the probe panel to investigate the cause of the Sewol sinking. The opposition and some families of the Sewol victims have claimed that the decree would enable the government to meddle in the investigation by placing public officials in the probe’s executive positions. Meanwhile, the lawmakers downplayed the government’s concerns. “I can’t grasp exactly which part (of the amendment) would violate the separation of powers,” said Yoo Seung-min, the floor leader of the ruling Saenuri Party, on Friday. NPAD floor leader Lee Jong-kul hailed the revision, saying that it will be a “prime opportunity” to bring back the balance of power between the executive and the legislature. Yoon Pyeong-joong, a professor at Hanshin University said that the government’s concern about separation of powers was “not convincing,” because it has exercised more power than other branches under Korea’s long-held presidential system.

The passage of the antismoking bill came after 11 attempts dating back to 2002. It requires image and word warnings on cigarette packs.The amendment to the National Health Promotion Act, aimed at deterring Koreans from smoking by highlighting its dangers, mandates that pictorial warning labels cover more than half of the cigarette packs, with the image making up at least 30 percent of the packaging.Violators of the law will face up to a year in jail or up to 10 million won ($9,000) in fines, or revocation of the company’s business license.The bill will take effect next December after an 18-month grace period.However, an unclear clause in the new plan, which stipulates that the images on cigarette packs must not be “excessively” repulsive, will likely spark controversy between the authorities and tobacco industry.Korea continues to show a high smoking rate, particularly among men, of which 37.6 percent smoke, according to the latest Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development health data. It is the second-highest of the OECD countries, following Greece.As part of the antismoking campaign, the government raised tobacco prices by 2,000 won per pack in January. The health authorities further plan to revise the Tobacco Business Act to ban convenience stores from advertising cigarettes and to designate indoor sports facilities as non-smoking areas in a bid to lower the men’s smoking rate to 29 percent, the average level for men among OECD countries, by 2020.

More than 20 USFK research personnel were exposed to it, but they were not infected, USFK officials said, adding they were not aware that the sample contained live bacteria.The group also called on the U.S. and South Korea to improve what it calls the “unreasonable” status of forces agreement that governs the stationing of U.S. forces in Korea. It argued that the SOFA should make it necessary for Washington to consult with Seoul on shipments of dangerous biological and chemical materials.Media reports surfaced Friday alleging that the USFK has run a laboratory using anthrax since 1998, amid growing public criticism of its alleged failure to consult with Seoul over its handling of the lethal pathogen.The USFK said that it was in the process of verifying when the lab was established.The U.S. was reported to have installed its first lab at a USFK installation, mindful of North Korea’s longtime pursuit of chemical and biological weapons, before building labs in overseas locations. The North began research biological weapons in the early 1960s. It is thought to be capable of producing massive amounts of anthrax bacteria ― a reason why the USFK has given its troops vaccinations against anthrax since 1998.The South Korean military currently stocks antibiotics against anthrax, and plans to develop an anthrax vaccine by 2016.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","demand apology for anthrax ,bacteria to forces korea ,civic groups demand apology ,in downtown seoul stressing ,shipment of live anthrax","['U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'Green Korea', 'Catholic Human Rights Committee', 'Seoul']",14,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.24513777  0.24560539

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Saturday urged Southeast Asian nations to deal with the causes behind a growing humanitarian crisis that has forced thousands of people from Myanmar and Bangladesh to flee by sea, leaving many still stranded in boats.  Rohingya migrants sit inside their temporary shelter in Bayeun, Aceh province, Indonesia, Sunday, May 24, 2015. Thousands of migrants - about half of them Bangladeshi and the others minority Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar - have landed ashore in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand since May 10. Thousands more are believed to be trapped at sea, and the United Nations has warned that time is running out. (AP-Yonhap)Ban said he has been discussing the emergency with regional leaders in Myanmar, Malaysia and Thailand, among others, and urged them to provide search and rescue operations and options for resettlement and reintegration.""It's important to save human lives,'' Ban said on a visit to Hanoi, Vietnam. But he also said it was important not to send the migrants back to dangerous situations in their home countries.More than 3,600 people -- about half of them from Bangladesh and the others minority Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar -- have landed ashore in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand since May 10. Thousands more are believed to be trapped at sea, and the United Nations has warned that time is running out.Four Malaysian navy ships began searching for boats Friday, according to navy chief Abdul Aziz Jaafar, who said three helicopters and three other ships were on standby. The Malaysian search is a positive step, but the operation is limited to Malaysia's territorial waters.A spokesman for the U.S. Pentagon said Thursday that Washington was readying air patrols to aid in the search. A U.S. Embassy spokeswoman in Bangkok, Melissa Sweeney, told The Associated Press in an email Saturday that the offer of assistance was still awaiting clearance.""We're actively engaging with the governments of the region to obtain their support and permissions for staging these flights,'' she said.Last week, Malaysia and Indonesia announced they would provide temporary shelter to the migrants for up to one year, and the U.S. has said it will settle some of them permanently.Speaking Friday in Myanmar, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said the Rohingya fleeing the predominantly Buddhist nation were risking perilous journeys and putting their lives in the hands of human traffickers because ``they are in despair and don't see a future'' at home.The Rohingya, numbering around 1.3 million, have been identified by the United Nations as one of the most persecuted minorities in the world. They have been denied citizenship and chased off their land in the latest bout of ethnic violence that left them with little access to education, medical care or freedom to move around.After Myanmar took steps to transition from dictatorship to democracy in 2011, newfound freedoms of expression gave voice to Buddhist extremists who spewed hatred against the religious minority and said Muslims were taking over the country. Attacks that followed left hundreds dead. Another 140,000 Rohingya were driven from their homes and are now living under apartheid-like conditions in crowded displacement camps.Myanmar's government says the Rohingya are illegal migrants from Bangladesh, even though most have lived in Myanmar for generations. Bangladesh also does not recognize them as citizens. Blinken said Myanmar needs to shoulder some responsibility for the crisis. ""The root of the problem for those leaving Myanmar is the political and social situation on the ground,'' he told reporters in Yangon.He said Rohingya Muslims ""should have a path to citizenship.'' He added, ""The uncertainty that comes from not having any status is one of the things that may drive people to leave.""Blinken said he made that point when he met with Myanmar President Thein Sein, the army commander-in-chief and other top officials.The persecution of the Rohingya has sent more than 100,000 fleeing to neighboring Southeast Asian countries. But in recent weeks, the exodus has erupted into a humanitarian crisis. Because of arrests after a crackdown on human trafficking networks in the region, captains earlier this month started abandoning boats that were packed with Rohingya as well as Bangladeshis escaping poverty.Myanmar's navy found two fishing trawlers filled with 208 men during a patrol off Rakhine state, the main point of departure for fleeing Rohingya.Zaw Htay, director of the presidential office, said the men were identified as Bangladeshi and would be sent to the neighboring country.After initially saying it might boycott a meeting next Friday in Thailand to address the problem, Myanmar agreed to attend, saying the invitation letter did not use the term Rohingya and did not say that Myanmar was solely to blame.""We are ready to cooperate with other governments to resolve the ongoing problems through constructive engagement and on humanitarian grounds,'' Zaw Htay said.","2015 thousands of migrants ,boats rohingya migrants sit ,saturday urged southeast asian ,boats rohingya migrants ,moon says save migrants","['YANGON', 'Myanmar', 'AP', 'U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'southeast asian', 'Myanmar', 'Bangladesh', 'Rohingya', 'Bayeun', 'Aceh province', 'Indonesia']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51215321  0.20397857

""We were able to be citizens' diplomats.""She voiced hope that their move could become the beginning of contacts across the ""artificial barrier"" to promote peace and understanding between the two Koreas.The group arrived in Pyongyang on Tuesday to meet with North Korean women to deliver their message and marched down to the South via the western corridor along the Gyeongui railway.Originally, they planned to walk through the truce village of Panmunjom, which sits in the middle of the DMZ. But they had to change plans by accepting Seoul's recommendation to march through the western land route.The truce village sits in the middle of the DMZ, which is guarded by stone-faced soldiers on each side of the military demarcation line. Passing through the truce village is a violation of the truce treaty, according to the United Nations Command.""We've come here to (help) end war. I think that it is the first step in a right direction,"" said Leymah Gbowee, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2011 for her role in leading a Liberian women's movement that helped bring an end to her country's brutal civil war.She said the activists feel ""privileged"" to be able to come across the DMZ, but they also feel sad as there are so many families separated by the Korean War.The activists said that the purpose of the DMZ crossing is to express hope that Korean families separated by the Korean War will be united someday and military tensions between the two sides can be reduced. But some critics claimed that the event would not help resolve North Korea's nuclear weapons program and human rights violation.The peace march also met with criticism here as anti-Pyongyang activists claimed that the female activists have pro-Pyongyang stances, citing a report by the North's media. A group of conservative activists held a rally in front of Imjingak, a park near the border to protest against them.North Korea's Rodong Sinmun, the communist party's official newspaper, reported last week that they ""praised"" the North's late founder Kim Il-sung at his birthplace.

Moon, however, did not elaborate on whether or not he would retain his post. “Without pointing fingers, we will look back on our deficiency and start afresh with a do-or-die resolution,” Moon said.  Moon Jae-in, the leader of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, attends a party meeting in the National Assembly in Seoul on Thursday. (Yonhap)Moon also urged the party members to stick together as it faces a long-term process of reform.“Taking this as medication, we will reform and integrate the party in a longer-term perspective.”The remark came amid mounting demands for the opposition leader to take responsibility for the defeats and set a new direction for the party’s agenda. Despite Moon’s determination to start afresh, the opposition party is widely expected to be forced to reform ahead of the general elections in April next year. Later in the afternoon, Moon met Ahn Cheol-soo, former party chairman and presidential candidate, at a closed-door meeting to discuss ways to save the troubled party and reunite its members divided over the defeats. During the meeting, Ahn suggested to Moon that they nominate a single candidate for the NPAD’s new floor leader to replace Woo Yoon-keun, as he feared voting may deepen the factional feuds.An interparty feud is likely to intensify between loyalists of former presidents Roh Moo-hyun and Kim Dae-jung as they are expected to clash over control. Moon was one of Roh’s closest allies and the central figure in the pro-Roh faction. But the defeats in the by-election are expected to weaken his leadership in the party and provide a reason for another faction in the party, namely the “DJ line” or the “Dongkyodong faction,” to demand reform.Particularly, the surprising victory of a party defector in the NPAD’s stronghold of Gwangju is expected to boost efforts to create a new opposition bloc. Kim Tae-ho (front), a Supreme Council member of the ruling Saenuri Party, carries party leader Kim Moo-sung on his back during a party meeting in the National Assembly in Seoul on Thursday. (Yonhap)Chun Jung-bae won in the by-election held in Gwangju as an independent candidate after defecting from the NPAD. He said he would gather forces in the Honam, the nation’s southwestern region, and produce new and talented politicians who could inherit the legacy of former President Kim Dae-jung. With his victory, pundits said Chun would start to create his own party with the support from the region before the general election next year. Chun’s move is expected to deal a blow to the NPAD, they added.The ruling Saenuri Party, on the other hand, stepped up efforts to push ahead with its reform drive on labor and the public sector, boosted by its victory in the by-elections on Wednesday. The party took three of four seats up for grabs despite a high-profile corruption scandal involving top government and party officials.Cheong Wa Dae also welcomed the outcome of the election and said it would take it as a message by the people to go ahead with the reform drive.“The latest decision by the people may mean a stern order to end political strife to reenergize the economy and to reform politics,” presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook said.The ruling party is likely to press the opposition party over a reform measure on the public servants’ pension system as the deadline nears. The rival parties have agreed to end the discussion on the reform measure by May 2.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","after election rout korea ,crisis after election rout ,democracy apologized thursday for ,election rout korea main ,the party crushing defea","['Korea', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.78163618  0.27074477

The Korean Confederation of Trade Union, one of two major labor groups, staged massive sit-in protests in Seoul and other areas. Organizers claimed about 260,000 workers participated in the strike. At Seoul Plaza, about 8,000 protestors gathered to stage protests. They urged the government to stop labor reform policies, scrap its controversial pension reform plan and raise the minimum wage to 10,000 won ($9.20) per hour.  Thousands of union workers hold a massive sit-in protest at Seoul Plaza on Friday. (Yonhap)The police said it dispatched about 9,500 officers to prevent potential violent clashes. “The rally is inevitable if the government tries to push for labor reform policies and pension reform,” said the KCTU in a statement. “We also demand a raise to the minimum wage.” The government vowed to take stern action as members of the left-leaning teachers group and unionized civil servants were participating in the protests across the country.Ministers released a joint statement Thursday and warned that public officials who attended the protests would face severe punishment. By law, public officials are banned from taking part in collective action. The ministry said it could also press criminal charges against those who orchestrated the protests. The Education Ministry also threatened that teachers would face punishment if they attended the rally, stressing their participation would disrupt classes.Concerns were raised for possible disruption in public offices and schools as teachers and civil servants said they would collectively take paid leave to attend the strike. No major disruption was reported, as some teachers canceled their plans to participate in the rallies or joined the protests after classes, due to fear from the authorities’ warning.

The Korea Teachers and Education Workers’ Union, or KTU, announced that up to 10,000 of its 53,000 members are expected to take part in the rally and strike, led by the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions. Teachers will take a leave of absence prior to the event in order to minimize setbacks in school lesson plans, the KTU said. Topping the agenda for the KCTU’s general strike are demanding the government to scrap its controversial pension reform plan for public officials, and raising the minimum wage to 10,000 won ($9.20) per hour. The KTU will hold a rally at Seoul Plaza in the afternoon and join the KCTU’s movement in which an estimated 200,000 workers and civil servants are expected to join from across the country. On Saturday, teachers will take part in nationwide protests against the civil servants pension reform.In a meeting of the nation’s vice superintendents, the Education Ministry warned the KTU not to push ahead with its plans.Korean law stipulates that public officials should not take collective action unrelated to their duties and prohibits education workers from partaking in illegal disputes. “Schools must uphold laws in all cases, and teaching and learning should be protected at all times. These must not be infringed by illegal acts of some organizations,” said Vice Education Minister Kim Jae-choon at the meeting. “The ministry condones legal activities by teacher unions, but will sternly deal with illegal actions that infringe upon students’ rights to learn and sparks confusion within education circles.”A ministry official said if the KTU carries out its plans, the ministry would file charges against all participants and demand local education offices conduct disciplinary action. The government Thursday released a joint statement criticizing “illegal action by public officials.”“We are in a critical moment where we have to focus our nation’s efforts on revitalizing the economy. It is regretful that some civil servants’ unions are pushing ahead with the strike, when most of the officials are fulfilling their duties,” it said. Despite the government’s disapproval, the KTU reiterated its decision to go ahead with the strike and rally. “Current law bans teachers from taking part in collective action. Without it, teachers only have limited options to express their opinions,” said the KTU. “The government is violating the human rights of teachers by banning us from rightfully taking a leave of absence to participate in a rally.”By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","rally friday to protest ,friday to protest against ,hold nationwide rally friday ,friday to protest ,government on thursday threatened",[],14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5524078   0.05121446

The government is committed to pushing forward key reforms in the labor market aimed at helping young people find work, resolving uncertainties surrounding standard wages and reducing overall working hours, he said.Extending the country's retirement age will be linked to the introduction of a wage peak system that can be a win-win arrangement for both older and younger generations, Choi added.""The goal is to pass labor-related bills through parliament this month,"" Choi said. ""Timing is extremely important. Further delays will adversely affect expectations for an economic recovery.""If labor unions want to do the right thing and tackle critical issues such as youth unemployment, they should try to engage in constructive dialogue, he said.Earlier this week, the labor ministry made clear that staging a strike over government policies or future legislative action is not allowed under the country's labor law.The KCTU insists that the government is trying to implement changes that will worsen labor market conditions and hurt the livelihoods of ordinary citizens.The upcoming strike aims to halt the government's push, the labor union said, adding that it will use the walkout to compel the government to raise minimum pay to 10,000 won ($9.20) per hour and compel it to respect basic labor rights.The KCTU said some 70 percent of its members will join the one-day walkout, with teachers, government employees, metal and construction workers as well as those in the clerical and service sectors to participate.

A total of about 10,000 people protested at Gwanghwamun Square, a place where demonstrations have been taking place on-and-off since the ferry sinking. They clashed with the police as they were attempting to march toward Cheong Wa Dae.  Supporters of the victims of the Sewol ferry sinking clash with police on Saturday as they march toward Gwanghwamun Square in Seoul. (Yonhap)The police used water cannons and pepper spray to push the protesters away from the police line. In response, some protestors damaged police buses and tore away police protective gear. A total of 100 protestors were taken into custody for police investigation.Police said Sunday 74 of its men were injured. Reports said nine of the bereaved families and activists were hurt during the clash.The police came under fire for infringing upon the right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. Amnesty International called the police action an “unnecessary use of force” and that it constituted “an insult to the victims and a violation of the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly,” in a press release on Friday. “The clampdown against an overwhelming peaceful protest is totally unjustified, unnecessary and an insult to both the victims of the Sewol ferry tragedy and their families,” said Arnold Fang, East Asia Researcher at Amnesty International.The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy jumped into the criticism, comparing the police’s decision to take 100 protestors into custody to actions taken during the authoritarian military regime in South Korea in the 1970s.“We are frustrated with the demise of civil rights and democratic values in Korea. We urge the police to release those taken into custody, including relatives of the victims of the ferry sinking and average citizens,” said NPAD Spokesperson Kim Sung-soo.Police held a press briefing on Sunday and said all those who violated the law will be punished.For this, they will set up an investigative headquarters at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency and create special teams for the probe at 15 other district police agencies.“A number of officers were hurt while police equipment and buses were damaged,” the police said, adding that they would seek compensation from the rally’s organizer.The Sewol ferry sank on April 16, 2014, leaving 295 dead and nine missing. Since then, families of the victims have been criticizing the government for mishandling the tragedy and calling for a thorough investigation into the causes of the incident.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","police condemned the protest ,blame game weekend demonstration ,weekend demonstration to mourn ,sewol ferry sinking culminated ,the confrontation on saturday","['Amnesty International', 'Se']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.14981185  0.31789914

I hope that you will join that effort,” added Kim, who is a former professor at the Communist College in the North. Kim defected to the South in 2004.Touching on the North’s cyber capabilities, Kim highlighted the role of Bureau 121, a key unit that he said consisted of “gifted” cyber-warriors in their 20s. The unit is conducting a campaign, dubbed the “Plan to Investigate International Natural Energies,” in which the North conducts hacking missions to steal technological information from the U.S., Britain, France, China and Russia.

YonhapIn doing so, the vice principal is said to have used coarse words ranging from “stop eating” to “beat it.”He is also said to have checked each student’s name from a list and told them how much they owed in meal fees in front of other students. With the incident receiving extensive media coverage, and going viral on the Internet, the school’s principal issued an official statement through the school’s home page on Tuesday.In the statement, principal Bang Sang-kuk said that the vice principal denies using coarse language, but that he would take “appropriate action” if related reports prove to be true. The vice principal also posted a statement saying that he could not help but check the list as the school is weighed down with snowballing late payments. According to the statement, about 6 million won ($5,500) of meal fees was unpaid in March, and that those who graduated earlier this year left nearly 40 million won in unpaid meal fees. While the school denies it, the development comes as the row over free school meals reignited in the political arena. South Gyeongsang Province Governor Hong Joon-pyo’s push to end free school meals has incited strong opposition from parents and progressive politicians including Rep. Moon Jae-in, chairman of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy.

(Yonhap)A foreign language high school specializes in foreign language education. They are widely considered as elite as only students with top grades are granted admission.According to the committee, Seoul Foreign Language High School has been among the top in terms of the number of graduates that were accepted at colleges and universities. They demanded that the SMOE should unveil the evaluation scores. But an SMOE official said the Seoul Foreign Language High School generally received low scores and refused to disclose the actual numbers, stating that the hearing has not yet taken place. Jo said the committee plans to hold protests about the “unjust selection” by the SMOE every day until the hearing next Tuesday, when both schools will submit their explanations.As of Monday, Younghoon International School did not reveal plans to hold protests. However, it faces a much more daunting battle protecting its status, as a recent admission fraud has already placed it in the firing line. Last year, an appellate court also confirmed a prison term for a former Younghoon chief for a series of irregularities related to admission processes. The school claimed to have successfully rooted out corruption and vowed to fight to retain its status at the hearing.Korean law stipulates that any school that has been found guilty of grade tampering or admission or accounting fraud can have their status stripped by local education authorities. An SMOE official said schools can receive an extension or extra credit on their assessment if they provide a sufficient explanation and plans for improvement at the hearing. If the education office decides to cancel their designation, it must lodge a request for the Education Ministry’s approval ― which is mandated under the recently-revised ordinance on the operations of specialized schools ― within 20 days of the hearing. The government then has 50 days to reach a decision, although it can choose to delay its decision for two months.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","protest monday denouncing seoul ,school protests status downgrade ,school held protest monday ,monday denouncing seoul education ,protests status downgrade parents","['Seoul', 'the Seoul Education Office of Education', 'Seoul']",14,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.1620893   0.13076837

Moon Jae-in upped the ante against his rival party Monday, saying he would attend the hearing for an investigation into an overseas resource development project, and demanded former president Lee Myung-bak join him. “The Saenuri Party insisted that the former president Lee would attend the hearing as long as I joined him. Fair enough. I will attend the hearing, and you should join me,” said Moon from the New Politics Alliance for Democracy. The ruling party, however, rejected the demand. “It is nothing but an attempt to play politics,” said Rep. Kim Mu-sung, leader of the ruling Saenuri Party. “If the allegation proves to be true, then he (former president) should attend the hearing. So far, no allegation has been proven. I can only imagine that they (opposition party) don’t want to continue the committee anymore,” said Kim.Moon’s remarks come amid a political tug-of-war surrounding the investigation into an overseas resource development project, otherwise known as “energy diplomacy,” which has been under fire for causing massive losses and wasting taxpayer’s money. Last December, the National Assembly set up a committee to investigate if there were any wrongdoings in the project. The two major parties, however, have been at odds over how to run the committee, particularly regarding a hearing for key players, including former President Lee.The opposition party has constantly demanded the former president should attend the hearing, saying he has been in charge of the project from the beginning. The party has also asked other key aides to Lee to attend. It urged the committee to extend its service beyond the expiration date of April 7, noting the failure to find anything until now. “President Lee spearheaded the energy development project. I think he has an obligation to answer the allegations. I urge him to come out and face the truth,” said Moon. “I also want to hear the response of chairman Kim, the leader of ruling Saenuri Party, to my request,” Moon added. As for the extension of the committee’s operation date, the ruling party left it open for discussion. “The party will discuss the matter with the committee’s members,” said Rep. Yoo Seung-min Saenuri Party Floor Leader. The project has been the most talked-about political scandal in Korea. It has cost 31.4 trillion won ($28 billion) in taxpayer’s money, according to Board of Audit and Inspection of Korea.

He noted, however, that what is important is for the Japanese government to ""seriously think about ways and make efforts to overcome the past (and move) toward future-oriented bilateral ties.""  In 2011, only 4 out of 18 total textbooks contained Tokyo's claim that South Korea is illegally occupying Dokdo, where a small dispatch of Seoul's police are stationed as a token of its ownership.  This year, the number jumped to 13, representing the Abe administration's attempt to bolster its efforts to lay claim to Dokdo.  South Korean Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo condemned Japan's move as regretful.  ""Japan can't deny or hide the past history for long,"" Lee told reporters at a luncheon.  Japan's move, which South Korean officials describe as a provocation, apparently undermined efforts to improve relations between the neighboring nations. Seoul-Tokyo ties have long been strained despite brisk economic and cultural exchanges due to long-standing stand-offs over territory and shared history.  It's a legacy of Japan's brutal colonial rule of Korea from 1910-45. South Koreans believe Japan has never offered a sincere apology for its wartime atrocities.  Continued disputes between Seoul and Tokyo are a major stumbling block to Washington's push for closer trilateral cooperation in regional security amid growing military threats from Pyongyang.  Amid persisting tension, Japan's Kyodo news agency cited diplomatic sources as saying on Monday that the two countries will hold their first security dialogue in more than five years next Tuesday.  The dialogue, involving senior foreign affairs and defense officials from both sides, was launched in 1998 to discuss each other's defense policies and North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. It has been suspended since the last session in December 2009 due to disputes over shared history.  Asked to verify the report, Noh said the two sides have yet to agree on a specific date, although talks have been under way.

They demanded the government rewrite the mandate on investigating the cause and measures related to the disaster. (Yonhap)Families of some of those killed in the Sewol ferry disaster last year repeated their calls Sunday for the government to repeal a mandate authorizing a probe into the disaster’s causes.The families claim the probe is likely to be controlled by officials who want to cover up the accident, as the mandate allows members of the Oceans Ministry and the Coast Guard ― two institutions blamed for botching rescue operations ― to sit on the investigation committee’s decision-making board.More than 300 of the 476 passengers aboard the Sewol drowned when the 6,825-ton passenger ferry sank in the West Sea in April 2014.Lee Seok-tae, chief of the investigation committee, expressed hope that the government would agree to exclude its representatives from the investigation’s board.Family members of those killed in last year’s Sewol ferry disaster march from the group memorial alter set up in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province, on Saturday. They plan to march to downtown Seoul in protest of the mandate on investigating the cause and measures related to the disaster. (Yonhap)“I am optimistic that the government will repeal the mandate,” Lee said Friday at Gwanghwamun Square in Seoul where some of the bereaved families have been camping in protest of the government’s allegedly lackluster effort to investigate the disaster.“It is clear to anyone who read the mandate that independent inquiries into the accident are impossible,” Lee said.The mandate will take effect midnight Tuesday, if not repealed. It authorizes the Oceans Ministry to dispatch its officials to the investigation committee’s strategy division. They will have the power to audit investigators’ budgets and report the committee’s activities to the government. Critics, including lawmakers in the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, the minor opposition Justice Party, have also denounced the downsizing of the committee’s membership from 120 to 90. Of the 90 members, 43 will be nongovernment officials. Critics argue that the mandate is a culmination of the government’s efforts to mute the probe.Two previous investigations into the Sewol disaster prompted further controversy as some of the family members claimed all those responsible for the accident have not been punished. Parliamentary probes were conducted in June last year, but left more questions than answers, some families said.Prosecutorial investigations resulted in the imprisonment of the ferry’s crew members, who abandoned the sinking Sewol after telling passengers to stay in their cabins during the accident. Lee Jun-seok, the Sewol’s captain, was sentenced to 36 years in November 2014.Prosecutors imprisoned maritime regulators accused of condoning safety violations and receiving kickbacks, including a Coast Guard official who was imprisoned. The official failed to tell passengers to evacuate during the accident, even though he had access to loudspeakers on his ship, judges said.The Sewol investigation has been a hotbed of political debate, as some opposition lawmakers have been criticized for publicizing a series of allegations against government bodies, including the presidential office last year.Progressives, on the other hand, criticized the conservatives for depicting their move as “politically motivated,” which they claimed was an attempt to cover up the fundamental cause of the tragedy.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","rally in seoul sunday ,ferry disaster hold rally ,hold rally in seoul ,families urge mandate repeal ,seoul sunday they demanded",['Seoul'],14,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.31965765  0.1130174

Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights plans to open a field structure in Seoul in the coming months to monitor and study the situation across the border. This is in line with a recommendation in February 2014 by the Commission of Inquiry. “We will never accept the rash acts by the (South Korean) puppet forces, who are devoured by the delusion of a unification (by absorption) and make stern responses,” Rodong Sinmun said. “Our warning against the U.N. office was never meant to be empty talk,” the paper stated, referring to a statement released Monday by the North’s Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea, which is in charge of cross-border affairs, that it will not “sit idle.” The North said if the U.N. office was established, it would be the “very first target of our merciless punishment.” The paper also accused Seoul of consistently conspiring to topple the regime, citing Pyongyang’s recent detainment of two South Koreans which it claims are spies. “The (South Korean) puppet forces are speaking of trust and dialogue in words, while colluding with the U.S. to frantically press ahead with joint military exercises aimed at invading the North and further intensifying mistrust and confrontation between the North and South through a human rights-themed plot,” the paper said. “As the puppets are fueling fratricidal confrontation, we have already clearly made sure that the chances are gone for inter-Korean dialogue and improvement for the relationship, and what’s left is confrontation by force.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","workers party denounced seoul ,party denounced seoul support ,party denounced seoul ,denounced seoul support for ,denounced seoul support","['North Korea', 'U.N.', 'Seoul', 'North Korea ’s', 'Pyongyang', 'Workers ’ Party', 'Seoul', 'U.N.', 'north korean']",14,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.54389805  0.03786872

Activists hold a rally against the investigative authority's raids on offices of some civic groups, which distributed handouts criticizing the Park Geun-hye administration, in front of the Jeonbuk District Police Agency in Jeonju, North Jeolla Province on Mar. 17. (Yonhap)Park said the on-the-spot inspections and raids would eventually have a “chilling effect” on the whole of society, as they discouraged citizens from publicly expressing their political views in a free manner.“It could also bring a loss of national prestige on the international stage, while Korea’s Constitution stipulates the freedom of expression of any individual,” he said.Asked about the tolerance band, he cited the case of the United States, whose administration generally tolerates expression as long as it is not believed to pose a “clear and present danger” to the nation or social security.“Korea’s case is irrelevant to public danger. It is just focused on the president’s honor (as to whether or not citizens defamed the president).”Korea has seen its global assessment in the freedom of expression continue to fall over the past few years. The country’s rankings in media and Internet freedom have been demoted by the United Nations and the nongovernmental organization Freedom House.France-based watchdog Reporters Without Borders, which ranked Korea at 31st in the media sector in 2006, lowered it to 50th in 2012 and 60th among 180 countries in 2015.According to Transparency International, Korea ranks 46th among 177 countries in the Corruption Perceptions Index as of 2013. Korea scored 55 out of 100 ― it ranked 39th in 2010.The Korean unit of TI said that the drop because the worst performing Korean prosecutors were being assigned to corruption.On Feb. 25, Amnesty International said in its annual report that the second year of Park’s administration showed a regressive trend in the realization of human rights, citing various concerns, such as barriers to the freedom of assembly and expression, as well as the government’s increasing restriction on the freedom of expression by using the National Security Law to intimidate and imprison people.Amnesty International took issue with the anti-North Korean National Security Law, which bans any activities that support or promote North Korea’s political ideas.Following the authorities’ investigation into the activists, NGOs claimed the government was applying a double standard in terms of the freedom of expression, saying that it has, in contrast, taken a lukewarm stance toward conservative groups distributing anti-North Korea leaflets across the border.Police have taken a back seat over the launches of balloons loaded with anti-Pyongyang leaflets, citing freedom of expression, despite concerns from neighboring residents upon North Korea’s retaliation threats.“In contrast, police hampered our move to fly handouts in yellow balloons (in October) demanding an inquiry into the president regarding the Sewol ferry sinking disaster,” said a spokesperson for the civic group Democratic Rights Solidarity.Police reportedly warned that the balloons could be a threat to passersby in the streets in terms of safety as the bundles of yellow balloons were again wrapped carried in bigger stick-type transparent balloons. Professor Park argued that, in that case, the sending of leaflets to the North should be a bigger priority for a crackdown, as residents in the inter-Korean border districts fear that the propaganda balloons could spark provocations by the North.Moves condemning the government continue to escalate.An activist group at Korea University on March 18 urged for an immediate halt to a police investigation into the distribution of leaflets criticizing the president, saying it held back freedom of expression.In a statement they criticized the police searching Byun’s home and his wife’s office. “It is trampling on the freedom and rights of the people by probing someone for handing out leaflets that mention the president’s past ... police should stick to their duty of protecting people’s freedom and rights,” the statement said.In the last three months of 2014, the criminal investigative authority stepped back from its earlier plan to carry out real-time monitoring of postings and messages of smartphone users amid a severe backlash from the public.After being severely denounced over the past few days for its move to conduct alleged surveillance of ordinary mobile users, the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office said it decided to drop the plan.There has also been recent debate over reports that the National Election Commission is considering revising the elections law to slap a penalty of up to 2 million won on those who post or spread comments online and offline that aggravate regionalism, especially during an election period.Although the move was aimed to tackle out-of-control Internet arguments between politically hostile regions, the idea was also criticized for potentially damaging freedom of expression.The issue of freedom of expression has also spread overseas, with the Japanese government stating on March 25 that it has brought up the matter of a Sankei Shimbun journalist being tried in South Korea on charges of defaming Park at the United Nations Human Rights Council. The Japanese government has been claiming Tatsuya Kato, former head of Sankei Shimbun’s Seoul bureau, should not be “arbitrarily” punished for the “freedom of press that is the basis of democracy.”Kato has been undergoing trial since October last year after his article in August delved into the whereabouts of Park during the April 11 Sewol ferry sinking tragedy.

The people will lead it. If they think arresting the leaders will stop it, they are wrong,"" said Tian Chua, vice president of Anwar's People's Justice Party.Zainuddin Ahmad, a top Kuala Lumpur police official, said protesters would not be allowed to gather.""The street procession is banned. Police will not hesitate to take any action, including arrests, if people defy the ban or break any laws,"" he said.The United States has been among the international critics of Anwar's conviction and the crackdown on dissent, saying both raised questions over the rule of law in Malaysia.Anwar denies the charge that he sodomised a former male aide in 2008.He says it was fabricated by Malaysia's long-ruling government to halt a run of opposition electoral gains that have raised the spectre of the country's first regime change since independence in 1957.Facing ebbing voter support, Prime Minister Najib Razak promised in 2011 to end the authoritarian tactics of his ruling United Malays National Organisation (UMNO).But after that failed to win back voters in 2013 polls, his regime launched a tightening clampdown that has seen dozens of government opponents hauled for up sedition or other charges over the past year.Anwar's daughter Nurul Izzah, a member of parliament, is among several people arrested in recent weeks as anger over her father's jailing has spiked.Charged with sedition, she was released on March 17 after a night in jail.In a statement released Friday, Nurul, 34, said Malaysia was sliding toward becoming a ""police state"". Najib has defended the crackdown by saying dissent cannot be allowed to jeopardise stability.The three most recent arrests included Mohamad Sabu, deputy president of the opposition Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), who was detained early Saturday.Rafizi Ramli, a vice president of Anwar's party, and activist Hishammuddin Rais, a frequent government critic, were arrested Friday. Zainuddin, the police official, confirmed Rafizi's arrest but declined comment on the others.All three men remained in custody, the opposition said.On March 7, several thousand demonstrators had marched through Kuala Lumpur demanding Anwar's release and shouting ""Down with Najib"". No violence was reported.","saturday protest march demanding ,to thwart saturday protest ,thwart saturday protest march ,saturday protest march ,crackdown to thwart protest","['KUALA', 'AFP', 'malaysian', 'Anwar Ibrahim', 'Tian Chua', 'Kuala Lumpur']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26270661  0.09262715

Eight protesters also faced charges of interfering with public functions over the clash, a police officer said.""Ma Ying-jeou sells out Taiwan,"" one protester shouted in footage aired by local television.Ma's office issued a statement condemning violence. ""Taiwan is a society with the rule of law. Any political appeal should base on the rule of law and should not cross the boundary of peace,"" it said.The route was originally due to be launched on March 5, but was postponed due to those objections.China later slightly modified the M503 route but is pressing ahead with the launch.The other three routes have been indefinitely postponed, according to Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration.The government has said that negotiations with China over the routes will help safeguard the island's aviation security. It has also said that Chinese fighter jets would not use M503.China considers self-ruled Taiwan a part of its territory awaiting reunification, by force if necessary. They split in 1949 at the end of a civil war.Ties have improved markedly since Ma came to power in 2008 on a China-friendly platform, but some fear Taiwan is becoming over-dependent on the mainland.","taiwan arrests after protest ,latest protest against china ,police on saturday arrested ,protest over china flight ,saturday arrested 13 people","['TAIPEI', 'AFP', 'taiwanese', 'China', 'Taiwan Solidarity Union', 'Ma Ying - jeou', 'Taipei']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.2837657   0.26774538

Moon Jae-in visited a military unit near the border with North Korea on Wednesday, in an apparent bid to erase public perceptions of his party as being Pyongyang sympathizers.Wearing a marine’s uniform, complete with protective headgear and camouflage face paint, the New Politics Alliance for Democracy chairman visited the 2nd Marine Division as rival parties geared up for next month’s by-elections. Four districts, three of which had been held by a now-disbanded minor leftist party, will be contested in the April polls. New Politics Alliance for Democracy leader Rep. Moon Jae-in takes a ride on an amphibious armored vehicle during his visit to the 2nd Marine Division at Gimpo, Gyeonggi Province, Wednesday. (Yonhap)Moon timed his visit to the outpost to coincide with the eve of the fifth anniversary of the North’s 2010 sinking of the South Korean naval corvette Cheonan, an incident that the North has repeatedly denied culpability for.His visit also comes after his party reissued statements criticizing the North’s 2010 attack, seemingly to rebuke the ruling Saenuri Party’s attempt to hold the NPAD accountable for allegedly supporting pro-North forces. This comes in light of the attack on U.S. Ambassador to Seoul Mark Lippert earlier this month by a leftist extremist.“The Cheonan sinking was the result of a failed national security policy led by the Saenuri Party,” Moon said during his stop at the marine base near the West Sea.“Instead of using the incident to improve the nation’s defense posture, the Saenuri Party used it to frame others as pro-North figures.”Many voters view the NPAD as being too soft on Pyongyang. The party is also the political offspring of past administrations that gave millions in aid to the North, money that conservatives in the South suspect eventually helped the North pay for its nuclear program.With next month’s by-elections seen as an opportunity for Moon to prove his leadership and restore his party’s approval ratings, the NPAD has been intensifying moves to clean up its reputation.“Public opinion here has been conservative in terms of the nation’s North Korea policy, and liberal in terms of its domestic economic policies,” said Yun Seong-yi, professor of Korean politics at Kyung Hee University in Seoul.“The NPAD must pursue a centrist agenda on national security to increase its political support base.”But another expert asserted that whether the NPAD succeeded in rallying more voters to its cause would depend on something more than the party’s own efforts.“Political positioning is not accomplished by yourself,” said Choi Young-jin, professor of political thinking at Chung-Ang University in Seoul.“There must be other extremist parties on the spectrum for a party to be considered as a more moderate and centrist group.“There are far-left and far-right parties in Japan and Europe that allow moderate parties to successfully position themselves in the center during elections.”This means the NPAD needs the more left-leaning minor opposition Justice Party to expand its public standing and be considered a centrist political group, Choi said.The far-left Unified Progressive Party was dissolved late last year by the Constitutional Court, which cited risk to public security as it supported North Korean political philosophies.The NPAD’s efforts to boost its national security credentials also continued with its criticism of the Saenuri Party.The party released a statement Wednesday against Saenuri chair Rep. Kim Moo-sung for his comments Tuesday, which virtually admitted that the North was a nuclear state.Kim had cited the North’s three nuclear tests as grounds for it to be considered a nuclear power in a speech at Busan. Foreign policy experts have cautioned that such comments could support the North’s ambitions of gaining unofficial international approval for its nuclear program, overthrowing decades of efforts to denuclearize the hermit state.

But the U.S. has since neither confirmed nor denied its role in the North's Internet outages. The issue re-emerged last week as Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, told a cyber-security event in Washington that the North's Internet outage was retaliation for the Sony hack.The lawmaker was quoted as saying, ""There were some cyber responses to North Korea.""On Tuesday, the online news outlet Daily Beast cited unidentified sources with knowledge of the U.S. government cyber-operations against North as saying that the operations were ""designed to send a message that North Korean officials weren't beyond the reach of the American government.""The U.S. operations took place before the blackout, but the takedown itself was not the result of those operations, the sources were quoted as saying. The report also said independent hackers have claimed they are the ones that took the North offline.Former U.S. intelligence officials were also quoted as saying that the American government would hesitate to take down the North's entire network because it would cut intelligence agencies off from the cyber-spying they were doing inside North Korea.It also cited a senior U.S. intelligence official recently saying that spying on the North's networks was mainly to gather information about its nuclear weapons program and to get insights into its thinking. The National Security Agency considers North Korea a priority target and has a unit dedicated to covering it, former officials said. In an interview with Fox TV on Sunday, CIA Director John Brennan neither confirmed nor denied speculation that the U.S. was behind the North's Internet disruptions, only saying that the North's infrastructure is rickety and its Internet system has problems.

They will be rehomed in South Korea and the U.S. The activists aim to end dog eating in South Korea.But their actions renewed a decades-old debate involving activists who say dog-slaying in South Korea often involves inhumane practices, and dog consumption advocates who say the Koreans’ centuries-old tradition is no different from the killing of cows, pigs and hens.Thousands in South Korea eat millions of dogs each year. Accurate numbers are unavailable, however, due to the lack of government oversight. Unconfirmed tallies by dog meat lovers in 2012 put annual consumption at 2 million dogs.Numbers are unclear because the Livestock Products Sanitary Control Act, a law setting safety rules in the butchering of farm animals, does not label dogs as meat subject to sanitary rules, making government regulation over dog slaughterhouses a legal impossibility. Neither does it explicitly outlaw dog eating. Even when provincial laws ban dog eating, enforcement is lax. Dogs raised for their meat are known to be exposed to crowded habitation, confinement to iron cages until butchering, and slaughtering practices showing butchers killing dogs within sight of other soon-to-be-killed canines. Dogs are also rarely checked for human-transmittable diseases before distribution in meat markets.Animal rights activists cite these practices as grounds justifying the abolition of dog eating in South Korea.Dog meat advocates, however, say such a move is extreme.

Accurate numbers are unavailable, however, due to the lack of government oversight. Unconfirmed tallies by dog meatlovers in 2012 put annual consumption at 2 million dogs.  Signs showing dog restaurants in Seoul. The restaurants do not explicitly say they are selling dog meat. Jeong Hunny/The Korea HeraldNumbers are unclear because the Livestock Products Sanitary Control Act, a law setting safety rules in the butchering of farm animals, does not label dogs as meat subject to sanitary rules, making government regulation over dog slaughterhouses a legal impossibility. Neither does it explicitly outlaw dog eating. Even when provincial laws ban dog eating, enforcement is lax. Dogs raised for their meat are exposed to crowded habitation, confinement to iron cages until butchering, and slaughtering practices showing butchers killing dogs within sight of other soon-to-be killed canines. Dogs are also rarely checked for human-transmittable diseases before distribution in meat markets.Animal rights activists cite these practices as grounds justifying the abolition of dog eating in South Korea.Dog meat advocates, however, say such a move is extreme.

Mark Lippert sustained cuts to his face and wrist in a knife attack by a South Korean activist who voiced his opposition to joint military drills with the U.S. The exercises are part of Seoul and Washington's efforts to better deter threats from North Korea.A preliminary probe showed that the assailant, Kim Ki-jong, had been to North Korea seven times between 1999 and 2007. He also tried to erect an altar at the heart of Seoul in memory of late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il in December 2011 shortly after he died.""We defined this case as one carried out by pro-North forces and agreed to thoroughly determine the truth and who was behind it,"" Rep.

The ministry offers incentives to employees to recruit families to the child care program, according to a public document released last year. However, the ministry grants higher rewards for recruiting top-income families than for recruiting families from the lowest-income group -- the poorest and most in need of assistance, the official added.(Yonhap)“The ministry wants to promote the fact that many people are benefiting from the service, but they want to save as much money as much as possible,” said the official of the Precarious Workers’ Union in the Public Sector.“This is their way of increasing the number of subscribers while minimizing their support cost for the poor. The more top-earning families they recruit to the service, the more money the ministry saves.”  The total number of households that use the service, in which government-certified nannies come to the household to care for the children, nearly doubled from 27,400 in 2010 to 54,300 in 2014.In that period, the proportion of subscribers from the top income bracket increased from 26 percent to 38 percent, but figure from the lowest quartile dropped significantly from 54 percent to 41 percent. The ministry subsidizes the child care service for the bottom three income brackets by 1,250 won to 4,500 won an hour, while the top-earning quartile -- households earning 4.83 million won or more per month -- pays the full price of 6,000 won an hour for the service.Households with three or more children, households with a person with disabilities, and single-parent households are prioritized for government subsidies.The ministry, for its part, said the service was becoming more popular among top-earning families because more people learned that they could use the service as long as they paid the full price themselves. “Many used to think you could use the service only if you were eligible for the government support,” said Song Young-gwang, who oversees the child support programs.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","pushing to recruit families ,the gender equality ministry ,child care policy turns ,to recruit families ,union for recruiters",['the Gender Equality Ministry'],14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27632603  0.26426631

The North has so far neither accepted nor rejected the proposal Seoul issued in late December.  ""Spreading (of leaflets) is in the sphere of the right to free expression per se, but it is not proper to do it openly and as if to show off,"" Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo said in an interpellation session.   The government is ""taking this issue seriously,"" Lee said, adding that he will come up with ways to address the issue.  Opposition lawmakers and residents of the border towns where the campaigns are launched have strongly called on the government to stop the leaflet scattering, citing the safety and military risks it could bring.   The government has, however, been inactive in taking action against the campaigns, repeating its stance that basically it is something that the civic sector should decide for themselves.  Earlier in the session, the new prime minister also vowed his utmost efforts in pursuing his duty as the country's second-highest official. It was Lee's first appearance in an interpellation session since being sworn into office earlier in the month.  ""I am feeling a heavy sense of duty and responsibility,"" the prime minister said in his opening remarks.  ""Above all, I will put all of my efforts in reforming every sector and the top priority will be put on reviving the economy,"" Lee said, also vowing smoother communication with citizens.

A Japanese vice-minister-level official was sent to this year's ceremony, prompting a strong protest from South Korea.   The prefecture has held the event on Feb. 22 since 2005, and Takeshima is the Japanese name of the rocky islets located in the East Sea.  Hundreds of members of local civic organizations gathered in front of the Japanese Embassy in downtown Seoul on Monday, followed by a press conference to denounce Tokyo's repeated territorial claims.  ""The Japanese government should annul the designation of Takeshima Day,"" said the Dokdo Network, as the members chanted slogans like, ""Stop distorting history.""  Holding a banner reading, ""Takeshima Out,"" they also called for Japan to stop attempts to distort history and make an apology.  Protesters also called for Japan to take responsibility for its past wrongdoing and urged Japanese politicians to stop paying visits to the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, which honors millions of Japanese who died for the country, including 14 Class-A war criminals from World War II.  The rocky outcroppings, which lie closer to South Korea than Japan in waters between the neighbors, have been a nagging source of diplomatic feud between them.  South Korea has rejected Japan's claim to Dokdo since the country regained its independence from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule and reclaimed sovereignty over its territories, including Dokdo.

In the Philippines, 10 South Koreans were killed last year while 13 were murdered there in 2013. Four Korean drug dealers were executed in China last year alone.There are also growing concerns that South Korean citizens are not safe from possible attacks by terrorists following the recent purported killing of two Japanese hostages by the Islamic State.Seoul has imposed travel bans on six countries ― Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Afghanistan and Yemen. More than 1,000 South Korean workers are known to be in Iraq while about 40 nationals are in Yemen and Libya, respectively.The government has been keeping close tabs on the possible impact of Muslim fundamentalism on its citizens since a South Korean teenager vanished in Turkey earlier last month. The 18-year-old, identified only by his surname Kim, is believed to have crossed the border into Syria voluntarily to join the IS, according to Seoul police. South Korea has set up a task force within the Foreign Ministry to deal with the issue following Kim’s disappearance, it said. (Yonhap)","governmental meeting on wednesday ,violent crime the meeting ,seoul discusses safety ,wednesday to discuss ways ,of officials from seoul","['South Korea', 'Seoul ’s Foreign Ministry']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48125151  0.24755858

Last October, the launch of balloons carrying these leaflets incited Pyongyang to fire machine guns at them, with some of the rounds falling near a town lying south of the Demilitarized Zone.Residents in South Korean border towns have rallied against the campaigns, although the groups, mostly comprised of North Korean refugees, have gone on unfazed. Seoul says it can't stop leaflet launches because it is a matter of free speech.The sources at the National Human Rights Commission of Korea said eight out of 11 standing committee members sided with the groups at a plenary meeting on Jan. 26. This means the commission will send a statement to the government asking it not to crack down on  or ban leaflet scattering.Two committee members voted against it, while the remaining one abstained, the sources added.Proponents of the campaign cited freedom of speech to back up their claims.""The privately organized spread of propaganda leaflets is a form of free speech protected by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,"" the sources quoted the final statement as saying.""Restricting these scatterings is like listening to the North's demands at the expense of South Koreans' human rights.""The opponents said the safety of border town residents outweighs freedom of speech.""Inhibiting the campaign does not violate the freedom of speech because saving residents' lives and their safety is for the greater common good,"" Jang Myung-sook, one of the two opponents, said.An NHRCK official, who requested anonymity, also said the fact that eight committee members voted against banning the leaflets just shows the political bias of the institution.

The professors are members of the American Historical Association and the statement was titled ""Standing with Historians of Japan.""  Japan has raised the eyebrows of historians following revelations that it asked U.S. publisher McGraw-Hill to alter the description of the sexual slavery issue in one of its textbooks, ""Tradition & Encounters: A Global Perspective on the Past,"" claiming there are grave errors in the book.  The request was seen as an attempt to water down the atrocity.  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also told a parliamentary meeting earlier this month that he was surprised to learn how the McGraw-Hill book describes the sexual slavery issue, and pledged government efforts to continue to push for changes.  ""As historians, we express our dismay at recent attempts by the Japanese government to suppress statements in history textbooks both in Japan and elsewhere about the euphemistically named 'comfort women,' who suffered under a brutal system of sexual exploitation in the service of the Japanese imperial army during World War II,"" the American historians said in the joint statement.  The scholars also accused the Abe administration of ""vocally questioning the established history of the comfort women and seeking to eliminate references to them in school textbooks"" as part of its effort to promote patriotic education.  They said they support the publisher and agree with author Herbert Ziegler that ""no government should have the right to censor history."" They also said they stand with many historians in Japan and elsewhere who have worked to bring to light the facts about this and other atrocities of World War II.  ""We practice and produce history to learn from the past. We therefore oppose the efforts of states or special interests to pressure publishers or historians to alter the results of their research for political purposes,"" the statement said.Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mainly from Korea, which was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. But Japan has long attempted to whitewash the atrocity.The sexual slavery issue has been the biggest thorn in frayed relations between Japan and South Korea, with Seoul demanding Japan take steps to address the grievances of elderly Korean victims of the atrocity and Japan refusing to do so.The American historians said in the joint statement that there have been debates about whether the number of victims is in the tens of thousands or the hundreds of thousands and what precise role the military played in their procurement.However, careful research by Tokyo's Chuo University professor Yoshimi Yoshiaki in Japanese government archives and accounts from survivors throughout Asia made it beyond doubt that there existed state-sponsored sexual slavery, they said.""Many of the women were conscripted against their will and taken to stations at the front where they had no freedom of movement.

135,135,"U.N. official: N. Korean human rights, cult of Kim can't coexist","A campaign within the United Nations to haul North Korean leader Kim Jong-un before an international court for crimes against humanity has touched off a defensive fury in Pyongyang, where it's being treated like a diplomatic declaration of war -- an aggressive act aimed not only at shutting down prison camps but also at removing Kim and dismantling his family's three-generation cult of personality. More paranoia? ...","A campaign within the United Nations to haul North Korean leader Kim Jong-un before an international court for crimes against humanity has touched off a defensive fury in Pyongyang, where it's being treated like a diplomatic declaration of war -- an aggressive act aimed not only at shutting down prison camps but also at removing Kim and dismantling his family's three-generation cult of personality. More paranoia? Actually, according to the U.N.'s point man on human rights in North Korea, that is not too far off the mark, though he stressed no one is advocating a military option to force regime change. ""It would be, I think, the first order of the day to get these 80,000 to 100,000 (prisoners) immediately released and these camps disbanded,"" Marzuki Darusman, the U.N.'s special rapporteur on human rights in North Korea, said in an interview with The Associated Press. ""But that can only happen if this cult leadership system is completely dismantled. And the only way to do that is if the Kim family is effectively displaced, is effectively removed from the scene, and a new leadership comes into place."" Such blunt words from a high-ranking U.N. official are unusual, although common among American officials. Darusman said previous proposals submitted to the U.N. trying to persuade or force North Korea to improve its human rights record were mostly ""rhetorical"" exercises.  But he said this resolution, passed by the General Assembly in December, is more significant because it holds Kim responsible based on a 372-page report of findings presented last year by the U.N.-backed Commission of Inquiry that detailed arbitrary detention, torture, executions and political prison camps. ""This is a sea change in the position of the international community,"" Darusman said during a recent visit to Tokyo. The North Koreans ""are in their most vulnerable position at this stage, whenever the culpability and responsibility of the supreme leader is brought out in full glare of the international public scrutiny.""North Korea's intense response has included threats of more nuclear tests, mass rallies across the country, a bitter smear campaign against defectors who cooperated in the U.N. report and repeated allegations that Washington orchestrated the whole thing in an attempt at speeding a regime change. Its state media last week railed yet again against the U.N. findings, saying ""those who cooked up the 'report' are all bribed political swindlers and despicable human scum."" It called Darusman, the former attorney general of Indonesia, an ""opportunist.""In a rare flurry of talks, North Korean diplomats at the U.N. lobbied frenetically to get Kim's culpability out of the resolution without success. The proposal is now on the agenda of the Security Council, which is expected this year to make a decision on whether the issue should be referred to the International Criminal Court at The Hague.  Just before the resolution passed the General Assembly, the North Korean diplomatic mission to the U.N. sought a meeting with Darusman to get the wording deleted. During the meeting with Ri Hung Sik, North Korea's ambassador-at-large, the North Koreans indicated their future was at stake, Darusman said.  ""They said that other people will take over, and the hardliners will be taking over,"" Darusman said, suggesting a schism may already be forming between factions scrambling to prove themselves more loyal and more effective in protecting the leadership. ""They wouldn't have to mention that to us, but I don't know. I'm taking it at face value."" But here's the reality check about the resolution: The likelihood of criminal proceedings against Kim is minuscule. It would likely be shot down by China or Russia, which have veto power on the Security Council. Also, while more than 120 countries support the International Criminal Court, the United States isn't one of them, so it is somewhat awkward for Washington to push that option too hard.  But even without bringing Kim to court, Darusman said, the placement of North Korean human rights on the Security Council agenda means Pyongyang will face increasing scrutiny from the international community. He said ally China will be under pressure to either distance itself from Pyongyang or lose credibility. ""It may seem remote, but at some stage it is conceivable that China cannot afford to be continuously associated with a regime that is universally sanctioned by the international community,"" he said. ""Something will give."" Washington, meanwhile, is turning up the heat following the massive cyberattack on Sony Pictures.     ""We are under no illusions about the DPRK's willingness to abandon its illicit weapons, provocations, and human rights abuses on its own. We will apply pressure both multilaterally and unilaterally,"" Sung Kim, Washington's special representative for North Korea policy, testified in Congress last month. ""The leadership in Pyongyang faces ever-sharper choices."" North Korea's official name is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.   Extricating North Korea from the personality cult of the Kim family would be a genuine challenge under any circumstances.  The country's founder, Kim Il Sung, and his son and successor, Kim Jong Il, permeate every facet of daily life. Citizens wear Kim lapel pins everywhere they go. Portraits and statuary of the father and son are everywhere. In Pyongyang at midnight every night, a ghostly dirge commemorating the elder Kim blares from loudspeakers through the darkness. According to the U.N. commission's findings and the testimony of many defectors, North Koreans who dare criticize the Kim family are punished severely and face horrific treatment in prison camps around the country. North Korea says that isn't true, and routinely accuses defectors of being ""human scum"" and criminals. Officials vociferously deny speculation of disunity within their ranks.  In an interview with the AP in Pyongyang in October, two North Korean legal experts attempted to discredit the U.N. campaign and its findings -- which they called an ""anti-DPRK plot"" -- and defended the prison system that has long been the core area of concern. ""In a word, the political camps do not exist in our country,"" said Ri Kyong Chol, director of the international law department at Pyongyang's Academy of Social Sciences. ""The difference between the common and the anti-state criminals is that the anti-state criminals get more severe punishment than the common criminals."" But Ri said common and anti-state inmates are not segregated.  ""I think every country has prisons to imprison those criminals who have committed crimes against the state,"" he said. But in North Korea, ""there are no different prisons for that.""

The action immediately caused a fierce physical clash between police officers and the residents of Gangjeong village and their supporters.The Navy said they had no other option but to drive them out in order to complete the construction of five four-story apartment buildings that would house essential members of navy operations and their families in the future, timed with the completion of the naval base in December as planned.The military has been constructing a modern military port that would hold up to 20 warships simultaneously, along with two 150,000 ton cruise ships.The military says the Jeju base, if completed as scheduled in December, will give Seoul a launching point for sending naval vessels into the South Sea, a key trade route for South Korea.But the opponents have long staged protests and taken legal steps to halt construction, citing potential environmental damage to the area designated as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.(Yonhap)","navy to force protesters ,site have staged protests ,to force protesters out ,protesters out of jeju ,force protesters out",['Navy'],14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.0470342  -0.08916221

The incident angered parents nationwide, pressuring officials to brainstorm quick solutions.But critics dismissed government suggestions to address the situation as populist. They said the measures did not amount to a fundamental solution. Officials had proposed toughening penalties against abuse, raising the bar for potential child care center workers, and installing more cameras. Lawmakers from both sides of the political spectrum echoed the public criticism Wednesday.“More cameras? Where’s the money? The government must look over the entire system. They cannot and must not come up with an array of small solutions and say ‘here’s what we’ve got for you,’” said Rep. Lee Myoung-su of the ruling Saenuri Party.Main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy Rep. Kim Yong-ik made similar criticism.“Punishing abusive teachers is important, but the government must ensure that (workers at) day care centers receive the right wages, that they have the resources to do their job,” Kim said.NPAD Rep. Rhee Mok-hee also expressed frustration over an earlier statement by Welfare Minister Moon, who had said that nonworking mothers should avoid using public child care centers, as the limited space should be reserved for children of working moms.“I think you should be thinking about how to make space available for children of non-working moms by finding ways to increase your ministry’s budget,” he told the minister/“You seem to be following orders from the president and simply trying to live with whatever amount of money the Finance Ministry deals out,” the lawmaker added.Welfare Minister Moon apologized.“I will travel countrywide to collect opinions from parents, child care center staff, the government and other areas,” the minister said.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","incident angered parents nationwide ,angered parents nationwide pressuring ,the incident angered parents ,wednesday grilled welfare minister ,incident angered parents","['Welfare', 'Moon Hyung - pyo', 'Korea', 'South Korea ’s', 'Incheon']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49249703  0.27757105

Citing film industry sources, local dailies reported Saturday that a high-ranking official in the Busan city government recently met with BIFF director Lee Yong-kwan to deliver the results of a recent audit into the agency, and indirectly persuaded him to resign from the post.Busan is an important sponsor of the annual film festival, covering more than half of the festival's annual budget. The city later confirmed the report, saying that it demanded the BIFF executive committee to present a new vision for the film festival and a plan to renovate the organization as the festival is to mark its 20th anniversary this year but has never urged Lee to step down.But the local film circle has protested the move, suspecting it as a retaliatory measure against Lee's decision to screen a controversial documentary film during last year's film festival.The festival authorities were in feud with the Busan city government and the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism over the screening of ""The Truth Shall Not Sink with Sewol,"" also known as ""Diving Bell,"" which is critical of the government's poor response to the April 16 Sewol ferry sinking that claimed more than 30 lives.""We cannot remove our suspicion that the alleged recommendation for Lee's resignation is a retaliatory measure against the festival's screening of the film,"" 12 film industry groups led by the Korean Film Producers' Association said in a joint statement released on Monday. The city government ""should immediately withdraw the measure,"" they said.""Politicians cannot be involved in the selection of films to be screened for a festival if it is a normal one,"" the groups said.Ensuring festival programmers' freedom to choose films was ""a factor behind BIFF's growth over the 19 years as Asia's leading film festival,"" they said.The groups said they will fight against the city government if Lee eventually is forced to step down.Founded in 1996, the BIFF has developed into Asia's largest film festival. Lee became the festival's executive director in 2010 and won a second term as the director in 2013. His three-year tenure is set to expire in February next year.Also on Monday, the festival authorities expressed their regret over the move by the local government.""It is unreasonable for the Busan city government to unilaterally and overtly mention the resignation of the festival director without any process to discuss with each other what problems they have and how to correct them,"" the BIFF said in a statement.

Shortly afterward, he switched departments and became the youngest police superintendent at the age of 31. He was later promoted to chief of the provincial police agency.During his career, Lee worked overseas for seven years, including at the South Korean consulate in Los Angeles.The nominee is a three-term lawmaker of the ruling Saenuri Party.His most recent election was during the parliamentary by-elections in April 2013, in which he won nearly 80 percent of the vote after overcoming a fierce battle with cancer.For the past seven months, he has served as the party's floor leader, leading tough negotiations with the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy on a controversial bill aimed at uncovering the truth behind last April's deadly ferry sinking.If he wins parliamentary approval to become the next prime minister, media attention will likely focus on his potential as a ruling party candidate for the next presidential election slated for late 2017.

Raids, arrests across Europe -   ================================   Four men suspected of supplying one of the gunmen behind the Paris attacks with weapons and vehicles were brought before an anti-terror judge Tuesday, the first to face possible charges over the shootings that shook France to its core.The three gunmen who carried out coordinated attacks from January 7-9 were killed in dramatic police sieges, and prosecutors are now hoping to pin down those who assisted them.Prosecutors called Tuesday for the men believed to have supplied gunman Amedy Coulibaly with weapons and vehicles to remain in detention and be charged with conspiracy to commit terrorist acts.Coulibaly was behind the murder of four hostages at a Jewish supermarket and the murder of a policewoman after brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi gunned down 12 people at satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.The attacks prompted a flurry of police activity across Europe.In Germany some 200 police carried out raids on 13 apartments in Berlin and other locations to find evidence against two men arrested last week for allegedly backing jihadist violence in Syria.This followed raids in Belgium last week that foiled potential attacks against police officers, and led to arrests in several European countries.Greece on Tuesday ordered the extradition of a 33-year-old Algerian man with suspected links to the jihadist cell dismantled in Belgium.The suspected mastermind of the plot, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a 27-year-old Belgian of Moroccan descent, remains at large.And in Bulgaria, a court ruled that a Frenchman who knew two of the Paris attackers should be returned to his home country.France had issued an arrest warrant for Muslim convert Fritz-Joly Joachin, 29, who denies being an extremist but was detained after trying to cross from Bulgaria into Turkey before the attacks.In southern France, five Russians from Chechnya were arrested on Tuesday with what police described as a dangerous amount of explosives, although the case was believed to be linked to organised crime and not radical Islam.      - Boosted security measures -   =============================   Many EU states have pushed for a US-style database of air travellers' details on the grounds that it would help track Islamist suspects, but the European Parliament has so far blocked the scheme saying it would breach civil liberties.Some European nations have also been pushing for a tightening of the Schengen visa-free zone.""They will discuss subjects including passenger name records and data retention, the functioning of the Schengen area and cooperation between security services,"" Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas told a briefing on Tuesday ahead of Wednesday's meeting.The fallout from the attacks has led to massive protests in Muslim countries, furious after Charlie Hebdo magazine responded to the killing of its staff by publishing a new cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed.Banned by Islam, the depiction of the prophet was taken as a searing insult to Muslims who burned French flags, and threatened the country in protests that have taken place in Chechnya, Afghanistan, Gaza, Iran and Pakistan. In Niger protests turned deadly as 10 people died and dozens of churches were torched.The attacks have forced France to face up to its failure to integrate poorer, migrant families, with Valls admitting on Tuesday that the country was plagued by ""social and ethnic apartheid"".

""The DVDs of 'The Interview' were not included on purpose."" About 20 American activists, including some from the U.S.-based Human Rights Foundation, also joined the border campaign, according to officials. Claiming the exclusion of the DVDs as a warning to North Korea, Park said the group will spread a massive amount of ""The Interview"" DVDs if the North is not cooperative with South Korea's dialogue offer and its proposal for a reunion of separated families.The activist group often flies leaflets carrying anti-regime messages in big plastic balloons across the border in a bid to spread dissenting messages in the reclusive communist country. Park had pledged to add the DVDs to their campaigns this month.The Monday action came despite South Korea's calls on the activist group to scrap their campaigns after the North's repeated threats of retaliation. In a news interview released earlier on Tuesday, Park indicated his intention to push ahead with the DVD campaign. ""The Interview"" DVDs would not be scrapped without an official government request,"" the activist group head said. ""I have previously vowed to accept if a person in charge of government administration requests restraint in the form of an official letter, but no such request has been made,"" Park said in an interview with Washington-based Radio Free Asia. ""We are in a position in which we cannot refrain from the plan only upon a verbal request from the government,"" he said.The South Korean government has maintained that on principle it will not interfere with the campaign because it is a matter of freedom of speech, although it may take action to prevent any safety risks that might result from the activities.Last week, a high-level government official met with Park face-to-face and verbally advised him against a future campaign. On Tuesday, a unification ministry official again reiterated its stance that ""Leaflet spreading by private groups belongs to a sphere of the basic freedom of expression, therefore the government cannot force them (to stop) and the private sector should decide for themselves."" ""The government will take necessary action only in case clear risks are posed to the safety of citizens in the concerned region,"" the official said, adding that the government plans to continue to call for discretion from activists.The release of the U.S. comedy film, which revolves around an American TV producer and a show host's trip to North Korea to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, has previously drawn angry reaction from the communist country.

""We're not going to excessively spread anti-North Korea leaflets for the time being.""The Campaign is one of two major civic groups that have regularly flown large amounts of anti-Pyongyang leaflets by balloons across the border. The leaflet campaign targeting North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has been a constant source of friction between the two Koreas.North Korea has openly threatened to retaliate against organizers of the leaflet campaigns who are mostly defectors from the North. But the Seoul government has refused to intervene, citing the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of expression.But the Seoul government appears to be changing its position on the issue following a court ruling last month that government authorities can intervene and stop the leaflet campaign if it threatens the safety of people living in border areas.The move by Lee's group came one day after the Unification Ministry separately met heads of the two civic groups and requested them to refrain from flying the leaflets.Lee, in response, said  his group will honor the government's suggestion but stressed that there will be no ""drastic"" cut in the frequency of the leaflet campaign, however.Park Sang-hak, also a North Korean defector who heads the other activist group that leads the campaign, said he is considering suspending his plan to send DVDs of a Hollywood film about a fictional plot to kill the North Korean leader across the border by balloon, according to sources.The head of the Fighters for a Free North Korea earlier had said he was planning to send 100,000 copies of Sony Pictures' ""The Interview,"" which the North condemned as a deal-breaker, around Tuesday.In a New Year Day address, the North Korean leader said he is willing to hold summit talks with South Korean President Park Geun-hye but said Seoul must first create a good atmosphere for dialogue by halting the leaflet campaign and joint military exercises with the United States.South and North Korea are in a state of conflict after the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an uneasy armistice, not in a peace treaty. About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea as a deterrence against the North.

(Yonhap)Ewha Womans University said Wednesday it would freeze tuition fees for the 2015 school year, reversing its original plan to raise them by 2.4 percent. “(The university) will freeze the fees this year in accordance with the government policy to pursue half-priced tuition,” university president Choi Kyung-hwa said during her meeting with Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea at the university campus in Seoul. But the timing of Hwang’s visit and Choi’s subsequent announcement has sparked speculations that the visit was intended to pressure Ewha, the first major university to announce a tuition hike. Earlier in the month, the university said it would raise tuition fees by 2.4 percent, the maximum amount set by the government.Hwang has been publicly pressuring local universities not to raise tuition fees. He urged university presidents to refrain from raising their fees this year at a meeting held last week in Yangjae-dong, southern Seoul.Half-priced tuition is one of President Park Geun-hye’s flagship education policies. She aims to reduce students’ financial difficulties by curbing or gradually reducing tuition fees and expanding state-backed scholarship programs. Some students, however, have questioned the policy’s effectiveness, pointing out that it would not substantially lower tuition fees and that not every student receives a state scholarship.The average college tuition fees decreased slightly from 6.68 million won ($6,154) in 2013 to 6.67 million won in 2014.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","womans university to freeze ,freeze tuition education minister ,womans university said wednesday ,university to freeze tuition ,wednesday ewha womans university","['Hwang Woo - yea', 'Choi Kyung - hee', 'Ewha Womans University', 'Seoul', 'yonhap)ewha Womans University']",14,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.45469949  0.44529015

Lim Su-kyung of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy is accused of appearing on the on-stage talk shows held in Seoul and other South Korean cities in the past several months.The shows, hosted by a Korean-American woman, Shin Eun-mi, reportedly contained comments sympathetic to the North Korean regime, in violation of the South's National Security Law.The law bans any activities meant to praise, promote or propagandize North Korean ideals in the country.The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency probing the case said Lim was called in as a defendant in the complaint filed by local conservative groups.The lawmaker is further accused of retweeting tweets posted by Urimizokkiri, a North Korean news website, according to police.Lim, however, said her show appearance was not premeditated.""I ran into the show when I was at the Jogye Temple (where the show was held in Seoul) to discuss Buddhism-related laws,"" she told reporters before the police questioning. ""I had received a request to participate, but I'd turned it down considering my other engagements at the National Assembly.""The former pro-unification activist became widely known after making an unauthorized trip to the communist nation in 1989 and meeting with then leader Kim Il-sung, the North's founder and grandfather of current leader Kim Jong-un.The police probe comes after Shin was expelled from the country last week. The prosecution had suspended her indictment.Earlier this week, the Seoul Central District Court also issued an arrest warrant for Shin's South Korean co-host, Hwang Sun, for holding shows that allegedly endorsed North Korea.

152,152,S. Korea vows stern punishment for N.K. provocations over leaflets,"South Korea warned North Korea of stern punishment Wednesday should it carry out provocations in protest of anti-Pyongyang leaflet campaigns by civic groups here.North Korea has demanded that the South deter its civic groups from releasing balloons carrying leaflets that criticize the North Korean regime, while the Seoul government has been cautious, citing their freedom of speech.""If North Korea provokes, using the ...","South Korea warned North Korea of stern punishment Wednesday should it carry out provocations in protest of anti-Pyongyang leaflet campaigns by civic groups here.North Korea has demanded that the South deter its civic groups from releasing balloons carrying leaflets that criticize the North Korean regime, while the Seoul government has been cautious, citing their freedom of speech.""If North Korea provokes, using the leaflet campaigns as an excuse, our military will, as warned repeatedly, mercilessly punish not only the origin of the provocations but also forces supporting it and its commanders,"" the defense ministry said in a brief release.The warning came after the local daily Donga Ilbo reported, citing the leader of an abductee advocacy group in Seoul, that the North Korean military has completed drills to devastate South Korean border regions where civic groups release propaganda balloons. Choi said he learned of the tips from sources inside the communist country.But the defense ministry here said the authorities do not have such intelligence and no signs have been detected of the North's such military drills.""North Korea's artillery units have beefed up attack drills targeting our major facilities every year ... Though they are regular exercises, we are monitoring their activities along the border very closely,"" said a military officer here, requesting anonymity.The civic groups, with most of their members being North Korean defectors, regularly send leaflets to their communist homeland to encourage their countrymen to rise up against the totalitarian regime.Whether to regulate the campaigns has also been a hot-button issue in South Korea, as supporters claim it is a matter of freedom of expression while critics and residents in border regions say it could invite unnecessary trouble.In October, the two Koreas exchanged machine gun fire across the border after the North apparently tried to shoot down balloons carrying anti-Pyongyang leaflets.

153,153,Anti-Islamic sentiment spreads across Europe,"Germany has become the latest European country to witness mass anti-Islamic protests which have grown increasingly common across the continent.

""In Europe in general, there is an anxiety, an anti-Islamic phobia, developing,"" said left-wing activist and Green euro MP Daniel Cohn-Bendit. He was referring to the latest protests by the Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West (PEGIDA) group that gathered an unprecedented 18,000 supporters to their rally in Dresden on Monday. PEGIDA, which was launched only in October, rails against a range of enemies -- not just Islam, but also the media (""all those liars"") and the political elite -- that they accuse of diluting Germany's Christian culture. They have won support from admirers abroad, such as Tommy Robinson, former head of the far-right anti-Islamic English Defence League. On Monday, he tweeted: ""St George's flags are flying in Dresden with PEGIDA. If I could be anywhere right now it would be Dresden.""The protests have been denounced by Germany's leading parties, with Chancellor Angela Merkel decrying the ""hate"" that fuels the participants. ""What's remarkable is that the phenomenon is not caused by an (economic) crisis -- Germany is doing well. And in Dresden, there are no Muslims,"" said Cohn-Bendit.He says images of violence by Islamic jihadist groups in the Middle East have frightened people even in parts of Europe where very few Muslims have settled. ""They have scared themselves with globalised television and the internet. That's how you can live in the heart of Saxony and have the feeling that you're under attack.""- Fear of the Other -=====================The story is a familiar one of fearing that which is not understood.""When we don't have contact with others, when we don't know them, we are afraid of them,"" said a European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""We saw that with the referendum on minirets in Switzerland. Those who live in remote villages, and are therefore the least affected, they were the most hostile to minarets.""But that has done nothing to offset genuine fears in many countries over the potential impact of mass immigration.Even Sweden, proud of its liberal attitudes, has strained under the pressure of 100,000 asylum requests in a country of just 10 million. It has seen the rapid growth of the extreme right Democrat Party which has played on concerns about immigration, while a number of fires at mosques have raised fears of mounting Islamophobia. Meanwhile France, home to Europe's largest Muslim population, is convulsed by a debate over supposed Islamisation, with fears whipped up by the far-right Front National and a number of public intellectuals. It was back in the media this week with the release of a new book by writer Michel Houellebecq which imagined the country ruled by a Muslim party in 2022. Cohn-Bendit puts it down to a wider identity crisis as traditional cultures face rapid change.""It's PEGIDA in Germany, it's also gay marriage in France,"" he said.""It's the fear of losing that which no longer exists: of losing a pure Germany ... of losing a vision of the family that no longer exists.""

(Yonhap)""Such a reckless act was done at a time when all Koreans in the North and the South and abroad were eagerly hoping to see mended North-South relations,"" said the KCNA.""It is a blatant challenge to the DPRK's sincere stand and appeal for improved North-South relations and national reunification and a last-ditch effort to obstruct the improvement of north-south relations and spoil an atmosphere of dialogue."" DPRK is the acronym for the country's formal name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.It was referring to Kim's speech aired on Jan. 1, in which he emphasized the need to improve inter-Korean relations this year, which marks the 70th anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japan's 35-year colonial rule.He said Pyongyang is willing to engage in various types of dialogue with Seoul even at the highest level. It was the first time that he openly spoke about the possibility of inter-Korean summit talks, although he attached routine preconditions to the olive branch such as a halt to annual joint defense exercises between South Korea and the United States.The conservative Park Geun-hye administration of the South maintains that the military drills are a necessary defensive measure and that there are no legal grounds to formally ban the leaflet campaign because of freedom of speech.Local media have paid attention to whether there will be a change in the government's position on the leaflet issue after a related court ruling.The Uijeongbu District Court, located just north of Seoul, ruled Tuesday that the authorities can restrict the scattering of leaflets if it jeopardizes public safety amid Pyongyang's threat of military retaliation.The court added that it's true that the leaflet campaign is associated with the freedom of speech.The unification ministry said it respects the court's ruling and it will continue to seek appropriate measures to protect its people from the North's possible attack.""There is no change in our basic stance (on the matter). But we will cooperate with police, if needed, to ease concerns about dangers to the lives and property of our people,"" ministry spokesman Lim Byeong-cheol said at a press briefing.He stuck to the expression of ""safety-related measures,""avoiding a direct answer to questions about whether the government has plans to ban such leaflet launches in a pre-emptive manner.

Hong Kong was handed from Britain back to China in 1997 and enjoys freedoms not seen on the mainland.

It reneged on a deal to hold high-level talks with the South between late October and early November, citing the practice by conservative groups here.Pyongyang has urged Seoul to ban the leaflet drive, which officials here associate with the freedom of speech.""(The group) seems to have scattered leaflets without prior notice (to the relevant authorities),"" the official told reporters on background. ""We are closely watching how North Korea will respond.""The government is apparently concerned about whether it will negatively affect burgeoning signs of a thaw in inter-Korean relations.In late December, South Korea proposed ministerial talks with the North this month. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, in his New Year's address, said his regime would make every effort to improve the ties through various types of dialogue, including summit talks.Pyongyang has not provided a formal reply yet to Seoul's dialogue offer but many observers here expect a positive answer.The ministry official said the latest spread of leaflets may serve as a litmus test for the North's resolve to engage in dialogue with the South.""If the dialogue mood is hampered by this incident, it would mean dialogue, even if resumed, can be suspended any time,"" he said.It's a matter for the two sides to ride out in order to develop their ties, he added, reiterating that the government has no legal basis to prohibit the leaflet campaign.
