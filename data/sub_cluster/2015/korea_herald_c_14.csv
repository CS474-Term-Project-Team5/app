The forthcoming April general election to constitute the 20th National Assembly will be a race for parliamentary seats as well as a prelude to the 2017 presidential election.The rival parties are mired in a power struggle of their own as their eyes are singularly set on individually and collectively winning the next Assembly seats, the configuration of which is likely to decide the fate of the incumbent administration’s initiatives to cope with the approaching lame duck period of President Park Geun-hye.Slews of populist pledges for each constituency are anticipated without a fundamental chance to address the engrained regionalism, while the grave economic outlook and the unstable security front could fan the ideological division that has often worked as an easy political tool to galvanize each of their supporters.National Assembly Speaker Chung Ui-hwa speaks to reporters on Thursday. YonhapThe heavy political calculations have even led to an unprecedented expiration of legal electoral maps, with the National Election Commission being forced to offer a grace period for the parties to agree on how to redistribute the constituencies.For the ruling party, the key task is to overcome the slipping approval rate of incumbent President Park Geun-hye, who will enter her fourth year in office in late February, all amid of an escalating power struggle between Park’s supporters and the “non-Parks.”But their dilemma may be nothing compared to that of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea. While struggling to keep itself from falling apart, the party also has to publicize its new agenda and identity to the public, with less than four months remaining to the election.Marking out the 2016 elections is the appearance of a new political power group other than the two leading parties.“The new party will embrace ‘rational reform’ instead of ‘old progressivism’ and ‘reactionary conservatism,’” former opposition cochairman and onetime independent presidential candidate Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo said Sunday, revealing his blueprint for the political party that he is to kick off.“Neither the developmental dictatorship of the 1970s nor the activist paradigms of the 1980s may solve the incumbent problems of our times,” he said, referring to the Park Geun-hye administration and the opposition party respectively.It remains to be seen whether the information technology guru-turned-politician will succeed this time as a true third force, and not repeat his failed positioning ahead of the 2012 presidential election.Ahn’s move, regardless of its success, poses a threat to the Minjoo Party, which needs unity in order to stand up against the ruling camp.The party holds 119 out of 300 seats in the National Assembly. This is already lower than the 120 seat baseline the party considers necessary in order to hold blocking power in the parliament, but is likely to fall further in the coming weeks. While eight lawmakers have left the party since Ahn’s defection, a group of senior members including former floor leader Rep. Park Jie-won have been hinting at their imminent defection.Struggling to hold the party together, the leadership decided to hold a national convention as soon as possible and prepare for the general election.The ruling Saenuri Party may be faring better than the opposition camp, but is getting increasingly caught up in its candidate nomination rules, an issue which has divided the pro-Park faction against others.The party’s nomination committee is pushing ahead with a recommendation system which, according to dissenters including party leader Kim, will enable the leadership to favor specific candidates.The two groups are also at odds on whether or not to offer extra credits to former government officials running for their first parliamentary office, with the pro-Park faction in favor of the idea and the non-Park group against it.At the heart of the problem is the unstable public polls of President Park Geun-hye, a factor that has divided her close aides and those who wish to stand apart from the group. The average approval rating of the president has remained in the low 40 percent range over the past few months, according to leading pollsters.By Bae Hyun-jung(tellme@heraldcorp.com)","2017 presidential election the rival ,the forthcoming april general election ,unstable public polls of president ,presidential election the rival ,2012 presidential election ahn move","['National Assembly', 'Assembly', 'Park Geun - hye', 'National Assembly', 'Chung Ui - hwa', 'the National Election Commission', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Park ’s', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Ahn Cheol', 'ahn ’s', 'the Minjoo Party', 'the National Assembly', 'Ahn ’s', 'Park Jie - won', 'Saenuri Party', 'pro - park', 'Kim', 'non - park', 'Park Geun - hye']",6,"[ 2.          1.          3.         ... -0.48706847  0.46314755

Enraged by what they called political collusion between the two countries, nearly 1,000 people jammed into a narrow downtown street to participate in the 1,211st weekly rally held by the former sex slaves and their supporters.  (Yonhap)The Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan has staged the rally for nearly 24 years to demand Japan’s acknowledgement of its responsibility for forcing up to 200,000 young Korean women into sex slavery and legal compensation. But Monday’s much-hailed settlement was far from what the victims and their rights groups have cried out for, they say. “What sins did we commit? Our only sin was that we were brought up as a daughter of this country. Why did I have to serve as a sex slave?” 88-year-old victim Lee Yong-soo shouted at the rally, shedding tears. “We have cried out for an official apology and legal compensation from Japan for all these years, but Japan still denies its wrongdoing,” Lee said, calling herself “living proof” of Japan’s atrocities. Lee also lashed out at her own government, saying she cannot trust Korean authorities. “This country killed us one more time. We were not informed at all about the deal. However old and powerless we are, we cannot just die like this,” she said. “As long as you are here to support us, our fight will begin again here.” The Wednesday rally began at around noon with a silent tribute to nine of the euphemistically called “comfort women” who died this year. Out of 238 Korean victims who came forward, only 46 are still alive, with their average age at 89.The participants in unison pledged not to forget about the pains the victims had to endure for more than two decades, with many of them holding photos of former comfort women and placards reading “Protect girls” and “Opposition to the relocation of the comfort women statue.”“I couldn’t stop crying after hearing about the ridiculous deal. I don’t know who the foreign ministry is working for,” said 41-year-old activist Park Hee-jin, who has attended the rally more than 10 times. “If the government fails to protect us, then we should protect each other.” The demonstration, swelling with more people than usual following Monday’s diplomatic settlement, came amid growing criticism that the Korean government failed to represent the interests of the victims. The surprise deal, which both countries called “final and irreversible,” includes Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s apology and 1 billion yen ($8.3 million) in payment to help support the 46 surviving victims. But the victims and civic groups lamented that the Korean government did not consult with them in advance and that Japan had refused to recognize the deal as legal compensation for past atrocities. Despite the international community hailing the settlement, Cornelia Schmidt was not convinced as to whether the victims’ grievances were really healed through the deal. “The deal Korean government made with Japan doesn’t seem to solve the issue,” the 23-year-old German student said. “I cannot blame Japanese people, but I think their government should make more efforts to make up for what they did in the past.”  Many of the crowd were seen paying a tribute to the life-size bronze statue of a young girl representing a comfort women sitting in front of the Japanese Embassy. They put gloves, scarves and blankets next to the statue in a gesture to make it feel warm and less lonely.The bronze statue, built in 2011 by victims and their supporters in front of the Japanese Embassy, has sparked fury from Tokyo, leading it to pressure Seoul to remove the statue. South Korea has indicated it would try to relocate it through consultations with relevant civic groups as part of the deal, adding fuel to the public backlash.In a survey conducted by pollster Realmeter, 66 percent of South Koreans opposed the relocation of the statute, while 19 percent favored it. Cho Hye-won, 45, led her child to cuddle the statue ahead of the rally. “I brought my child because he needs to learn that this is history we should never forget nor repeat,” she said. “For that purpose, the statue should stay here.”Earlier in the day, a union of civic organizations and students groups held press conferences to voice their objection to the settlement, denouncing it as indulging Japan.  Some of the opposition lawmakers from the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea also joined the rally, paying their respects to the victims and raising their voices against the settlement.The council for the victims said it plans to launch a global campaign to bring justice for the human rights abuses by Japan by continuing to hold the rally every Wednesday in front of comfort women statues across the nation. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","korean women into sex slavery ,seoul on wednesday to condemn ,in the 211st weekly rally ,sexual enslavement of korean women ,korea also joined the rally","['South Koreans', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'korean', 'yonhap)the Korean Council', 'the Women draft for Military Sexual Slavery', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'korean', 'Lee Yong - soo', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Lee', 'Japan', 'Lee', 'korean', 'korean', 'Park Hee - jin', 'korean', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe ’s', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Cornelia Schmidt', 'korean', 'Japan', 'german', 'japanese', 'the Japanese Embassy', 'the Japanese Embassy', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'realmeter', 'South Koreans', 'Cho Hye - won', 'Japan', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Japan']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22211745  0.46325523

3,3,77% of South Koreans see need for ‘filial duty contracts’,More than 75 percent of South Koreans surveyed by a local pollster think “filial duty contracts” -- a legal document that makes it mandatory for all grown children to financially and emotionally care for their aged parents -- are necessary should they receive any gifts such as real estate or stocks from them.　The survey results were released two days after the Supreme Court ruled in favor of an elderly father who ...,"More than 75 percent of South Koreans surveyed by a local pollster think “filial duty contracts” -- a legal document that makes it mandatory for all grown children to financially and emotionally care for their aged parents -- are necessary should they receive any gifts such as real estate or stocks from them.The survey results were released two days after the Supreme Court ruled in favor of an elderly father who filed a suit against his son, who, in spite of signing a filial duty contract, did not care for his ill mother as promised after receiving a personal estate. The court acknowledged the legality of the document and ruled the son must return the property to his father, as the property was gifted in exchange for his support. In August, a controversial bill, which gives Korean parents the right to sue their children in case of mistreatment and ask them to return any gifts, was introduced by the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea. The bill is currently pending at the National Assembly.   (123RF)Filial duty has been largely considered as one of the most important traditional values in Korea. Even until the mid-1980s, all grown children in Korea, especially the sons, were ""expected to have the responsibility and obligation for their aged parents' well-being because of the reciprocal dependence of successive genearations,"" according to scholar Keun Young Chung Pang's 2000 book ""Virtuous Transcendence.""""Parents may depend on all their sons because all their sons have depended on them,"" the scholar wrote in the book. ""Each son has a debt from his early years that has to be repaid.""Yet with the nation's changing family structure and expensive cost of housing and education that often burden young Koreans, more elderly citizens in Korea are unable to rely on their children to take care of them. According to government data, 1.02 million out of 5.42 million elderly Koreans are reported to be living alone this year.The  survey results on the ""filial duty contracts"" showed that Koreans still feel obligated to fulfill -- and benefit from -- filial duty. Among the 567 Koreans who participated in the survey by Seoul-based Real Meter, 77.3 percent said such filial duty contracts are necessary between grown-up children and their parents. While 87 percent of those in their 50s agreed with the idea of having such contracts, only 64.7 percent of those in their 20s shared the view. Responses varied among regions. Those who live in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province had the highest proportion of individuals – 92.8 percent -- who believed the contracts were necessary. Eighty-five percent of those who live in Ulsan and South Gyeongsang Province, 73.2 percent of those who live in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province, and 65.8 percent of Gwangju and Jeolla Province residents believed the same.  Also, 67.7 percent of all participants said they believe the bill introduced by TMK that guarantees a parent’s right to retract a gift should they get mistreated by their children, must be approved and passed by the National Assembly.Under the current law, a donor may rescind a gift contract if the recipient committed an act of crime against the donor, or if “the beneficiary is obliged to support the donor but does not do so.” However, the law also states that rescinding a gift contract does not have any effect once the gift has already been given to the beneficiary.According to the Welfare Ministry, 5,772 instances of elderly abuse were reported in Korea last year. Of the abusers, 51.1 percent were the victims’ adult children. With the country recording the highest poverty rate for elderly citizens -- 49. 6 percent -- among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations this year, the number of Korean parents suing their children for financial support more than doubled from 135 in 2004 to 262 last year.Critics of the bill said the number of elderly individuals who can actually afford to give gifts to their children is very small, and therefore the law revision won’t benefit the majority of the elderly population, especially those who live below the poverty line. Proponents support legal contracts for property transactions, even between a parent and a child.Researcher Choi In-hee from the Korea Women’s Development Institute said the government should share responsibility to take care of and financially support the elderly members of family, and also take into account the difficulties faced by young adult Koreans to afford housing or education.According to Statistics Korea, 10.1 percent of all young Koreans aged 15-29 were not in school and out of work this year, even after more than four weeks of job hunting. Once the statistics include those who are not employed as they are faced with situations that are beyond their control such as critical family illness, or those who haven’t been searching for jobs for more than a month, the proportion of unemployed young Koreans reached 22.4 percent this year.

Regarding the controversial wage peak system, both sides agreed to hold more talks next year on whether or not to expand its implementation.

In comparison, the rate for North Korean men was 66 years and 72.7 years for women. The infant mortality rate, one of the biggest reasons behind the life expectancy disparity, was measured at 22.0 deaths of infants under age 1 per 1,000 live births in North Korea, a figure 7.6 times higher than in the South. A night in Pyongyang. YonhapAccording to the latest reports by the Korea Foundation for International Healthcare, the only South Korean agency that provides health care support to North Korea, some of the most vulnerable social groups in the communist state’s poor medical system were pregnant women. As of 2010, North Korea’s maternal mortality ratio was 81 women per 100,000 live births. South Korea’s ratio was 16, while Japan and China’s ratios were 5 and 37, respectively. According to KOFIH’s 2013 data, less than 10 percent of North Korean obstetricians and gynecologists have been trained in newborn care. Family doctors in small regional clinics are not trained in emergency obstetric and newborn care, childbirth or gynecology.Poor sterilization of medical equipment also leads to infection of patients in North Korean medical facilities, data showed. In the country, 15 percent of women who died due to complications from pregnancy or childbirth died from sepsis, a whole-body inflammation caused by an infection.Statistics Korea predicted that by 2055, the life expectancy rate would reach 85.9 years for South Korean men and 89.8 years for women, while the rate for North Korean men would reach 71.4 years for men and 77.9 years for women.Poor nutrition and an inadequate number of health care professionals have been also noted as some of the reasons behind North Korea’s lower life expectancy rate.

The 15th annual ranking analyzes the overall peace statuses of 143 countries based on various factors including local politics, military, diplomacy and socioeconomic level. Germany has remained at the top for three consecutive years with 89.6 points. Maintaining stable social and economic conditions contributed to the ranking, the report said. Iceland, Canada and Sweden followed with 89.5, 89.4 and 88.9 points, respectively. The U.S. ranked No. 70 with 69.2 points. It ranked low due mainly to military and diplomatic issues in the Middle East and antiterrorism measures, as well as social factors such as shooting rampages and the widening economic gap, it added.

Having graduated from a private women’s colleges in Seoul, she currently makes about 2.5 million won ($2,120) a month working at a marketing firm. As she lives alone and supports herself in Seoul while her family is in Daejeon, she doesn’t have much opportunity to save.“I know my parents don’t have anything ready for their postretirement expenses,” she told The Korea Herald. “I know I’ll have to support them once my father retires. I know they haven’t been able to save anything because they spent most of their income on me,” Shin said. While she feels she owes them support in their later years, it also pressures her into thinking that marriage and children in her own life may be an unrealistic luxury.Shin’s problems are apparently shared among many South Koreans, who often feel obliged to support their offspring even after they go off to college, land a job and get married. Add that with low youth employment, an economic slowdown and soaring living expenses, saving for postretirement life has become a tough challenge. A mall in Seoul. (Yonhap)According to the report released by the KB Financial Group Research Center, which surveyed 2,906 Koreans aged 25-59 nationwide on their household finances, Koreans need an average monthly income of 2.26 million won for postretirement expenses. However, based on the surveyed individuals’ savings, public and private pension plans and other financial assets, they only had an average monthly income of 1.1 million won for their postretirement days. The report showed that married couples with children are more vulnerable to postretirement income risks, as they tend to sacrifice their retirement savings for their children’s education and wedding costs. According to the report, married couples with children require an average monthly income of 2.52 million won postretirement, but they only end up saving 43 percent of the needed funds.Married couples without children are currently saving 63 percent of the needed funds for their postretirement expenses, which is 2.21 million won a month. Among all occupations, public servants were best prepared for their postretirement days, saving 70.7 percent of the required funds needed after retirement. Self-employed workers were saving 45.2 percent of the needed funds, while high-earning professionals, such as doctors and lawyers, were saving 57.8 percent.Those who felt they weren’t financially prepared for their postretirement years said they didn’t have enough income, they were spending too much on their children or they had too much debt to pay off.In October, a report released by the National Pension Research Institute showed that transfer payments, such as social retirement benefits and public pension payments, only make up about 28.8 percent of the average income of Korean elderly, with almost 50 percent of the elderly living below the poverty line.The high poverty rate and inadequate public transfer payments mean that most Korean elderly must stay employed, even if they don’t want to, or financially depend on family members or children in order to live above the poverty line, the report claimed.The paper also showed that 46.9 percent of the Korean elderly population lived in poverty -- defined as having income of less than half the median national income -- as of last year. The number was significantly higher than those of other developed nations, such as Norway (1.5 percent), the U.K. (7.9 percent), the U.S. (19.3 percent) and Taiwan (26.6 percent).In countries such as Denmark, Poland, the U.K., Finland, Australia and Canada, public transfer payments, such as pension payments, retirement benefits and living allowance, accounted for at least 70 percent of the average income of the elderly population.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","private women colleges in seoul ,29 year old office worker ,women colleges in seoul she ,surveyed 906 koreans aged 25 ,women colleges in seoul","['Shin Yu - hee', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Daejeon', 'the Korea Herald', 'Shin ’s', 'South Koreans', 'Seoul', 'the KB Financial Group Research Center', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'the National Pension Research Institute', 'korean', 'korean', 'korean', 'Norway', 'U.K.', 'U.S.', 'Taiwan', 'Denmark', 'Poland', 'U.K.', 'Finland', 'Australia', 'Canada', 'Claire Lee']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56273508  0.29990911

In South Korea, an arrest warrant can detain a suspect for up to 48 hours for questioning, then police need a formal detention warrant issued by the court to further take the suspect into custody.The police accuse Han of holding a banned rally, staging a demonstration in an unpermitted place, disrupting traffic, disobeying the police order to disperse, damaging public property and obstructing the execution of police duties in nine protests held this year.  Police are considering additionally charging Han with allegedly inciting violence during the Nov. 14 rally and plotting to pose a threat to public security, which carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison and a financial penalty of up to 15 million won ($12,700).The decision is set to be made after a detention warrant is issued for Han, police officials said. “There are already too many things to investigate to apply for a detention warrant, so it is not realistic to consider adding the sedition charge right now,” a police official said prior to seeking the detention warrant. It has been rare for prosecutors to file sedition charges against protestors. The last time prosecutors applied the charge was in 1986 during the authoritarian Chun Doo-hwan administration when pro-democracy activists threw rocks and firebombs at riot police. Han has remained silent during the probe, the KCTU said in a statement, in the face of what it called a malicious investigation. It said that the police tried to steer the probe in an unfair direction for its leader by accusing him of mobilizing labor union members capable of organizing violent demonstrations. Han has been staging a hunger strike for 12 days.Following the chief’s arrest, the KCTU renewed its pledge to stage an all-out strike on Dec. 16 to oppose the government’s push for labor market reform bills. Another antigovernment street rally is scheduled in central Seoul for Dec. 19. The probe into protestors suspected of committing violence during the Nov. 14 rally has picked up pace, with police having raided the KCTU local branches to collect evidence. So far, police have investigated 731 people related to the Nov. 14 rally, detained 10 and booked 204 without detention.One of the detained is the head of the nation‘s democratic taxi labor union, identified only by his surname Koh, who allegedly smashed windows of police buses and attempted to set fire to the buses. With its chief being detained for police investigation, Choi Jong-jin, a deputy chief of the labor union, will serve as the acting leader, the KCTU said. The nation’s two umbrella labor unions -- KCTU and the Federation of Korean Trade Unions -- have fiercely opposed the government’s labor market reform bills, viewing them as expanding temporary jobs, giving businesses more leeway to dismiss workers.  The government has claimed, on the other hand, the measures are necessary to ease labor regulations, boost the economy and create jobs for the young.At the National Assembly, the rival parties continued to lock horns over the five labor market bills.The ruling Saenuri Party has presented the bills related to labor conditions, insurance for employment and industrial accidents, and temporary workers.The bills stipulate a reduction in working hours, improvement in benefits for the unemployed, extension of hiring of irregular workers, expansion of sectors that can employ temporary workers and adoption of the peak wage system.

This is part of the city’s five-year measures for supporting the employment of young people.  Seoul City Mayor Park Won-soon (second from right) eats sandwiches with NPAD chairman Moon Jae-in and other participants representing the youth at a forum on youth policies on Nov. 19. (Yonhap)About 3,000 of those aged between 19 and 29 in the low-income bracket will benefit from the scheme starting from next year on a trial basis. They will be selected upon review of their applications, officials said. Seoul City said it would inject about 9 billion won into the program in the first year. The city emphasized that the new scheme will work as a social safety net and pave a firm path for self-support for job seekers. According to the city, about 35 percent of Seoulites in their 20s, or 502,000, are either part-time employees or unemployed.Scheme sparks political debateSeoul City’s announcement, however, immediately sparked debate in the political arena, with the ruling party arguing that the new measure is a “populist” measure with political motives ahead of the general elections slated for next year. Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon is a member of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy. While Park will serve as mayor until 2017, he holds heavy sway among liberal voters. The NPAD considers cooperation with Park a key strategy to woo voters.“Although I agree that youth unemployment is a solution-needed issue, ‘purchasing’ the youth’s minds with an allowance is typical populism that is seriously improper,” Saenuri Party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung said. “I warn that the act of buying voters with taxpayers’ money will ultimately return like a boomerang and be judged by residents,” he added. Kim also blasted a similar project pushed by Seongnam City in Gyeonggi Province led by progressive mayor Lee Jae-myung.Earlier this year, Seongnam City vowed to offer 1 million won throughout one year for all youth aged between 19 and 24 who have lived in the city over three years in an aim to support the job-hunting process.Many raised speculations that the ruling party is intentionally criticizing the two city representatives to contain their influence in upcoming elections. Park has competed for the top ranking with Kim in public opinion polls on potential presidential candidates. Seongnam’s Lee has also recently been added to the list of potential candidates after he drew public attention with a series of welfare project proposals, such as free school uniforms for students and free postpartum care centers for mothers. Seoul City, however, refuted the “populist” claim. It argues that, for one, the new project is different from Seongnam’s, as the capital would selectively implement the program based on need, while Seongnam will universally support all young job seekers. Some supporters of the allowance program also assert that a similar welfare benefit scheme was considered by President Park Geun-hye when she led the Grand National Party in 2011. The then-ruling party had contemplated providing 300,000 won subsidies to young job seekers for up to four months.The central government, however, has warned the capital city that such welfare measures should not be unilaterally pursued by the city and must be discussed with the Welfare Ministry. Under social security regulations, municipal heads are mandated to consult with the central government over introducing or changing welfare schemes. Seoul City rebukes the notion.Political tensions escalated last week after the central government revised an ordinance that would pose hurdles to Seoul City’s allowance plan. Under the new rule, the state would be allowed to cut local subsidies if municipalities unilaterally introduced or changed social security schemes without negotiating with the central government first, the Interior Ministry said. “While negotiating welfare measures with the central government is mandatory under the ordinance, there was no penalty for not following the rule. To ensure the effectiveness of the social security regulations, (the government) decided to revise the ordinance,” said Interior Minister Chong Jong-sup. All municipalities receive various subsidies from the state ranging from general and special budgets to real estate subsidies.This year, about 32 trillion won in subsidies have been distributed to cities nationwide, with the majority in general subsidies. This indicates the cities’ heavy reliance on the state’s financial support. Seoul City, however, does not receive general subsidies due to its financial independence. The Seoul Metropolitan Government has expressed “deep regrets” over the government’s move, claiming that such a new rule may breach the local subsidy law. “This is an act that cuts the ‘sprouting’ of grassroots democracy. Local welfare is needed in places the central government is unable to reach,” said Seoul City spokesperson Kim In-cheol. The city claimed that controlling local welfare measures by linking them to local subsidies breaches the core of the local autonomous government system. Under the local subsidy law, cities should return the state’s financial subsidies only if they excessively spend them by violating regulations. The NPAD also expressed concerns.“The ordinance that threatens municipalities with subsidies is apparently unconstitutional and sets back the welfare system,” said NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in on Dec. 2. One day later, however, the Ministry of Government Legislation rebutted Moon by analyzing the legality of the controversial subsidy plan. It concluded that the allowance measure should be discussed with the Welfare Ministry as the idea of the plan is part of the social security concept that universally defines the constitutional ideas of a modern social welfare country. “As the purpose of the youth allowance scheme is to support the youth’s capacity and social participation, it must be considered as part of social services under the social security basic law. While the ministry’s interpretation is not law-binding, it can pose a burden to Seoul City, critics said.Since the interpretation, Seoul City has remained cautious, saying last week that it would independently review the legality of the controversial scheme and that it would take proper steps afterwards. Public divided over allowance plan As the political dispute continues over the city’s youth allowance plan, the public has also been split over the measure’s efficacy. The business sector insists that providing 500,000 won will only waste the people’s money with little positive impact.“Although some claim that (the authorities) should promote youth employment through the allowance, it is difficult to alleviate the youth unemployment rate by sharing money. Youth unemployment originates from the unfair system and practice of the labor market rather than the youth’s financial hardships,” said Ryu Ki-jung, director of the Korea Employers Federation. Even if the new scheme encourages young people to proactively look for jobs, it will likely be difficult to properly monitor the overall process, from selection to proceedings, he added.Youth organizations, on the other hand, sided with the city government’s plan, arguing that it would help those about to give up job-hunting amid the unemployment crisis. Civic group Youth Community Union stressed that the policy support and social safety net are currently severely insufficient in Korea, leaving youth in a dilemma between staying out of work and choosing unwanted jobs.“The most wanted social safety net that the youth seeks is that of recruitment. The government should help the youth whose social connection is weakening over job-hunting challenges,” said policy chief Chung Jun-young at YCU. Some European countries have already run similar programs, he said. In France, for example, the government introduced an allowance scheme in 2012 for young job seekers aged 18 to 26 upon their participation in job training programs. About 50,000 young people in France are expected to have benefitted from the program by the end of this year. In order to ensure the efficacy of the welfare measure, however, sufficient step-by-step employment services must be provided, ranging from counseling to job training, Chung added.

The Seoul Metropolitan Government said it verified circumstantial evidence that the Gangnam district government had systematically posted slandering online comments against the city government while advocating Gangnam district Mayor Shin Yeon-hee from October to November. A total of 11 district officials posted slandering comments on portal website Naver, with six of them each posting over 70 malicious comments, the city claimed. The city said it would conduct another round of probes and consider taking legal measures against the district depending on the results.The city’s move came after a local news outlet reported Tuesday that the Gangnam district office had attempted to sway public opinion online over controversial city projects that have clashed with each other. The district office, however, denied the allegations, claiming the officials merely posted their personal opinions. Since 2012, the city and the district have been at odds over how to develop the slum village Guryong, which is located within Gangnam. The confrontation escalated last year over another project, when the city said it would share the public fund to a neighboring region that the city received from Hyundai Motors after the carmaker purchased the land in Gangnam. The company had offered to pay 1.7 trillion won ($1.44 billion) in public contribution fees in return for changing the legal use of the site. While the city insisted that the majority of the fund would be used on Hyundai Motors’ land as part of its plan to transform the district into a hub for the meetings, incentive tours, conventions and exhibitions industry, Gangnam has argued that the fund should only be used on its region, as it originated from its land. They are also currently clashing over building a second municipal community center in an exhibition center in the district.

According to statistics released by the Korea Institute for Health and Science Affairs, the country’s Gini coefficient, or Gini index, based on expenditures surged to 0.262 last year, nearly equivalent to the figure from 2009, suggesting widening economic disparity. The index reached its highest in 2009 at 0.266, with the figure gradually improving until 2012. The Gini coefficient, developed by an Italian expert, is a statistical measure of dispersion that represents the income distribution of a country’s residents. It helps define the economic disparity between the rich and poor, with a figure nearing 1 indicating worse inequality. Zero indicates perfect equality, with a ratio over 0.4 commonly suggesting severe economic inequality. The index based on residents’ net income recorded 0.294 last year, remaining the same on-year. The ratio remained unchanged for the first time since its gradual improvement until 2013. The ratio had peaked upon the financial crisis in 2008. “The country’s economic disparity suggests that the social security system that is supposed to alleviate inequality has not played its full role. As of now, for instance, various welfare measures, such as national insurance packages, are not fully guaranteed for nonregular workers, compared to regular employees,” said welfare professor Han Chang-keun at Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul. Meanwhile, last year’s overall relative poverty rate improved a little to 13.3 percent, down 0.1 percentage point on-year, according to a separate report from the institute also released Tuesday.The relative poverty rate indicates the rate of households bringing in less than 50 percent of median earnings. It is considered the simplest way to measure a country’s level of poverty. While Korea’s relative poverty rate improved a little, the absolute poverty rate based on market income worsened to 12.2 percent, climbing by 0.5 percentage points compared to 2013. The absolute poverty rate represents the shares of those lacking the minimum amount of income needed to maintain the average standard of living in the country. The absolute poverty rate improved from 2010, but has started to worsen since 2013. Among the poverty rates, the relative poverty rate of single households showed a noticeable downturn, as the figure jumped to 47.6 percent, up by 1.5 percentage points on-year. Single households’ poverty rate reached their highest in 2012 with 48.1 percent, but dropped to 46.9 percent in 2012. The poverty rate of the elderly, children and job seekers all improved by an average of 0.4 percentage point to 47.2 percent, 7 percent and 7.4 percent, respectively.

(Yonhap)Officer Lee, 29, has gotten used to it. As he says, it is nothing dramatic, just grueling tedious work of aiding people in their lives.“I’d say around 80 percent of our cases are somehow related to drinking. When they get drunk, conversation is not an option. Physical abuse occurs frequently,” said Lee, who works at a police substation in Incheon.“People’s cane” is what people call the police in Korea, used to describe a slew of different roles they are expected to carry out for citizens. But the respect they get often falls far short of the authority the heavy-handed nickname suggests.Lee explained that many, especially those decades older than him, look down on young policemen like him. He said the frequent disputes over police abuse forces them to arrest citizens in the most nonviolent way possible, making them more vulnerable to violence. The public’s sensitivity toward police violence is in part linked to police abuses in the past, particularly by the conscribed auxiliary police against pro-democracy protesters in the 1980s. The use of police force at mass rallies continues to be a bitterly divisive issue to this day.Korean police regulations state that the first shot out of a firearm should always be a blank. Officers are entitled to charge citizens who “disrupt public duty” for those who physically abuse or issue threats on an officer, but this is not an easy task. Cops specialized in rescue and security missions at rivers conduct drills to enhance their capabilities in saving people`s lives. (Yonhap)In order to prove such action has taken place, one must take evidence such as CCTV footage -- which is borderline impossible given the generally spontaneous nature of the event -- while testifying to other officers and the prosecution. According to field officers, such actions are often frowned upon by fellow policemen who think they are making a big deal out of nothing.But dealing with the drunks is only part of the job description for policemen; it also includes arresting violent criminals, escorting victims to police stations and therapy centers, and rescuing ambitious hikers and swimmers who bite off more than they can chew.Recently, with President Park Geun-hye urging the passage of the antiterrorist bill in light of the recent deadly Paris attacks, the more serious aspect of the roles of the police has also been highlighted -- to prevent possible terrorism.Last Saturday, the special weapons and tactics unit of Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency held a public antiterrorism drill. The SWAT members demonstrated entering high-rise buildings, a shootout with the terrorists and using police dogs to thwart a bomb attack. Korean police’s domain is not confined to domestic affairs either. Officers and explosives detection dogs at Incheon International Airport Police are entrusted with the task of sniffing out risks imported from overseas. The Korean National Police Agency earlier this week also launched a team comprising forensic experts to be dispatched to protect Koreans in the Philippines following rampant crimes committed against its nationals.But for the majority of the policemen, their work revolves around the everyday lives of citizens, which is no mean feat.A recent story of a 31-year-old woman -- booked for drunken violence -- who defecated in a police station highlighted the absurd levels that Korean officers have to face each day.According to a survey by the Police Science Institute, civilians’ complaints were the highest source of stress for officers, at 4.15 out of 5 points. It was well above promotion/disciplinary actions, dealing with colleagues or even dealing with violent criminals, which respectively stood at 3.85, 3.7 and 3.62.Last week, Korean movie “Veteran” -- about a police officer who get to the bottom of a financial tycoon-related crime -- was selected as the best cop movie of the year.But Lee said the movie is more a fantasy than reality. “Beating up criminals to arrest them? Not a chance, not to mention it is nearly impossible to use firearms,” he said. “Police work is not as dramatic or ideal as people think -- it’s just bottom-line hard work.”By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","terrorism last saturday the special ,thwart bomb attack korean police ,buildings shootout with the terrorists ,ample amounts of korean barbecue ,last week korean movie veteran","['Incheon', 'korean', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Incheon', 'Korea', 'Lee', 'korean', 'CCTV', 'Park Geun', 'Paris', 'Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency', 'SWAT', 'korean', 'Incheon International Airport Police', 'the Korean National Police Agency', 'Koreans', 'Philippines', 'korean', 'the Police Science Institute', 'korean', 'Lee', 'Yoon Min - sik']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59786206  0.90763372

The Saturday rally to criticize police and support the farmer was originally banned by the police, but a local court on Thursday ruled that the ban was ""unjust,"" giving the event the greenlight.A farmers' association will also hold a cultural event at Gwanghwamun Plaza, hoping for the 69-year-old's recovery.Civic groups have vowed multiple times to hold a peaceful rally.Police said they would not have water cannons or barricades at the rally, but may utilize them if it turns violent, for instance, if demonstrators attempt to march toward Cheong Wa Dae, the presidential office.""(We) must root out illegal, violent protests by certain people, which many citizens are concerned about recently, in order to establish rule of law,"" Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn said Friday at a commencement ceremony at the Korea National Defense University.A survey by Gallup Korea showed that 60 percent of respondents approved an amendment banning the use of masks during rallies or protests, about double those who opposed the bill, which remained at 32 percent. The poll also showed that 48 percent were opposed to the use of police vehicles to create barricades during street rallies, slightly above those who support the use, which was 42 percent.A rough majority of people who voted positively to the mask bill also supported prohibiting the use of police buses during protests.""Apart from ideology, (it seems like people) are supportive of non-violent protests in terms of demonstrators and a police reaction (that does not ignite) controversy over excessive use of force,"" an official from Gallup said. The survey was conducted on 1,005 adults between Tuesday and Thursday, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.Last month, some 30 ruling Saenuri Party lawmakers, led by National Assembly Vice Speaker Jeong Kab-yoon, proposed an amendment to the law on assembly and demonstration, banning participants in violent rallies or protests from wearing masks or other apparel that hides their identity.(Yonhap)","in downtown seoul to protest ,saturday rally to criticize police ,police buses during protests apart ,downtown seoul to protest ,downtown seoul to protest the","['Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'the Korea National Defense University', 'Gallup Korea', 'Gallup', 'Saenuri Party', 'National Assembly', 'Jeong Kab - yoon']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.39267835  0.05275842

The figures are higher than the previous year's tally of 78.5 years and 85.1 years.   This means a baby boy born last year has a 56.8 percent chance of reaching 80, while the chances of a baby girl becoming an octogenarian stood at 77.9 percent. Corresponding numbers for a boy reaching 65 stood at 86.5 percent and 94.3 percent for a girl.  The life expectancies for male and female babies here are 1.2 years and 2.4 years longer than the average for member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the report showed.  Among members of the 34 developed market economies with high income, South Korea's life expectancy for men ranked 17th, while those for women stood at fourth place.   The gap in life expectancy between men and women stood pat compared to the year before at 6.5 years.  South Korea's gap is higher than the 5.2 year average for the OECD as a whole, and on par with countries like France and Japan.  ""Although the life expectancy gap did not become smaller in 2014, there has been an ongoing trend of men catching up with women,"" the statistical office said. It said one reason for this development is less men succumbing to liver-related diseases. In 1985, the gap stood at 8.4 years.  The chances that a person could die of cancer in the future stood at 28.4 percent for male babies and 16.9 percent for female babies. Both numbers are up vis-a-vis 2014 when they stood at 28.1 percent and 16.6 percent.  If the death risk from cancer is excluded, the life expectancies for male and female babies would increase by 4.8 year and 2.8 years, each, the report said.     The latest report also showed among babies born last year, a male baby could expect to enjoy 64.9 years of healthy living while the number for girls was slightly higher at 65.9 years.  Among regions, people living in Seoul and surrounding Gyeonggi Province have the highest life expectancy, while they were the lowest for the industrial city of Ulsan and mountainous Gangwon Province.  The difference, the office said, stems from the availability of medical services, income levels and other social considerations. (Yonhap)","korean babies born in 2014 ,babies would increase by year ,16 percent for female babies ,babies born last year male ,babies born in 2014 are","['south korean', 'Statistics Korea', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', ""South Korea 's"", ""South Korea 's"", 'OECD', 'France', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Ulsan', 'Gangwon Province']",11,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.81176585  1.00825953

It said it would spray paint into the crowd at the upcoming rallies to better distinguish protestors committing violence and arrest them on the spot while setting up roadblocks with police buses. The move came two days after the police banned the forthcoming antigovernment demonstration planned in Seoul this weekend and a day after the rally organizers ― Korean Confederation of Trade Unions and Korean Peasants League ― pledged to go ahead with the protest despite the ban. The police did not allow the organizers to hold the protest near City Hall, citing violence that could possibly break out during the event. But the nation’s second-largest umbrella labor union and farmers’ group lashed out at the decision, accusing the government of denying constitutional rights and slipping back into past authoritarian rule. Under the Constitution, the freedom of expression and rights to hold assemblies are stipulated as basic rights for citizens, with authorities required to grant the permit for a “lawful” protest upon declaration. But a lower law stipulates that the police can ban any rally that could “clearly disrupt public order and inflict damage upon the people via violence, threat and arson.” But the police’s heavy-handed measures, coupled with President Park Geun-hye’s pointed remark against masked protesters last week, appeared to be backfiring, with netizens taking to social media to lampoon her remarks and graffiti satirizing the president ― a daughter of former dictator Park Chung-hee ― popping up across the nation. Shortly after her calls for a ban on mask-wearing protestors, netizens posted comments like “Let’s hold a dance party wearing masks in the upcoming rally. It only costs 8,400 won per mask!”President Park Geun-hye led the campaign against what she denounced as illegal, violent rallies by calling for a ban on masked protests and likening the masked participants to Islamic State group terrorists. A well-known novelist Lee We-soo said in his tweet, “If the bill barring protestors from wearing masks passes, will the Mask King also be abolished?” he said, referring to the popular TV singing competition in which professional singers stage a performance while wearing masks to hide their identity. On Monday, graffiti of a masked person appeared on the walls in various locations in western Seoul near Hongik University and Sinchon Station. In the painting, the woman covers her whole face with a mask, with the number 51.6 percent underneath her. The graffiti appears to depict President Park as she earned 51.6 percent of the votes in the 2012 presidential election. Progressive Seoul City Mayor Park Won-soon also joined the fray, saying the government blocking rallies by police vehicles or banning use of masks posed questions over the country’s democracy level.“The most basic part of democracy is the freedom to express and think. And only through that can an individual’s creativity shine,” Park said in a speech at Seoul National University. “It is only right that the central government take on a more open approach, and rather than banning them through oppression, seek the reason and fix the cause of why these people are rallying and protesting.”In a survey conducted by pollster Realmeter, 54.6 percent of the respondents were against the bill barring protestors from covering their faces with masks, with 40.8 percent supporting such a policy. About 5 percent of them did not have clear opinions. The Dec. 5 rally followed a mass protest held on Nov. 14, the largest in more than seven years, by labor, civic and farmers’ groups. Some 70,000 people took to the street to oppose the government’s push to reintroduce state-issued textbooks, open agricultural markets and reform the labor sector. The demonstration spiraled into violence, with police firing tear gas and water cannons to stop protestors from marching toward the presidential office, which divided the nation over who was to blame for the violent protests. The police directly aiming a water cannon at a protestor trying to pull down police bus barricades left Baek Nam-gi, a 69-year-old farmer, to remain unconscious as of Monday. On the other hand, the police claimed that the violence during the rally incurred 389 million won ($340,320) worth of damage to police equipment and injured 113 officers. Since the protest, the police vowed zero tolerance for any violence committed during rallies, raiding the Nov. 14 protest organizers’ offices and bringing in 401 people for questioning on charges of leading what it called illegal rallies. Following the president’s criticisms against masked protesters, Rep. Jung Gap-yoon of the ruling Saenuri Party scrambled to table a bill to legalize the ban on protestors wearing masks during demonstrations. The bill was presented as protestors wearing masks make it difficult for the police to check their identities and collect evidence to arrest them, the lawmaker said. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","the violent protests the police ,masks in the upcoming rally ,dec rally followed mass protest ,the protest the police vowed ,government blocking rallies by police","['Seoul', 'korean Confederation of Trade Unions', 'Korean Peasants League', 'Park Geun - hye', 'netizen', 'Park Chung - hee', 'netizen', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Islamic State', 'Lee We - soo', 'Seoul', 'Hongik University', 'Park', 'Seoul City', 'Park Won - soon', 'Park', 'Seoul National University', 'realmeter', 'Baek Nam - gi', 'Jung Gap - yoon', 'Saenuri Party']",4,"[ 0.00000000e+00  0.00000000e+00  2.00000000e+00 ... -4.38517928e-01

Korea activists vow to hold planned protest despite ban,"  South Korea's major labour group vowed Sunday to hold a massive anti-government protest this week, a day after authorities banned the rally over concerns it could turn violent.    The planned demonstration on Saturday follows a major protest earlier this month -- the largest in more than seven years -- that saw police clash with demonstrators.    Critics say the conservative government of President Park Geun-H...","South Korea's major labour group vowed Sunday to hold a massive anti-government protest this week, a day after authorities banned the rally over concerns it could turn violent.    The planned demonstration on Saturday follows a major protest earlier this month -- the largest in more than seven years -- that saw police clash with demonstrators.    Critics say the conservative government of President Park Geun-Hye, daughter of the late heavy-handed ruler Park Chung-Hee, is slipping back into past authoritarian rule.   The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions said the police ban on the planned march was ""unconstitutional"" and vowed to press ahead with the march.     ""Such ban is an outright denial of constitutional rights... and was prevalent only during dictatorship,"" the umbrella union said in a statement, referring to the 1960-70s era military rule under Park Chung-Hee.    ""Our plan to hold the rally remains unchanged,"" the group added.     Police had on Saturday banned the planned demonstration scheduled for December 5, citing safety concerns.    The protesters are demanding that Seoul scrap its labour reform plan that critics say would make it easier for firms to fire workers. They are also calling for the government to cancel a controversial scheme to impose state-issued history textbooks in schools.    The protests on November 14 -- involving more than 60,000 people -- led to violent clashes with police, who sprayed water cannons and pepper spray at demonstrators.    Police have come under fire for what critics describe as excessive use of force that left dozens injured and one protester in critical condition after he was hit by a water cannon.   President Park condemned the rally as an effort to ""deny the rule of law"" and urged strong measures against those identified as inciting violence.   Park also called for a ban on wearing masks during demonstrations, drawing parallels between masked protesters and the Islamic State group -- prompting angry reactions from opponents.

40,40,Labor union vows protest regardless of police ban,"One of South Korea’s largest umbrella trade unions Sunday vowed to push ahead with its plan to host a mass antigovernment rally on Dec. 5, despite facing heat from the government and the police’s recent ban on a similar demonstration on the same day by a local farmers’ group over concerns about violence.“Our plan to hold the protests remains unchanged, and all responsibilities for events that may take place on De...","One of South Korea’s largest umbrella trade unions Sunday vowed to push ahead with its plan to host a mass antigovernment rally on Dec. 5, despite facing heat from the government and the police’s recent ban on a similar demonstration on the same day by a local farmers’ group over concerns about violence.“Our plan to hold the protests remains unchanged, and all responsibilities for events that may take place on Dec. 5 falls on the administration.” said Park Seong-shik, spokesman for the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions. “The KCTU has made it clear that (the Dec.5) rally will be a peaceful one unless (the police) block our path with bus barricades and water cannons.” Although the authorities have yet to approve or prohibit the rally, he added that the group will hold the rally regardless of whether or not the police give the go-ahead. The move by the KCTU came on the heels of the police banning another massive rally by the Korean Peasants League. The KPL had given notice of a plan to hold a rally drawing some 10,000 participants near City Hall in Jung-gu, central Seoul to police, who shot it down Saturday, citing the possibility that violence could break out at the event.Although Korean law stipulates that authorities must grant the permit for a “lawful” protest upon declaration, it also states that any rally that “will clearly disrupt public order and inflict damage upon the people via violence, threat, arson” can be banned. Police said as the KPL was one of leading groups of the Nov. 14 antigovernment rally ― which the government has labelled a “violent and illegal” protest ― its December demonstration is likely to turn violent as well.The KPL has pledged to proceed with the protests as scheduled, seeking a court injunction to overturn the police ban. Both the government and the ruling Saenuri Party has moved to ban the KCTU’s protests as well. Saenuri leader Kim Moo-sung claimed Friday that authorities should not allow the protests, and said that the country’s per capita income would have already exceeded $30,000 “if it were not for KCTU that frequently carries out radical illegal protests.”The KCTU chimed in to denounce the police ban on the KPL protest, calling it a “dictatorial” move and a “blatant denial” of the right to assembly stipulated in the Constitution.The Dec. 5 rally is a follow-up to the November protests that decried the government’s much-disputed policies of reinstating government-issued textbooks, opening agricultural markets and reforming the labor sector. The government and the Saenuri remain at loggerheads with the participating groups and the opposition over who is to blame for the escalation of violence at the rally and scores of injuries suffered by both the police and the protesters, the worst of which was suffered by a 69-year-old farmer who remained in a coma as of Sunday.Last week, Park called for a ban on masked protests and warned she would not tolerate “illegal protests.” But her comparison likening the masked participants to Islamic State group terrorists touched off a furious reaction from civic groups and opposition lawmakers alike.Another controversy erupted recently after unconfirmed claims that a police water cannon deliberately aimed at an injured protester being carried from the scene in an ambulance. An association of local medical students is planning a collective action in protest of the alleged abuse by law enforcement.In addition to saying it would push ahead with protests, the KCTU also expressed concern over recent reports that police are planning to raid a Buddhist temple to arrest KCTU chief Han Sang-kyun ― who took refuge there on accusations of his part in leading what police claimed were an illegal protest. The umbrella union also warned against the National Assembly discussing labor reforms, which encompass thorny issues such as the definition of regular wage and expanding scope of temporary work. It vowed to initiate a general strike on the event of Han’s arrest or the labor reforms bill’s deliberation.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","police banning another massive rally ,mass antigovernment rally on dec ,illegal protest its december demonstration ,banning another massive rally ,hold rally drawing some 10","['South Korea ’s', 'Park Seong - shik', 'the korean Confederation of Trade Unions', 'kctu', 'the Korean Peasants League', 'KPL', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'KPL', 'KPL', 'Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'KPL', 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'Islamic State', 'KCTU', 'buddhist', 'KCTU', 'Han Sang - kyun', 'the National Assembly', 'Han']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.17448199 -0.07553392

According to the NPA, 113 police officers were injured during the protest, 50 police buses were damaged and 231 items of police equipment, including walkie-talkies and rain coats, were lost or broken.

Students from the North also appeared to be more interested in reunification overall, with 66 percent and 31 percent of them saying they were “very interested” or “somewhat interested,” respectively.The largest portion, or 46 percent, of the South Korean respondents were “somewhat interested,” but 37 percent said they were not that interested.“The survey showed that students that defected from the North had higher interest in unification and recognition of its need compared to South Korean students. The results would be of meaningful reference in the future when the two Koreas eventually go through social integration,” Story K said.While most South Korean students said reunification was “somewhat” (43 percent) or “not really” (27 percent) needed, defectors deemed it was “very much” (85 percent) or “somewhat” (13 percent) needed.The majority, or 71.6 percent, of South Korean youths saw the need to wait until conditions mature for the two Koreas to reunify, as opposed to 53.9 percent of young defectors who said reunification should be realized as soon as possible at all costs. All respondents, meanwhile, shared a similar perception on the process of reunification, with 47.5 percent of South Koreans and 46 percent of defectors saying it would be possible when the current North Korean regime collapses. Upon reunification, most native South Koreans (69.3 percent) and defectors (66.1 percent) said the two Koreas should be integrated into a system of liberal democracy. Some 15.2 percent of South Koreans and 16.7 percent of defectors said the systems of the two Koreas should be integrated with compromise.With preparing the foundation for peaceful reunification being one of the key policies of the Park Geun-hye administration, the government has been moving to reinforce education regarding reunification from an early stage. A presidential committee for unification preparation was launched in July 2014, while Park has emphasized the government’s controversial reintroduction of state-authored history textbooks for secondary education was ultimately aimed at preparing for reunification by learning the “right” history.Most recently, the Unification Ministry said on Tuesday that it would develop teaching aids to be used at child care centers and kindergartens from next year to educate toddlers and preschoolers of the need for reunification.From news reports","korean defectors currently attending universities ,born students survey showed thursday ,53 percent of young defectors ,most south korean students said ,180 north korean defectors currently","['North Korea', 'South Korea', 'Story K', 'South Koreans', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'south korean', 'south korean', 'Koreas', 'Story K', 'south korean', 'south korean', 'Koreas', 'South Koreans', 'north korean', 'South Koreans', 'Koreas', 'South Koreans', 'Koreas', 'Park', 'the Unification Ministry']",11,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46088746  0.9100154

This is up from 38.7 percent reported in the previous year.  Despite feeling the pressure, the general public said the country needed more medical facilities and welfare support centers.  People, moreover, called for additional employment support, as well as assistance in medical and health-related areas. Demand for hiring support stood at 33.5 percent, while the number of medical and health-related support was 19.4 percent.

Reacting to the demonstration, President Park Geun-hye on Tuesday called for a ban on wearing face masks during protests, likening the masked protestors to IS terrorists.But Park’s tough rhetoric ― which came as police mulled banning a second mass antigovernment rally on Dec. 5 ― appears to have backfired, with civic groups and the opposition accusing the leader of “waging war on her people.”Park Ju-min, a member of the Lawyers for a Democratic Society also known as Minbyun, said in a radio interview that her comments were “inappropriate as a leader of a democratic nation.”“These people took to the streets to exercise their fundamental rights, and it is not appropriate to compare them to terrorists. ... I felt that (Park administration) is moving toward the direction of repressing the people’s rights to express their will,” he said. Two protesters look after a farmer lying on the ground after he was sprayed by a water cannon during the Nov. 14 antigovernment mass rally in Jongno, Seoul, in this file photo. (Yonhap)The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy accused Park of “using politics to induce division and confrontation (of people)” while the minor opposition Justice Party said Park is regarding her own people as “an object of repression.”Choi Seung-gun, a 20-year-old student who participated in the rally, said that Park’s comments likening them to the IS was just “ridiculous.”“Because of all the tear gas, many of us has to wear the masks. Yes, the IS hides their faces. Well they eat, too, so does that mean we can’t eat? That just shows you our president’s class,” he said.Last week, Choi garnered media attention after claims that he was shot by water cannons while being carried off by medical staff. The “attack” on Choi, coupled with an incident where a 69-year-old farmer Baek Nam-gi was knocked down by a water cannon blast ― mixed with tear gas ― and remains unconscious as of Wednesday, touched off a blame game over the legitimacy of the police force used during the rally. While the local human rights watchdog labeled it “an attack against civilians” police said that it was an “unfortunate accident” that occurred during necessary use of water cannon to disperse violent protestors.According to the National Police Agency, the protests caused 389 million won ($340,320) worth of damage to the police equipment, while 113 officers were injured by protesters. It accused 594 protestors of using excessive violence in the demonstration. But protestors, along with eyewitnesses, blame the police for crossing the line while containing the protests. Goh Eun-san, a medical student at the Yonsei University Wonju Campus, said the attack on Choi was particularly uncalled for, as he was attacked while being carried off to a hospital. He said in an online posting Friday that the ethics and pride of practicing medicine was “trampled” when an injured man was attacked.Citing a medical law prohibiting any form of attack against an emergency patient, he urged action against what he called “an act against humanity.”“Right now we are gathering signatures to convene an emergency meeting of the Association of Medical Students. We may hold the meeting next week,” he said. The association is expected to discuss Choi’s incident at the meeting, and urge the government to punish those involved and make sure that such incidents do not reoccur.Kang Sin-myeong, the chief of NPA, denied that the water cannons were aiming for the patient. But Choi said Kang’s explanations were unlikely as the supposed spraying went on for at least a minute.The civic demonstration on Nov. 14, the largest since 2008, was organized by civic groups across the country to protest the government’s recent decision to reform the labor sector, open the agricultural market and reinstate the government-issued state textbooks for secondary education. Controversy over violent rallies is expected to persist as the opposing parties are at loggerheads over Park’s emphasis on banning masked protests. Rep. Jeong Kab-yoon of the ruling Saenuri Party proposed a bill which bans participants from wearing masks during violent protests. Non-violent protests or demonstrations where participant have a legitimate reason to wear masks ― such as illness ― are allowed. Violation can result in a maximum two years behind bars or 3 million won in fine. The bill also stepped up the regulation on weapons. The previous law only punished those who used them but an amendment will discipline anyone who makes, transports and stores weapons. It also restricts protests when colleges hold the admission process, such as interviews or essays.“Although freedom of assembly is a constitutional right, the violent and illegal protests are disturbing the social order each year. The purpose of the bill is to establish a culture of law-abiding demonstration by putting our foot down on violent protests,” he said.Rep. Kim Young-nam of the same party pointed out that even many European countries which have advanced laws to protect human rights regulate wearing masks during demonstrations.But Park of Minbyun said that violence at Korean protests are different from those in countries where masks are prohibited.“In those countries, protestors are reported to have committed robbery or arson. There haven’t been any reports of such cases in Korea. The physical altercation (for Korea) usually occurs between protesters and police attempting to disperse them,” he said.Rep. Kim Kwang-jin of the NPAD said that the Constitutional Court in 2003 has already ruled that choosing one’s own attire is part of the freedom of assembly.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","education controversy over violent rallies ,banning second mass antigovernment rally ,cannon to disperse violent protestors ,violent protests he said rep ,violence at korean protests","['Park Geun', 'Park', 'Ju - min', 'the Lawyers for a Democratic Society', 'Minbyun', 'Jongno', 'Seoul', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Justice Party', 'Park', 'Park ’s', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Baek Nam - gi', 'the National Police Agency', 'Goh Eun - san', 'the Yonsei University Wonju Campus', 'Choi', 'the Association of Medical Students', 'Choi ’s', 'Kang sin - myeong', 'Choi', 'Kang ’s', 'Park ’s', 'Jeong Kab - yoon', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Young - nam', 'european', 'Minbyun', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Kim Kwang - jin', 'the Constitutional Court']",4,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.03809857 0.22223911 0.34756109]

The country has one of the lowest birthrates among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development member states.  The statistical agency said there were no clear cut reasons for the dip.For the first nine months of 2015, childbirths edged up 0.7 percent on-year to about 336,400 babies, according to the report.  In 2014, 435,400 babies were born in Asia's fourth-largest economy, down 0.2 percent on-year. The drop also followed a 9.9 percent plunge in the previous year.  The latest report then showed about 19,000 couples tied the knot in September, down 1.6 percent from a year earlier.  The number of newlyweds is a good indicator of future childbirths as very few children are born to single-parent families here.   The number of marriages dropped 5.4 percent last year to 305,500, following a 1.3 percent contraction in 2013.  For the January-August period, about 220,300 couples got married, down 0.1 percent from the same period last year.  In September, the number of divorces fell 11.1 percent on-year to about 8,800. In the January-September period, the number of divorces shrank 6.7 percent on-year to about 80,500.  The number of deaths, meanwhile, edged up 0.9 percent on-year to some 21,400 during the month.

There are currently no vaccines or treatment for the disease.  South Korea, meanwhile, has reported no new cases since July 4, with the World Health Organization declaring the country as entering a ""end of transmission"" phase.   Under WHO regulations, an official end to the outbreak can be declared 28 days after the last patient is declared recovered, although in the case of South Korea, health authorities may not make a formal declaration.

Co-chairs of the group are Lee Jasmine from South Korea; Mike Honda from the U.S.; Yonah Martin from Canada; Melissa Lee from New Zealand; Fiona Claire Bruce from Britain, and former Canadian lawmaker Joy Smith.  ""IPCVSS shares the views that restoration of honor and dignity of victims is mandatory. Countries and non-state actors shall be encouraged to officially apologize for historical and/or current sexual violence perpetrated by its armed forces,"" the lawmakers said in a prepared statement read during the news conference.  The coalition's ""first action will be to seek to unearth facts and call on responsible governments to officially apologize for the acts of abducting by force or mobilizing and deceiving girls and women from the Asia Pacific region as sexual slaves, the so-called comfort women, for its own military during World War II,"" they said.  ""The resolution of the Japanese military's comfort women issue will serve as a model for addressing the issue of girls and women's wartime human rights for future generations,"" the lawmakers said.  The coalition plans to hold an international conference on the issue next year.  Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mainly from Korea, which was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. But Japan has long attempted to water down and deny responsibility for the atrocity.  The sexual slavery issue has been the biggest thorn in frayed relations between Japan and South Korea, with Seoul demanding Tokyo take steps to address the grievances of elderly Korean victims and Japan refusing to do so.  Early this month, South Korean President Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe held the first summit talks between the two countries in more than three years and agreed to accelerate negotiations to resolve the issue.

As the police targeted the face and upper body of protestors, many sustained fractures and bleeding.Citing the recent research, the civic group also pointed out that spraying the water mixed with tear gas on the human body may cause serious problems, including skin rashes, hives, irritation and temporary blindness. In response, the police argued that it was inevitable to use the water cannons to stop protestors committing violence and did not plan to stop using the 19 water cannons to break up “violent” protestors.“It is unfortunate that Baek sustained an injury, but it was a rare accident that took place while stopping violent protests,” the police said.  National Police Agency chief Kang Sin-myeong (right) attends a parliamentary meeting Monday on security and public administration. (Yonhap)The police also cited the data that shows a significant drop in the number of “violent” protests and injuries for police officers since it began employing the water cannons in 2005. The number of rallies that spiraled into violence halved from 128 in the 1999-2005 period to 52 in the 2006-2014 period, with the number of police injuries also having decreased from 614 to 281 during the same period. The police also defended the decision to set up bus barricades to shut down Gwanghwamun Square and bar protestors from marching toward the presidential office. “The police bus barricades were not used to deter the protestors from marching, but they were employed to prevent occurrences of violence,” Kang Sin-myeong, the National Police Agency commissioner general, said at a parliamentary meeting held Monday.“Protestors destroyed the police line and tried climbing up the buses, and they attempted to cross into the area they were banned from,” he said. But opposition lawmaker Rep. Jin Seon-mi of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy slammed the police for overusing force, citing a ruling made by the Constitutional Court in 2009. The 2009 ruling outlawed the use of police bus barricades, as they severely disrupt the free movement of the public. The rival party lawmakers, meanwhile, each introduced revision bills for the Demonstration and Public Assembly Act, with the ruling Saenuri Party defining the rally as a “violent protest,” while the NPAD accused the police of cracking down on the public’s freedom of speech.Rep. Jin of the opposition party, along with 16 other lawmakers, presented a bill banning the police bus barricades. “The police are abusing their power to set up police barricades with buses, as there are no clear rules stipulating the use of the barricade. The bill will guarantee the public freedom of holding public assemblies by barring the police from stopping them with the police buses,” she said. Rep. Jung Gap-yoon of the ruling party, meanwhile, plans to submit a revision Tuesday that forbids protestors from covering their faces with masks. Meanwhile, the KCTU, the nation’s second-largest umbrella union group that led the Nov. 14 rally, hinted at another mass rally in central Seoul on Dec. 5. Accusing the government of steering public opinion against the labor union to dodge responsibility for the deadly crackdown, it vowed an all-out war against the oppressive government in a press briefing held near Cheong Wa Dae. “We are determined to defy the crackdown and maintain our posture to fight against the government’s plan for labor market reform,” the press release read. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","monday protestors destroyed the police ,held monday protestors destroyed the ,meeting held monday protestors destroyed ,violent protests the police said ,held monday protestors destroyed","['Seoul', 'Baek Nam - gi', 'Baek', 'National Police Agency', 'Kang Sin - myeong', 'Kang sin - myeong', 'the National Police Agency', 'Jin Seon - mi', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'the Constitutional Court', 'the Demonstration and Public Assembly Act', 'Saenuri Party', 'NPAD', 'Jin', 'Jung Gap - yoon', 'KCTU', 'Seoul', 'Cheong']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66118532  0.00748299

In recent years, access to Campania, Puglia, Calabria and Sicily has improved markedly, due to extensive modernization of infrastructure, such as high-speed trains, highways and international airports, the ambassador noted.

One protestor remains in critical condition. Police officers seize evidence from the office of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions in Seoul on Saturday. YonhapThe union officials are suspected of premeditating and leading the violent protest in the rally with plans to assault the police with metal pipes and break police equipment, according to police.The police had confirmed that three cars from the KCTU’s office transported the attack items such as ladders, ropes and metal pipes to the protest site. The police said they secured documents, computer drives and several items, including ladders, hammers and metal pipes, from the KCTU’s headquarters. They said they also seized a police walkie-talkie and helmet in the office. The investigators said they would probe the seized items and look into if there were any conspirators or masterminds for the violent clash, they added.The labor union resisted the search and seizure, claiming the police were attempting to water down the rising public criticism over the police’s excessive use of force after a 69-year-old farmer was seriously injured in the rally.“When the police do not offer any apology to the protestor who is hovering between life and death because of the police’s water cannons, they are trying to avoid public criticism by suppressing the public,” said the KCTU. “The government will face strong costs.”The labor union argued that publicizing the seized items is the government’s attempt to manipulate public opinion by making the organization appear to be a violent group. It claimed that hammers, ropes, walkie-talkies and other equipment were not used in the massive rally. This is the first time the KCTU’s headquarters have been raided since it was established in 1995. On Nov. 14, over 130,000 demonstrators from 53 labor unions and civic groups took to the streets against the government’s moves to adopt state-issued history textbooks and institute labor reform. The rally turned violent as riot police armed with water cannons clashed with demonstrators holding metal pipes, leaving one protestor in a coma after he was hit by the water attack. On Friday, the police also launched a task force to file a compensation lawsuit against the labor union for damages incurred in the demonstration, authorities said.Last week, investigators arrested six protestors for aggressively destroying police equipment in the rally and assaulting police officers. An arrest warrant was also issued for KTCU head Han Sang-gyun, who has taken shelter at the Jogye Temple in the capital to avoid arrest.As the standoff has continued between the police and Han, the temple monks said they would intervene in the case upon Han’s request. The temple’s conflict resolution committee will hold a discussion on how to help the two sides solve the confrontation, the temple said. The committee was launched in 2010 as some protestors have tended to seek shelter in the temple to avoid arrest since the mid-2000s.

Having graduated with a bachelor’s degree in political philosophy from a state university in California, Yoon has remained unemployed for almost two years since finishing his mandatory military service.“I thought the applicant like me who speaks fluent English and has work experience would have little trouble getting a job in Korea,” said Yoon. He applied to more than 30 companies, his confidence buoyed by the fact that he had received a “global education” in the U.S. since he was in elementary school. “Now I am afraid that my 15-year endeavor in the U.S. will come to nothing,” he said. A young jobseeker looks at a job posting on a bulletin board. YonhapHis frustration in finding a job in Korea reflects a changing trend among Koreans who once considered studying overseas as a ticket to success back home. Education authorities said Tuesday that the number of students who went abroad to study has plunged by two-thirds over the past eight years. According to statistics released by the Ministry of Education and Korean Educational Development Institute, 10,907 students left Korea to study overseas in 2014. In 2006 the number was 29,511. Of those in 2014, about 40 percent were elementary school students, with 34 percent being middle school students and 26 percent high school students. The 2006 statistics showed about 46 percent were elementary school students while 31 percent and 23 percent were middle and high school students, respectively. The number of Korean students who went overseas to study has fluctuated throughout the 2000s. Since 2000, when sending young children abroad to study became popular among parents, the number of students has increased annually with 2000 marking 4,397, 2001 showing 7,944 and 2002 at 10,132. Having peaked in 2006 when 29,511 left Korea to study, the number has been declining since then with 27,668 students in 2007, 27,349 students in 2008 and 18,118 during the 2009 financial crisis. Education officials estimated that, if trends continue, the total number of students studying abroad in 2015 would be less than 10,000. They attributed this to the widespread notion among young students that studying overseas does not automatically connect to better job prospects at home. “Back in previous days, students believed that studying abroad would help them get a better job. ... But those benefits don’t seem to exist anymore. Also, there are many domestic schools where students can learn English (without young students going abroad),” said officials from the Ministry of Education. Human resources departments at Korean companies agreed that those who have studied overseas do not necessary land better jobs than their competitors who lack overseas educational experience.  “Admittedly, companies are worried whether those who have graduated from colleges overseas would adjust to Korea’s unique working environment. If all things are equal among the applicants, I would prefer those who are familiar with Korea’s work ethics,” said an anonymous recruiter from a Korean retail conglomerate.

The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy accused the authorities of using “excessive violence against the people” and illegal counteraction.Both vowed to take stern measures against those responsible as the political standoff aggravated over a number of contentious issues including security, education and economy as the parties head toward the parliamentary race next April.“These so-called professional demonstrators who aim to push society into confusion made the Gwanghwamun area, the heart of this country, into a lawless world,” Saenuri chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung said.  Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn pays a visit to a police conscript who was injured during the Saturday rally at a hospital in Seoul, Monday. (Yonhap)Saenuri floor leader Rep. Won Yoo-chul questioned their motive citing the distribution at the site of papers that were written with phrases like “Oppose dissolution of the UPP” or “Release Lee Seok-ki.” The Unified Progressive Party was dissolved by the Constitutional Court last year citing its plot for a rebellion. UPP lawmaker Rep. Lee Seok-ki was convicted of plotting to overthrow the government in the event of a war with the communist North.“We must firmly trace whether there were any rebellious forces behind the rally,” Won said.Their remarks were echoed by other senior and rookie members of the party with some likening it to a “riot,” and some comparing it to last week’s Paris terrorist attacks by saying, “Violence that is controlled by radical antiestablishment forces must be removed fundamentally.”The NPAD, meanwhile, called the incumbent government “abnormal” for dealing with “innocent people with violence.”“This government only excels in killing the people’s livelihood and oppressing the public,” said NPAD chairman Moon Jae-in. “It must listen to the outcry of the people against youth unemployment, the retrogressive revision of the labor law and price slump of agricultural products.” NPAD lawmakers watch a video footage of a protestor being doused with water cannons during the Saturday rally at a party meeting on Monday. (Yonhap)NPAD Rep. Joo Seung-yong citied the 2011 ruling by the Constitutional Court that found police buses barricading the Seoul Plaza as unconstitutional for blocking citizens’ right for free movement, calling the latest barricade unconstitutional.The party’s floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul said the serious injury suffered by demonstrator Baek Nam-gi, who underwent brain surgery after he fell as police doused him with water cannons, was equivalent to the Sewol ferry captain “murdering” the passengers -- referring to Lee Jun-seok, who was sentenced to life imprisonment for neglecting his duty to evacuate passengers when the ferry sank off in April 2014, killing 304. The protests, arranged by the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions and joined by labor, civic and farmers’ groups, turned violent on Saturday afternoon as police clashed with demonstrators attempting to march through Gwanghwamun Square toward the presidential office by pulling down barricades set up by police buses. The clashes left one critically injured, 51 arrested and 50 police buses damaged. Some 113 police officers were wounded while the KCTU claimed at least 500 were injured by the “excessive police force.” A total of 182,000 liters of water and 651 liters of capsaicin were used.From news reports","groups turned violent on saturday ,injured during the saturday rally ,2014 killing 304 the protests ,over the violence at rally ,buses damaged some 113 police","['Seoul', 'Saenuri Party', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Gwanghwamun', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Seoul', 'Won Yoo', 'Lee Seok - ki', 'the Unified Progressive Party', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Lee Seok - ki', 'Won', 'Paris', 'NPAD', 'Moon Jae - in', 'npad', 'Joo Seung - yong', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Lee Jong - kul', 'Baek Nam - gi', 'Lee Jun - seok', 'the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions', 'KCTU']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53296751  0.10713769

Looking frightened, they confronted protestors of similar age who took to the streets against the government’s push to reintroduce state-authored history textbooks. “I was too afraid to be there. ... I was pushed for one hour by angry protestors while trying to block them. Water mixed with tear gas dropped on my head. ... I just wanted to get away from the scene,” a conscript who was at the scene said on the condition of anonymity. “They could be my friends, you know?”  A citizen washes tear gas from the face of a conscripted policeman during a mass rally in Gwanghwamun, Seoul, Saturday. The picture posted on Twitter has been shared among numerous social media and online communities. (Twitter)He is one of the young conscripts who chose to serve their 21-month mandatory national service in the police rather than in the military. The conscripts recruited by the National Police Agency are mostly dispatched to help maintain public order at protest sites across the nation. In the rallies held at various locations in Seoul from Saturday afternoon, some 70,000 demonstrators, led by labor, civic, student and farmers’ groups, gathered to protest the government’s plan to adopt state-issued history textbooks, reform labor regulations and open up the agricultural market.The demonstrations turned violent as the protestors tried to pull down the police bus barricades in order to march through Gwanghwamun Square to the presidential office. The police, which earlier refused to allow the march citing traffic disruptions, used water cannons to spray water mixed with tear gas to break up the crowd. Enraged by the police crackdown, some protestors swore at the police officers, urging them to open the road toward Gwanghwamnun Square. “You bastards! Open the way! Don’t you have a mother or father? Stop firing the water cannon.”As the violence reached its peak at 9:30 p.m., the angry crowd attempted to bring down the police bus barricades by tying ropes to the vehicles and hitting police officers on the top of the buses with poles. Tainting most demonstrators’ wish to hold peaceful assemblies, some radical protestors went as far as attempting to set fire to a police bus, physically abusing police officers and arousing anger in the crowd. Such actions were largely frowned upon or ignored by fellow demonstrators, many of whom appeared to sympathize with the mostly young conscripts stuck in the middle of official demands for public order and the protesters’ determination to march forward. Some of the demonstrators shouted, “Police officers, please come down (from the top of the buses)! It is too dangerous up there.” A 35-year-old office worker, who participated in the rally, also told The Korea Herald that the police officers were not to blame. The government should take the blame. “I feel so sorry for them. They are just following the orders. They are suffering from what adults have done wrong. I feel like they are putting the young at the forefront of the adults’ ideological war,” he said. “The youth are being sacrificed in vain.” An American national, who only wanted to be identified as Patrick, said that he saw a lot of fright in all their eyes while observing the protest scene for hours. “Some of them seemed to hate what they were doing. Many might have friends out there I imagine. The looks on their faces said it all.”The Korea Herald also witnessed a woman weeping at the corner of a police bus parked near Gwanghwamun Square. The windows of the bus were smashed, though conscripts were still inside on standby in case of emergencies. The woman talked into the bus windows covered by shields, “My son is also a conscript. … Please don’t hurt our children. … Please, stop this violence.”Two days after the violent protest in central Seoul ended, a photo from the scene went viral showing a protestor washing tear gas from a conscript’s eyes. After seeing the picture, which was quickly spread on social media, a netizen said in a tweet, “Why do we have to fight like this?”By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","violent protest in central seoul ,police in the largest rally ,one hour by angry protestors ,conscripted policeman during mass rally ,enraged by the police crackdown","['Seoul', 'Gwanghwamun', 'Seoul', 'the National Police Agency', 'Seoul', 'the Korea Herald', 'american', 'Patrick', 'Korea Herald', 'Seoul']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34765035 -0.15009536

""The courts should feel responsible for letting illegal rallies continue by handing down soft punishments to the defendants,"" Kim added.  As the Saturday rally continued into the late night, it turned more violent with protesters brandishing metal pipes and police firing water cannons at the protesters.Criticizing the violence during the demonstration, Rep. Suh Chung-won of the ruling party said illegal rallies with iron pipes and torches should be eradicated by the Park Geun-hye administration.  The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy denounced the excessive use of force by the police, calling it a ""deadly suppression"" of citizens.During the crackdown, some 182,000 liters of water were used, which is about 45.5 times more than the amount used by the police in similar situations last year, according to Rep. Jung Chung-rai of the NPAD.The violent demonstration caused 29 protesters to be rushed to hospitals after sustaining injuries, according to reports. Among the injured was a 69-year-old farmer, surnamed Baek, who suffered a brain hemorrhage after being knocked down by a police water cannon. He was taken to Seoul National University Hospital and underwent surgery but remains in critical condition.Some police officers also sustained injuries although the exact number is not available.Rep. Joo Seung-yong of the NPAD also noted the illegality of using police vehicles to create barricades during a street rally, making it difficult for citizens to pass through the area.In 2011, the Constitutional Court ruled that it is unconstitutional for the police to surround Seoul Plaza with riot buses because it violates the citizens' right to freedom of movement.""The government should listen to the outcry from the citizens over youth unemployment, labor reform and the plunge in agriculture prices,"" NPAD Chairman Moon Jae-in said.

The protest organizers projected that as many as 130,000 gathered for the protest that stretched late into the night.Riot police fire water cannons at protesters during a rally in Gwanghwamun Square, Seoul, Saturday. (Yonhap)The protests started to turn violent at around 4:30 p.m. as police clashed with demonstrators attempting to march through Gwanghwamun Square toward the presidential office by pulling down barricades set up by police buses. The clashes left one critically injured, 51 arrested and 50 police buses damaged. Some 113 police officers were wounded while the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, one of the nation’s two major umbrella groups, claimed at least 500 were injured by the “excessive use” of police force. Baek Nam-gi, a 69-year-old farmer, underwent brain surgery at a hospital after he fell and hit the back of his head as police doused him with water cannons near City Hall, according to the Korea Peasants League. He was pulling the rope to move the police buses at the time. On the road from Jonggak Station toward Gwanghwamun Square were mostly young students and citizens holding candles, demanding the government salvage the Sewol ferry as soon as possible and withdraw its plan to adopt state-issued history books. The state-authored history book has triggered an ideological feud, with critics denouncing the government’s plan as an attempt to beautify the past dictatorial governments and bloody transition toward democracy in the 1980s. Conservatives argue the current history books are biased toward left-wing ideology. “I made my way to show my objection to the government’s plan for history textbooks. A history textbook should not be a script that can be written by a winner,” Lee Hyun-ju, a 19-year-old student in a school uniform, told The Korea Herald.“I am not sure my participation can change anything, but I had to do something,” said Lee, who took the national college exam Thursday. “But I cannot find a way into the rallies because police buses blocked all the paths.” On the other side of the police barricades, hundreds of citizens, blocked from joining the march, watched from a distance as the police fired water cannons into the crowd from the tops of their buses. Many of the protestors shouted in anger, “Don’t shoot the water cannon,” “Stop the water cannon” and “Violent police, step back!” as the police continued to order the crowd to disperse and spray the water mixed with tear gas. The police said it mobilized about 22,000 police officers, 700 police buses and water cannons to shut Gwanghwamun square from the protestors. The police earlier this week banned the march, citing the traffic disruption, and pledged stern action against what it called any “illegal acts” during the protest. On Sunday afternoon, Justice Mister Kim Hyun-woong vowed stern action against protestors who led what he called “violent, illegal” rallies. “Our concern became reality as violent, radical protests took place at the heart of Seoul,” he said. “We allowed legal, peaceful assemblies to a great extent, but some protestors committed violence by using illegal weapons like steel pipes to beat the police.”Throughout the hours-long stand-off between police and protestors, the police made a series of announcements, saying, “You are causing a serious traffic disruption here, which is illegal under the Korean law. We are officially taking pictures of your faces to arrest those who commit illegal acts. Don’t push police officers or beat them.” Despite the government’s denunciation on violent protesters, controversy also brew up over the “excessive” police force.According to the law, water cannons and dangerous chemicals like capsaicin, a chemical that can cause irritation and burns, can only be used at the minimal level to enforce the law. Using police buses as barricades was ruled illegal by the Constitutional Court in 2011. The court said surrounding the protest site with police buses violates public rights for free movement.The United Nations Human Rights Committee expressed concerns about what it called “severe restrictions” placed on the right to peaceful assembly including the use of bus blockades in its recent recommendations for the Korean government. Maeng Haeng-il, 73, accused President Park Geun-hye administration of breaking the Constitution by stifling freedom of expression and mobilizing the police for its own sake. “I feel like we are in the 1970s again. President Park is doing exactly the same thing as her dictator father did during his presidency,” he told The Korea Herald, referring to her late father and former President Park Chung-hee. “Democracy is backtracking,” he said, holding a candle as he watched the protestors on the other side get drenched with water. “The traffic disruption cited by the police is just an excuse (for the crackdown).” Near City Hall, another group of protestors, mainly composed of civic groups, labor unions and farmers’ groups, carried flags and banners and chanted “Park Geun-hye, step down” and “No layoffs” in protest against the government’s labor reform plan. The Park administration has been pushing for reforms to make the market more flexible, to create more jobs for youth and boost the nation’s sluggish economy.Labor groups, however, have been fiercely opposing the government plans to allow employers to lay off workers more easily, adopt a peak wage system and extend the length of hiring period of irregular workers, viewing them as only benefiting businesses. Many of them, masked and wearing raincoats, the protesters responded more violently to the police action, demanding the government to open the path toward Gwanghwamun Square. Some of the radical participants went as far as pulling down some of the police buses by tying ropes to the vehicles, smashing their windows, throwing bricks at the police and attacking officers with steel pipes and poles. Some protestors coughed due to the tear gas, desperately asking for water from people around while continuing their attempts to break the police barricades. “Don’t shoot the water cannon in people’s faces,” a protestor shouted. A 23-year-old student at the University of Cambridge said she had collapsed after being hit by the tear gas-mixed water and had to crawl out of the mass. “I cried out, ‘rescue me,’” said Park Eun-young, who came with a group of students to join the rally against the state-issued textbook scheme. “I should get home now to clean off the tear gas, but I cannot get out because of the police buses.” The protests reached a peak at around 9:30 p.m. when a group of labor union members appeared with torchlights. One of them attempted to throw the firebomb into the police, while others just held it amid cheers from fellow demonstrators. Many citizens had to detour to pass through central Seoul during the day as the police set up the barricades early in the morning, with some of them complaining about the disruptions. Police officers wearing a vest with distinctive orange signs helped the citizens find a way to get around. “With the oil leaking from police buses, the pavements are extremely slippery,” a 20-something office worker said on the pavement in the closed Gwanghwamun Square. “I had to walk for hours to find an exit, but I cannot complain because I agree with what protestors do.”By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","seoul saturday yonhap the protests ,cannons at protesters during rally ,protesters during rally in gwanghwamun ,rallies because police buses blocked ,the police buses the protests","['Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Riot', 'Seoul', 'the korean Confederation of Trade Unions', 'Baek Nam - gi', 'the Korea Peasants League', 'Jonggak Station', 'conservative', 'Lee Hyun - ju', 'the Korea Herald', 'Lee', 'Gwanghwamun', 'Kim Hyun - woong', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'the Constitutional Court', 'the United Nations Human Rights Committee', 'korean', 'Maeng Haeng - il', 'Park Geun', 'Park', 'the Korea Herald', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Park', 'the University of Cambridge', 'Park Eun - young', 'Seoul', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.62489408 -0.07640538

Over 26 percent of underage smokers said smoking once or twice was OK -- a rate four times higher than that of teenage nonsmokers who think so, at 6.4 percent. While more than 85 percent of nonsmokers approved of legally banning youths from smoking, only 63 percent of teenage smokers agreed. Nearly 14 percent of smokers said they would smoke in the future whereas 2.7 percent of nonsmokers said they would likely smoke someday. Meanwhile, the organization’s study showed that students were 74 percent more likely to start smoking underage if they saw their teachers smoking at school. “Antismoking education must be carried out in a way that can correct students’ misunderstandings and change their perceptions of smoking,” said Lim Wan-ryung, a researcher at the organization. As part of the efforts to curb youth smoking, the Ministry of Health and Welfare launched antismoking programs at over 11,000 schools this year, officials said.

Among the injured was a 69-year-old farmer, surnamed Baek, who suffered a brain hemorrhage after being knocked down by a police water cannon. He was taken to Seoul National University Hospital and underwent surgery but remained in critical condition.Some riot police officers also sustained injuries although the exact number is not available.Nine police buses, parked in the protest area to block the flow of demonstrators, were destroyed as protesters attacked the barricade of buses with ropes and clubs.The Korea Employers' Federation, meanwhile, issued a statement earlier in the day, urging the government to ""hold those who instigated the illegal demonstrations and their followers responsible.""""Such a riot in downtown Seoul not only attempts to undermine the backbone of the nation governed by law but serves as a serious challenge to the (democratic) society of the Republic of Korea,""the statement said, noting the demonstrators broke away from the place where they were supposed to stage the rally and violently attacked police.

Most have difficulty in determining their career paths as they are uncertain about their true interest or have inadequate information and experience regarding the range of occupations. A sophomore from Ewha Womens University’s law school is taking part in a law school internship held at Seoul Western District Court. (Yonhap)In this sense, internship may play a pivotal role in discovering one’s aptitude and talents, while tasting the realities of life in the wider society. “Initially, I yearned to get a job in the finance industry, based on its social reputation along with its strong relevance with my major. However, after working in the field as an intern, I could objectively determine whether finance suits me or not,” said a 24-year-old student from a Seoul-based university.The majority of students start an internship for a simple reason -- “to add one more qualification to my resume.” However, most realize that there are a slew of other significant factors to take in as a lesson after going through the internship period. One such lesson is realizing the differences between university life and life as a member of the society.“The proper way to face superiors, how to talk politely, while being concrete, the need to take care of work ahead of time were some of the important things that I learned” said Park, who was an intern at a public relations company. “But most of all, perceiving the way to form a ‘good human relationship,’ which is the core part of having an easygoing work life, was the biggest lesson that I received in the broad sense. It was a great opportunity to become aware that the workplace is very different from my university life.” Participants gesture at an internship program held by the Korean International Trade Association. (Yonhap)Above knowing the significance of developing effective and good relations with others, comprehending the overall ambience and culture of the company is another merit of internships, since it can enable students to quickly adopt to the workplace.A university student, who interned at the Korea Chamber of Commerce & Industry, confessed, “I had heard that employees work under a very free atmosphere at the place. However, after experiencing it myself, I realized that there were also some issues which were far different from what I heard.”Meanwhile, to double the efficiency during the internship period, it is wise to opt for an internship that has high practical job relevancy. Although a majority of internship recruitment notices initially inform that the interns will have a chance to share some workload of full-time employees, the reality might be much different.Firms where interns handle miscellaneous work are aplenty.A 26-year-old, from Hankuk Universities of Foreign Studies, indicated, “I actually experienced sharing some practical work of full-time employees. High job relevance really contributed best in deciding whether the job well suits me or not.”Just unquestioningly relying on information available on the Internet is not the right way to find an effective internship. Rather, it is better to receive advice and information from pre-interns or go through as many internships as one can.Although internship has no absolute role in determining one’s career path, no one can deny that it is the best means to have the biggest and practical influence on it.

He was joined by ministers and vice ministers of agriculture, interior, labor and education.Justice Minister Kim Hyun-woong. YonhapThe Korea Confederation of Trade Unions, the more militant of the country’s two major umbrella labor unions, estimated that at least 100,000 students, farmers, laborers, public servant union members and activists will gather to rally against labor reforms, free trade agreements and the history textbooks.National Police Agency chief Kang Shin-myung had also vowed Thursday to block any attempt by protesters to approach Cheong Wa Dae, such as by barricading all roads in Gwanghwamun with police vehicles. The prosecutor’s national security department also vowed to crack down on any participation by those deemed “antistate,” such as by supporting North Korea.The education and interior ministries in the statement urged government workers and teachers not to participate in the protest, saying the rally would cause traffic jams on a day when students are to take an essay test as part of the college entrance exams.“The policies pushed by the government such as labor reform, Korea-China FTA and normalization of history education are imminent reform tasks that must be achieved for sake of the country’s sustained development. ... But there continue to be baseless denunciations and misleading of public opinion,” the statement read.The KCTU said that the rally is aimed at condemning the government for lax communication in its attempt to overhaul rules on business sectors that are designed to enable more flexible use of nonregular workers glorified as ways to create jobs for the young.Korea has been roiling in controversy over some of the administration’s key policies, namely the reinstatement of state-authored history textbooks despite vehement opposition from progressives and opposition parties.The KCTU also released a statement Friday urging test-takers to support their rally and asked them to travel to the exam center earlier than scheduled due to traffic concerns.“Eleven of the 12 universities that are holding the essay exam are located far away from the site of the rally and will not be influenced. As the majority of the universities are holding the test before noon, they will not be affected by the rally being held in the afternoon,” the union said.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","100 000 protesters the most ,anti beef protests in 2008 ,korea popular venue for rallies ,gather some 100 000 protesters ,scheduled mass rally against labor","['south korean', 'u.s.', 'Cabinet', 'Korea', 'Kim Hyun - woong', 'Kim Hyun - woong', 'YonhapThe Korea Confederation of Trade Unions', 'National Police Agency', 'Kang Shin - myung', 'Gwanghwamun', 'North Korea', 'Korea', 'KCTU', 'Korea', 'KCTU', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.2542372   0.26981843

According to her, of all addicts who started gambling by visiting online sites, 59.7 percent were teenagers.She also noted that gambling addiction is closely linked with other mental illnesses. Jeon cited 2011 research from Monash University in Australia that found that 23.1 percent of gambling addicts also had alcohol addiction, while 37.4 percent of them had an anxiety disorder. The researcher said more support is needed for potential gambling addicts, especially those in their teenage years. “There are only eight institutions that specialize in gambling addiction nationwide,” she wrote in her study. “This is just not enough to tackle the problem.”Article 246 of Korea’s Criminal Act punishes a person who gambles or bets for the purpose of gaining property with a fine of not more than 5 million won ($4,300). However, the country allows certain gambling activities to be operated under restricted circumstances, such as tourism, including casinos, slot matches and racing.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","23 percent of gambling addicts ,percent of gambling addicts also ,million south koreans aged 20 ,in gambling addiction nationwide she ,07 million south koreans aged","['South Koreans', 'the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs', 'Koreans', 'Jeon Jin - ah', 'korean', 'Jeon', 'Monash University', 'Australia', 'Claire Lee']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59173751  0.37859711

The survey showed that 19.4 percent of the surveyed firemen, all of whom were government employees, said they were either depressed or had an anxiety disorder, while feeling unprotected from possible injuries at work. Aside from depression and anxiety disorders, firefighters were dealing with a number of other health issues. A total of 43.2 percent of them said they had sleep disorders including insomnia, while 24.8 percent said they had hearing problems. Also, 57.5 percent said they felt chronically tired, while 54.2 percent said they had either headaches or eye fatigue.  Firefighters in South Korea. Yonhap.A total of 1,348 firemen among the surveyed said they had experienced a work-related injury that required medical attention and at least a day of rest, but only 225 of them filed a request to take the sick leave. Among the 225, only 173 were granted the break from work to be treated for their condition. The study also found that more than 90 percent of the surveyed firemen felt unsafe at work. Among the 93 percent who felt unsafe, 77 percent of them said their stations were understaffed, while 73.1 percent said they use outdated equipment and safety gear. Also, 50.7 percent of them said they were not informed enough about potentially dangerous substances at work.In particular, 33.2 percent of all surveyed firefighters said they had spent private funds to purchase safety gear needed for work, such as firefighter shields, flashlights and boots.The study found that 97.6 percent of the surveyed firefighters felt that a representative body is needed to better protect their rights. Also, 95 percent of all participating firemen said they’d join if such a group were established. The study was conducted for the National Human Rights Commission of Korea, which plans to come up with safety measures and policies specifically for firefighters in the country, including those protecting their labor rights and access to health care.

This is a 2 percentage point rise over last year. By region, eight metropolitan cities including the capital recorded 85.2 percent on average, 10 percent more than non-metropolitan and rural areas. The port city of Tongyeong in South Gyeongsang Province topped the ranking with 95.2 percent. Seoul reached 85.7 percent. By age, about 94 percent of those under the age of 60 were cremated, with 99 percent of those in their 20s being cremated. Among those aged 60 or older, 75.4 percent were cremated. “The limited cemetery space and financial burden of purchasing land for graves contributed to the rise of cremation. Managing the grave also requires a lot of time, which poses challenges to the increasing number of nuclear families,” Lee Sang-jae, president of a funeral worker’s association, told The Korea Herald. “Compared to metropolitan cities, rural regions have more land space. Many senior residents already secured their grave spots before passing away, which is probably why the cremation rate of the elderly is lower.”Unlike in the past, there is little resistance to the cremation culture these days, he added.While cremation was common in ancient Korea, burial culture had been preferred from the Joseon era (1392-1910), which was led by the Confucian philosophy that serving ancestors well would ensure the prosperity of future generations. Cremating their parents was considered unfilial. In Korea, cremation services cost less than 100,000 won ($86) and the charge for storing the remains varies from 1 to 5 million won, depending on place. The cost for burial, on the other hand, depends on the price of the land, with some priced at 7 million won per 3.3 square meters of land. As part of the efforts to seek an environmentally friendly funeral culture, the government has promoted cremation by launching the Korea Funeral Culture and Policy Institute in 2013. The body unified the cremation reservation system and provides transparent information about cremation facilities. “The cremation rate has annually increased by 3 percentage points since it overtook the burial rate at 52.6 percent in 2005. The cremation rate is likely to surpass 80 percent next year,” the ministry official said.As of late last year, a total of 55 cremation facilities were being operated across the country, officials said.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","funerals last year surging fourfold ,79 percent of funerals last ,percent of funerals last year ,funerals last year surging ,korea funeral culture is fast","['South Korea ’s', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare', 'Tongyeong', 'South Gyeongsang Province', 'Seoul', 'Lee Sang - jae', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea', 'confucian', 'Korea', 'the Korea Funeral Culture and Policy Institute', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",11,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40450072  0.48590291

There were no arrests.Protesters also gathered at Taipei's Songshan airport where Ma gave a brief address to reporters before boarding his flight Saturday morning.The demonstrators tried to burn images of the two leaders with slogans calling Xi ""Chinese dictator"" and Ma a ""traitor"" with 27 arrested after they tried to tried to push their way through a guarded side gate.They included student leader Chen Wei-ting a key figure in last year's Sunflower Movement which occupied parliament for almost a month over a controversial trade pact with China.Television footage showed Chen dragged into a police van while officers with riot shields scuffled with protesters. ""As a president who doesn't represent public opinion, Ma doesn't have the right to meet with the leader across the strait,"" one 35-year-old protester, also named Chen, told AFP.A TSU spokesman in Taipei said legislative candidate Hsiao Ya-tan was ""taken away by police"" from a hostel in Singapore in the early morning, along with two of her assistants. ""They are being questioned... that's the only information we have,"" said spokesman Liu Ching-wen.  Speaking to reporters at the airport, Ma said the purpose of the summit was to ""reinforce peace across the strait and maintain (the) status quo"".Critics have accused Ma of arranging the summit in secret as a bid to boost the ruling Kuomintang's chances at January elections, which it is tipped to lose.Support for the KMT and for Ma personally has plunged, partly due to a China-friendly policy.","to storm parliament in taiwan ,protesters also gathered at taipei ,presidential office in taiwan saturday ,arrested at the airport saturday ,scuffled with protesters as president","['TAIPEI', 'AFP', 'Taiwan', 'Ma Ying - jeou', 'Singapore', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'TSU', 'Singapore', 'Taiwan', 'chinese', 'Communists', 'Xi', 'Ma', 'Singapore', 'Ma', 'Taiwan', 'China', 'Beijing', 'Ma', 'Taiwan', 'Taiwan', 'Beijing', 'Taipei', 'Taiwan', 'Taipei', 'Songshan', 'Ma', 'Xi', 'chinese', 'Ma', 'Chen Wei - ting', 'Sunflower Movement', 'China', 'Chen', 'Chen', 'TSU', 'Taipei', 'Hsiao Ya - tan', 'Singapore', 'Liu Ching - wen', 'Ma', 'Ma', 'Kuomintang', 'KMT', 'Ma', 'China']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53594214  0.23413999

Born in 1988 and adopted by a U.S. couple at age 1, Kim arrived in South Korea last year in hopes of finding her birth parents. Kim finally began her search in Korea as an adult, but the process was far from easy. A visit to the Korea Adoption Services, which offers birth family search services for adoptees, was disheartening as officials there told her she wasn’t allowed to see any information about her birth family without their consent. They told her a telegram had been mailed to her mother, and only if she agrees, Kim would be able to meet her in person. Kim is one of many Korean adoptees demanding a revision of the current Special Adoption Law, which they argue prevents them from accessing their records and finding birth families. “Finding our families and knowing our histories shouldn’t depend on accident or luck,” Kim said at a recent forum at the National Assembly in Seoul. Korean adoptees, lawyers and public servants attend a forum discussing the ways to improve the current Special Adoption Law at the National Assembly on Oct. 29. Rep. Choi Dong-ic’s officeIf Kim had not asked for the paper receipt for the telegram, she may have never been able to reunite with her mother. The agency had blackened the recipient’s tracking code on the receipt, but Kim traced it by holding it against a bus window. When Kim finally met her mother by showing up at her place, she realized her mother in fact had been searching for her, too. Her mother had replied to the telegram sent from the KAS asking for further clarification, but got no response from them. The agency had been telling Kim they did not hear back from her mother.Since the KAS was established in 2012 upon the revision of the adoption law, the number of adoptees asking for their personal records to find their birth families has increased dramatically. While 258 adoptees asked to see their information in 2012, 1,654 have done the same this year as of August.In total, 4,790 adoptees requested their records to find their birth parents from 2012-2015, but only 14.7 percent of them were able to reunite with their families, according to data released by New Politics Alliance for Democracy Rep. Lee Jong-kul. Although the law aims to protect children’s rights, the way the KAS interprets some of its articles has made it almost impossible for returning adoptees to see their records, adoptees argued. According to the law, one can access their birth records without their birth parents’ permission only if the birth parent is dead or cannot be found, or the adoptee has a medical condition or other reason for doing so. Jane Jeong Trenka, an adoptee and president of the Truth and Reconciliation for the Adoption Community of Korea, said the KAS was applying the clauses too strictly by telling adoptees that they could only receive they personal records if all three criteria are met. “We believe that this is unreasonable, and this was certainly not our intention,” she said, referring to her organization’s input and support in amending the law three years ago. One of the major changes stipulated by the act was that all children must have a complete birth registration here before being put forward for adoption. Because meeting all three criteria at the same time is practically impossible, many adoptees would spend years simply tracing their birth parents.Hanna Johansson, an adoptee in Sweden, has visited Korea six times since 2007 in search of her birth family. The trips have cost her about $15,000, but she has yet to find any relatives.It has been an arduous journey. She began her search from the papers from the Social Welfare Society, the Korean agency that was in charge of her adoption in 1976. The papers said she was an orphan. It was only in 2010 when Johansson discovered that she was found by a police officer in Seoul’s Wangsimni area and was taken to a hospital before being adopted without any records of her birth parents. In 2013, she realized that perhaps the most crucial information had been kept from her -- the name of the police officer who had found her. While the name was included in the file shown to her in 2010 by SWS, it was written in Chinese characters. She learned it was the name of the officer after sharing the documents with Trenka. Johansson was finally able to meet the police officer after sending the KAS about 50 emails.“I think SWS never thought the adoptees would return to search,” Johansson told The Korea Herald. “I think they just do not care if we can get the information or not.” South Korean babies are being sent to the U.S. via plane to be adopted in 1956.YonhapGovernment statistics show that the current system, particularly the process of contacting the birth parents through telegrams instead of text messages or phone calls, is proving ineffective. According to data released by NPAD Rep. Choi Dong-ic, the KAS sent a total of 2,301 telegrams to birth parents between January 2012 and August 2015. Of them, 705 agreed to have their information revealed, while 1,596 did not respond or wished to remain anonymous.Currently, the KAS interprets a non-response from the birth parent as not agreeing to disclose their information. Consequently, 91 percent of 1,391 birth parents who did not give consent for their information to be disclosed from January 2014 until August this year were actually those who never replied.During the forum, Trenka pointed out that there is no way for adoptees to even confirm that these telegrams were even sent, and verify if the right birth parent received them. Trenka and lawyer So Ra-mi also argued that many birth parents would mistake the telegrams as junk mail even if they received them, as some of them simply say “a foreigner is looking to find you,” without informing that the person is an adoptee.South Korea remains one of the largest exporters of overseas adoptees in the world, having sent about 200,000 children abroad over the past six decades. About 90 percent of Korean adoptees are born to unwed, single mothers, who are vulnerable to social discrimination and stigmatization here. Woo Hong-sik from the KAS said this is why telegrams are being sent when contacting birth parents, instead of calling or visiting them in person. “Birth mothers who have been remarried (after sending their child overseas for adoption) often keep their past a secret,” he said. “A birth mother may not want their current family to find out that she’s had a child as an unwed woman in the past. Revealing that information could severely affect her relationship with her current family.”However, Kang Tae-in, a representative of a group of Korean birth families, said it was untrue that most birth parents don’t want to be found. He said many members of his group have tried to search for their children, only to be insulted and lied to by adoption agencies. One of the members was told, “You gave up on her. What makes you qualified to search for her now?” when he visited the agency that was in charge of his daughter’s adoption to Denmark. The father was also told that according to Danish laws, birth parents cannot contact their adopted children unless the adoptee contacts them first. However, the father later found out that Denmark has no such laws.Lawyer So Ra-mi said the current system goes against Article 7 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which stipulates that the child “shall have the right to acquire a nationality and, as far as possible, the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents.” For another adoptee, Andrea Kim Cavicchi, locating her birth mother’s burial site involved posting flyers, knocking on the door of every house and visiting three other villages where her mother may have lived, all on her own. She had been reunited with her maternal aunt in 2006 after appearing on a TV show in Korea. Her aunt informed Cavicchi that her mother had passed away, but refused to share any other information.When Cavicchi asked the KAS to persuade her adoption agency, Holt, to hand over her file to help her locate the grave site, the KAS refused, saying she did not have a medical condition, one of the three requirements to access her records. While Cavicchi managed to locate the site without any organizational support, the adoption agency told her to be “grateful” that she was adopted because she would have been stigmatized for having a single mother who was mentally challenged had she stayed in Korea. She said the most painful part of the search was a deep sense of hopelessness.“(The painful part was) knowing I’ll never find answers to some questions. … What made my mother laugh? What did her voice sound like? What was her favorite food?” she told The Korea Herald. Cavicchi reached closure when she finally found her mother’s grave site. She learned that her mother remarried after Cavicchi was sent away, and that she was 27 when she died. But Cavicchi said the feeling of “han” remains, referring to a Korean word describing a sense of unresolved resentment against injustices suffered. “We will never physically meet in this lifetime, Mom, but I want you to know that I am fighting for you,” she wrote in her article titled “Dear Eomma (mom)” published last year. “I embody your han.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","show in korea her aunt ,popular korean actress lee young ,her birth mother after watching ,convinced that popular korean actress ,korean babies are being sent","['Annie Kim', 'korean', 'Lee Young', 'korean', 'U.S.', 'Kim', 'South Korea', 'Kim', 'Korea', 'the Korea Adoption Services', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'korean', 'Kim', 'the National Assembly', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'the National Assembly', 'Choi Dong - ic ’s', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'KAS', 'Kim', 'KAS', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Lee Jong - kul', 'KAS', 'Jane Jeong Trenka', 'the Truth and Reconciliation for the Adoption Community of Korea', 'KAS', 'Hanna Johansson', 'Sweden', 'Korea', 'the Social Welfare Society', 'korean', 'Johansson', 'Seoul', 'SWS', 'chinese', 'Johansson', 'KAS', 'SWS', 'Johansson', 'the Korea Herald', 'south korean', 'U.S.', 'NPAD', 'Choi Dong - ic', 'KAS', 'KAS', 'so Ra - mi', 'South Korea', 'korean', 'Woo Hong - sik', 'KAS', 'birth', 'Kang Tae - in', 'korean', 'Denmark', 'danish', 'Denmark', 'Andrea Kim Cavicchi', 'Korea', 'Cavicchi', 'Cavicchi', 'KAS', 'Holt', 'KAS', 'Cavicchi', 'Korea', 'the Korea Herald', 'Cavicchi', 'Cavicchi', 'Cavicchi', 'korean', 'Claire Lee']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.77590603  0.30412146

Statistics compiled by the Paris-based club of advanced economies show that the average South Korean -- including salaried employees, self-employed and part-timers -- worked 2,124 hours in 2014, up 45 hours from the previous year.  This marks 1.2 times, or 354 hours, more than the average for the 34 Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development member countries, which stands at 1,770 hours per year. (Yonhap)Mexico was the only country ahead of Korea with 2,228 hours. South Korea was the most overworked country in the OECD bloc until Mexico knocked it off the top spot in 2008.Germans worked 1,371 hours, the least among the OECD, meaning Koreans work four months longer than Germans per year. Western European and Nordic countries logged less than 1,500 working hours per year, with the Netherlands recording 1,425 hours, Norway 1,427 hours, Denmark 1,436 hours and France 1,473 hours. Japan (1,729 hours), the United States (1,789 hours), Italy (1,734 hours) and the United Kingdom (1,677) hovered around the OECD average, according to the data. South Korea’s working hours had seen a steady decrease from 2,512 hours in 2000 to 2,090 hours in 2011, but the figures have fluctuated since then. The growing number of self-employed workers and the longer hours they put in amid the faltering economy might be linked to last year’s increase for Korea, an expert said.“The data seems to explain that the self-employed kept their stores open longer as their businesses did not do well,” said Ahn Ju-yeop, a senior researcher from the state-run Korea Labor Institute. The number of self-employed rose from 5.38 million in 2013 to 5.83 million as of this August in the country with a population of 50 million. “There are also still many salaried workers at manufacturing companies working for more than 60 hours per week and many who do not take their paid vacations,” said Ahn. But the long working hours do not necessarily result in higher labor productivity, the level of output for every hour of work, another expert said.“South Korea’s employment structure requires workers to work long hours despite low productivity, as it is more cost-effective for businesses,” Kim Jong-jin, a researcher from the Korea Labor & Society Institute, told The Korea Herald. According to OECD data, South Koreans’ labor productivity was $31.90 per hour in 2014, much lower than the OECD average of $49. It draws a stark comparison with France, where laborers work for 35 hours a week, but with productivity scores of $64 per hour.“Businesses can save costs such as severance pay and training fees when they make their skilled employees work overtime rather than hire (and) train another staff member,” he pointed out. “The environment makes Koreans work longer hours and unable to take paid time off work.” The inefficiency is equally felt among workers themselves, according to a poll last year by the Labor Ministry. In the poll, 37.5 percent of the surveyed 1,300 employees nationwide said their companies’ work efficiency was high enough. While another 37.5 percent of them “hardly” worked overtime, only 24.9 percent thought that such a practice helped raise their productivity. “Unless the government fixes the structure through legally binding measures, Koreans will have to work longer hours and the productivity will continue to suffer,” Kim said. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","koreans work the second longest ,second longest hours among oecd ,koreans work four months longer ,koreans work four months ,the second longest hours among","['South Koreans', 'OECD', 'Paris', 'south Korean', 'the 34 Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development', 'Korea', 'South Korea', 'Mexico', 'OECD', 'Koreans', 'german', 'western european', 'nordic', 'Netherlands', 'Norway', 'Denmark', 'France', 'Japan', 'the United States', 'Italy', 'the United Kingdom', 'OECD', 'South Korea ’', 'Korea', 'Ahn Ju - yeop', 'Korea Labor Institute', 'Ahn', 'Korea ’s', 'Kim Jong - jin', 'the Korea Labor & Society Institute', 'the Korea Herald', 'OECD', 'South Koreans', 'OECD', 'France', 'Koreans', 'the Labor Ministry', 'Koreans', 'Kim']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.89500576  0.7249729

In 2007, more than 120 South Korean victims were alive, but the number has since dropped to 47, with their average age standing at nearly 90.  Historians estimate that more than 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were sexually enslaved by Japanese troops during the war. Korea was a colony of Japan from 1910 to 1945.        In the current situation, the summit dealing with the potential entry of Japanese self-defense forces into the Koreas is inappropriate, the groups said.   Associations of bereaved families from the colonial victims also held a press conference in front of the former Japanese Embassy building in central Seoul, demanding Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe apologize to and compensate the forced Korean laborers during the period.  Many Koreans were conscripted into the Japanese military or drafted to work in the military industrial sector, being deployed to Japan and other countries against their will.  Many of them returned home after the Korean liberation, following Japan's defeat in the war, but others remained abroad. Many are believed to have died during the war.  It is unclear how many people were mobilized for forced labor and died. Some civic groups claim the number of conscripts goes up into the millions.  ""In the summit, sex slaves are rising as key issues but soldiers, workers and repatriation of their corps are left out,"" they said.   Other liberal civic groups took part by picketing in front of the Westin Chosun Hotel in central Seoul where Abe has been staying.  President Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed during the first summit between their countries in more than three years on Monday to speed up negotiations to quickly resolve the issue of former sex slaves, Cheong Wa Dae said.

The exact cause of the outbreak is still unknown.Among the 44 individuals, 41 currently have been officially diagnosed with pneumonia and are being treated in isolation at several separate medical facilities, the KCDC said. The remaining three have not officially been diagnosed yet. They are currently staying at home while being monitored. Although the three patients are only showing mild symptoms, they are scheduled to take chest X-rays to check for pneumonia.According to Konkuk University, some students who have been diagnosed with pneumonia visited an animal farm in Chungju, North Chungcheong Province, for research on Oct. 14. They also attended a dairy cattle show in Anseong, Gyeonggi Province, on the same day.The KCDC said the 41 patients who had been officially diagnosed with pneumonia have been tested for a total of 16 respiratory viruses, including MERS, influenza and coronavirus. Only four of the 41 patients have tested positive to a single disease, called respiratory syncytial virus, which causes mild symptoms that typically mimic the common cold. Everyone else has tested negative to all 16 viruses.The KCDC said it was unlikely that the RSV had caused the outbreak, as the particular virus is currently common nationwide. It said it would continue with its ongoing epidemiologic investigation to identify the exact causes of the outbreak. On Sunday, the Health Ministry said it will investigate to see if any chemical substances used in the research in the building contained harmful ingredients capable of causing pneumonia.

It said Korean nationals, as well as foreign citizens living in the country, will be asked to answer various questions posed by the census officials that could take some 30 minutes from start to finish.It said that people who want to respond to the Internet survey can still do so even if the official deadline has expired. This move can save time and effort and be more convenient for some, although census takers may visit a home if the data provided online is inadequate.The agency then assured the public that under South Korean law all data collected cannot be divulged to any other outside source, so there won't be any privacy issues. It said questioners have been instructed to clearly show their identification before entering a person's home to ensure there are no safety concerns.

85,85,[Weekender] Breakdown of Korea’s recycling process,"Having lived in the United States since her childhood, 27-year-old graduate student Lee Hee-jung was surprised when she saw her roommates sifting through the garbage to separate milk cartons from trash bags filled with paper. “Back in the U.S., I would lump together trash and put it on the road where trash operators would pick it up.

Since recycling is not mandatory in our state, that was pretty much all I had to do. Now I struggle here with my roommate nagging me for not following the recycling regulations that are so strict,” said Lee. These “strict” recycling regulations were introduced in 1995 and require residents and business operators to separate out trash that can be recycled, such as plastics, glasses, cans and milk cartons. Paper, plastics, cans and other recyclable waste must be separated from household trash and be thrown out at a designated area for recycling. Vendors come to the site regularly every week to pick up the recycled waste. Large trash, such as furniture and home appliances, must be dumped with a state-issued sticker attached to them.More specifically, milk cartons must be separated from other paper trash because they are coated with hard-to-recycle materials such as vinyl and thus require an extended period of time to decompose. Broken glass and other sharp-and-pointed objects must be put in designated sacks, not trash bags.Among the recyclable trash, items that can be reused are sold to vendors who collect them. Other items that cannot be reused, such as Styrofoam, are reprocessed for other purposes, such as construction materials. “The separation of trash was officially mandated in 2003. The rule was set in law with a penalty imposed on violators. Since then, we have fostered recycling programs and reduced the amount of trash that otherwise would be buried,” said Son Kyung-pyo of the Environment Ministry’s resources recycling division.According to the ministry’s statistics, per capita household waste was reduced to 0.94 kg per day in 2013 from 1.3 kg per day in 1994. From 1994 to 2013, the rate of trash that was buried decreased from 81.2 percent to 9.6 percent and the amount of trash that has been incinerated has decreased from 15.3 percent to 6.4 percent. The rate of trash that has been recycled increased from 15.3 percent to 83.2 percent. “Environmental benefits aside, recycling brings more economic benefits to countries that have a small landmass and few resources like Korea. Large countries like the U.S. spend a lot of money on traveling between recycling facilities, but small countries like us can save money by recycling,” Son said.But Korea’s signature recycling system has sometimes upset residents because of its strict, and sometimes, ambiguous rules. In February 2015, Seoul city government announced that it would no longer accept regular trash bags that contained paper or plastic. Following the announcement, Seoul residents were confused as to whether items such as toilet paper, diapers and sanitary pads should be included in the category of paper to be recycled, and refused to recycle them. The government later explained it had used an “ambiguous” expression in the announcement and clarified that toilet paper, diapers and sanitary pads were not subject to recycling rules. “The government recycling policy is a step in the right direction. But sometimes it is a bit confusing and ambiguous. Before implementing the policy, the government should communicate better with the public over the details,” said Kim Seoul-gi, a 58-year-old Seoul resident. By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","roommates sifting through the garbage ,my roommate nagging me for ,milk cartons paper plastics cans ,she saw her roommates sifting ,my roommate nagging me","['the United States', 'Lee Hee - jung', 'U.S.', 'Lee', 'broken', 'Styrofoam', 'Son Kyung - pyo', 'the Environment Ministry ’s', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Kim Seoul - gi', 'Seoul', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43799996  0.33191693

However, the slogan may not be going down so well, at least on the initial impression. People are making parodies of the sentence by using it in different photos and conversations. One Twitter user wrote “I will find you, and I will Seoul you” over a photo of Liam Neeson in a scene from the hit action thriller “Taken.”Many others added their own twist to Seoul’s new slogan. Referring to the Park Geun-hye government’s failed attempts at lowering the cost of housing, one Twitter user wrote “I. SEOUL. U (Korean: I will raise the jeonse price).” Jeonse refers to a lump-sum rent deposit.Another Twitter user posted a fictional conversation between a tenant and home owner -- “Hello, it’s me. I Seoul you (Korean: Hi, your jeonse contract is almost over. And we would like to raise the price.).” The tenant responds, “Don’t Seoul me please (Korean: Can you please reconsider that).”Comparing it to the infamous Bucheon slogan, “Bucheon Hands Up (Put your hands up),” one Twitter user said, “Maybe it’s time for us to reevaluate the Bucheon slogan.”One expat commented, “Don‘t Seoul Me,” while another said, “Don’t you Seoul me young man.”Seoul, and the Korean government, have been ridiculed in the past for slogans that were awkward at best. In 2009, there was the slogan “Infinitely Yours,” which has zero connection to the city or the country. There was also the widely ridiculed “Korea, Sparkling” and “Seoul, my _____,” a highly risky tactic for anyone in any way you put it.By Suk Gee-hyun (monicasuk@heraldcorp.com)","twist to seoul new slogan ,twitter user wrote seoul korean ,new slogan the seoul city ,the new slogan the seoul ,seoul new slogan referring to","['Seoul', 'New York', 'Seoul', 'Liam Neeson', 'Seoul', 'I.

Earlier that month, a practice projectile was found in a pine field following three similar cases of ricochets in proceeding months. ""Day and night, the sounds of firing never cease in Pocheon, the home to dozens of military bases, camps, a military airfield, ammunition dumps and the Eighth U.S. Army's Youngpyoung (Rodriguez) firing range as well as the South Korean Army's ranges,"" the villagers' committee on the ricochet issue said in protest. The residents near the range started to desert their hometown in fear of stray bullets, they claimed in the protest rally near the U.S. military range.Protesters set fire on straw bundles they brought to the protest area where smoke grew steadily and filled the dusky sky. The villagers' committee was launched last week, demanding the local government take countermeasures on the issue.  Some of the protests carried a funeral bier with banners that read ""Death awaits outside the door"" and ""We want to live,"" in demand of resolution. Encompassing some 13.5 million square meters in the town of Youngjung in Pocheon, it is the U.S. military's biggest shooting practice complex in Asia. Severe tremor and unceasing noise have often been sources of severe protests from villagers.Speaking on the issue in a recent news conference, Theodore Martin, the commanding general of the Second Infantry Division which uses the range, said the division is working closely with the city of Pocheon.

The police said that residents living and doing business in the area had handed in a petition, asking for a prohibition on the demonstration.Under the current Assembly and Demonstration Act, the police can ban assemblies when a petition is submitted against such a move. The court admitted that the demonstration could disturb the neighborhood, but invalidated the police ban, citing a lack of evidence to prove that the petition is authentic and submitted by the residents themselves. The petition only included personal profiles and signatures of some 80 residents living near the demonstration venue without specifying the date and place of the demonstration they opposed and reasons for such a petition. During the trial, two residents who signed the petition reportedly could not testify what it was about and why they submitted it, raising questions over the authenticity of the document. “It is very doubtful that the residents were opposed to the demonstration and asked for protection from the police,” the court said in the ruling. The verdict came amid mounting concerns that an increasing number of police bans are placed on demonstrations and protests over politically sensitive issues, citing traffic disturbances and harm to public order. Another recent controversial police ban on an assembly came in May when organizers of the gay pride parade applied for a permit to hold the annual event. The police rejected the application, taking issue with possible traffic disruptions and clashes with antigay activists during the parade. The decision sparked heated debate and overturned when the court ruled in favor of the LGBT activists. “Assemblies can be prohibited only when they pose a direct and clear threat to public order,” the court said in the ruling. “Banning assemblies should be used as a last resort when there are no options left.”Traffic disruption has been the most cited reason for the police to forbid a protest, according to data released by the National Police Agency. The number of police bans on assemblies stood at 281 last year, with traffic disruption accounting for 45.6 percent of the reasons. Disruption to neighborhood came in second at 32 percent, followed by multiple applications for a single venue at 12.8 percent. A human rights lawyer hailed the court decision as the first step to deter the police from abusing their authority to forbid demonstrations and protests, which he called the backbone of democracy. “While the past court rulings seemed to lean toward the police, this time, the court thoroughly examined the petition. In the past, many petitions seemed rather dubious, raising doubts that sometimes the police led residents to submit them,” Park Ju-min, a lawyer for Lawyers for a Democratic Society, told The Korea Herald. “It seems like the police is making various excuses to ban demonstrations, especially when they are politically oriented and to criticize the government in power,” Park said. “I think the ruling will stop the police from insensibly issuing bans on assemblies.”By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","annual event the police rejected ,gay pride parade applied for ,the police to forbid protest ,police on tuesday to withdraw ,ferry tragedy in central seoul","['Seoul', 'Seoul', 'the Seoul Administrative Court', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'the Jongno Police Department', 'the National Folk Museum', 'Assembly', 'LGBT', 'ban', 'the National Police Agency', 'Park Ju - min', 'Lawyers for a Democratic Society', 'the Korea Herald', 'Park', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",4,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.32283756  0.19717276

This otherwise common scene is made more special as the students are homeless and the teacher is Cho Sei-hon, among the top tier of photographers in Korea. This is part of Cho and Seoul City’s welfare program called “Himang Frame,” or frame of hope, seeking to help homeless members of society become more self-reliant by providing them with a chance to learn photography skills. Cho has run the program since 2012. For Cho, with over three decades of career experience in photojournalism and fashion photography, taking pictures is not merely a way to capture a moment, but a means to connect the public and inspire hope. “I’m grateful I can do the volunteer work when my talent is nothing more than just taking pictures. It is just that people like myself became more useful as society has changed (to pay closer attention to welfare),” the ICON STUDIO owner told The Korea Herald in an interview. Cho Sei-hon (second from right) instructs his students while they practice at his studio in Yongsan-gu, Seoul, on Thursday. (ICON STUDIO)After the two-month-long class that provides students with cameras and other necessary gear, he picks the two best students to work as public photographers in Gwanghwamun Square in Seoul. In March 2013, the first two homeless photographers opened a photo studio. Depending on the size of the pictures, they earn around 3,000 won ($2.65) per shot that they take and print for tourists. While the photography becomes a useful source of income, the city also provides them with basic monthly allowances to support their living conditions. Cho originally brought up the idea for Himang Frame after he was invited to a British photo exhibition in 2011 held by U.K. nonprofit foundation A Positive View, which pursues philanthropy through photography. Prince William became Royal Patron of the organization in 2010 after his mother Diana, Princess of Wales. Some 100 photographers around the world are regularly invited to the charity event to auction off their pictures for charity. All the auction proceeds are donated to photography class programs for the homeless in the U.K. “At a dinner event in the U.K., I came across one of the photographers. Surprisingly, I found that he was once a homeless person who learned photography from the charity program. With the support, he became a professional photographer. I started to think, ‘Why couldn’t this happen in Seoul?’” said the 56-year-old. Returning to Korea, he shared the idea with Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon right before he was elected in 2011. After his inauguration, Park pushed ahead with the project with Cho in February 2012. As of now, four homeless photographers are working at the public photo studio, with two more expected to debut soon as this year’s program is to be finished later this week.“I’m hoping to train at least 10 photographers so that they can even form their own cooperative union and become truly self-reliant,” he said. Cho’s philanthropic activities date back to 2000.It began when he took family pictures of those with intellectual disabilities. But it was not until he felt the “obligation to support others” that he was asked by a social worker to take pictures of children put up for adoption on their 100th day after birth, celebrating a Korean tradition that recognizes the baby’s health and prosperity.To raise awareness, he took pictures of each baby being held by a celebrity volunteer, and the event soon became regular with the adoptee photo exhibition being held every December as “Letters from Angels.”“I somehow felt the sense of duty. Thanks to the participation of top celebrities, I was able to contribute to raising the awareness of the adoptee issue by encouraging these top stars to be more vocal as well,” the photographer said. “At first, some thought that I was taking advantage of the innocent children to boost my popularity. But as the exhibition event continued for over a decade, no one looks at me with such prejudice anymore,” he added with laugh. Cho also took pictures of disabled athletes and held an exhibition at the general assembly of the International Paralympic Committee in Seoul in 2007. Moved by his photos, the IPC committee offered him the chance to work as one of 20 official photographers for the Paralympic Games held in Vancouver, Beijing and London. “I wanted to break the prejudice through photography,” he said. “When you see the people from the sky, everyone looks like dots. I just try to equalize the disabled in the picture by discovering their beautiful sides. That way, I believe it can improve the public perception toward the disabled.”Cho is currently the chairman of public relations at the Korea Paralympic Committee. “Photography is a universal language. It moves the heart and wins sympathy without any translation.”Recognized for his service, he received a presidential citation in 2011, along with an award from the Welfare Ministry for his adoptee program and another from the Culture Ministry for helping the disabled in 2010.To better “donate” his talent and collectively support those in need with his professional skills, he set up a company called The Himang Frame for a Positive View in September 2012.In conjunction with Himang Frame, Cho has also operated the Green Frame program since 2012 to support underprivileged youth who are interested in photography, especially the disabled, orphans and multicultural children. He has taught about 300 students annually since 2012, with financial support from Samsung Group.“It felt so fruitful and rewarding when two orphan students were admitted to college as photography majors this year. Gaining school admission means they can stay at the orphanage until they graduate. A little support extended their living support and paved the way for change in their life,” the photographer said. Under the regulation, orphans are required to leave the orphanage once they legally become adults. The rule is suspended if they are admitted to college.As the Green Frame program is only available in Seoul, he now dreams of a greater goal to expand the program to those living in isolated areas, possibly with a mobile photography classroom. Cho has also started providing such learning opportunities to blind children.“As long as I explain in detail, the blind do understand what I say and take pictures as their senses of hearing and touch are much more developed. They can even distinguish where the light and shadows are by feeling the heat,” he said.“Is it really necessary to see the pictures with eyes when they can visualize the object in mind? After all, they do have fun with cameras, which means that they get to have something to enjoy in their life.”By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","four homeless photographers are working ,first two homeless photographers opened ,homeless photographers opened photo studio ,four homeless photographers ,two homeless photographers opened photo","['Cho Sei - hon', 'Korea', 'Cho', 'Seoul City ’s', 'Cho', 'Cho', 'the Korea Herald', 'Cho Sei - hon', 'Yongsan - gu ,', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Cho', 'british', 'U.K.', 'Prince William', 'Royal Patron', 'Diana', 'Wales', 'U.K.', 'U.K.', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Cho', 'Cho', 'korean', '”“I', 'Cho', 'the International Paralympic Committee', 'Seoul', 'IPC', 'Vancouver', 'Beijing', 'London', 'the Korea Paralympic Committee', 'the Welfare Ministry', 'the Culture Ministry', 'the Himang Frame', 'Himang Frame', 'Cho', 'Green Frame', 'Samsung Group', 'Green Frame', 'Seoul', 'Cho', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38151681  0.19265874

(Yonhap)Park also urged lawmakers to end political confrontation over her plan to introduce the state-authored textbooks for secondary education and stop driving the nation into chaos. “Distortion, confusion should be stopped for textbooks that have not been written yet -- things that should not happen.“Correcting the history should not be and cannot be the subject for political wrangling,” she said looking directly at opposition lawmakers.Opening the speech in a rather relaxed tone, Park touched widely on her achievements on state agenda on the economy, inter-Korean relations, labor and public services. The president, however, wrapped up her speech by raising her pitch on state-authored textbooks, a rare gesture seen as clarifying that she has no intention to call the plan off despite the intensifying ideological and political standoff. The opposition members sit with their laptops holding up signs denouncing her textbook plan while Park delivers her speech. (Yonhap)In her 41-minute-speech, Park also urged lawmakers to ratify free trade deals that South Korea had concluded with China, New Zealand and Vietnam. Stressing that the year 2016 was crucial to her government’s completion of a three-year economic innovation plan, the president also urged the parliament to approve bills designed to overhaul the nation’s labor sector and other economy-related bills within this year. She also urged lawmakers to pass the budget bill by the legal deadline of Nov. 30 to help her administration to effectively implement plans to revitalize the economy. The president added that the government would set aside 14.8 trillion won ($13 billion) to strengthen measures for public safety. More than 30 percent of the 386 trillion won budget drafted for next year will be spent in the welfare sector. On North Korea, Park pledged to strengthen defense readiness to better deal with Pyongyang’s possible provocations. Seoul will keep the door for dialogue open and continue efforts to promote exchanges of civilians, such as the reunions of separated families, she said.The president also spent a large portion of her speech stressing the need to secure stable jobs for young people. To open a bright future, South Korean should implement a series of radical reform measures to eradicate abnormal practices that remain hurdles for young people, she said.“Bills aimed at revitalizing the economy and creating jobs for young people remain pending at the parliament for years. As president, it is regrettable. “Even though it is a difficult task, we can only create good jobs for young Koreans only if we go through structural reform,” she said. Her speech was delayed for 14 minutes as rival parties tussled over the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy’s unexpected way of showing their opposition to Park. The NPAD lawmakers placed signs on the back of their laptops that read “No to state-authored textbooks” and “Stabilize people’s lives first.”National Assembly Speaker Chung Ui-wha urged opposition lawmakers to remove the signs before Park enters the parliamentary chamber. The NPAD lawmakers, however, rejected Chung’s demand and sat on their hands throughout Park’s entire speech.The ruling Saenuri Party chairman Kim Moo-sung hailed Park’s speech, saying that it would help the party set a new vision.Expressing frustration, NPAD leader Rep. Moon Jae-in lashed out at Park that she had ignored the people’s demand to focus on the economy and withdraw her plan to introduce the textbooks.“She gave no answer to questions on how to improve the people’s livelihood. There was no self-reflection at all on the government’s failed drive to revive the economy.”Later in the afternoon, the NPAD held an outdoor rally at Seoul Plaza in association with progressive civic groups for first time in 14 months after the party launched a sit-in protest against the government’s botched rescue mission on Sewol ferry that sank off in April, last year. The opposition party also plans to hold a joint debate session with other minor progressive parties and a bus tour to expand public criticism on the textbook plan.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","lawmakers silent protest president park ,opposition lawmakers silent protest president ,denouncing her textbook plan park ,lawmakers silent protest president ,signs denouncing her textbook plan","['Park Geun', 'Park', 'pro - japanese', 'pro - u.s.', 'the Republic of Korea ’s', 'Park', 'Park Geun', 'National Assembly', 'Park', 'inter - korean', 'Park', 'South Korea', 'China', 'New Zealand', 'Vietnam', 'North Korea', 'Park', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'south Korean', 'Koreans', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy ’s', 'Park', 'NPAD', 'Assembly', 'Chung Ui', 'Park', 'NPAD', 'Chung ’s', 'Park', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Park ’s', 'NPAD', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Park', 'NPAD', 'Cho Chung - un']",4,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.13246971  0.01078165

The total number of newborns was also down from 36,700 tallied for July.The annual decrease follows a 0.8 percent on-year rise in the previous month and 3.8 percent gain in June.South Korea, whose population is expected to peak in 2030, has been trying to push up its birthrate to prevent a decline in the national workforce, which could result in more welfare expenses and damage the country's growth potential. The country has one of the lowest birthrates among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development member states.The statistical agency said there were no clear cut reasons for the dip, although data showed childbirths usually fell during the peak summer months of July and August.For the first eight months of 2015, childbirths moved up 1.3 percent on-year to about 299,900 babies, according to the report.In 2014, 435,400 babies were born in Asia's fourth-largest economy, down 0.2 percent on-year. The drop also followed a 9.9 percent plunge in the previous year.The latest report showed about 21,800 couples tied the knot in August, down 2.2 percent from a year earlier.The number of newlyweds is a good indicator of future childbirths as very few children are born to single-parent families here. The number of marriages dropped 5.4 percent last year to 305,500, following a 1.3 percent contraction in 2013.For the January-August period, about 201,300 couples got married, effectively unchanged from the same period last year.In August, the number of divorces fell 5.4 percent on-year to about 8,700. In the first eight months, the number of divorces shrank 6.2 percent on-year to about 71,700.The number of deaths, meanwhile, rose 2.4 percent on-year to some 21,500 during the month. Total deaths in the country hit 185,400 as of August.In a separate report, the statistics office said the number of people changing their residency backtracked 2.9 percent on-year to about 550,000 in September. This number is also down from 619,000 in August.

The main cause behind stroke for middle-aged men aged between 46 and 65 was also smoking (37 percent), followed by high blood pressure (23 percent) and diabetes (15 percent). Elderly men aged 66 or older, however, showed a different pattern, with high blood pressure being the biggest cause for stroke (24 percent), while past medical problems also contributed to the disease (20 percent). Professor Bae hailed the research as the first such study looking into the nationwide population by age and gender to find the risk factors for stroke to come up with preventive measures. “To stave off stroke, younger ones should refrain from smoking while trying to manage their blood pressure, and the elderly need to be careful not to suffer a stroke again,” Bae said. The study was recently published in the Korean Stroke Society’s official Journal of Stroke.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","diabetes 15 percent elderly men ,743 stroke patients both men ,the disease 20 percent professor ,biggest cause for stroke 24 ,young men recent medical study","['Bae Hee - joon', 'Seoul National University', 'east asian', 'korean', 'the Korean Stroke Society ’s', 'Journal of Stroke', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.6438477   0.37280551

Of those, about 18 percent said “great” and 29 percent said “good.” The poll questioned 2,584 adults from Oct. 19-23 with a margin of error of 1.9 percentage points. In contrast, 48.5 percent said her performance was “very bad” or “bad” with 31.3 percent and 17.2 percent, respectively. The number rose 1.5 percentage points from the previous week.

Upon the decision by the Korea Educare Association, parents, particularly those of double-income families, struggled to find places that can look after their kids during the shutdown.“Even though I haven’t heard anything from the child care center that my kids attend, I am thinking about taking a few days off or asking my parents or friends to take care of my children for the next week,” said Song Ki-eun, the 30-year-old mother of a 2-year-old boy. If the KEA, an interest group for privately run child care centers with about 14,000 registered entities, goes ahead with its plan, officials estimate that 700,000 children would be affected. The KEA expected that half of its member child care centers would join the move. Teachers at child care centers protested on Friday over the government`s decision to cut its budget for child care programs. Yonhap.The shutdown came as a part of the child centers’ attempt to block the government’s move to freeze subsidies for centers looking after infants aged 0 to 2. The centers claim that the government had promised to increase the budget by 3 percent in 2016. The caregivers also protested over the government’s failure to fund its free child-care policy, known as Nuri Curriculum, which provides preschools and child care centers with subsidies that help them implement the free welfare policy for children aged 3 to 5. As the opposition grew, the Ministry of Health and Welfare said Friday it would work with lawmakers to increase the subsidies, while trying to encourage municipal governments to fund the Nuri program. But the prospects for funding of the Nuri Curriculum, one of President Park Geun-hye’s key pledges in her presidential campaign in 2012, looked grim as the central government and municipalities continued to clash over which agencies were responsible for funding the free child care initiative. The government has mandated that provincial and municipal education offices should fund the program through their own budgets, while the offices have rejected the government’s demand and insisted that the program be funded by the central government. Meanwhile, the Welfare Ministry has urged the caregivers to withdraw their push to shut down the day care facilities and warned that those involved would be held accountable.“I am sick and tired of the struggles over welfare policies. Their fight over their own vested interests only ends up leaving the parents and the children suffering the most,” said Song.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","2016 the caregivers also protested ,government move to freeze subsidies ,centers protested on friday over ,their kids during the shutdown ,the caregivers also protested over","['the Korea Educare Association', 'Song Ki - eun', 'KEA', 'KEA', 'Nuri Curriculum', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare', 'Nuri', 'the Nuri Curriculum', 'Park Geun - hye ’s', 'the Welfare Ministry', 'Song', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33879709  0.55801708

The patient was recovering from the aftereffects of MERS after testing negative earlier. The 152nd patient received a lung transplant after suffering from MERS but failed to recover fully. Following the latest death, the fatality rate of the disease in Korea rose from 19.4 percent to 19.9 percent.The CDC said that the five super-spreaders, all of whom had pneumonia, transmitted the virus to 153 of the 184 patients detected between May 20, 2015, and July 13, 2015. Two of the total 186 infected patients have been excluded from the denominator as their transmission routes remain uncertain, the CDC said. Thirty-five-year-old patient No. 14, for instance, spread the virus to 85 people while staying at Samsung Medical Center, showing the strongest contagiousness observed from the crisis, the CDC said in its report. Officials take the temperature of hospital-goers at Samsung Medical Center in Seoul on Oct. 13 after one of the patients recovered from MERS was diagnosed again. YonhapThe CDC published these and other epidemiological results on Korea’s MERS outbreak on the Osong Public Health and Research Perspectives journal. This is the CDC’s first such report on the MERS outbreak here.The CDC said it has defined those as super-spreaders if the patient had transmitted the virus to at least four people.The median age of the super-spreaders was 41 years and they all contacted hundreds of people while staying at their respective medical facilities. Four of them were men. Patients 1, 14 and 16 had severe coughs and infected 28 people, 85 people, and 23 people, respectively. On the other hand, Patient 15 and patient 76, who rarely coughed, infected six people and 11 people, respectively, the report said.These patients were hospitalized for an average of 10 days, and the number of people who came into close contact with them ranged from 288 to 805. While patient No. 14 wore a mask intermittently, other super-spreaders did not wear one. None received aerosol-generating treatment.Of the 186 patients infected across 16 hospitals, some 44.1 percent of the cases were patients exposed in hospitals, 32.8 percent were caregivers, and 13.4 percent were health care personnel. The most common presenting symptom was fever and chills. The estimated incubation period was 6.83 days and the serial interval was 12.5 days.The report said the respiratory droplet route is seen as the most likely method of transmission but that further survey is currently ongoing.The report also confirmed failed preventive measures in the early stage.The patient No. 1 started developing fever and myalgia on May 11 after returning from a business trip to Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. His diagnosis did not come until May 20, partly due to a failure of him telling medical staff the countries he had traveled to in his first several hospital visits. By then, he had already come into contact with over 600 people during his multiple visits to different hospitals. Twenty-six cases of infection were confirmed among these initial contacts, and consecutive transmission via hospitals rapidly proceeded throughout the nation, the report explained. Even upon the first diagnosis, only three were placed in isolation. The number then increased to 64 the next day and to 120 upon the diagnosis of the fifth patient. Those who were not placed in isolation soon enough further transmitted the virus at other hospitals, some of them becoming super-spreaders.The analysis showed that the mortality rate of those aged 65 and over was almost eight times higher than that of younger patients.History of diabetes, malignancy and the presence of underlying respiratory disease, cardiac disease and chronic kidney disease were also significantly associated with mortality. MERS is a viral disease that is still fairly new to humans. No vaccine or treatment is currently available for the disease, which contributes the high fatality rate of around 36 percent globally.There currently is only one MERS patient in South Korea. Thirty-five-year-old patient No. 80 tested negative for the virus on Sept. 30 and again on Oct. 1 but tested positive recently.From news reports","sunday after another patient died ,patient in south korea thirty ,152nd patient received lung transplant ,fever and myalgia on may ,the virus on sept 30","['Korea', 'South Korea', 'the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Korea', 'CDC', 'CDC', 'Samsung Medical Center', 'CDC', 'Samsung Medical Center', 'Seoul', 'CDC', 'Korea', 'the Osong Public Health and Research Perspectives', 'CDC', 'CDC', 'Bahrain', 'the United Arab Emirates', 'Saudi Arabia', 'South Korea']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3874507   0.55539715

Joint Press Corps.“My sister, sister, I will take you to Seoul. We will go there together. I will send you back after you spend just three days with us there … you will have no problem,” Park said in a trembling voice.His nephew from the North separated the grieving siblings, saying, “We will meet when our countries are reunited.”The first round of the reunions at the mountain resort ended Thursday after the two-hour gathering where 389 South Koreans exchanged what could be their last words of love with their relatives they were separated from after the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.A total of 141 North Korean participants attended the reunions, which were possible as part of a comprehensive inter-Korean agreement on Aug. 25 to defuse cross-border tensions and improve bilateral ties.During the final gathering in the morning at the resort, many participants got down on their knees and bowed to bid farewell to their parents, with some singing a sorrowful song longing for unification.‘It is a sad thing (for us to be separated again),” said Ri Hong-jong, 88, from the North as her 68-year-old daughter Lee Jeong-suk was poised to bow before him. “We are running out of time,” Lee said with teary eyes.Lee Gyeong-hee, 77 from the South, promised his 84-year-old sister Ri Ran-hee to live until 100, hoping that reunification will come before they die.“Live long. Some 20 years, we both will turn around 100 and will be able to meet again,” Lee told his sister, while firmly clasping her hands.

Schools choose from any of the eight textbooks, while primary schools have a single set of state-authored history textbooks.After months of controversy, the Ministry of Education last week announced that history textbooks nationwide will be authored by the government starting in the 2017 school year. ""The problematic thing about the current system is that most of the authors participating in authoring and monitoring the textbooks are mostly left-leaning,"" said Cho Jin-hyung, the chief of the group.Cho said as for Rhee Syng-man, the first South Korean president, most textbooks described him as a leader who had many flaws rather than feats.""There were mostly negative contents about the Rhee Syng-man administration,"" Cho said, adding that books should have a balanced view of him as the leader in the chaotic period following Korea's liberation from Japan's  1910-45 colonial rule.Another non-profit education civic group, World Without Worries About Shadow Education raised concern that the government's decision to reintroduce a single set of textbooks could raise the cost of private education.""It is difficult to conclude that a single set of textbooks directly raises the cost of private education,"" said Yoon Jee-hee.""However, there is a high possibility that the burden on private education will be increased in light of the local education culture, which emphasizes private tutoring."" South Korean parents are known for their enthusiasm about education, with private education spending staying significantly high, though its growth has been slowing in recent years. Parents spent 18.2 trillion won ($17 billion) in 2014 on private education for their children, according to data released by the non-profit education civic group.Private education spending reached its peak in 2009 at 21 trillion won.

Now, I do so for you,"" Park said, with his eyes teary.They were among hundreds of Koreans granted a rare chance to meet their long-lost families living on the other part of the heavily-fortified border for the first time in more than six decades.Nearly 130,000 South Koreans are registered in the government's database as having family in the North, split by the 1950-53 Korean War. Half of them have already died and around 66,000 others still hope for reunions with their relatives in the North.Amid the rather chilly and cloudy autumn weather, the South Koreans headed back home without any plan to see their families in the communist nation again. Reunions may be unlikely before unification, as the two Koreas are technically still at war with the 1950-53 Korean War ending in a truce, not a peace treaty.Tight border control will continue, blocking phone calls and email exchanges.It marked the first inter-Korean family reunion event in a year and eight months, a result of the Aug. 25 deal between the two Koreas that ended a military standoff.Another round of reunions involving 250 more South Koreans from 90 families will be held from Saturday to next Monday at the scenic mountain, home to a resort developed by the South's Hyundai Group.Such family reunion events began in 2000, riding on the accomplishment of the first inter-Korean summit.

Yonhap“I am taken back and even flabbergasted,” said Rep. Kim Yong-tae of the Saenuri Party on Wednesday in an interview with a local broadcaster. “(The government) acts as if the state-authored textbook scheme is the only option and forces us to follow its lead. … I believe there is no consensus among the public,” said Kim. The second-term lawmaker elected from Yangchun-gu, Seoul, cautioned that the party would lose voters in the capital city and neighboring metropolitan areas, highlighting that the constituents would oppose the move at worst or have marginal interest in the issue at best. Kim’s criticism followed that of a fellow Saenuri lawmaker from the metropolitan area. Rep. Chung Doo-won, the three-term lawmaker for the constituency of Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, dismissed last Thursday the government’s move as a “backward” policy that hurts democratic diversity. While saying that the current textbooks’ left-leaning bias must be addressed, Chung, who once served as vice mayor of Seoul City, asserted that the governments should follow the norm where nations refrain from monopolizing textbooks. The escalating voice of opposition within the ruling party was seen to reflect the lawmakers’ concerns toward aggravating public opinion especially in the metropolitan area.According to a Gallup poll released on Oct. 16, 45 percent of Seoul residents and 46 percent of Incheon and Gyeonggi Province residents opposed the adoption of the state textbooks. Nationwide polls, meanwhile, were equally split with 42 percent each for and against the textbook change.Meanwhile, other political heavyweights from the ruling party also spoke out against the government’s plan to publish state textbooks. National Assembly Speaker Chung Eui-hwa on Tuesday expressed his regret at the lack of communication by the government to convince the public of the need for state-authored textbooks.“(The government) should have first convinced the public about how ideologically biased the current textbooks are and then discussed whether it would push to issue state-authored textbooks or reinforce the government’s monitoring system. Though belated, we should address those procedural issues,” said Chung.Gyeonggi Province Gov. Nam Kyung-pil also expressed his opposition to the move. In an interview with a local daily, Nam said that the government should have published better textbooks and let the public select what they consider appropriate, and not force them to choose what the government sees as right.

The previous evening, it explained that Hwang’s comments were in line with his emphasis on the importance of investing in history education.“The comments were the personal opinion of one university chief. The quote in the article does not even fit the context,” the ministry said. Hwang, who doubles as a lawmaker for the ruling Saenuri Party, has been the front man of the administration’s push to take back publishing rights for secondary school history textbooks from private publishers. Last week, the Education Ministry announced the revival of state-authored history textbooks because current textbooks are left-leaning. Progressive educators, students and the opposition parties responded with protests and statements decrying the decision. Professors from at least 35 universities across the country have announced their intent not to participate in the state history textbooks as of Wednesday. By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","massive student pro democracy protests ,history textbooks further escalated wednesday ,majors have conducted numerous protests ,student pro democracy protests until ,the nationwide student protests","['Hwang Woo - yea', 'Hwang', 'Korea', 'South Korea', 'Hwang', 'Hwang', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Education Ministry']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33483967  0.64104575

YonhapThe survey was conducted online on 1,000 Seoulites aged 19 or over in August. If they had enough spare time, about 35 percent said they would like to work out or have hobbies, while over 16 percent said they wanted to sleep. The other 16 percent said they would prefer to study or learn something new. As for the main reason for the forgone leisure time, more than 42 percent picked financial pressures. That was followed by excessive working hours and housework with 32 percent. The rest said they psychologically could not afford to invest in hobbies or did not know enough about such activities. Seoul citizens have four hours and 24 minutes a day in spare time, according to the survey.Those in their 60s had the most time to spare with about 6.5 hours, followed by those in their 50s with 4.5 hours. Those in their 30s had the least spare time with just three hours and 19 minutes daily.Watching TV was the most common activity that all generations preferred in their spare time, as people spent nearly two hours a day doing so on average. They used less than half an hour on social life and 14 minutes on surfing the Internet.Those in their 30s spent the largest portion of time reading books at 11 minutes a day while other generations spent 10 minutes or less.Other than watching TV, senior citizens preferred to take walks or rest, while those in their 20s and 30s spent time searching for information on the Internet or playing computer and mobile games.

The research paper, authored by Lee Soon-ah from the National Pension Research Institute, showed that 46.9 percent of the Korean elderly population lived in poverty -- defined as having income of less than half the median national income -- as of last year. The number was significantly higher than those of other developed nations, such as Norway (1.5 percent), England (7.9 percent), the U.S. (19.3 percent) and Taiwan (26.6 percent).  Korean elderly citizens wait to get treated at a medical clinic. (Yonhap)In countries such as Denmark, Poland, the U.K., Finland, Australia and Canada, public transfer payments, such as pension payments, retirement benefits and living allowance, accounted for 70 percent of the average income of the elderly population. In Korea, however, public transfer payments only made up 28.8 percent of the average income of the elderly, while private pension payments and savings accounted for 19.8 percent of the income. In most European countries examined for the paper, including Denmark, Norway and Finland, such private savings or pension payments only accounted for about 0.1 to 0.4 percent of the average elderly income. “The statistics show that families and individuals, rather than the state, are caring and providing for the country’s aging population,” said researcher Lee in the paper. “The government must make sure all elderly individuals can benefit from the country’s welfare benefits regardless of the financial status of their family members or children.”Under the current law, all adult Koreans are legally obligated to financially support their spouses, parents and parents-in-laws. Accordingly, the recipients of the state welfare payments lose a portion or all of their allowance if any member of their immediate family -- spouse, child or child-in-law -- has a regular monthly income, depending on how much they make. Critics of the law have claimed the current system has in fact caused family discord among people who live below the poverty line, as they would purposely cut contact with one another to prove they have no family members to rely on, therefore becoming eligible for the state allowance payments given to those who make less than the government-designated minimum cost of living of 603,403 won ($534.25) a month.As of this year, there are some 6.62 million senior citizens in Korea, accounting for 13.1 percent of the entire population. With the country’s low fertility rate, coupled with the high ratio of baby boomers entering retirement age, Statistics Korea expects the elderly will make up 15.7 percent of the population in 2020 and 40 percent by 2060.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","taiwan 26 percent korean elderly ,percent of the korean elderly ,26 percent korean elderly citizens ,percent korean elderly citizens wait ,46 percent of the korean","['korean', 'korean', 'Lee Soon - ah', 'the National Pension Research Institute', 'korean', 'Norway', 'England', 'U.S.', 'Taiwan', 'korean', 'Yonhap)In', 'Denmark', 'Poland', 'U.K.', 'Finland', 'Australia', 'Canada', 'Korea', 'european', 'Denmark', 'Norway', 'Finland', 'Lee', 'Koreans', 'Korea', 'Statistics Korea', 'Claire Lee']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47939253  0.43497834

A.J. Garcia, the U.S. branch president of civic group Coexistence of Animal Rights on Earth, had launched a hunger strike in front of the Seoul mayoral residence from Oct. 9, claiming that 33 auctioned animals including goats and deer were actually sold to a slaughterhouse. He urged the zoo to repurchase the remaining animals.Seoul Zoo had denied Garcia’s claim, arguing that the first buyer of the animals appeared to have sold the animals to a slaughterhouse without their knowledge. It also stressed that the sale of animals was part of the zoo’s long-term reform to control the number of species while concentrating on raising endangered and wild animals. The zoo has regularly put excess animals up for auction once or twice a year since 1986 to control the number of animals.Following the decision, the 30-year-old activist stopped his hunger strike on Saturday.The repurchase cost will be shared by the zoo and two animal rights group, including CARE.

It is very healthy for the younger generation,"" he said.Rifkin, meanwhile, stressed that the public still must be concerned over the falling quality of content.""What I'm worried about is contents losing ability (to help readers) think in a deep layered way. Then we lose the best talent we have, which is to produce knowledge,"" Rifkin said.Rifkin said although he admires South Korea's achievements in technology, the country also must make efforts to establish an environment-friendly ecosystem.""You are starving for something, but you don't know what it is. It is too much from being natural way of the planet. Where is nature? Where is environment living?

Aside from earning quick cash, the experience empowered him with a shrewd sense of live performance, audience interaction and song selection.The up-and-coming artist visited Korea in early October at the invitation of the Korea Foundation. He performed at the Multicultural Arirang Music Festival in Changwon City on Oct. 4, Korea Foundation’s Cheonggyecheon Music Festival in Seoul on Oct. 9 and Oct. 11 and at the opening ceremony of Citadines Haeundae Hotel in Busan on Oct. 13. Kostadinov also recorded a session of the variety show “A song for you” with Korean pop group CNBlue, which will be aired on KBS2 on Oct. 25. Bulgarian singer, songwriter and guitarist Miryan Kostadinov and Bulgarian fans at the Korea Foundation’s Cheonggyecheon Music Festival in Seoul on Oct. 11. Joel Lee / The Korea Herald“Korean music is exceptional in that the producers are really smart and know how to make international hits,” he said. “K-pop artists are very passionate, talented and well-trained, and can dance and sing like no other.”“When all these things come together,” he explained, “it translates into a formula for the Korean Wave.”The tall singer with a sturdy, husky voice said that a key part of hallyu’s universal vogue had to do with linguistics. “The Korean language has musical qualities because of the way it sounds,” he highlighted. “In music, word intonation is important and Korean sounds very melodic. I think it’s one of the reasons why K-pop is so popular globally.”Koreans also know how to promote their music, he noted, pointing out that K-pop was readily audible and visible compared to music from other Asian countries. “People all over the world can just stumble upon K-pop and once they hear the music and see the dance and music video, they simply fall in love with it.”Bulgarian singer, songwriter and guitarist Miryan Kostadinov and Bulgarian fans at the Korea Foundation’s Cheonggyecheon Music Festival in Seoul on Oct. 11. Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldIn July, Kostadinov witnessed firsthand the power of hallyu in Bulgaria when he was invited to be on the jury of a K-pop festival organized by the Korean embassy in Sofia.“It was incredible to see thousands of Bulgarians singing and dancing along K-pop songs by heart, so perfectly in Korean language,” he said. “It wasn’t just music, but a whole frenzied culture that included album sales, Korean people and food stalls on the sides.”Although Bulgaria and Korea are physically far apart, he argued that fans could connect through K-pop.From 2012 to 2014, Kostadinov studied art and design at the University of Huddersfield in England. He graduated with a first honors degree and was granted a master’s scholarship, but decided to pursue a music career back home instead. “So far in Bulgaria, we haven’t had companies supporting individual songwriters. Many singers parrot labels presented to them,” Kostadinov said. During his two-week visit here, he performed various songs, including “Arirang,” “The Sound of Silence” and “Love Somebody,” as well as his compositions “Inner Demons” and “I Won’t Pray.”He added, “If you have a style that you are good with, you need to stick with it and do everything you can to improve it and be recognized for that style.” Bulgarian singer, songwriter and guitarist Miryan Kostadinov at the Korea Foundation’s Cheonggyecheon Music Festival in Seoul on Oct. 11. Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldThe young singer with raven hair and a beard, wearing a black hoodie, noted that diverse music genres have begun to spring up in Bulgaria over the past several years, triggered by people’s avant-garde desires.“Many talented artists perform underground and are not yet exposed through the mass media,” he said. “Over the next few years, I think there will be a qualitative shift in Bulgaria’s music industry, because people are simply fed up with the same, flat commercial scores.”Next year, Kostadinov plans to release four to five singles with videos, possibly an album, on top of performances around the world. “My ultimate dream is to be one of the most recognized musicians in the world,” he said smiling. “So far, it seems to be going perfectly well. I can’t wait to achieve them all, so I’m always rushing ― ‘ppalli-ppalli.’”By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)Bulgarian singer, songwriter and guitarist Miryan Kostadinov at the Korea Foundation’s Cheonggyecheon Music Festival in Seoul on Oct. 9.

113,113,1 in 10 Korean women in their 20s smoke: study," About 10 percent of Korean women in their 20s are smokers, accounting for the largest portion of all female smokers in South Korea, a government study showed Sunday. 　While Korean women’s smoking prevalence rates are quite low compared to other developed nations, research findings show that the rates may rise in the future if young women in their 20s as well as female teenagers continue to smoke as they grow olde...","About 10 percent of Korean women in their 20s are smokers, accounting for the largest portion of all female smokers in South Korea, a government study showed Sunday. While Korean women’s smoking prevalence rates are quite low compared to other developed nations, research findings show that the rates may rise in the future if young women in their 20s as well as female teenagers continue to smoke as they grow older, according to the government report.As of last year, only 4.3 percent of all Korean women aged 15 or older smoked, which was far lower than the average smoking prevalence rate for women in the Organization for Economic and Development countries, which stood at 15.7 percent. The rate in France was 20.2 percent, while that of Japan was 8.2 percent. 123RFHowever, the smoking prevalence rate for Korean female teenagers, which stood at 5.7 percent, was higher than those for all age groups except women in their 20s and 30s.Overseas studies have shown that women’s empowerment is associated with increasing women’s smoking prevalence rates, especially among young women. The World Health Organization’s 2010 report found that in countries where women have higher empowerment, women’s smoking rates were higher than men’s, independent of the level of economic development and of the level of income inequality. Data from the Global Youth Tobacco Survey also showed that smoking rates among boys and girls worldwide resemble each other more than smoking rates among adult women and men, partly because societies are becoming increasingly tolerant of women who smoke worldwide.The WHO report also stated that the rise of smoking among women has been affected by the tobacco industry’s marketing of cigarettes to women as a “symbol of emancipation.”Regardless, medical experts stressed that cigarette smoking harms nearly every organ of the body, causes many diseases and reduces the health of smokers in general, regardless of one’s gender. For women, smoking is estimated to increase the risk of developing lung cancer by 26.7 times, and quadruples their risk of having an ectopic pregnancy. In spite of its low female smoking rate, Korea is home to almost 10 million smokers, and an estimated 57,000 die each year due to smoking-related diseases including lung cancer. Last year, it had one of the highest smoking rates for adult males among OECD nations at 43.7 percent, surpassing the OECD average of 26 percent.While the largest number of female Korean smokers are in their 20s and 30s, the biggest number of male smokers were in their 30s and 40s, as of last year. The parliament last year approved an 80 percent increase in the price of cigarettes in an effort to curb smoking. The new bill took effect on Jan.1.Local health experts stress that it is important to make efforts to curb youth smoking rates on the connection with other issues, as studies have shown the number of teens who both drink and smoke is 6.4 times higher than those who drink but don’t smoke. Smoking teenagers are also 1.9 times more likely to be depressed and 1.4 times more likely to skip breakfast than nonsmoking teens.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","10 percent of korean women ,korean women smoking prevalence rates ,rate for korean female teenagers ,percent of all korean women ,korean women in their 20s","['korean', 'South Korea', 'korean', 'korean', 'the Organization for Economic and Development', 'France', 'Japan', 'korean', 'the World Health Organization ’s', 'the Global Youth Tobacco Survey', 'WHO', 'Korea', 'OECD', 'OECD', 'korean', 'Claire Lee']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.71808904  0.55932868

His demand to the mayor is simple: Stop selling public zoo animals to slaughterers. A.J. Garcia, U.S. branch president of civic group Coexistence of Animal Rights on Earth, argues that Seoul City is using the overpopulation of animals as a means to draw profits. The Seoul Metropolitan Government runs the Seoul Zoo to the south of the capital in Gwacheon, Gyeonggi Province.  A.J. Garcia stages a hunger strike Wednesday for the sixth day in front of the Seoul mayor’s residence in central Seoul. (Lee Hyun-jeong/The Korea Herald)“What Seoul Zoo does is that it sells any animals, including dogs, at auction and lets anyone buy them. It has become profits for the zoo. It doesn’t properly check where they are selling to. This is insane,” the 30-year-old told The Korea Herald on Wednesday. His battle with the city started in August when CARE officials found that dozens of deer and black goats from the Seoul Zoo were being taken to a slaughterhouse after being put up for auction. One black goat was immediately slaughtered on the first day, CARE said. The hunger strike was the last option left for him to save the animals, Garcia said. “We kept asked the city to take action for two months, but nothing changed,” he said, adding that the mayor has yet to acknowledge him, though he has been sitting next to the door of his residence for six days.Seoul Zoo, however, flatly denied Garcia’s claim.“In August, the zoo sold the animals to one who didn’t have anything to do with the slaughterhouse. But the first buyer apparently resold them to a slaughterhouse,” a zoo official said. Seoul Zoo has regularly put excess animals up at auction once or twice a year since 1986 to control the number of animals.It also refuted the claim that the animal sales were for business purposes, saying that it was to control the number of animals. In the case of other countries, such as the U.S. or some European states, contraception or euthanasia is often used to control the number of “surplus” animals in the limited space.“The zoo’s annual budget is around 18 billion won ($15.9 million). It drew only about 15 million won for the animal sales this year. Earning such an amount from the auction gives little financial help,” the official added. The animal rights activists urged the zoo to buy back the animals, but it refused the demand, citing insufficient space. The official stressed that the zoo is currently rearranging animal types as part of a restructuring plan released last year. In the long term, the zoo is aiming only to focus on endangered species and native animals, officials said. Acknowledging the concerns over animals being sent to slaughterhouses, however, the zoo vowed to map out a guideline to prevent similar cases and limit the eligibility of auction participants.

According to a study conducted by the Institute for Longevity Sciences at Wonkwang University, developed countries with high Internet accessibility were found to have longer healthy life expectancies than developing countries with fewer Internet users. Healthy life expectancy refers to how long a person can be expected to live healthily without a disease.The research team analyzed the World Health Organization’s health life expectancy data of 178 countries and the social economic indexes released by the United Nations and World Bank between 2000 and 2012. The study was published in the latest issue of the Social Indicators Research. Ireland, with the longest life expectancy of 71.5 years, topped the ranking of Internet users with 70.34 out of 100 citizens. Canada stood at second with 71 years of healthy life expectancy and 67.15 Internet users, followed by Sweden with 71 years of healthy life expectancy and 69.43 Internet users. South Korea took the fourth spot with 70.5 years of healthy life expectancy and 64.39 Internet users. On the other hand, countries with short healthy life expectancies were found to have low numbers of Internet users. Sierra Leone, which recorded the shortest life expectancy with 36 years, had only 0.6 out of 100 citizens as Internet users. “The tendency of longer life expectancy in Internet-developed countries suggests that people are able to easily reach health information online. It also reflects the impact of high income level and urbanization level in the Internet-developed countries,” said institute head professor Kim Jong-in.

Most companies still require applicants to attach photos to resumes for the screening process. In a separate survey of 880 human resources staff members from Korean companies released earlier this year, some 64 percent responded that they took into account applicants’ appearances in the recruitment process. The employers thought that good-looking candidates could get along better with coworkers and their looks were a result of their competence and efforts. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","appearance hurts their job prospects ,korean women 38 percent were ,10 job seekers in south ,hurts their job prospects ,deciding job prospects most companies","['South Korea', 'Saramin', 'korean', 'South Korea', 'korean']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.77272528  0.37636977

Seoul Central District Court upheld the previous rulings the evidence was insufficient to confirm that the broker had known that the runaway wife did not initially have intentions to marry and the broker deliberately provided false information about the foreign wife. A Korean man in his 50s surnamed Han met a Filipino woman in the Philippines in 2011 through the marriage broker after paying a fee of 24 million won ($21,000). The couple married in the Philippines and settled in Korea in July 2012. The foreign wife, however, ran away from home 56 days after arriving here, and severed contact with her husband. In 2013, Han sought compensation of 6 million won and return of the brokerage fee, claiming that the middleman allegedly had known that the wife came to Korea without intentions to marry. He also argued that the broker did not give documents of the contract and personal information of the spouse. The court ruled that there was no causality between the spouse’s runaway and the provision of the documents. It is also difficult to see that Han had suffered damages, the verdict added.The court, however, ordered that the broker return a partial brokerage fee of 9 million won to Han, saying that the contract was not terminated upon matchmaking, but that it was valid until Han filed the lawsuit.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","the foreign wife korean man ,foreign wife korean man ,korean lower court tuesday ruled ,foreign wife korean man in ,wife came to korea without","['korean', 'Seoul Central District Court', 'korean', 'Han', 'filipino', 'Philippines', 'Philippines', 'Korea', 'Han', 'Korea', 'Han', 'Han', 'Han', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.77737033  0.45363984

Young people don't feel personally connected to it,"" said Dennis Blair, chairman of the Sasakawa Peace Foundation USA, in an interview with Yonhap News Agency, in response to a question about the ""comfort women"" issue.Comfort women is a euphemistic term for victims of Japan's sexual enslavement of women during World War II.""But young people have to know where they came from, what happened, what their grandparents did, what their great-grandparents did,"" he said. ""It is a cop out to say that we never, we will never, we only should apologize once.""Such historical issues should be ""relearned and revisited and passed on in a very dynamic way,"" Blair said. ""History is alive and your understanding has to be refreshed from generation to generation.""The sexual slavery issue is the biggest thorn in frayed relations between Japan and South Korea, with Seoul demanding Tokyo take steps to address the grievances of elderly Korean victims of the atrocity and Japan refusing to do so.Tokyo has also been accused of attempting to whitewash its militaristic past, allegedly pressuring an American publisher to revise a description of the sexual slavery issue in a school textbook in an apparent attempt to water down the atrocity.Blair said that both South Korea and Japan should ""face their history.""""To overcome the events of history requires a two-way process,"" he said. ""There has to be understanding, apology, reconciliation, but then, there has to be acceptance by the other side so that things can move forward.""Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's war anniversary statement in August ""could have gone further from the Japanese side because, as I said, I think that it's very important for the leaders of both countries to move forward,"" Blair said.Blair also said South Korea and Japan view history too emotionally as something of traitor-or-patriot issues, stressing that history should be discussed in a cool-headed manner and in historical terms, with a focus on arguments.""Japan and Korea have so many important issues they need to work on together,"" he said. ""With so much important work to do, to have a historical issue just block the ability to move forward I think is not good. Not good for Korea, not good for Japan. Certainly not good for the U.S.""Blair recently drew media attention when he criticized Japanese Prime Minister Abe for failing to offer a clear, straightforward apology for the country's wartime crimes in a statement issued in August to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.In an article posted on the Sasakawa USA's website, Blair said Abe's statement ""falls far short"" of Japan's 1995 statement of apology, known as ""Murayama Statement,"" in helping Japan ""face its own history squarely and assuring other countries it has done so.""Blair also said in the article that the Abe statement ""too often resorts to the anonymous passive voice with its avoidance of responsibility,"" such as ""countless lives were lost"" and ""there were women ... whose honor and dignity were severely injured.""""This statement is disappointing and misses a huge opportunity both to educate Prime Minister Abe's own supporters and to reassure other countries,"" Blair said in the article. ""We wish Japan's leaders would help its citizens understand their country's past better and more fully.""The criticism came as a surprise because Blair is the chairman of a think tank known for efforts to help promote Japan's image and interests in the U.S., and has been considered one of the pro-Japanese American security and foreign policy experts.""We're an independent organization and sometimes I criticize the U.S. government, sometimes I criticize the Japanese government, sometimes I criticize the Korean government and I think that's the job in democracy,"" he said of the article.""I hope my criticisms are founded on reason, not on emotion, that they are logical. I think the strength of democratic governments is to have reasoned dialogue. There's too little of it in the politics of any of our three countries,"" he said.Speaking of renewed tensions over North Korea's threat to conduct nuclear or missile tests, the former commander of the U.S. Pacific Command said Pyongyang is ""playing its old game"" of asking for concessions in exchange for refraining from doing bad things.""We have to be strong and resilient. If they take an action, we have to hit them harder than they hit us. I think the economic sanctions should continue to be strong. We have to, to the extent we can, help North Koreans realize what a terrible government they have,"" he said.Blair said Japan's controversial security legislation should be no cause for concern for South Korea because it's clear that Japanese public opinion, which he said will ultimately control the use of Japanese force, is not aggressive, but defensive.He also said he believes the legislation is a ""step in the right direction"" and would actually be in Korea's interest because Japan can provide logistical and other support for U.S. and Korean forces in the event of contingencies, even if Japanese forces are not involved in combat operations in Korea.Blair said he wishes South Korean President Park Geun-hye's upcoming visit to Washington a success.""I think it will be a good visit.

This includes presentation skills, negotiation tactics and how to effectively carry out a business meeting. But it aims to achieve more than making students a business expert. One of Min’s main project is the “creative mobile app proposal,” which has students create hypothetical products for a hypothetical company, such as smartphone applications, devices for the Internet of Things and wearable computers.The project does not stop at merely creating ideas. Min chooses product plans that stand out and introduces them to relevant companies or government bodies. If the plan is deemed plausible, the respective organization develops the product, potentially creating jobs and profit.About 800 students participated in the project from 2010 to the spring semester of 2015. “Through this project, students foster the ability to develop their original ideas, which gives them an edge over potential competitors in a global job market. Companies also benefit from it because they are provided with creative ideas from the students,” Min said. One of the model projects for the spring semester of this year was an application and a website for helping refugees in Germany, by a student named Jonathan Berneth, which will help with organizational problems and make it easier for people to donate. Min said the project was initiated so that it could help students develop abilities that corporations demand.“There is a considerable gap between higher education and the talent companies are looking for,” Min pointed out. “In order to overcome this gap, it is important for students to acquire a competitive edge that the companies want by participating in various projects.He said the goal of the project is to train students to perform their jobs in future careers while being able to come up with creative ideas.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heradlcorp.com)","making students business expert ,making students business expert one ,students business expert ,through his business english class ,students business expert one","['korean', 'Min Byoung', 'Konkuk University', 'Germany', 'Jonathan Berneth', 'Yoon Min - sik']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38233235  0.599567

The activists said they are bringing the particular issue to the U.N. Women, during a scheduled meeting with the organization’s policy director Dr. Purna Sen on Oct. 27 in New York.The protesters, some 20 of them, included lawyers and activists for women with disabilities and victims of sexual violence. The participants, representing 12 NGOs, were initially scheduled to meet with Gender Ministry officials after holding a press conference, but the ministry canceled the meeting at the last minute on Tuesday night. A group of human rights and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex issues activists protest Wednesday in front of the central government building in Seoul against the Gender Ministry’s recent order for Daejeon Metropolitan City to delete articles that guarantee LGBTI rights in the city’s newly revised charter of gender equality. (Claire Lee/The Korea Herald)The reason for the cancellation was, according to the ministry, that the officials thought the meeting was “going to be a private event” and the activists organized a press conference without consulting the public servants. “This is both disrespectful and absurd,” said Na Young-jung, one of the protesters who participated in the rally. South Korea’s Women’s Development Act, implemented in 1995 to protect women’s rights and combat discrimination against women, was renamed in July to expand the scope of protection against discrimination of both genders. In June, Daejeon Metropolitan City revised its municipal charter of gender equality, based on the renamed Gender Equality Act, and newly introduced articles that protect the rights of the LGBTI community. The revised charter stipulated that the mayor of Daejeon is responsible for coming up with and implementing measures that guarantee equality of opportunity and diverse family life for LGBTI individuals. However, after receiving complaints from gay rights opponents including religious group members, the Gender Ministry in August sent the municipal government of Daejeon an official order to delete the particular articles on LGBTI rights in its charter. The ministry claimed the revised Gender Equality Act in fact does not specifically include any articles on LGBTI rights, and therefore it is incorrect to state that the articles in the charter are based on the Act. The Daejeon municipal government eventually scrapped the articles in the charter. “We had been planning to delete the articles even before the Gender Ministry sent us the request,” said Kwon Jun-sik from the Daejeon Metropolitan City. “We received a lot of complaints from citizens. We first assumed that the Gender Equality Act includes the concept of protecting LGBTI rights, but it turns out the Act does not specifically state that.”The protesters demanded that the government must recognize and validate LGBTI issues as gender issues. “Am I not a woman?” said Song Jeong-yoon, representing a group of sexual minority women at the rally. “This question was asked by black women about 160 years ago. They asked (while forced into slavery), ‘Are we not women?’ ‘Are we not human beings?’ I did not think I’d be asking this question in 2015. How can the Gender Ministry, a government body responsible for women’s rights, voluntarily exclude sexual minority women from benefiting from policies and measures for women?”Bae Bok-ju, the head of a group of women with disabilities, also criticized the ministry for discriminating against LGBTI community.“How is this (what the ministry has done) different from saying, ‘Women with disabilities shouldn’t be entitled to benefit from policies for women’?” she said at the rally. Last month, a total of 12 United Nations entities, including UNHCR, U.N. Women and WHO, released a joint statement calling for an end to violence and discrimination against LGBTI people, asking governments to do more to tackle the issue. “We remain seriously concerned that around the world, millions of LGBTI individuals, those perceived as LGBTI and their families face widespread human rights violations,” the statement said. “The statement is an expression of the commitment on the part of U.N. entities to support member states to (end violence against them).”However, an official from the Gender Ministry, who did not wish to be named, said “the public has to be convinced first” in order to implement measures for LGBTI individuals in Korea. “We still don’t even have antidiscrimination laws,” she said. She also claimed that the Human Rights Commission is in charge of LGBTI rights in Korea, not the Gender Ministry. “The LGBTI rights are protected under the National Human Rights Commission Act, not the Gender Equality Act,” she said.According to a 2013 study conducted by the local think-tank Asan Institute for Policy Studies, only 21.5 percent of 1,500 surveyed Koreans said they had little or no objection to homosexuality. Ryu Min-hee, an attorney at the Korean Lawyers for Public Interest and Human Rights, said the particular incident involving the Gender Ministry will be addressed at a meeting with U.N. Women’s Dr. Sen in New York later this month. At the meeting, the policy director is scheduled to meet with representatives of LBTI groups around the world. “The U.N. entities have encouraged governments to do more to end discrimination against LGBTI community members. What the Gender Ministry is doing is the opposite of what’s been asked,” Ryu said. “We have our representative residing in New York and she will be discussing this matter at the meeting.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","intersex issues activists protest wednesday ,activists protest wednesday in front ,issues activists protest wednesday ,activists protest wednesday ,issues activists protest wednesday in","['south korean', 'LGBTI', 'the Gender Ministry ’s', 'LGBTI', 'LGBTI', 'the U.N.

In 1999, 12 out of the 25 administrative districts in the capital had more than 10 overpasses. But now, only five districts have more than 10 overpasses. Dongjak-gu and Dongdaemun-gu plan to demolish several more overpasses by the end of the year. “Pedestrian-oriented” measures contributed to the overpass decline, the city said. The city districts have begun to prefer crosswalks over overpasses due to public complaints over the inconvenience footbridges pose to elderly and disabled people. The unattractive look of old overpasses also played a role, it added.The maintenance and repair of each overpass costs over 10 million won ($8,500) a year on average, officials said. Not all overpasses will be torn down, however. Some will be kept to ensure the safety of children around the school zones.

Seeking to break the ice, he told them a story starting with a Korean proverb. Word for word, it was supposed to be “Too many boatmen steer a boat to the mountain.” Instead, the interpreter opted for what she believed was a more comprehensible expression, “Too many cooks spoil the broth.” Yet the official, who had expected to hear “ship” or “mountain” to his dismay, gave her poor marks after the session and asked for someone else for the next round. This old saga, told by a senior diplomat to The Korea Herald, highlights the delicate and complex nature of the work that poses a dilemma between literal and liberal translations, even for the nation’s finest specialists. Heated debate persists over whether translation is an art or a science. Either oral or written, it requires not just an exceptional command of both languages but also a flair for conveying the nuance and intention of the speaker or writer and, perhaps their audience as well. Presidential interpreters are some of the best at it, many of them career diplomats armed with superb language skills and knowledge of sensitive foreign policy issues. “Unlike simultaneous or conference interpretation, we need to embody the speaker’s personality in addition to conveying exact meanings,” said Chung Eui-hae, director for ASEAN cooperation at the Foreign Ministry who served as an English interpreter for late President Roh Moo-hyun from 2006-08. “Presidential interpreters, in particular, need to help the two leaders build a rapport, going beyond being communication facilitators, while fostering the mood in line with the type of the event.” The field has increasingly been dominated by women. Females make up some 80 percent of the entire enrollment at the Graduate School of Interpretation and Translation at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul, according to school officials. Yet the overall scale of the market, where freelancing still holds sway, has rather shriveled in recent years, especially for English translation, as more Koreans gain overseas experience starting in childhood and get to mingle with international staff at school and work, insiders say. “To me, the No. 1 threat to my job security is the growing number of fluent English speakers,” said a freelance English interpreter who served former President Lee Myung-bak and prime ministers under Roh and wishes to remain anonymous. “Most chiefs of today’s corporations and institutions freely speak English, or they just pick someone from their own pool of capable employees and let them do the job unless the topic is critical and requires a professional.” The dynamics surrounding the job, traditionally considered the domain of humans, are also rapidly evolving in line with technological innovation. Some 10 years ago, many Web users enjoyed poking fun at the primitive translations of the Babel Fish service, then run by first-generation search engine AltaVista and now by Yahoo. For an input of “I am Sam,” a Korean translation would pop up, saying “I am a surface-to-air missile,” while the Korean word “woneomin” (“native”) used to be rendered as “circle fisherman” (from “won” and “eomin”). From Google to Skype to Flitto, however, the once primitive Web-based translation services are now growing smarter, with some now being available even without Internet access, and other gathering wisdom from social media in real time. Seoul’s Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, for its part, joined forces with the state-run Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute to roll out an automatic interpretation mobile application named GenieTalk two years ago. Its latest edition unveiled late last year recognizes more than 100,000 words, functions without Internet access and has made Bluetooth communication available. Yet many industry experts and insiders remain skeptical of the machines’ ability to fully replace career translators, especially given the Korean language’s abstract, subtle, and complex characteristics, though they acknowledge their assistance in boosting accuracy and speed. “Despite the rapid technological development, in terms of advanced translations and interpretations, machines have yet to overcome their limits due to the ambiguity and duplicity that come with nuanced human speech,” said Kwak Joong-Chol, a professor of interpreting at Hankook University of Foreign Studies. Cho Sei-young, a former career diplomat and Japanese interpreter for former Presidents Kim Dae-jung and Kim Young-sam and currently an international relations professor at Dongseo University in Busan, echoed Kwak’s view. “Practical documents such as manuals may be doable with automatic translators. But no cutting-edge computers can be a substitute for creative work like poetry, novels or project planning. A sophisticated task such as summit interpretations will hardly be fulfilled by machines,” he said.

They speak about pressing brainteasers with the top actors on the world stage. They have access to the heavily fortified Cheong Wa Dae and its inner workings, as well as those of other presidential offices around the globe. Despite their seemingly coveted call of duty, almost the only time they make the headlines is when they blunder. At times, they are bewildered by the convoluted, highfalutin language of the politicians sitting next to their client even before composing their nerves in an environment that requires intense concentration. They are the president’s interpreters.Lee Sung-hwan (center), an assistant presidential secretary for foreign affairs and President Park Geun-hye`s execlusive English interpreter, sits between Park and Chilean President Michelle Bachelet during a U.N. session in New York on Sept. 27. (Yonhap)While well-trained specialists provide professional services, many of them are career diplomats who boast language skills and knowledge about sensitive diplomatic issues. Whatever their background, they are considered some of the best in the field of interpretation.“If you are preparing for a meeting, you want to fully understand what will be discussed and thoroughly check on the English translation of related technical terms. Once the session kicks off, you just focus on interpreting every word said by both sides without missing one,” says Seoul’s Ambassador to the Netherlands Choe Jong-hyun, who was an English interpreter for former Presidents Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung from 1996 to 2000. Bae Sun-kyung, who served as a Russian interpreter for President Park Geun-hye and her predecessors Lee Myung-bak and Roh Moo-hyun, also stressed the significance of delivering accuracy and context, for which additional explanations are indispensable at times. “Precise representation is far more essential at summits than dinner and other relatively casual settings, especially if the president needs to convey a strong, clear message. I take caution not to be inclined to personal feelings and exercise self-control,” says Bae, who is now a second secretary at the South Korean Embassy in Belarus. “But I often find it necessary to elucidate contextual meanings. You may think of it as sort of an interference that could damage the accuracy, but it is not. You would never know when you end up interpreting for someone who has little to no idea about the six-party talks, Cheonan corvette sinking, or the Sewol ferry tragedy.” Her point was echoed by a professional English interpreter who served Lee and, before that, prime ministers. “As I usually represent my client only, I was trying to read his or her intentions and goal and fit the mood,” she said, asking anonymity due to the sensitivity of her work. The intensity of the atmosphere and the high-stakes agenda are so stressful in themselves that it can cause severe anxiety coupled with health problems in the lead up to the events, the presidential interpreters say. In Bae’s case, it is indigestion, menstrual irregularity, insomnia and acne, among others. Yet the experience offers a crucial chance to delve into various diplomatic issues and thus improve their vocational capability, while seeing into the minds of their own president and other world leaders on major flashpoints, they note. “After the meeting ended, sometimes my head went blank and I just could not remember anything that was discussed in the past two hours,” said Chung Eui-hae, director for ASEAN cooperation at the Foreign Ministry who interpreted from Korean to English for Roh. “It involves a great deal of tension and stress, yes, but the moments of complete immersion make for a stunning experience.” Adding to the already high-pressure backdrop is the nearly flawless command of foreign languages possessed by some commanders in chief.Kim Dae-jung was known to have taught himself English and Japanese. Kim Young-sam is also a fluent Japanese speaker. The incumbent Park, who has shown her English and other language skills through speeches and other occasions, drew media attention after fixing her interpreter’s use of the term “party congress” to “party convention” during a meeting with German Ambassador Rolf Mafael here in early 2013. Cho Sei-young, a former director general for Northeast Asia affairs at the ministry and Japanese interpreter for the two Kims, says their own proficiency magnified the intensity of his service. In one episode, as he rode in a car after a summit in 1998 in Tokyo with then-Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, Kim Dae-jung praised his work and even advised him to “enrich” his vocabulary such as by reading Japanese novels as the deceased president did himself while in prison. “They knew whether my interpretation was correct or not, so pressure was several times higher for Japanese interpreters,” says Cho, who now teaches international relations at Dongseo University in Busan.As professional interpreters have taken over a large part of their task, however, the burden on younger diplomats ― and their overall language ability and self-improvement efforts ― have sharply declined in recent years, he says. Bae also expressed hope that the Foreign Ministry would create a division to boost interpretation functions and nurture resources in the long term through training and education. “With the president or premier being the top diplomat of a country, repeatedly listening to their remarks at arm’s length allows you to look into his views on real diplomatic issues, and could create enormous synergy when you prepare the materials for the next summit or handle the issues yourself,” Cho adds. “Back then I was only a secretary-level servant but I took great pride in having an understanding of major diplomatic issues that is no less than that of senior diplomats.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","society elite they fly hundreds ,elite they fly hundreds ,highfalutin language of the politicians ,elite they fly hundreds of ,every year on charter planes","['Lee Sung - hwan', 'Park Geun - hye`s', 'Park', 'Chilean', 'Michelle Bachelet', 'U.N.', 'New York', 'Seoul', 'Netherlands', 'Jong - hyun', 'Kim Young - sam', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'russian', 'Park Geun', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Bae', 'the south Korean Embassy', 'Belarus', 'Cheonan', 'Lee', 'Chung Eui - hae', 'ASEAN', 'the Foreign Ministry', 'Korean', 'Roh', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'Japanese', 'Kim Young - sam', 'japanese', 'german', 'Rolf Mafael', 'Cho Sei - young', 'japanese', 'Tokyo', 'Keizo Obuchi', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'japanese', 'japanese', 'Cho', 'Dongseo University', 'Busan', 'the Foreign Ministry', 'Cho', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63618505  0.67801428

The interpretation profession is another such field, if not one of the most notable ones.At local graduate schools specializing in interpretation and translation, female students have far outnumbered male ones for a long time, which has contributed to the female dominance in the field. For example, women account for some 80 percent of students at the Graduate School of Interpretation and Translation at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, the country’s first institution established in 1979 to produce interpreters, a school official told The Korea Herald. “When the first graduate school for interpretation opened some 30 decades ago, even then there were much more female applicants than male ones,” said Byun Joo-kyung who has worked as a freelance interpreter for some 13 years.“Some 20 years ago, Ewha Womans University opened a graduate course for interpretation, solely for female students, which might have contributed (to women’s dominance in the field).”Other cultural and economic factors add to the effect, as the Korean tradition encourages men to play a “leading” role rather than an ancillary one in whichever line of profession they are in.“As an interpreter, you are in a position to provide service to your client and barred from voicing your opinions. Given the country’s cultural aspects, men seem to prefer to lead whatever project they engage in, rather than being a part of it,” said an industry source who declined to be identified.Insiders also point out that the characteristics of the work that requires linguistic adeptness and sensitive protocol have made the job an ideal profession for women.“Clients also tend to prefer female interpreters for various reasons,” another source said.The type of work available for interpreters, which leans heavily toward freelance and contract-based stints, also play a part. Except for the small number of the so-called in-house interpreters who are hired on a permanent basis, most interpreters are freelancers. This makes interpreters’ employment highly sensitive to market conditions. Earlier this year, as an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome hit South Korea, many international forums that would require interpretation services were canceled or delayed. “When the MERS struck the nation, a series of conferences for which I was to provide interpretation were all canceled or put off,” a freelance interpreter said, wishing to remain anonymous. “When the North conducts provocations such as a nuclear test, conferences are also likely to be canceled or delayed.”Undeterred by cultural and societal challenges and market constraints, many male aspirants remain hopeful that they can develop a unique competitiveness by accumulating knowledge in areas of specific interest.“Yes, there may be challenges facing male interpreters. But we need to think outside the box and look at the benefits of the interpretation work that may offset those challenges,” said Lee Sang-ju, a 27-year-old student at the HUFS.“As male interpreters are apparently rare here, there may be niches in the market that they can create. As long as you have the will and motivation to become a full-fledged interpreter, you can find a way to secure your competitive edge.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","interpretation and translation female students ,female students have far outnumbered ,womans university opened graduate course ,south korea many international forums ,translation female students have far","['korean', 'the Graduate School of Interpretation and Translation at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies', 'the Korea Herald', 'Byun Joo - kyung', 'Ewha Womans University', 'korean', 'South Korea', 'Lee Sang - ju', 'HUFS.“As', 'Song Sang - ho']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55547249  0.25131086

Tasked with books as thick as a dictionary, his trick to quick translation is to run the document through the Internet translation first before tackling the job himself.“Internet translation service saves time and efforts. Although the quality is not as good as that of translation by humans, it would have consumed twice as much time to translate the whole document without the Internet. The technology has come a long way,” said Kim.Once thought as a fixture of Sci-fi movie, humankind’s long-held ambition of communicating across language barriers went one-step closer to reality as a series of technology breakthroughs provide the tool that enables them to topple the babel tower -- a biblical reference to language barriers.One among them is Google Translate. Touted as the most widely used translation service, it covers 90 languages and boasts 500 million users on a monthly basis. Recently, Google rolled out an upgraded version that features translation of real-time conversation and images such as street signs and restaurant menus.Participants attend an event promoting Seoul government’s interpretation app GenieTalk. Ministry of Science, ICT and Future PlanningSkype Translator, Microsoft’s recently-unveiled rival to Google Translate, made the headlines with its simultaneous translation service. In the promotion video, an English-speaking student communicates almost flawlessly and simultaneously with a Spanish-native on the other side.“These technologies were not as fancy as they are now,” said translator Kim. “In the early days, the Internet translation service couldn’t even translate ‘annyeonghaseyo,’ ‘hello’ in Korean, into proper English,” Kim said, referring to the now-defunct prototype translation service Babel Fish. What brought the breakthrough is the technology called “machine learning,” a computer program that can learn by itself with enough exposure to spoken language. What has changed from previous generations is that the translation quality improves through use, trial and errors.For example, a translation machine could fail to properly translate “annyeonghaseyo,” into “hello” on the first try. But if the users spot it and fix the error, and get the result incorporated into the machine, it eventually spits out the correct version of translation. The groundbreaking technology, however, is not enough to translate a complicated sentence full of cultural and historic contexts into the one that sounds natural to native speakers. On the flip side, the factors that prevent natural translation pose an opportunity to Internet companies who amass stockpiles of data of their native language. Combined with the-more-the-better “machine learning” technology, vast databases contribute to a more natural-sounding translation. “Since we have more Korean-based data than any other search engines and excellent voice-processing technology that can even make out the difference between Korean homonyms, I think we excel at translation from Korean to English,” said an official from Naver, Korea’s biggest search engine. Other companies found their way to the solution with social-networking and collective knowledge, a new approach to make up for machine translation’s lack of accuracy in translating documents that require specific knowledge or cultural understanding.Flitto, a crowdsourcing translation developer, provides users with a forum where they can make a translation request to ideal “human” translators who are classified into different grades that reflect their performance standard such as speed and accuracy among others.“We are leveraging the talent of average citizens who have excellent language skills. Writing a business letter in foreign language will be a good example as it is a skill that needs good language skill, but not a skill as good as that of professional translators,” said Simon Lee, CEO of Flitto.Experts in translation industry remain skeptical about the prospect that machines will replace career translators who have extensive experience and special expertise in various fields. They claim that the underlying intent would be lost in translation, regardless of how advanced the technology is. “Our communication is usually ambiguous and inaccurate. So it is extremely difficult for machines to completely capture connotation behind the expressed language. How could the machines possibly translate simile-ridden literatures?” Kwak Joong-Chol, professor of interpreting at Hankook University of Foreign Studies. Other experts, such as Suk Jeong-hoon who has worked as professional translator for about 10 years, downplayed the significance of machines’ translation as the technology is all about “prompt” translation, not “accurate” translation, especially of Korean, a language that he considers the most hard-to-translate in the world. “What is impressive about the translation machines is their speed. But what really matters is what is being translated, not how fast the process is. The machines can only translate basic conversation by those who command perfect grammar, which I think is far from real-life conversation,” said Suk. “The nature of Korean makes matters worse. Not only is it unique in terms of linguistic structure, but it also has little demand for the language’s translation. Few businesses have ventured into developing translation systems involving Korean as it is apparently not the most sought-after language (in the global translation market),” Suk said.

But the total number of crime cases in the country dropped by 5.6 percent, from 1,814,386 to 1,712.435. As of last year, the elderly accounted for 8.8 percent of all criminals. In 2010, they made up 6.1 percent of all criminals in the country.The increase in the rate of elderly criminals surpassed that of the increase in the elderly population from 2010 to 2014. While the number of crimes committed by senior citizens rose by 35 percent, the elderly population increased by 25.4 percent in the same period. More than 80 percent of the Korean elderly are known to spend their leisure time solely by watching TV, while 1.02 million out of 5.42 million senior citizens are reported to be living alone as of this year. (Yonhap)Among the elderly criminals, those who committed violent crimes -- murder, rape, robbery, arson and aggravated assault -- surged dramatically by 61 percent, from 1,129 in 2010 to 1,869 last year. Among the elderly who committed violent crimes, in particular, elderly rapists increased by 75 percent from 2010-2014. A total of 1,699 elderly Koreans were arrested on rape charges last year, accounting for about 89.3 percent of all violent crimes committed by senior citizens.Also, the number of theft cases committed by the elderly surged by 37.9 percent in the same period, while all theft cases in the country dropped by 16.2 percent. Last year, some 2,280 senior citizens were reported for stealing goods. Some of the high profile crimes committed by the elderly in recent years include the 2008 Namdaemun Gate fire, in which an arsonist in his 60s set fire to Seoul’s historic Namdaemun gate -- leading to the 550-year-old property’s complete destruction and eventual restoration. Last year, a man in his 60s was arrested for sexually harassing four elementary school girls by taking photographs of their body parts in Yeongam, South Jeolla Province. In August, a man in his 70s was arrested on rape charges against his step-granddaughter. He reportedly sexually abused the victim about 10 years before, when he was in his 60s and the woman was a teenager.Rising elderly poverty rates and social isolation are being blamed for surging crime rates among the elderly here. According to the government-funded Korea Labor Institute, 48.6 percent of Koreans over 65 lived below the poverty line as of 2011, the highest rate among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. More than 80 percent of the Korean elderly are known to spend their leisure time solely by watching TV, while 1.02 million out of 5.42 million senior citizens are reported to be living alone as of this year. Meanwhile, the number of Korean elderly women who have been infected with sexually transmitted diseases increased from 662 in 2010 to 1,447 in 2014. The police earlier this year arrested a total of 33 mid-aged and elderly women, known as “Bacchus ladies,” for illegally selling sex to elderly men spending time at Seoul’s historic Jongmyo Park. Most of the women were 50 or over, while one of them was 81 years old. “Many things have to be done, but I think education is the key,” said professor Lee Geum-ryong from Sangmyung University. “More senior citizens should be informed about how to stay healthy and safe, how to manage their finances, how to participate in the society and stay connected to the community. Such programs are already available, but there definitely should be more.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","699 elderly koreans were arrested ,teenager rising elderly poverty rates ,rate of elderly criminals surpassed ,total of 699 elderly koreans ,diseases increased from 662 in","['South Korea', 'Koreans', 'korean', 'yonhap)among', 'Koreans', 'Seoul', 'Yeongam', 'South Jeolla Province', 'Korea Labor Institute', 'Koreans', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'korean', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'Jongmyo Park', 'Lee Geum - ryong', 'Sangmyung University', 'Claire Lee']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39224052  0.31965941

According to the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, families of 208 out of 304 killed or missing have agreed to accept the government’s offer of financial compensation, which is expected to reach up to 470 million won ($399,000) per victim.The families of nine who remain unaccounted for have also requested the compensation, after the ministry vowed to prepare measures to prevent the bodies from being lost in the salvage process. They said they will decide whether or not to receive the money after the ship is salvaged. Of the 157 survivors, 140 applied to be compensated. Settlement for the survivors varies depending on their respective jobs, age and degree of injury, but each one will receive a minimum of 10 million won.Bereaved families and survivors who did not apply for the compensation had filed a lawsuit against the government and Cheonghaejin Marine Co., the ship’s operator, saying that the government compensation was not sufficient. They refused to receive money for their losses, as a settlement would deprive them of the right to sue those responsible for the incident. The ministries of justice, maritime and security will jointly deal with the case.The Maritimes Ministry also received claims related to cargo loss, pollution and damage to the adjacent fishing ground, which came to 325, 62 and 562 cases each. To date, 47.2 billion won has been paid in compensation, 37.8 billion of which was handed to victims and survivors.A 14-member committee, including government and judiciary officials, will hold meetings twice a month to deliberate on the settlement. The ministry plans to deliberate all cases and pay the compensation by the end of the year.The sinking of the 6,825-ton vessel is considered one of the worst maritime disasters in Korea. Most of its victims were high school students en route to a field trip on Jejudo Island.Nationwide outcry broke out after it was learned that most crew members, including captain Lee Joon-seok, had abandoned the ship before passengers were led to safety. Lee was handed a life imprisonment sentence by an appellate court this April, and sentences for rest of the 15 crew members varied from 1 1/2 years in prison to 12 years.Lee appealed the ruling and the case is currently pending decision at the Supreme Court.The incident also unveiled a network of corruption between government and civil officials, and sparked criticism over the government’s failure to conduct effective rescue operations, which led to President Park Geun-hye disbanding the Korea Coast Guard.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","10 million won bereaved families ,million won bereaved families ,salvaged of the 157 survivors ,won 399 000 per victim ,million won bereaved families and","['the Ministry of Oceans', 'Cheonghaejin Marine Co.', 'the Maritimes Ministry', 'Korea', 'Lee Joon - seok', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'the Supreme Court', 'Park Geun', 'the Korea Coast Guard']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35074776  0.19145603

The Cabinet approved the revision that will be handed over to the National Assembly for final approval.Up until now, it was difficult to crackdown on unfair cases during pregnancy and upon childbirth unless the employee filed a report.With the change, the ministry will be able to investigate the case when an employee changes the employment status for “involuntary” reasons during one’s pregnancy or post-childbirth.The ministry will also be able to look into cases where an employee fails to apply for paid parental leave even when the due date has well passed.The employment insurance currently gives up to 1.35 million won ($1,140) monthly for one to three months for a worker on baby break.Last year’s health insurance statistics showed that while 105,633 employees gave birth, only 88,266 were counted as those on parental leave based on the employment insurance tally. This means about 17,000 workers failed to receive due paid leave or were forced to leave the company.Based on the Labor Standards Act, an employer can face up to five years of imprisonment or fine of up to 30 million won for dismissing an employee during one’s pregnancy or soon after childbirth. Those that refuse to give paid child care leave are subject to up to two years in prison or penalty of up to 10 million won.From news reports","childbirth the ministry will also ,fortify its crackdown on businesses ,labor ministry said wednesday that ,unfair treatment to pregnant workers ,crackdown on businesses giving unfair","['the Employment and Labor Ministry', 'the Welfare Ministry', 'the Labor Ministry', 'the Health and Welfare Ministry', 'Cabinet', 'the National Assembly']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5791775   0.1077852

Her father had just passed away after being hospitalized for seven years. “The medical bills were just enormous,” the 40-year-old said. “My siblings were too young, and my father had divorced my mother. I was the de-facto breadwinner of the family.”Jang was one of some 1,000 South Korean sex workers who gathered in central Seoul on Wednesday asking for the abolishment of the controversial anti-prostitution law, which has criminalized the buying and selling of sex since 2004.“We are telling the government that we are willing to and want to pay our income tax,” she told The Korea Herald. “And we are asking the government to regulate the industry and protect us with that tax money we are willing to pay. Right now we can’t pay taxes (because sex trade is illegal) and are not eligible to receive a lot of welfare benefits and protection because of this.”Amnesty International’s recent endorsement of a global effort to decriminalize all forms of consensual sex work that “does not involve coercion, exploitation or abuse” has been stirring controversy in Korea, where both purchasers and sellers of sex can face criminal charges.  South Korean sex workers participate Wednesday in a rally in central Seoul in protest of the antiprostitution law that has criminalized the sex trade since 2004. YonhapThe human rights group argued decriminalization was the best way to defend sex workers’ rights, as it will encourage governments to introduce specific laws and policies that regulate sex work more effectively. The effectiveness of the Korean anti-prostitution law has been seriously questioned in recent years. In spite of the law, the number of female sex workers in Korea in fact increased by 3.8 percent from 2010-2013, from 4,917 to 5,103, according to data from the Gender Ministry. According to Rep. Nam In-soon of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, the number of illegal sex trade businesses that operate in unconventional places, such as residential buildings and Internet cafes, increased dramatically from 2010 to 2014, from 2,068 to 6,669.Jang said the government’s current program to support sex workers failed to meet their practical needs. The former sex worker, who worked in brothels for about a decade, said many prostitutes continue to stay in the illegal business because they can’t make a living otherwise. A number of her colleagues have been seriously abused by their customers since 2004, the year the anti-prostitution law was enacted, but could not report the abuse to the police as they are afraid of being criminally charged. She said she and her colleagues do not want the government to decriminalize sex trade completely, without any regulations. She wants brothels to be licensed by the government and for the authorities to monitor the industry. “Many of us are in our 30s and 40s without formal education, and we have families to support. A lot of us are the breadwinners of our families,” she said. “The government currently gives 400,000 won ($335) a month to those who quit sex work and are looking for another job. How do you make a living and support your family with 400,000 won a month? Many say we are lazy for not trying to find another job. But most people have no idea what it is like for women without an education to find a job that pays enough to support herself and her family.”According to Hanteo National Union, a representative body of Korean sex workers, 80 percent of them did not attend or finish high school. A government study last year that surveyed 15 sex workers also showed that 86.6 percent of them grew up in broken homes, while 60 percent of them became involved in prostitution as teenagers after running away from home.In Korea, prostitution is closely associated with domestic abuse against children and teens. According to a joint study by the Seoul Metropolitan Government and Ewha Womans University which surveyed 219 runaway teens this year, 18.3 percent of them -- and 31.6 percent of those aged 14-16 -- said they had been involved in the sex trade at least once in their lives. The highest number of them, 66.7 percent, said they did it because they needed money, while 46.2 percent said they didn’t have any place to stay, and 28.2 percent said it was because they needed food. It is estimated that the biggest reason why Korean teens run away from home is because of family conflicts and domestic violence.“It’s a vicious circle,” said Byun Hyun-ju from Women’s Human Rights Commission of Korea. “Domestic abuse leads to prostitution, and prostitution leads to other forms of abuse against women.”In spite of the continued demand from sex workers, the Korean government stands firm on its stance that the commercial sex trade cannot be legal. Gender Equality Minister Kim Hee-jung said in that sex was “something that cannot be sold and bought.”Sarah Benson, the chief executive officer for a Dublin-based NGO supporting women affected by prostitution, said while no individual should be punished for selling sex, evidence shows that decriminalization of prostitution does not help the sex trade and or sex trafficking victims. According to Benson, Germany and the Netherlands did not see a decline in human trafficking and violence directed at prostitutes in spite of decriminalizing sex work early in the last decade.  “Even when you offer the opportunity to legitimize the business of prostitution, those who organize it (will) attempt to and continue to operate criminally,” she said in a press meeting at the International Symposium on the Prevention of Sex Trafficking held in Seoul on Wednesday. “And most importantly, the conditions for persons in prostitution do not improve, human trafficking increases because of the size of the sex trade increases. The ability of the police to target and challenge traffickers is compromised because when you make something a legitimate business then the opportunity to go on and investigate becomes more difficult.”Benson said the sex trade is a very clear example of a hierarchy of power, and therefore purchasers of sex and traffickers should not be decriminalized. “Nobody is ever forced to buy sex,” she said. “The person in prostitution in the vast majority of cases is somebody who is either coerced or (does so) for a variety of other reasons which are still based on vulnerability and lack of other options.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","korean sex workers participate wednesday ,prostitution as teenagers after running ,000 south korean sex workers ,criminalized the sex trade since ,father had divorced my mother","['Jang Se - hee', 'south korean', 'Seoul', 'the Korea Herald', 'International ’s', 'Korea', 'south korean', 'Seoul', 'YonhapThe', 'korean', 'Korea', 'the Gender Ministry', 'Nam', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Hanteo National Union', 'korean', 'Korea', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Ewha Womans University', 'korean', 'Byun Hyun - ju', 'Women ’s Human Rights Commission', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Kim Hee - jung', 'Benson', 'Dublin', 'Benson', 'Germany', 'Netherlands', 'Seoul', 'Claire Lee']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.74530476  0.2571317

The move came a week after over 15,000 educators across the country had protested what they claimed was a policy that “downplays democracy and creative education.”Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea has been pushing to give the government the exclusive rights to publish school history textbooks. Currently, eight local publishers author the textbooks, which are certified by the ministry before they hit the market.“The current textbooks are based on the universal historical viewpoint of academic circles and follow ministry guidelines. An attempt to reinstate state history books is an attempt to impose the historical interpretation of those in power (on students),” 132 Yonsei professors said in their statement.“Forcing a monolithic view of history upon students infringes upon the impartiality and autonomy of education stipulated in the Constitution,” they said.The joint statement follows a protest against the state textbooks by 160 professors from Korea University last Wednesday, another prestigious Seoul-based higher education institute. Late last month, 34 professors of history-related departments at Seoul National University also decried the ministry’s move.The efforts to reinstate history textbooks for secondary education was put on overdrive last year, after privately authored textbooks had been accused of being inaccurate and ideologically biased. Hwang, upon taking office in August last year, has repeatedly stressed that students should be taught with “a single version of history.”But such attempts have prompted fierce opposition, particularly from liberal educators. The left-leaning Korea Teachers and Education Workers Union last week announced that 15,701 teachers had signed a petition against the government pushing ahead with the contentious policy.Proponents of the policy say teaching one version of history can contribute to reducing ideological standoffs among people. The Parents’ Association for Reviving Public Education claimed that many of the eight historical textbooks in the market were biased in favor of liberals, and accused the university professors who opposed state textbooks of also having bias and being “unqualified as educators.”The standoff over history textbooks was noticeable during the ongoing parliamentary audit of government organizations. Members of opposition parties pointed out that state history textbooks were used to whitewash the dictatorial rule of former President Park Chung-hee in the 1970s, raising concerns that the books are likely to cater to demands of those in power. But the ruling Saenuri party said that state textbooks would actually help history lessons remain politically neutral. The government is expected to reach a decision on publishing a system of middle and high school history textbooks next month. By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","school history textbooks next month ,protest against the state textbooks ,history textbooks currently eight local ,school history textbooks currently eight ,reinstate history textbooks for secondary","['Yonsei University', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'Yonsei', 'Korea University', 'Seoul', 'Seoul National University', 'Hwang', 'Korea Teachers and Education Workers Union', 'the Parents ’ Association for Reviving Public Education', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Saenuri']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60799932  0.4400726

The study, led by public health professor Kim Ho at Seoul National University, was conducted based on weather and death toll data between 1979 and 2010. It was published in the latest issue of Science of the Total Environment. Considering the average temperature range of 10 degrees Celsius during the transition between seasons, the study suggested that the overall death risk could jump by 5.8 percent. The average daily temperature range of the overall year is 5 degrees Celsius, the researchers said. Such large temperature gaps can particularly impose health dangers on those with respiratory problems and circulatory system diseases. The death risk of those patients surged by 9.7 percent and 8.1 percent, respectively, when temperature ranges reached 10 degrees Celsius. The city of Incheon recorded the highest death risk of 2.84 percent per 1 degree Celsius difference for people with respiratory diseases, followed by Tangshan and Tianjin in China, with 2.25 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively.The study also showed that the health impact was more serious for people aged 65 or older. “The larger the daily temperature difference is, the more it affects the heartbeat, blood pressure, immune system and respiratory organs, indicating that the drastic temperature change can affect the internal immune mechanism,” Kim said. In order to reduce health risks, keeping the immunity level up is essential, such as by keeping the body warm during outdoor activities and by controlling personal hygiene, experts said. Drinking enough water and taking vitamins is also helpful.

Since 1995, the North has held an event to mark National Foundation Day.  South and North Korea held joint celebratory events in 2002, 2003 and 2005.

Along with the new bill which took effect on Jan.1, the Health Ministry announced that it would support up to 70 percent of the cost of aid and medication for nicotine replacement therapy.However, the report released by Rep. Rhee Mok-hee of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy showed that the number of smokers who received the treatment dropped significantly from 39,718 in February to 18,334 in June. 123RFDue to the programs’ unpopularity, the ministry and the National Health Insurance Service has so far spent only about 8 percent of the 93.4 billion won budget allocated for the service this year, according to Rep. Lee. Some blame the complicated registration process to receive allowance for the medication and aid for nicotine replacement therapy -- such as nicotine gum and nicotine patches -- for the low use of the service. As the medication and aid are currently not covered by the national health insurance, those who wish to get support from the government are required to file a separate form online. The Health Ministry initially planned to have the aid and medication covered by the state insurance starting October, but the plan was delayed partly because of the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome which hit the country in late May. The government is to announce its revised plan regarding the insurance coverage later this week. It is estimated that the government collected some additional 1.2 trillion won worth of tax money by raising the cigarette prices in the first half of this year. However, its next year’s budget for antismoking programs, including nicotine replacement therapy, has been cut by 16 billion won -- from this year’s 147.5 billion won to 131.5 billion won. While the government has been insisting that the only reason it raised tobacco tax was because of the nation’s high smoking rate that poses a threat to the NHIS and the economy, the move has been criticized as a sly way to increase taxes particularly paid by the nation’s low-income population, whose smoking rate is higher than high-income earners.“Only about half of all medical clinics (nationwide) are participating in antismoking programs and offering treatment options,” Rep. Lee said. “If the government is really determined to curb smoking, it has to come up with better ways to make sure more smokers can benefit from nicotine treatments.”Meanwhile, the Health Ministry is establishing a think tank to research on the damage caused by tobacco next month. One of its main goals is to determine if local tobacco makers use additives, such as ammonia, sugar and cocoa beans, to make their products more addictive.Sugar, for example, is known to generate aldehydes when pyrolyzed. The combination of aldehyde and nicotine is known to be more addictive than nicotine by itself.The establishment of the think tank is one of the measures to support the NHIS’ high-profile, on-going suit against major tobacco firms -- including KT&G;, British American Tobacco and Philip Morris -- seeking damages of 53.7 billion won for payouts over tobacco-related diseases especially lung cancer.

He was detained Thursday in Seoul, eight days after he allegedly put her body in the trunk of a car and set it on fire.The police said the 48-year-old suspect kidnapped the victim to allure karaoke worker “A,” a man he was originally planning to kill for revenge. The personal information of “A” was withheld. Kim and “A” were involved in an assault case over a traffic lane violation issue in a mild car accident in May. While Kim was fined, “A” was acquitted, police said. Kim had visited the workplace of “A” seven times and asked him to pay back the fine but was rebuffed, so he decided to murder “A” by enticing him with a woman. Kim allegedly planned to ask the victim to contact “A” by posing as a job seeker, investigators said. The suspect then kidnapped the victim at a parking lot of a market but strangled her to death as she resisted, they added. Asked why he brutally damaged the victim’s body, Kim testified that he was outraged over the failed plan and that the victim had insulted him. Kim claimed that he felt sorry for the victim as he had not intended to kill her, police said.On Saturday, the suspect expressed his intention to kill “A” to the gathered media as he was being taken to the court for arrest warrant screening. Kim was also found with a note listing the names of 28 people with whom he thought he had conflicts. The two-page note found in his pocket included names of judges, doctors and police officers.The name of “A” was on the list, they said.During a probe, he muttered to himself, saying, “I need to kill all of them,” police said.The suspect was found to have 22 criminal convictions including assault. Investigators are probing whether Kim made further murder plans or committed other crime.

(Yonhap)Kim, who had 22 criminal convictions including one for assault, was arrested Thursday, eight days after he allegedly stabbed a 35-year-old woman, surnamed Joo, outside a discount store before abandoning the body in the trunk of her car. The murder suspect said during the probe that he wrote down the names upon being treated badly and being unhappy with them. He even mumbled to himself, “I should kill them all,” according to the police.That the notes contained mostly female names raised the possibility that the crime had been motivated against women, though the suspect claimed he killed the victim only to steal her car and mobile phone.The police, however, dismissed speculation that the list could have indicated potential targets for his crimes.“There was no one on the list victimized by Kim,” the police said. “We see the list as a meaningless scheme.” Kim is suspected of kidnapping Joo as she loaded groceries into her car in an underground parking lot in Asan, Chungcheong Province, on Sept. 9. He dragged the victim around the country in her car before killing her and setting the vehicle on fire to destroy the evidence of his crime. The unemployed man, who lived on government subsidies, was apprehended in a separate case in Seoul after he broke into a veterinary hospital and threatened a nurse with a knife, demanding a euthanasia drug used on pets. A veterinarian and another nurse allegedly locked themselves in the office and made a distress call to the police.  The police are said to be having difficulties in questioning him, as he has been emotionally unstable and refused to make statements.

Park Nam-choon of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy.As of June this year, out of 284,409 buildings, only 25 percent of them, or 7,982, had applied earthquake-resistant plans in the architecture.Under current laws, all constructions with three or more aboveground stories with a total ground area of 1,000 square meters or more must have aseismic designs applied.Aseismic designs could range from incorporating more steel reinforcement when erecting a building to increasing the structure’s density by reinforcing the beam-column joint or attaching carbon fiber sheets onto the columns to prevent an abrupt collapse of the building. By district, Jung-gu had the weakest reinforcement works with only 13 percent of the 8,277 buildings having earthquake-resistant designs.

The second foreign language is one of the optional tests in Suneung, in which students can choose out of nine subjects including Japanese, German, Chinese, Spanish, French, Russian and Chinese characters. A total of 90,752 students are taking the subject in this year’s Suneung, roughly 14 percent of 631,184 applicants for the test.Applicants for the Arabic exam in particular nearly tripled from 9,969 in the previous year, overtaking Vietnamese as the most popular second language. The number of students taking Arabic has increased by 175 times compared to 2005.Experts point out this trend is peculiar, given that the two languages are the least commonly taught at schools here.The government-commissioned mock exam for Suneung conducts all subjects for the entrance exam excluding Vietnamese and Arabic, because there are not enough teachers to set up exam questions, said Oh Jong-un, an official from Haneul Education. The unlikely popularity of these languages is because students are able to get higher grades for these subjects than for other subjects, he said.Suneung has a nine-level grading system based on each student’s relative scores. Due to the low popularity of Arabic and Vietnamese, the cutoff score for the top grades tends to be lower than other subjects.“Many students are taking their chance with Arabic because the cutoff raw score was much lower than Vietnamese in last year’s exam -- 23 to 48 -- which explains the sudden surge in its popularity,” said Oh. “Theoretically, a student who guesses all the answers in an Arabic test could get a level-five grade.”The second foreign language was first implemented in 2001, and is mostly taken by applicants of humanities majors. But it is generally considered a minor subject by students as most top universities -- except Seoul National University -- allow students to substitute the subject with social studies, and a decreasing number of universities require students take it at all.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","vietnamese in last year exam ,private education firm said tuesday ,half of all students taking ,students taking arabic has increased ,most top universities except seoul","['Haneul Education', 'arabic', 'Vietnamese', 'Suneung', 'japanese', 'german', 'chinese', 'french', 'russian', 'chinese', 'arabic', 'Vietnamese', 'Suneung', 'Vietnamese', 'Haneul Education', 'Suneung', 'Arabic', 'Vietnamese', 'vietnamese', 'arabic', 'Seoul National University']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.6208176   0.5699451

Some members of the Federation of Korean Trade Unions stage a rally opposing the compromise reached on labor reforms during a cetral executive committee meeting Monday in Seoul. YonhapThe compromise came after months-long negotiations, with the trilateral committee agreeing on the broad picture of the labor market reforms and the labor bloc backing down from its initial stance. But the panel left most of the major contentious decisions to the National Assembly, hinting that the reform plans still had a tough road ahead.Though the government, the ruling Saenuri Party and businesses hailed the agreement as a breakthrough, some radical unionists under the Federation of Korea Trade Unions opposed the plan, casting a shadow over the prospects of a smooth implementation. The FKTU held an executive meeting Monday to endorse the deal, which was strongly opposed by some of its members.Some 100 union members rallied in protest at the umbrella union’s “compromise” with the government, holding up placards that read “We can never approve the agreement that enslaves 20 million laborers.” The meeting was thrown into further disarray when Kim Man-je, head of its metal union, poured paint thinner onto his body and the floor at around 3:30 p.m. to express resistance. Another unionist near him reportedly stopped him from setting himself on fire with a fire extinguisher. As of 6 p.m., the union meeting resumed, but the officials were nowhere near reaching a conclusion, a source from the trade union said.The labor and business blocs had locked horns over the employers’ call for reduced protection of workers. According to the plan, the government will set up administrative guidelines designed to ease restrictions for employers to dismiss underperforming workers and change company rules without union approval.In an apparent attempt to contain the labor circle’s concerns, the committee stipulated in the draft plan that the government should sufficiently consult with the labor and business blocs when employing measures to reform the labor market.Until such guidelines are established, employers will refer to past court rulings to decide under what conditions employees can be dismissed and rules changed.The plan would lay the groundwork for employers to push to change the employment contracts or salary system without union approval, giving a boost to expanding the government-backed wage peak system in the private sector.The government pledged to offer financial and policy support to the companies adopting the system in the proposal, with the committee vowing efforts to use the money saved from the wage peak system to create jobs for the young. Under the wage peak system, companies pay senior employees reduced salaries after the workers reach a certain age, generally between 55 and 60, in return for extending the retirement age. With the official retirement age set to rise by two years to 60 next year, the government has pushed for the revamp in the overall wage system. Regardless of the FKTU’s approval, the government and the ruling Saenuri Party will likely forge ahead with attempts at market reforms. They held a consultative meeting to map out plans for legislation earlier in the day.Lee Jang-woo, the spokesman for the ruling party, called the agreement “belated but extremely fortuitous.” Lee urged “active” participation from the opposition party. The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, however, expressed regret, saying that there is still a long road ahead for the agreement. The ruling party is set to submit the reform bill to the Assembly on Wednesday in a bid to pass it though the parliament within the upcoming regular session. Led by the tripartite commission head Kim Dae-hwan, the top negotiators from each side -- the FKTU head Kim, Korea Employer’s Federation head Park Byoung-won and the Labor Minister Lee Ki-kwon -- have tried to draw a compromise on the reform plan since the labor union returned to the three-way dialogue in late August. The negotiations faced a number of hurdles, with the trade union fiercely opposing the government’s plan to ease restrictions on dismissing underperforming workers and give companies more discretion to change their rules without union approval.The talks among management, labor and government came in line with President Park Geun-hye’s campaign for labor market reforms, a top priority on her policy agendas in the second half of this year. The government has vowed to implement the reforms within this year, even without workers’ approval, to inject flexibility in what it has called “rigid” labor market.

147,147,Joining military increasingly competitive,"In the face of a long-running job crunch, young South Korean men are finding it increasingly difficult to join the military for the obligatory two-year service, with an acceptance rate hovering around a mere 13 percent this year, a lawmaker said Monday.

Between January and July, only 84,224 out of 630,427 applicants were enlisted in the Army, Navy, Air Force or Marine Corps, beating odds of 1 in about 7.5, said Rep. Chung Mi-kyung of the ruling Saenuri Party, based on data submitted by the Military Manpower Administration for an annual audit. Acceptance is skewed toward older candidates who must enlist by age 38.The rate is down 3.2 percentage points from 16.6 percent last year, when 134,393 out of 807,520 were accepted. By branch, the Air Force proved to be most competitive this year, with about 8.2 people chasing every post, followed by the Army with 7.9, the Marine Corps with 6.1 and the Navy at 5.9. The widening mismatch reflects the cutthroat competition in the job market, as well as a surge in military resources -- chiefly the offspring of baby boomers who were born between 1955 and 1963, the lawmaker said, citing the MMA’s analysis. There were some 336,000 servicemen candidates born in 1990, 349,000 in 1991, 364,000 in 1992, 374,000 in 1993, 378,000 in 1994 and 380,000 in 1995. Yet the military’s demand for draftees continues to decline, from 271,000 last year to 250,000, in line with the military’s ongoing reform plan.As a result, the Defense Ministry is adjusting the quota upward and tighten physical test standards. “Despite the measures, the competition will inevitably continue to increase given the extensive discrepancy between supply and demand and youth unemployment,” Chung said, calling for a comprehensive overhaul of the MMA’s conscription system. Yet the trend contrasts with the growing number of South Koreans who give up their nationality and thereby become exempt from the military service. In 2014, 4,386 men opted for foreign citizenship, up from 3,375 in 2013, according to Rep. Jin Sung-joon of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, also citing MMA statistics. Taking into account the 2,374 renunciations registered between January and July this year, the five-year tally tops 16,000. The seven-month total also includes 30 children of secretary- or higher-level public servants, Jin noted. The U.S. remains their most preferred second home, followed by Canada, Australia and New Zealand. In South Korea, all physically able young men are subject to compulsory military service for about two years, after which they are required to receive six rounds of three-day training over a period of eight years.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","job crunch young south korean ,crunch young south korean men ,336 000 servicemen candidates born ,long running job crunch ,south korean men are finding","['south korean', 'Army', 'Navy', 'Air Force', 'Marine Corps', 'Chung Mi - kyung', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Military Manpower Administration', 'the Air Force', 'Army', 'the Marine Corps', 'Navy', 'MMA', 'the Defense Ministry', 'Chung', 'MMA', 'South Koreans', 'Jin Sung - joon', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'MMA', 'Jin', 'U.S.', 'Canada', 'Australia', 'New Zealand', 'South Korea', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",11,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61500674  0.38669679

The woman, surnamed Kim, brought the baby girl to her center in July of last year, after the biological mother reportedly gave up custody of the child shortly after giving birth at a Busan-based hospital.Soon after the infant arrived at her center in Jinju, South Gyeongsang Province, Kim tried to sell the child for 650 million won ($550,000) to an individual surnamed Jeong whom she met online. Jeong, who posted a false online post saying she was desperately interested in adopting a child even if it meant going through an illegal broker, was in fact an undercover reporter for a TV program who was researching the situation of child trafficking.   About 90 percent of Korean adoptees are born to unwed mothers. (Yonhap)The writer eventually reported Kim to the police. The baby showed a number of signs of abuse when found by the authorities. She was suffering from a skin disease and weighed only 2.62 kilograms, much less than her birth weight of 3.37 kilograms.During the trial, Kim argued that she never actually sold the baby, as the writer was not interested in being a parent, and therefore she never committed a crime. The court, however, upheld her “guilty” verdict.South Korea remains one of the largest exporters of overseas adoptees in the world, having sent about 200,000 children abroad over the past six decades. About 90 percent of Korean adoptees are born to unwed mothers who have few resourses to raise their children alone and are vulnerable to social stigmatization. Many of them are forced to give up their children even to this day. By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","unwed single mother for illegal ,mother for illegal adoption online ,single mother for illegal adoption ,mother for illegal adoption ,born to unwed mothers yonhap","['the Supreme Court', 'Kim', 'Busan', 'Jinju', 'South Gyeongsang Province', 'Kim', 'Jeong', 'Jeong', 'korean', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'South Korea', 'korean', 'Claire Lee']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59420109  0.07237738

150,150,Changing faces,"Last year, Park Ji-eun, a 26-year-old in Seoul, had a nose job and double-eyelid surgery. It was her final year in university and she wanted to get it done before applying for jobs. “I didn’t have any dramatic reasons for doing it,” she said. “I don’t think I had been particularly unhappy with my looks. I just wanted to improve it, just like the way you would improve your CV.”Park, who now works at a big firm, ...","Last year, Park Ji-eun, a 26-year-old in Seoul, had a nose job and double-eyelid surgery. It was her final year in university and she wanted to get it done before applying for jobs. “I didn’t have any dramatic reasons for doing it,” she said. “I don’t think I had been particularly unhappy with my looks. I just wanted to improve it, just like the way you would improve your CV.”Park, who now works at a big firm, said she is satisfied with the results and her decision. Yet her experience post-surgery was not always pleasant. Once, Park was told that she was a “fake beauty.” Some belittled her by saying she wasn’t “naturally beautiful.”Park belongs to the 20 percent of all South Korean women who are reported to have undergone plastic surgery at least once in their lives. While Korea is often referred to as the world’s plastic surgery-capital ― it ranked fourth among the countries that performed the most cosmetic surgical procedures last year ― the country’s lookism today is linked to more complex social and economic situations, experts say.“There is a lot of evidence that the plastic surgery industry is unethically involved in the nation’s labor and job market,” said culture critic Lee Moon-won. “So many firms require applicants to include their photographs when submitting their resume, while plastic surgery clinics openly say ‘appearance can be your competitive edge in the job market’ in their public ads.”Often, the persistently high number of unemployed young Koreans ― standing at 410,000 as of the first half of this year ― attribute their bad luck to their looks. Korea’s peculiarly high tolerance of candid judgements about one’s appearance also adds to its obsession over looks.The nation’s popular culture depicts this tendency in many ways.“Let Me In,” a television program offering a complete makeover mainly through extensive plastic surgery, is one of those blamed for stoking lookism.Featured women in the program include a young job seeker who wishes to become a flight attendant but feels her appearance is preventing her from landing her dream job. Another is a North Korean defector who claims her “aggressive” facial features make her vulnerable to discrimination here.Another unemployed participant, a bullying and dating abuse survivor who had been wearing a facial mask every day to hide her protruding jaw, in fact bent her knees in front of the MCs and begged. “I want to live like a human being for once in my life,” she said in tears.“Most of the women featured are socially marginalized, with low incomes. Their problems, such as low self-confidence, don’t only stem from their appearance,” said Lee Yun-so from Womenlink, a women’s rights organization, who recently filed a public petition against the program.“It’s a vicious circle. It’s a disadvantage (in the job market) if you are not physically attractive, and when you are unemployed, you can’t ‘solve’ the situation because you can’t afford to pay for your surgery.”A “milder” version of such lookism was apparent in a recent episode of MBC’s “Real Men,” a variety show featuring celebrities experiencing life in the military,When Kim Hyun-sook, a female comedian, came out after dyeing her hair back to black to comply with military rules, other cast members had a field day, teasing her that she had become even less attractive.“Commenting on or making fun of someone’s looks is so normal in our society that no one thinks there is anything wrong with it even when it’s being done on national television,” Lee Yun-so said.While the emphasis on looks in the earlier days of Korea’s modernization was geared toward looking clean-cut and neat, the preference has evolved into more elaborate and glamorous features. Now the trend changes with a blink of an eye, from a bigger set of eyes and a higher nose to a smaller face shape. More men have also joined the craze, seeking to tweak their facial features and building their bodies, a phenomenon dubbed the “Adonis complex.”Some blame the obsession on Korea’s ruthless capitalism, with media and the establishment reinforcing lookism by commercializing sex and feeding off sensational interests to maximize their income.Rapid introduction of the Western culture since the Korean War (1950-53) also played a major role, as the Eastern notions of beauty were overtaken by the Western features that quickly became the standard for things that are beautiful, supreme and successful.Such excessive infatuation toward looks have subsequently fostered the country’s surgical skills.For the Korean government, its $5 billion plastic surgery industry attracts foreign visitors and their cash. Last year, 267,000 foreigners visited Korea to receive medical treatment in the country, spending 560 billion won ($468.8 million). Of the visitors, the second-largest number of them, 36,000, received cosmetic treatments or surgical procedures at plastic surgery clinics. Seoul’s Gangnam district, where 35.5 percent of all cosmetic surgery clinics are located, made 165.7 billion won from treating foreign visitors last year, accounting for 29.8 percent of the total spending by patients from overseas.For Park Ji-eun, being shamed for having undergone plastic surgery is what she finds the most ironic in today’s society.“I’m honest about it whenever somebody asks. I tell them I’ve undergone plastic surgery,” she said. “But I see irony in this whole situation. We don’t shame people who climb the social ladder by studying hard or working hard. We are often told that what matters is how much effort you put in to better yourself. “People who undergo plastic surgery pay their own money and endure physical pain to obtain what they weren’t given.

The remains were gathered by experts, religious people and students from the two countries in all parts of Hokkaido since 1997. It is the first time that more than a hundred sets of remains are delivered at once. On Thursday, 13 sets of remains found in Sakhalin, Russia, arrived at Incheon International Airport.The forced mobilization was carried out when the Korean Peninsula was a Japanese colony from 1910-45. Many Koreans were conscripted into the Japanese military or drafted to work in the military industrial sector, being deployed in Japan and other countries against their will.Many of them returned home after the 1945 liberation of Korea, following Japan's defeat in World War II, but others remained. Many are believed to have died during the war.It is unclear how many people were mobilized for forced labor and died. Some civic groups claim the number of conscripts goes up to a million or more.With the remains, the representatives are due to come back on Sept. 18. A funeral will follow on the next day at the Seoul Plaza.About a thousand people, including Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon, the bereaved families as well as civic groups will participate in the funeral, the group official said.""The last 18 years of efforts by civilians finally got results,"" said Chung Byung-ho, the head of Steppingstone for Peace.""We hope this could contribute to bringing a brighter future to east Asia.""

President Park Geun-hye waves to the crowd during her visit to a market in Daegu on Monday. YonhapAccording to local pollster Realmeter, Park’s job rating surged to 50.4 percent last week, recovering the 50 percent mark for first time in 10 months. The day she attended a massive military parade in Beijing on Thursday, her approval rating hit a new record this year at 54 percent, a 20 percentage point increase just in two weeks, according to Gallup Korea.With security her traditional forte, Park is widely expected to use her popularity to push ahead with her reform drive to revitalize the sluggish economy, despite objections from the opposition.Riding on her popularity in full swing, Park on Monday visited Daegu, the nation’s third-largest city, where she holds a strong support base, and vowed that she would keep this momentum and use it to carry out diplomatic and domestic tasks.“I believe that I should vigorously push forward for peace and the stability of the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia on the diplomatic front and also to achieve reform for economic revitalization and for the future of the nation on the domestic front (at the same time),” she said at a meeting with local officials in Daegu.Calling it a rare phenomenon for a president who already passed his or her midway point of a single five-year term to recover the 50 percent mark, experts, however, remained cautious on Park’s remaining two years in office.“I believe it is a passing phenomenon contributed mainly by the breakthrough in inter-Korean talks,” said Yoon Seong-yi, political professor at Kyung Hee University in Seoul.Citing her weakness of being uncommunicative and a unilateral leader, the professor said she still faces lingering challenges to revive the nation’s economy and achieve labor reforms and economic democratization aimed at making the market a fair ground for all.With her presidency passing the midway mark and attention fast shifting to general elections next year, Park also sounded desperate in pushing her reform drive, the centerpiece of her state agenda.“We have no time to waste or wait,” she said, urging representatives of labor and business who returned to the negotiation table to make concessions on labor reforms.“We must reach an agreement for coexistence, with strong determination that this year is the last chance for labor reforms.”Park has begun her third year in office on a sour note, as controversy loomed over a political scandal involving her close aides. The outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome further consolidated antagonists from last year’s Sewol ferry sinking tragedy, as the public condemned the government’s early response. Her leadership and her lack of communication with the public came under fire, further dragging her popularity down to a record low of 29 percent in June. But ironically it was North Korea’s mine blast in the demilitarized zone and the military tensions between the Koreas that shifted the spotlight back on Park’s leadership. Her hardline stance against North Korea’s provocation and her approach toward the reclusive regime’s volatility brought Seoul into an advantageous position in the breakthrough talks late last month.With North Korea expressing regret over the mine blast, and Seoul cementing closer ties with Pyongyang’s traditional ally and the biggest benefactor, Beijing, at the summit and military parade this month, conservatives here say that Park has brought a paradigm shift in Northeast Asian politics. Calling it the “Park Geun-hye doctrine,” right-leaning media and her supporters claimed that she has presented a vision to resolve North Korea’s nuclear ambition through the peaceful unification of two Koreas.

However, the proportion of ethnic Korean households with a single child is still 15.6 percent higher than the same figure for Chinese households, and 25.17 percent higher than the proportion of households of other ethnic minority groups with a single kid.Choi said many factors contribute to the statistics, including high expectations ethnic Koreans have for their children. “Many think it’s their duty to educate their children as much as they can,” Choi said at a recent academic forum in Seoul. “That’s why I think many ethnic Korean women in China decide to have one child and even have abortions, because having one child increases your chance of supporting the kid as much as possible.”Choi’s study also showed that a large number of the surveyed individuals were concerned about the declining population of ethnic Koreans in China, while not opting to have more than one child at the same time. While 71.7 percent of the surveyed Koreans said the population decline is a serious problem, 53.4 percent said the issue was heavily affecting the ethnic Korean community in China.When asked about the reasons they think are behind ethnic Koreans’ low fertility rate, 87 percent of them pointed to financial difficulties, while 50.2 percent of them said it was due to a lack of child care support. While 64.4 percent of married Koreans said they hoped their children would marry a fellow ethnic Korean, only 56.6 percent of the unmarried individuals who participated in the study said they were only willing to marry someone with Korean heritage.“Ethnic Koreans are now living everywhere across China, whereas many of them only stayed in Yanbian County in the past,” Choi said. “More Koreans are marrying non-Koreans as well.

The festival will run until Sept. 12.""This partial opening is greatly meaningful in that it can show the process of filling the country's largest cultural facility together,"" Bang Sun-gyu, the ACC's acting chief, was quoted as saying in a release.

The military keeps 24 green camps with the Army and another four with the Navy in a bid to help conscripts who show signs of suicide or complain maladjustment inside military barracks. Art therapy and other psychiatric treatment are provided in the weeks-long program before deciding whether to send the inmates back to barracks or to grant them early discharge. In 2012, a total of 417 inmates were granted an early discharge, while the numbers soared to 515 in 2013 and to 826 for 2014. For the first half of this year 462 conscripts were discharged in advance. The military said they plans to upgrade and extend the green camp program to better help with conscripts' rehabilitation.The data came as the military is struggling to deal with increasing maladjustment issues inside the barracks. Last week, a 23-year-old conscript was sentenced to the death penalty for killing five fellow soldiers in a shooting rampage in a military outpost near the border with North Korea. He had complained of being bullied by comrades although the military court did not accept his defense as the reason for the shooting.All the able-bodied South Korean men are required to serve about the two-year mandatory military service as the country technically remains at war with North Korea since the 1950-53 Korean War.

(Yonhap)President Park Geun-hye has renewed calls for a correct recognition of history to move ties forward in the region as she visited a symbolic building in China that served as a base against Japan's aggression.  Park attended a ceremony on Friday to reopen a historic building in Shanghai that was used by Korea's provisional government during part of Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula.  The ceremony ""showed that South Korea and China share the historic meaning and value of sites of our independence struggle,"" Park said in the ceremony.  She vowed to make efforts to keep those sites intact through close cooperation with China.  China has helped preserve the building and other historic sites related with Korea's independence movement against Japan, in a sign of deepening ties between South Korea and China.  Many Koreans moved to China to continue the anti-Japanese resistance movement during the colonial rule.  ""Our people remember well that Chinese people provided support"" to Korea's independence movement, Park said in an interview with the People's Daily, a state-run Chinese newspaper, published on Friday. ""We are thankful to our old friends.""   The provisional government was formed on April 13, 1919, as the Korean government-in-exile, a month after Korea launched an independence movement against Japan. The Korean Peninsula was later divided into the capitalist South and the communist North after its independence from Japan in 1945.  Shanghai is the second and last stop on Park's three-day trip to China. In Beijing, she met with her Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, and attended a military parade, the centerpiece of the 70th anniversary of China's victory over Japan in World War II.  Xi has highlighted that Koreans and Chinese fought against Japan's aggressions as he expressed his gratitude to Park for visiting China for the celebrations.  South Korea, China and Japan are key trade partners, but tensions still persist between South Korea and Japan and between China and Japan over territorial and other history-related issues.  Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony and controlled much of China in the early part of the 20th century.  ""The countries in the region need to make joint efforts to move toward a new future based on a correct recognition of history,"" Park told the People's Daily. ""On that premise, sufferings of past history can be healed and overcome.""  Last month, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Tokyo ""has repeatedly expressed the feelings of deep remorse and heartfelt apology for its actions during the war.""  Still, Abe did not offer his own clear apology for Japan's militaristic past in the statement issued on Aug. 14, on the eve of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.  Park and Xi have agreed to hold a trilateral summit with Japan in Seoul in either late October or early November.  A trilateral summit has not been held since May 2012 due to the tensions in the region. China was represented by its prime minister in a previous trilateral summit.  Park expressed hope that Seoul, Beijing and Tokyo can create a new order of trust, noting it is very important for the neighbors to boost mutual cooperation.  She also called for cooperation with China to ensure lasting peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia, where North Korea poses threats with its missile and nuclear programs.  China is believed to have significant leverage over North Korea, which has long been dependent on Chinese diplomatic support and economic aid.  Park said in a meeting with hundreds of people of the Korean community in Shanghai that China's cooperation is very critical in bringing out changes in North Korea and in achieving unification with North Korea.  She also reaffirmed her stance that South Korea will sternly retaliate against North Korea, if provoked, but it will make efforts to continue dialogue and cooperation with North Korea.  The two Koreas have recently produced a deal that eased the tensions and paved the way for reunions of families separated since the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in a cease-fire, not a peace treaty.

According to the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, over half of grooms’ parents spent more than 80 million won on average while 70 percent of brides’ parents spent less than 60 million won. About 10 percent of the couples said they spent over 200 million won on their wedding. The survey was conducted on 1,200 grooms and brides who married in the last three years and their parents between the ages 55 and 69. Wedding costs for the survey were said to include the ceremony as well as setting up the couple’s home.Due to the large sums of money needed for the wedding, many couples said they depended on their parents for support. Nearly half of the couples replied that over 60 percent of the wedding costs were shouldered by their parents.While more than half of the parents felt burdened by the wedding costs, about 70 percent of parents felt obligated to support their children. Nearly 85 percent also replied that it is better to give support if they could afford it.The majority of the children took their parents’ help for granted, with 64 percent saying that it is better to receive the support if parents are willing to do so. Only about 10 percent of the couples said they independently prepared for their wedding. Most, or 93 percent of the parents, said they felt uncomfortable discussing their financial difficulties with their spouses.About 85 percent of the parents also said that they did not receive any regular financial support from their children despite having provided assistance to them. Of those that did, the average monthly allowance was 220,000 won. Most parents, also 85 percent, did not expect any financial help from their children. Among those seeking the help, mothers of the grooms showed the highest expectation for support at 23.5 percent.

The poll asked 1,000 men in their 30s and 40s who live in Seoul and have a child aged eight or younger. As of 2013, South Koreans work an average of 2,163 hours, the third longest following Mexico and Costa Rica among OECD countries. But the young working fathers had a strong desire to build a better work-family balance, with 92.5 percent of the surveyed willing to curtail working hours to care for their children if possible.The survey also found that nearly half of the respondents had taken paternity leave for an average of 6.1 days to care for the wife and newborn. But the vast majority wanted to extend the leave, with 34.3 percent of them demanding at least seven days and 23.6 percent supporting a monthlong leave. Currently, male workers can take up to 5 days off work by law for paternity leave when their wives give birth. Child care leave is open to both men and women who have a child aged 8 or younger, entitling each of them to a paid leave for up to one year. Unlike the paternity leave, the child care leave remained more inaccessible for men, the survey showed. Only 15.3 percent of the surveyed said that they had taken the child care leave, with 60.8 percent of them having spent less than three months on the leave. To make it easier for working fathers to take the child care leave, the surveyed men said that the government should make it mandatory for all eligible men to take the leave rather than allowing them to choose. They also addressed the need to increase the pay for those taking the leave.As part of efforts to raise the chronically low birth rate and help women maintain their career, the government has implemented the policies to encourage shared childrearing between men and women.The government gives financial incentives to couples with a child aged 8 or younger when both of them take the child care leave. The parents can also work between 15 and 30 hours per week, with their wage covered by employers and government-funded insurance. Against this backdrop, the overall number of South Korean fathers taking the child care leave has dramatically risen in recent years. Still, the number only accounted for 5 percent of those who took the leave in the country in the first half of this year, raising questions over the effectiveness of the policies. The survey also found that women spend less time at work and more time for child care and household chores, highlighting the deeply-rooted Confucian values in Korean society considering men as breadwinners rather than caregivers. When both wife and husband have a career, husbands worked on average of 9 hours and 14 minutes per day, while spending 1 hour and 19 minutes on looking after a child, 47 minutes on doing housework and 1 hour and 7 minutes on pastime. On the other hand, women worked for 8 hours and 5 minutes per day on average, spent 2 hours and 11 minutes on taking care of a child and 1 hour and 33 minutes on domestic chores. They spent 1 hour and 4 minutes on pastime. “There are laws and institutions to encourage work-family balance in place, but they are not being properly implemented,” said Lee Sook-jin, head of Seoul Foundation of Woman & Family. “Based on the survey results, we will work on drawing up specific policies reflecting the reality facing working fathers.”By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","korean fathers taking the child ,workplace 10 percent and slashed ,monthlong leave currently male workers ,reasons for poor work family ,survey in seoul showed tuesday","['Seoul', 'Seoul Foundation of Woman & Family', 'Seoul', 'South Koreans', 'Mexico', 'Costa Rica', 'OECD', 'south korean', 'confucian', 'korean', 'Lee Sook - jin', 'Seoul Foundation of Woman & Family', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",11,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68942332  0.57132614

In South Korea, a new controversial bill is being introduced to prevent Korean parents from becoming modern-day King Lears, some of whom reportedly get abused or neglected by their adult children after handing down most of their wealth and possessions.The bill, which is being introduced by the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, gives Korean parents the right to sue their children in case of mistreatment and to return any gifts that were previously given to them. A total of 5,772 instances of elderly abuse took place in Korea last year, according to government data. (Yonhap)Under the current law, a donor may rescind a contract of gift if the recipient committed an act of crime against the donor, or if “the donee is under duty to support the donor but does not perform his duty.” However, the law also stipulates that rescission of a contract of gift does not have any effect once the gift has already been given to the donee. “The current Korean civil act contradicts itself,” said Choi Byoung-chun from the Institute for Democracy and Policies, a think tank for the NPAD. “While Article No. 556 says a donor can rescind a contract should there be a criminal offense against him or her, or the child does not perform his supporting duty, Article No. 558 -- which stipulates that rescission of a contract is invalid once the gift has already been handed over -- makes it impossible to retrieve any of the possessions regardless of the circumstances. Article No. 558 needs to go now.”The introduction of the bill, dubbed “Anti-bulhyo bill” -- “bulhyo” means mistreating one’s parents -- is seen as the NPAD’s calculative move to attract elderly voters for next year’s upcoming general election.The NPAD’s bill states that a parent has the right to sue their children in the event of any mistreatment, not only criminal activities, and have them to return gifts that were given to them in the past. The donee, once asked to return the gift, will have to give back the equivalent monetary value even if he or she has spent it all. While the move is laden with controversial aspects, such as the subjective view of filial duty and the legal intervention in parent-child relations, the government was also seen to be jumping on the bandwagon by reportedly pushing for its own version of law revision. According to the Welfare Ministry, a total of 5,772 instances of elderly abuse took place in Korea last year. Of the abusers, 51.1 percent were the victims’ adult children. The number of Korean parents suing their children for financial support more than doubled from 135 in 2004 to 262 last year. In some European countries, the laws guarantee the donor’s rights to reclaim their gifts should there be mistreatment by the donee. Germany’s Civil Code stipulates that “a donation may be revoked if the donee is guilty of ingratitude by serious wrongdoing to the donor or to a close relative of the donor.” The French Civil Code also says that an inter vivos gift may be revoked on account of ingratitude when the donee has made an attempt against the life of the donor, or he has been found guilty of cruelty, serious offenses or grievous insults against him, or when he refuses maintenance to him.“The current law allows ungrateful individuals to get away with their duties as scions after receiving gifts from their parents,” said Choi. “We’ve seen parents who gave their children almost all of their possessions, thinking the children would take care of and financially support them once receiving the gifts, only to find out they would not even speak to them on the phone.”However, some experts said the law revision won’t be able to tackle Korea’s high elderly poverty rate, which nearly reached 50 percent early this year. The revision can only benefit a small portion of the elderly population, said family law expert Choi In-hee from Korea Women’s Development Institute.“The number of elderly individuals who can actually afford to give gifts to their children is very small,” said Choi. “This means most elderly people can’t really benefit from this revision because they don’t have any gifts to give to begin with.”Choi said the government should share an individual or a family’s responsibility to take care and financially support the elderly member of the family. Under the current law, all adult Koreans are legally obligated to financially support their spouses, parents and parents-in-laws should they become unable to support themselves with their own financial resources of labor.The country’s destitute elderly individuals have been suffering from the particular laws, as the recipients of state welfare payments lose a portion or all of their allowance if any member of their immediate family -- a spouse, child or child-in-law -- has a regular monthly income, depending on how much they make.“This system is hard on both the parents and their children, especially if they are all low-income earners,” she said. “The point is to increase the government’s involvement in the caring and supporting of the elderly population.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","korean parents suing their children ,korean parents suing their ,of korean parents suing their ,number of korean parents suing ,korean parents suing","['Shakespeare', 'South Korea', 'korean', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'korean', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Choi Byoung - chun', 'the Institute for Democracy and Policies', 'NPAD ’s', 'NPAD ’s', 'the Welfare Ministry', 'Korea', 'korean', 'european', 'Germany', 'Choi', 'Korea', 'Choi', 'Korea Women ’s Development Institute', 'Choi', 'Koreans', 'Claire Lee']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34572798  0.61577344

The Defense Ministry have for years been stepping up efforts to stem the runaway flow and violence within barracks by shortening the service period, improving the military culture and paying greater attention to soldiers in need of “intensive care” such as those suffering from depression. “There still are troops who get sick and tired and then flee the military, even while some 80 servicemen had opted to delay their discharge in the face of a recent flare-up of tension with North Korea,” Seo said on Twitter. “We should strive more to change unreasonable military culture so that the soldiers can dutifully fulfill their service.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","415 people broke barracks last ,south korean servicemen who deserted ,people broke barracks last year ,june this year 154 desertions ,korean servicemen who deserted from","['south korean', 'the High Court for Armed Forces', 'Seo Young - kyo', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Demilitarized Zone', 'Defense', 'the Defense Ministry', 'North Korea', 'seo', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3790819   0.64347416

I wish to become a car engineer.”Bluntly praising one’s qualities and telling life experiences that do little to stress one’s abilities or academic prowess are only some of the pitfalls students can fall into while writing self-introductory essays, South Korean education firms that offer lessons on composing essays say.They offer a service that a growing number of students are turning to in their arduous struggle to enter college, as universities have begun placing more emphasis on test takers’ writing skills.Education authorities have been moving to highlight nonacademic aspects in the college admissions process as part of their efforts to alleviate the students from the burden of intense test competition.But a glaring problem with the new approach is that students have been left without any training from their earlier education in how to write such essays, leading to the bitter irony of some students plagiarizing other people’s life stories or getting private tutors to write their personal introductions. There have been complaints that Korea’s high school curriculum is overly focused on preparing for multiple-choice tests like school exams and the annual college entrance exam known here as the “Suneung.” In a hasty response to such criticism, the ministry revised the curriculum so that each high school student could select an essay class in school, starting last year.But with no formal textbooks developed by the government yet, essay-writing education is still predominantly conducted in the private sector. “Throughout my middle and high school days, I’ve never even learned how to write. Yet I suddenly have to write an essay about my life for college. So, naturally we have no choice but to turn to private education,” said a high school senior at a Seoul-based school.  Students and parents listen to a lecture by the Seoul Education Research and Information Institute on how to write self-introductory essays for college applications at Soongsil University in Seoul on Aug. 23. (Yonhap)Lee Man-gi, an official from local education firm Uway which offers lessons on how to write these essays, said a lack of storytelling ability causes many students to have trouble writing self-introductory essays.“There is a huge disparity among students’ ability levels to write, and they have trouble identifying which life experience is worth mentioning. This is what our institute instructs the students on” he said. In addition, he mentioned that the immense academic workload piled on students restricts them from having varied experiences outside of studying.“Their club activities, the books they’ve read. ... There isn’t too much discrepancy among Korean kids. Yet they have to write something that stands out. This is why they seek help,” he said. Meanwhile, the ability to write good essays is becoming more important.According to the 2016 college admissions guidelines announced by the Korean Council for University Education last month, the percentage of extraordinary admissions has increased in this year’s admissions process.Extraordinary admissions happen through a process conducted between August and October, basing the evaluations more on general schoolwork and extracurricular activities than the Suneung.In these admissions courses, self-introductory essays and interviews are an important part of the grading process. According to Rep. An Min-suk of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, there have been 7,623 cases of suspected plagiarism among self-introductory essays submitted in the admissions process for the 2015 school year. “Admissions fraud strips other people of their rightful opportunities, and must be severely dealt with,” said An, urging the authorities to crack down on students, teachers and anyone involved in such cheating.But according to Lee Seok-rok, an admissions officer for Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, the occurrence of plagiarism is actually trending down.In light of the rampant plagiarism of essays, the KCUE in 2012 announced guidelines for colleges to weed out copycats in the admissions process. Most major schools, including HUFS, adopted a system to identify similarities in essays to pick out those who copied and pasted others’ work. “I think more students are now worried that copying other’s essays will eliminate their chance of getting accepted at universities,” said Lee, pointing out that HUFS only had three cases of suspected plagiarism last year. Sungkyunkwan University, Korea University and Seoul National University had the most plagiarism cases of all universities with 541, 424 and 422, respectively.While less students are copying others’ work, more students are paying for the wisdom of others.A recent report by a local daily showed that university students who were accepted at top-tier universities via nonscheduled admissions often teach high schoolers how to write essays and do interviews. According to the report, one sold his self-introductory essay for 50,000 won ($42) to each student wanting to know his “secrets,” and was paid about 150,000 won per essay for correcting them.These lessons for self-introductory essays have formed a profitable market, with local private education firms offering classes as well. With so many students feeling clueless about how to effectively explain who they are, admissions officers advise them to just stick to the basics: persuade the reader why one needs to pick him or her. “School records just show results of students’ work. Self-introductory essays give students a chance to explain the process of their school lives, and allow them to explain why he or she belongs (at the university),” said HUFS’s Lee.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","was very interested in cars ,students work self introductory essays ,become car engineer bluntly praising ,arduous struggle to enter college ,admissions often teach high schoolers","['south korean', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'the Seoul Education Research and Information Institute', 'Soongsil University', 'Seoul', 'Yonhap)Lee Man - gi', 'Uway', 'korean', 'the Korean Council for University Education', 'Suneung', 'An Min - suk', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Lee Seok - rok', 'Hankuk University of Foreign Studies', 'HUFS', 'Lee', 'HUFS', 'Sungkyunkwan University', 'Korea University', 'Seoul National University', 'HUFS ’s', 'Lee']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65256906  0.38471669

It grew 0.3 percent in the April-June period from three months earlier, decelerating from a 0.8 percent on-quarter expansion in the first quarter.

The number of undergraduates marked a 0.8 percent fall from 2014.The total number of students in tertiary education has been on the decline since peaking at 3.73 million in 2011. Ministry officials said their consistent efforts to cut the number of students at colleges and universities appear to be paying off. The government has been pushing to decrease the number of undergraduates as a way to restructure crowded and underperforming colleges. As Korea’s population continues to dwindle, the overall number of students is also expected to continue to decline.There are currently 6.81 million students at primary and secondary schools, which is a little more than two-thirds of 10 million students Korea had in 1960. If this trend continues, there will be 160,000 more college student openings than high school graduates by 2023.The Education Ministry is conducting a nationwide college evaluation, the results of which will be announced next Monday, and institutes that get poor grades will be pressured to cut their student quota. Those unwilling to comply will be cut off from government subsidies.The ministry is pushing to cut about 40,000 student openings at colleges by 2017, and 160,000 by 2023, which implies that the number of students in higher education is likely to keep decreasing.While the number of overall students fell, the country had more students from multicultural families than ever before. A total of 82,536 students were from multicultural families, jumping 21 percent from the year before.Students of Vietnamese descent accounted for 20.9 percent of multicultural students, followed by Chinese and Japanese, respectively, at 20.8 percent and 15.9 percent.The figure for foreign students also peaked at 91,332, marking a 7.6 percent from 2014.Since taking office, Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea has stressed that hosting more foreign students was the best way for local colleges to compensate for the declining number of local students.In contrast to the student headcount, the number of teachers saw a slight increase of 0.2 percent from the year before. About 69.7 percent of teachers in primary and secondary education were women, while women accounted for 24.4 percent of educators in higher education.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","undergraduates marked percent fall from ,universities decreased for the first ,year colleges and universities decreased ,cut about 40 000 student ,of undergraduates marked percent fall","['south korean', 'the Education Ministry', 'Korea ’s', 'Korea', '2023.the Education Ministry', 'vietnamese', 'Chinese', 'Japanese', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'Yoon Min - sik']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.70084953  0.33328187

The ratio was higher than 53.5 percent for members of Generation X, who were born in the late 1960s and 1970s and 46.5 percent for baby boomers, who are in their 50s or older.Some 70 percent of the Sampo Generation saves money on fixed-rate bank deposit accounts, while 65 percent of baby boomers hold such accounts.Slightly over half of those in their 20s and 30s think they should own a house, with comparable figures coming to 41.7 percent for Generation X and 46.7 percent for baby boomers.However, 18 percent of the younger generations put money in mutual funds, while the figure hovers above 20 percent for older generations.More than half of the Sampo Generation start to provide for old age before they turn 30, while the older generations begin at around 40.""Among the three generations, the so-called Sampo Generation is the most conservative in asset management,"" said Doh Chul-hwan, a researcher at the institute.

It marked the second straight year ofon-year decline and was the lowest since 2005, when around 435,000 babies were born. Yoon Yean-ok, director of population statistics at the statistical agency, said the drop reflects an overall drop in the number of women in their 20s and 30s. The average age that a mother had her first born was 32.04 last year, up from the 31.84 years in 2013. Some 22 percent of these mothers were over 35 years of age.""There has been a steady drop in mothers in their 20s, with more and more women giving birth in their 30s,"" Yoon said. ""This can cause people to only opt for fewer children.""The number of first babies edged up 0.3 percent on-year to 225,400 in 2014, but those of second and third children contracted 0.2 percent and 3.4 percent, respectively.The total fertility rate, or the average number of babies that a woman is projected to have during her lifetime, reached 1.205 last year, compared with the previous year's 1.187. The agency said the slight gain is mainly the result of more women in their late 30s having babies.This is a positive step, although the figure is way below the 2.1 needed to prevent a drop in the population, it said, adding current predictions have indicated that South Korea's population will peak in 2030.South Korea has one of the lowest fertility rates among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.The latest annual report, meanwhile, is expected to fuel concerns that the country's chronically low birthrate will result in a smaller workforce down the road, eventually hurting the country's economic growth and undermining its growth potential. An aging population usually results in greater welfare outlays that can endanger the fiscal health of a country.

Countries including Italy, the U.S., Germany and Australia also had a gap of less than five years in the life expectancy of men and women. One of the reasons behind the nearly 7-year gap in life expectancy between Korean men and women might be the higher smoking rate for men, the report suggested. (Yonhap)About 36 percent of Korean men smoked daily in 2013, the third highest rate among OECD countries. But only 4.3 percent of women smoked every day, the lowest in the OECD bloc. OECD data also showed that the more adults smoke, the less likely they live long in general, which hints at a link between the short life expectancy and the high smoking rate.Nearly 44 percent of Greek men aged 15 or older smoked in 2013, the highest rate across the OECD bloc, followed by Turkey at 37.3 percent and Korea and Estonia at 36.2 percent.Sweden recorded the lowest smoking rate for men with 9.8 percent, followed by Iceland (10.7 percent), Australia (14.5 percent) and the U.S. (15.6 percent.)Life expectancy for men belonging to countries with the high smoking rates was relatively short, with Greece ranked 17th (78.7 years), Turkey at 29th (73.7 years) and Estonia at 32nd (72.8 years).

""It also raises questions over whether the loudly proclaimed 'pivot' to Asia is, in fact, no more than a pirouette.""Last week, U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense David Shear told reporters that the annual Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercise had been temporarily suspended and then resumed as the two sides needed to do some coordination over an exchange of artillery fire with North Korea.Halpin said the decision was similar to the 1992 cancellation of the Team Spirit exercise, which was made in order to remove an ""irritant to North Korea"" after the two Koreas issued a landmark joint declaration on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

(Yonhap)The celebratory event kicked off at 7 p.m., with Rai chanting “We won!” in front of the Seoul office of the Ministry of Employment and Labor, where Rai and the union members staged a sit-in day and night for three weeks in the blazing heat.“(As the union is now officially registered,) let’s not hesitate to mobilize ourselves to fight abusive employers and discriminatory treatment,” Rai said. “Now, the day to achieve basic labor rights for migrant workers is nearing. Let’s fight together through collective action.”The crowd, consisting mostly of human rights activists and civic groups, erupted in cheers as a four-member Pakistani band took the stage to perform. As the night went on, the street next to the ministry building turned into a party venue, with participants sharing food and drinks. The authorization came nearly two months after the Supreme Court legalized the union, and a month after the labor ministry refused to issue a permit for the establishment of the MTU, taking issue with what it called “politically oriented clauses” in the union’s bylaws.“In the labor union’s original rules, there were some contents against the upper law,” Oh Yeong-min, an official from the ministry, told The Korea Herald. “The purpose of setting up a trade union shouldn’t be politically motivated.” The ministry demanded that the union water down phrases like “legalization of unregistered migrant workers in Korea” and “abolishment of the Employment Permit System,” which prompted the union to launch an around-the-clock sit-in protest.Under the EPS, unskilled workers from 15 nations are allowed to enter Korea to work for up to three years. But migrant workers and civic groups have accused the system of favoring employers, giving them leeway to exploit migrant workers. According to government data, the number of migrant workers legally staying in Korea on the EPS visa stood at more than 270,000 at the end of last year, with 52,760 in the country illegally.Suk Kwon-ho, an official from the nation’s second-largest trade union, the Korean Confederation of Trade Union, said that behind the refusal was the government’s “allergy” to trade unions and the mobilization of workers. “Mobilizing workers and founding a labor union are, of course, political activities to have our voices heard in the Korean society,” Suk told The Korea Herald. “The government was just afraid of laborers being mobilized to fix a flawed structure and institution.” Indeed, a significant number of KCTU members were present at the rally, supporting the foreign workers’ fight in the name of “solidarity.”“Laborers, regardless of nationality, should join forces to fight against capitalists’ low-income policy,” Suk said. “Migrant workers here are at the bottom of the income ladder, with many of them being enslaved by employers.” The Supreme Court’s ruling was historic, as it stated that migrant workers residing in Korea, could set up and join a trade union, whether they were here legally or not. The court recognized foreign workers that were in breach of immigration law as being entitled to labor rights in accordance with the nation’s labor law, 10 years after the group filed a lawsuit in 2005.Celebrations after the ruling were quickly subdued following the ministry’s refusal to recognize the union. While the MTU was “disappointed,” it decided to change what was viewed as “politically oriented” to gain legal status. “We have fought for 10 years, and if we didn’t compromise, it could take 10 more years to establish a trade union,” Shekh Al Mamun, a deputy head of the MTU, told The Korea Herald. Some radical civic groups voiced concerns over the MTU’s decision, viewing it as a compromise. But the MTU said it pushed for changing the phrases to move forward.“When the conventional way of protests doesn’t work, there needs to be a change in the technique,” Mamun said. The ministry finally accepted the application after the MTU changed its purpose of establishment to “improving the social and economic status of migrant workers,” shelving the goal to abolish the EPS system and grant amnesty to illegally residing migrant workers, at least on paper.“The rephrased statements in the bylaws, however, don’t change what we stand for or erode our spirit for resistance,” he said. The MTU wrote a new chapter in migrant workers’ history in Korea, but the union members said it was only the beginning, expecting a tougher road ahead to dispel negative perceptions toward foreign laborers here. The unusual scene, with foreign workers’ voices blaring from the loudspeakers at the sit-in protest in central Seoul, was enough to turn many heads, but passers-by walked indifferently past the campaigners. “Koreans pity us, but don’t respect us,” the union leader Rai pointed out. “Many of them think we are poor and try to help us, but when we raise our voices, they point a finger at us.”According to the 2010-2014 World Values Survey of 1,200 Koreans, 34 percent of respondents had hostile feelings about multiethnic residents, and 44 percent felt negative about migrant workers in Korean society. The level of Koreans’ acceptance of other races ranked 51st out of 59 surveyed countries.But Rai remains hopeful as the growing levels of both support and dissent mean there has been progress in raising awareness of migrant workers in Korean society. “It was unimaginable to hold a sit-in in front of the government building 10 years ago.”Another challenge facing the MTU is to diversify its membership to increase its representation. The MTU currently has some 1,100 members mostly from Southeast and Central Asia. “We have fought hard, but could not reach out to migrant workers from various backgrounds, though a trade union is driven by the power of union members,” Mamun said.The MTU plans to travel across the nation to meet with migrant workers, educate them about their labor rights, and persuade them to join the union to garner support for the greater collective action.“We will continue the fight until the day we are recognized as part of society by more actively raising voices for migrant workers as well as the marginalized in society,” Mamun said. “We have a long road ahead.”By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","seoul thursday yonhap the celebratory ,thursday yonhap the celebratory event ,migrants trade union celebrate after ,2010 2014 world values survey ,thursday yonhap the celebratory","['Udaya Rai', 'the Seoul - Gyeonggi - Incheon Migrants ’ Trade Union', 'the Seoul - Gyeonggi - Incheon Migrants ’ Trade Union', 'Seoul', 'Rai', 'Seoul', 'the Ministry of Employment and Labor', 'Rai', 'Rai', 'pakistani', 'the Supreme Court', 'Yeong - min', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea', 'the Employment Permit System', 'EPS', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'EPS', 'Suk Kwon - ho', 'the Korean Confederation of Trade Union', 'korean', 'the Korea Herald', 'KCTU', 'the Supreme Court ’s', 'Korea', 'Shekh Al Mamun', 'the Korea Herald', 'EPS', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Koreans', 'Rai', 'Koreans', 'korean', 'Koreans', 'Rai', 'korean', 'MTU', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55544037  0.37184516

The court invalidated the ban, recognizing the unregistered migrants as “workers” in accordance with labor law if they offer labor in return for wage. (Ock Hyun-ju/The Korea Herald)Following the ruling, the MTU requested an authorization permit from the ministry. But the ministry rejected its application twice in the past two months, taking issue with what it called “politically oriented clauses” in the union’s bylaws. “In the labor union’s original rules, there were some contents against the upper law,” Oh Yeong-min, an official from the ministry, told The Korea Herald. The current labor law stipulates that an organization cannot be authorized as a trade union if its activities are politically motivated. The MTU’s bylaws had included that it would pursue legalizing unregistered migrant workers in Korea and abolishing the Employment Permit System, which led the ministry to demand the union to water down the clauses in question. “Such clause was viewed as politically oriented, as it had nothing to do with improving their working conditions,” the official said. The ministry finally accepted the application after the MTU changed its purpose of establishment to improving the social and economic status of migrant workers here, rather than to abolish the EPS system and grant amnesty to illegally residing migrant workers.

Four of these diseases -- cancer, diabetes, lower respiratory diseases and circulatory system diseases -- together accounted for 70 percent of all deaths in the same year.The cost to treat patients of chronic disease, 38 trillion won ($32.06 billion), also accounted for nearly 80 percent of all entire medical bills in 2013.  More than 80 percent of deaths in South Korea are caused by chronic diseases, a government study showed. (123RF)Chronic conditions -- such as obesity, arthritis and prediabetes -- are known as among the most common and preventable of all health problems. Health risk behaviors, especially physical inactivity, excessive smoking and drinking and unhealthy diet are some of the major causes of more serious chronic diseases. The report showed that Koreans, especially teenagers, don’t exercise enough. Only 12.5 percent of all Korean teenagers were engaged in physical activities as of 2013, while 47.2 percent of Korean adults were doing the same. Also, 11.9 percent of adult Koreans were drinking more than twice weekly, each time drinking at least seven glasses. A total of 41.4 percent of adult Korean men were smoking, as were 14.4 percent of male teenagers.The report showed that Korean adults should consume less calories. In 2013, 21.6 percent of all adult Koreans were overconsuming high-calorie foods, while 47.2 percent of Korean teens were overeating high-fat foods in the same year.Also, 13 million Koreans were obese as of 2013. The condition is becoming significantly more prevalent among men in their 20s and 30s. Nearly 30 percent of all adult Koreans, 9 million of them, had high blood pressure, but only 58.6 percent had been treated properly. The Ministry of Health and Welfare said it is important to promote a healthy lifestyle as many of the chronic diseases are preventable. “Even those with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes and obesity can prevent developing more serious diseases, such as stroke or heart attacks, by maintaining a healthy lifestyle and diet,” the ministry said in a statement.

In late July, Korean Air purser Park Chang-jin lodged a suit against his former boss, Cho Hyun-ah, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York for damages caused by the incident. Cho's legal team requested that the U.S. court dismiss the case, arguing that it should be handled by a court in South Korea, home to both the plaintiff and defendant, for practical reasons. Moreover, the legal team said that Park is fully capable of receiving compensation in his home country without having to reach out to overseas courts. ""(Park) has already demonstrated that it is possible for him to seek compensation in South Korea,"" one of Cho's legal representatives said, adding that Park is already taking time off from work after his case was recognized as an industrial accident last month by a local labor welfare agency. On Dec. 5, Cho forced a Korean Air flight departing from New York back to the gate because of the way her nuts were served -- in an unopened bag instead of on a plate -- and had Park disembark from the plane.The latest dismissal request is the second one filed by the former executive of Korean Air. Earlier in July, her legal team took similar countermeasures against a suit filed by another crew member to whom Cho had lashed out on during the in-flight commotion.Both plaintiffs are required to provide a response to the court by mid-September. In June, the Seoul High Court sentenced Cho to 10 months in prison but suspended the term for two years for changing the aircraft's flight route at the time when she forced Park off the plane. Prosecutors said they have submitted an appeal to have the court's decision reversed.

176,176,Drinking significant factor in domestic violence in South Korea,"When Lee Tae-ho, a social worker at the National Child Protection Agency, last year visited a 7-year-old at his home upon request from his school teacher, nothing seemed too out of place at first. 　“My mother drinks a lot of water when she’s eating,” the child told him about his single mother.　It didn’t take long for Lee to realize that the “water” was in fact the colorless Korean alcoholic beverage soju. 　U...","When Lee Tae-ho, a social worker at the National Child Protection Agency, last year visited a 7-year-old at his home upon request from his school teacher, nothing seemed too out of place at first. “My mother drinks a lot of water when she’s eating,” the child told him about his single mother.It didn’t take long for Lee to realize that the “water” was in fact the colorless Korean alcoholic beverage soju. Unemployed and depressed since her bitter divorce, the mother would drink about 20 bottles of soju a week, and would fail to provide basic care for her young children. The boy and his sister, 6, would skip dinner most days. A number of times, the suicidal mother asked them if it “would be better if they all killed themselves together.”As a social worker working for a state-run agency, Lee said he has personally witnessed many domestic violence abusers with drinking problems. Lee’s observation was demonstrated in a recent study, which found a significant connection between alcohol abuse and domestic and sexual violence in South Korea.  A recent study found a significant connection between alcohol abuse and domestic and sexual violence in South Korea. (123RF)The scholarly article from Dongguk University, which surveyed 4,851 arrested individuals for violent crimes last year, showed that 73.1 percent of the domestic violence abusers and 67.9 percent of sex offenders committed their offenses while under the influence of alcohol. While some say violent abusers with untreated alcoholism should face heavier punishment, others point out that those with low socioeconomic status are much more vulnerable to addiction and committing crimes, and therefore a stronger safety net is needed to tackle the issue in the long run. In 2009, a shocking case of child rape drove Korea into a fury when it was revealed that the assailant, a 57-year-old named Cho Doo-soon, was given 12 years in prison after damaging 80 percent of the young victim’s colon through his offense. That year, the court said Cho had “diminished capacity for his decisions” because he was drunk at the time of the offense, which weighed into the sentencing. The victim, who was 8 at the time of the incident in 2008, was also abducted and beaten by Cho before being raped. Cho had been unemployed and addicted to alcohol.Lee Won-jeong, a police officer who authored the study for Dongguk University, claimed that criminals should never be given reduced punishments for “being drunk” at the time of the offense. Instead, ex-convicts with a record of alcohol addiction who chose not to get the required medical treatment should face heavier penalties should they become second offenders, he wrote. “In order to do this, the police should establish a separate team that monitors all offenders with drinking problems, and that offers treatment options so they don’t repeat their mistakes again,” he wrote. Social worker Lee said most domestic violence cases against children he witnessed were triggered by marital problems and the financial problems of the parents. The abusive, alcoholic mother, for example, became depressed after her husband suddenly went missing. After the divorce, the unemployed mother relied on state subsidies given to destitute individuals who make less than the government-designated minimum cost of living. She soon started drinking alone at night. “She kept telling me that she no longer wants to live,” Lee said, “and that she can’t even kill herself because of her children. In many cases that I have seen, they had three signs before the abuse took place -- divorce, depression and alcoholism.”Studies have shown that Korean domestic abuse offenders with drinking problems tend to have low socioeconomic status. A 2012 research paper by the Korean Alcohol Research Foundation, which surveyed 142 domestic violence offenders with alcoholism, showed that 30 percent of them were unemployed while 43 percent were temporary workers on daily contracts. Almost 50 percent of them attended up to elementary or middle school. Meanwhile, 99.3 percent of them were men.Park Seong-su, a professor at Semyung University’s police administration program, said addiction can be more prone to affect people who are faced with overwhelming situations or unresolved emotions. “You need something to focus on in order to forget about whatever problems you have in your real life,” he said. “This can be common in people who are faced with financial hardships and a lack of support. Feelings of helplessness are what often cause depression, and depression often leads to addictions.”The study also found that 54.5 percent of the offenders had a father who also had drinking problems. Almost 55 percent of them said it’s their anger and distrust for their wives that led to their abusive behavior, while 23.9 percent said their low self-confidence triggered domestic abuse. Also, 21.8 percent cited stress as the main cause of their violence. Korea is notorious for its culture of binge drinking. In a report released last year by Euromonitor, a London-based market intelligence firm, Koreans were said to drink 13.7 shots of liquor per week on average, making them the heaviest drinkers in the world, beating out the Russians and Thais.Meanwhile, confirmed cases of child abuse in Korea jumped nearly 50 percent last year from 2013, with 80 percent of the abusers being the parents. According to the latest data available from the Gender Equality Ministry, 46.1 percent of Korean parents abused their children at least once in 2013, and 45.5 percent of married Koreans were abused by their spouses in the same year. Social worker Lee said many children who have been abused by their parents often don’t want to be separated from their mothers and fathers in spite of the violence. “The child of the alcoholic mother in fact refused to speak further when I asked him more about his mother,” Lee said. “What is best for the children in abusive homes, I think, is to treat their parents and reunite them once they are healthy. What would be even better is to prevent addiction and other mental illnesses in socially and financially vulnerable homes.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","his sister would skip dinner ,sister would skip dinner most ,korean parents abused their children ,sister would skip dinner ,parents the abusive alcoholic mother","['Lee Tae - ho', 'the National Child Protection Agency', 'Lee', 'korean', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'Dongguk University', 'Korea', 'Cho Doo - soon', 'Cho', 'Cho', 'Cho', 'Lee Won - jeong', 'Dongguk University', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'korean', 'the Korean Alcohol Research Foundation', 'Park Seong - su', 'Semyung University ’s', 'Korea', 'Euromonitor', 'London', 'Koreans', 'Russians', 'Thais', 'Korea', 'the Gender Equality Ministry', 'korean', 'Koreans', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Claire Lee']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59678966  0.56873828

The green tide advisory is raised when the chlorophyll-A concentration exceeds 15 milligrams per cubic meter and the number of blue-green algal cells is over 500 cells per milliliter based on two sets of test. This is the fourth advisory for Paldang Lake in the last five years. The lake, artificially constructed in 1973 to run Paldang Dam, serves as one of the capital’s main water sources. Over 244 million tons of water is stored there. The low rainfalls and high water temperatures amid the heat wave have contributed to the algal bloom reoccurrence, the ministry said. The advisory was also raised for the Hangang River as of Tuesday afternoon, 18 days after Seoul Metropolitan Government had lifted the alert. The river is linked to Paldang Lake. In late June, the city issued a warning for the entire downstream section of the river for the first time in 15 years. The alert lasted for a month. As part of its efforts to alleviate the green tide, the city said it would temporarily open Singok weir, a small dam, in the mouth of the river in Gyeonggi Province, which has recently been pointed to as a culprit of the green tide by civic groups. While the weir was constructed to control the water flow and prevent floods and back flow of sea water, activists have called for it to be torn down, claiming that it actually slows down the natural water flow, thereby causing ecological problems. Seoul City also urged the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport on Tuesday to contemplate whether to demolish the weir. The ministry has the authority to make the decision as it owns Singok weir. Based on a long-term study of the weir’s efficacy, Seoul City concluded earlier this year that it is economically more beneficial to tear down the small dam. The city sent the study report to the Environment Ministry and Land Ministry in May, but no responses had been received, city officials said. The Land Ministry has reportedly been reluctant to pull down Singok weir, citing the benefits of keeping the water level steady. If no rain is forecast by next week, Seoul Metropolitan Government will temporarily open the small dam and monitor the ecological differences for three days, authorities said.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","green tide advisory wednesday for ,five years the lake artificially ,over 000 blue green algal ,environment ministry issued green tide ,green tide advisory wednesday","['Seoul', 'the Environment Ministry', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Singok', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Seoul City', 'the Ministry of Land , Infrastructure and Transport', 'Singok', 'Seoul City', 'the Environment Ministry', 'Land Ministry', 'the Land Ministry', 'Singok', 'Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3776069   0.14652731

Girls got 5.4 more points in standard scores in Korean Language type B category ― the Suneung math and Korean sections are conducted in two sets of tests, an easier type A and more difficult type B. Math type B, the only subject where boys outperformed girls in the 2013 Suneung, was also taken over by girls, although the disparity was the smallest among all subjects at 0.4.The data reflected the recent trend of female students outperforming their male counterparts in school work. (Yonhap)According to an analysis of the KICE’s evaluation on academic achievement of middle and high school students, girls had a profound lead in both Korean Language and English ― by 8.3 to 10.7 points ― while boys only had a minor advantage of 1.1 in high school math. “In secondary education, girls tend to be more diligent and hardworking than boys. They also pay more attention to detail, which helps because most of our exams are about getting the facts right,” said an English teacher at a Seoul-based middle school.A five-year analysis of the data also showed that the boys’ lead in the math category had consistently shrunk since recording 3 points average higher disparity in 2010, while girls maintained a steady lead in the two other categories. While girls generally did better than boys in recent Suneung exams, experts say that girls’ dominance in Math type B is likely to have been a result of authorities’ failure to balance out how difficult each subject is.For example, 4.3 percent of the students got the perfect score in Math type B, but only 0.09 percent aced the Korean Language type B. Based on the nine-level grading system, those who took Math B had to have scored perfect marks to be graded in the top level, as the test was relatively too easy.“Because last year’s Suneung had such easy math exams, boys had a harder time showing better grades on the test that failed to distinctively assess the students’ capacity,” said Yang Jung-ho, a professor of education at Sungkyunkwan University. Girls, on the other hand, had a significant advantage in doing well in what they already excelled in on the test that was much more difficult, he added.He pointed out that 4 percent of male students got the top rating in Math type B, while 1.9 percent of the female students garnered the top rating. In the case of both Math type A and B, more male students received the top rating than their female counterparts. In addition to gender disparity, there were also substantial differences in the performances of students from large cities and rural areas.In terms of standard scores, students from large cities ― those with a population of 500,000 or more ― scored as much as 11.6 points more than those from rural areas.Yang said this is because those living in metropolitan areas tend to have higher incomes as well as more access to private language education and information related to education, which allows them to be more committed to their children’s education than those in rural areas.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","female students garnered the top ,math exams boys had harder ,female students outperforming their male ,boys in recent suneung exams ,last year garnered higher scores","['Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation', 'KICE', 'english', 'Korean Language', 'Suneung', 'korean', 'KICE ’s', 'Korean Language', 'Seoul', 'B. base', 'Yang Jung - ho', 'Sungkyunkwan University', 'Yang', 'Yoon Min - sik']",11,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.58241642  0.9132995

Three generations of the family, including Oh’s mother, sister, and grandfather, devoted themselves into the cause, enduring years of financial hardship, relentless travel across China and sacrifice of personal happiness.Born in 1926 to Manchuria-based Korean activists and raised in multiple Chinese cities including Nanjing and Chongqing, Oh was separated from her father at age 10 when he was arrested by the Japanese while on a mission in Beijing. For the next 10 years, she and her two siblings were raised by their mother in China, assuming their father was probably dead. “We knew he spent three years in jail after he disappeared,” she said. “But we didn’t know what happened to him after that.” Independence activist Oh Hee-ock speaks during an interview with The Korea Herald. ( Ahn Hoon/The Korea Herald)Oh’s mother, Jeong Jeong-san, was a fearless activist often dubbed a “woman warrior.” When they lived in Manchuria, she cultivated the wasteland on her own and started rice farming. Every day, she’d cook 12 bags of rice to feed soldiers of the Korean Liberation Army, in which her father-in-law, Oh In-soo, and husband, Oh Gwang-seon, played leading roles. Gwang-seon, in particular, was one of the closest aides of Kim Koo (1876-1949), the last Premier of the Provisional Government of Republic of Korea, a partially recognized Korean government-in-exile that was based in Shanghai and later in Chongqing during Japanese rule. Kim was also a leader of the Korean independence movement and became a reunification activist after 1945. One of the supporters of Kim and the Korean Liberation Army was Chiang Kai-shek (1887-1975), the Chinese political and military leader who later became the first president of Taiwan. Oh and her sister were allowed to attend a school founded by Chiang in China when their mother could not afford to send them to school as a single parent. Jeong also encouraged her teenage daughters to become soldiers and fight against the Japanese. Oh was only 14 when she joined the army in Chongqing. “It just felt very natural for me and my sister,” Oh recalled. “We didn’t think not joining the army was an option.”While her sister, Hee-young, worked as an intelligence agent and was responsible of recruiting soldiers and plotting guerilla warfare along with Chinese activists, Oh spent most of her time organizing political campaigns against the Japanese authorities, engaging in a number of propaganda plays and musical performances. What gripped Oh and her colleagues in China was a heavy sense of loss. “We were on this mission together and the mission was about retrieving what was forcefully taken away from us ― our country,” she said.Oh and her family moved to Korea in 1946, a year after the country was liberated from Japan. They were soon reunited with their father in Incheon. He had been rescued by a Chinese family after being left in a remote wilderness by the Japanese, and worked in Manchuria on secret military missions.Yet the family faced more hardships in their home country, even after the Korean War (1950-1953). Oh is still particularly grief-stricken by her late sister’s life and how it ended. “My sister was such a gifted, eloquent and intelligent person. She spoke Chinese and English on top of Korean. She had so much to offer,” Oh said. “Our teachers always said she would make a great lawyer.”Unlike Oh, who managed to get a job as a teacher after moving to Korea, her sister didn’t get the same opportunity. Before moving to Korea, Hee-young married a fellow Korean activist, Shin Song-sik, in China in 1944, and had her first son shortly after. The son died as a child during the Korean War. She had six children after that. “She was too busy being a mother (to do anything else),” Oh said.Throughout her life, Hee-young suffered severe financial hardships, after Shin chose not to join the Korea Army Forces because his belief ― which had been based on activism for unification ― conflicted with South Korea’s anti-North Korean military agenda. He tried to start a business once, but it ended in bankruptcy after he was swindled out of his savings. Hee-young died in 1969 of cervical cancer. She was only 42. Shin died of lung cancer four years later. Their orphaned children were forced to part ways to support themselves, and only two of them managed to attend high school.It was in 1990 that Hee-young was posthumously awarded the Order of Merit for National Foundation for her work as an independence activist, along with other family members including Oh, her husband Shin, and her parents. “It really breaks my heart whenever I think about her,” Oh said.Oh’s father, on the other hand, was never promoted beyond colonel in the South Korean Army, in spite of his contributions during the colonial period. Being left out of the much-deserved promotion for 8 years also led to financial struggles for his family. He died in 1967 at age 71.“I heard that only the president can promote a colonel to a (general),” she said. “My father was a close aide of Kim Koo, who was the strongest political rival of Syngman Rhee, the first President of South Korea.”Oh said she still had conflicted feelings about her late father. He was a remarkable solider and a caring father, she recalled. He was ahead of his time and determined to educate his daughters. But he also caused Oh’s mother suffering by leaving her for 10 years ― albeit involuntarily ― and living with another woman and having children with her during that period. “Perhaps it’s better for an activist with a big purpose to not marry at all,” she said. “I don’t think you can do both; serve your country and supporting your family at the same time.”Her mother, who spent most of her later life alone until her death in 1992, also suffered from financial hardships. “I could not visit her very often because I had to take care of my own grandchildren,” she said. “Once she visited me at my house, and asked if I had any money to support her. She had to rely on a stick to walk at the time but still came all the way to see me. That day I had no money to give her and she had to leave the house empty handed. I still think about that day and I still wish I could have helped her. I think about it over and over again.”After all these years, Oh, who is the sole survivor of her family, wishes to see the reunification of the two Koreas. Just like Kim Koo, her father had fiercely opposed the establishment of separate governments in North and South Korea after Korean liberation. The division was a loss of the country that Oh and her family had so desperately envisioned.“My family’s efforts were for a liberated Korea, not a divided one,” she said. Oh still clearly remembers the lyrics of a song which she often sang with her sister and fellow soldiers in China as a young activist. The song was written by composer Lee Si-woo in 1935, inspired by a real-life story of a woman whose husband was killed by the Japanese after crossing the Tumen River to campaign in China for Korean independence. “There is a boatman rowing on the blue Tumen River,” the song goes.“My love once took a boat and years flew by. Where was my love heading? My love, when are you returning to me?”By Claire Lee(dyc@heraldcorp.com)","moving to korea her sister ,young married fellow korean activist ,her late mother and sister ,the korea herald oh mother ,married fellow korean activist","['Suwon', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Korea', 'japanese', 'Korea', 'China', 'Manchuria', 'korean', 'chinese', 'Nanjing', 'Chongqing', 'japanese', 'Beijing', 'China', 'oh Hee - ock', 'the Korea Herald', 'Ahn Hoon', 'the Korea', 'Jeong Jeong - san', 'Manchuria', 'the Korean Liberation Army', 'Gwang', 'Gwang', 'Kim Koo', 'the Provisional Government of Republic of Korea', 'korean', 'Shanghai', 'Chongqing', 'japanese', 'Kim', 'korean', 'Kim', 'the Korean Liberation Army', 'Chiang Kai - shek', 'chinese', 'Taiwan', 'Chiang', 'China', 'Jeong', 'Japanese', 'Chongqing', 'chinese', 'japanese', 'China', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Incheon', 'chinese', 'Japanese', 'Manchuria', 'Korean', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Shin Song - sik', 'China', 'Shin', 'the Korea Army Forces', 'South Korea ’s', 'anti - north korean', 'Shin', 'Shin', 'the south korean Army', 'Kim Koo', 'Syngman Rhee', 'South Korea', 'Koreas', 'Kim Koo', 'North and South Korea', 'korean', 'Korea', 'China', 'Lee Si - woo', 'Japanese', 'China', 'korean']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.17355838  0.21575291

(Yonhap)The government reportedly presented a toned-down proposal to the labor bloc on Sunday, three days ahead of the slated meeting of 52 key officials belonging to the Federation of Korean Trade Unions on Tuesday to decide whether to return to the negotiations.The trade union has been refusing to even discuss the new layoff plan on the bargaining table, boycotting the talks unless the trilateral committee scraps the agenda from the negotiations. In the government proposal, only symbolic statements for the easing of firing regulations and recruitment guidelines would be included, in an attempt to temper the controversial points to push ahead for an agreeable market reform that also include ordinary wages, working hours and an extension of the retirement age.The suggestion came over a week after Kim Dae-hwan, head of a tripartite committee of government, labor and management, returned to his post, pledging to resume the dialogue as soon as possible. Kim had offered to resign in April, taking responsibility for the collapse of the trilateral talks on reforming the labor market. The government’s stepped-up efforts to resume the talks comes in line with President Park Geun-hye’s campaign for labor market reforms to increase flexibility in what she calls a “rigid” labor market.Park set labor reforms as the nation’s top priority in the second half of this year to help boost the nation’s sluggish economy and generate jobs for struggling youth.If the labor bloc accepts the suggestion, the trilateral consultative body is expected to avoid contentious topics and to draw conclusions on agreeable items including ordinary pay, the wage peak system and protection for irregular workers.“It is important to stick to a principle, but it is necessary to protect the labor bloc’s rights in the consultative body’s framework,” an FKTU official said, raising possibility of the union accepting the proposal.However, the union itself is expected to face the daunting task of persuading its union bodies as some of the members including a trade union for metal workers vowed not to accept the suggestion.The metal union is the biggest body under the FKTU with 130,000 members, allegedly retaining a great deal of organizing and leveraging power within the union. It pledged to block the union meeting from taking place Tuesday. The labor union is scheduled to hold mass rallies across the nation to resist the government’s push for labor market reforms on Aug. 22.

The guidelines also completely ignored sexual minorities, saying sexual abuse can lead to “defects” like questioning one’s sexual orientation. It also described women not paying the bill on dates as being one of the reasons behind date rapes, and that women “have to be careful” and “firmly say no” to avoid date rape. “Not only do the guidelines generalize the misperception about men’s sexual desire, thereby justifying sexual violence, it leads students to have strings of prejudice related to sex,” said an official from the KSVRC.The ministry explained the following day that it ordered the officials to revise the part about date rape and is planning to consult with experts on the part about men’s sexual urges. Despite the ministry’s prompt reaction, the guidelines -- distributed earlier this year -- raised questions about sexual education in schools, or lack thereof.Bae Jeong-weon, a sex education counselor who heads the Center for Sexuality and Harmonious Life, said that lack of proper sexual education is damaging students’ perceptions of sex, making it harder for students to understand what is appropriate and what is not.She pointed out that sex education in high school is being conducted as one of six categories under the public health classes, which is insufficient to provide adequate information. Law mandates that all elementary, middle and high schools conduct sex education. But important details, such as about safe sex and contraception, are also often glossed over, while the guidelines sternly warn students about the negative side effects of sex, such as unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.Talking about teenage sex has been frowned upon in conservative Korean society. According to a recent survey by seven sex education institutions in Seoul, over half of middle school boys in Seoul do not consult anyone about sex-related problems.Teenagers say such taboo is driving them further away from understanding the basic concept of sex. “Teachers just say sex is something that we simply should not do. It is a natural thing between people that love each other, but they don’t talk about that,” said a 16-year-old girl who left home last year and is currently living in a shared home with fellow runaways.  Students at a Seoul-based high school attend a class in this file photo. (The Korea Herald)With the authorities tip-toeing around the issue, students may have the misperception that breaking the taboo is “cool and hip,” Bae said, pointing out that such misperceptions about sex may have fueled sex-related incidents among college students.Most colleges and universities conduct a “welcoming workshop” for freshmen students, during which freshmen and older students go on a trip to drink, play games and get to learn more about college life. But such release of the stress accumulated through years of preparing for college while being relatively unaware of sexual boundaries is also blamed as part of the reason for an increase of sexual harassment during these events.Earlier this year, several male students at Sogang University were slammed for using sexually offensive terms in allocating rooms for first-year students. While the incident sparked nationwide furor, students say this is not uncommon during the events.A 24-year-old student surnamed Yoo at a Seoul-based university shared an incident that happened during his freshman year, where a 20-year-old sophomore made inappropriate contact with younger female students. “It wasn’t like he had a reputation for being a pervert or anything. He just didn’t know better. Now that I think about it, it could have happened to me, too,” Yoo said. Bae said sex education in schools should be more detailed and informative. Instead of just telling students not to have sex until adulthood, the sex classes should help students understand the changes they are going through, she said. Parents should also be involved, Bae added.“Parents have trouble talking about it because they think of it as sexual intercourse, but it is more about teaching ways of life. They need to constantly discuss the issue with their children,” she said. Yoon Hee-sang, a 22-year-old student at Ewha Womans University, said that reoccurring cases of sexual abuse by students had her wondering if Korean education was headed in the right direction. “Students -- even those who criticize the professors about the incidents -- don’t hesitate to tell sexual jokes among their peers,” she said. “These actions by the so-called elite students, particularly at an official school event, make me wonder if our education system is overly emphasizing the academic achievements and overlooking the character development of students.”By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","teenage sex has been frowned ,date rapes and that women ,fellow runaways students at seoul ,no to avoid date rape ,sexual education is damaging students","['the Korea Sexual Violence Relief Center', 'Korean Women ’s', 'the Education Ministry ’s', 'ksvrc.the', 'Bae Jeong - weon', 'the Center for Sexuality and Harmonious Life', 'law', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Sogang University', 'Yoo', 'Seoul', 'Yoo', 'Bae', 'Bae', 'Yoon Hee - sang', 'Ewha Womans University', 'korean']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64561373  0.28528377

(Yonhap)As the flames went up during a performance to commemorate the victims coerced into sex slavery, people at the scene scrambled to douse it with fire extinguisher and placards they were holding, witnesses said. Choi was rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment. He allegedly suffered three-degree burns, but remains conscious. Yoon Mi-hyang, a head of the rally organizer, Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery, said that Choi had worked for the victims in Gwangju and come to Seoul to join the protest at least once a month. The police is set to launch a probe to determine the reason behind Choi’s self-immolation attempt. The rally was the largest in scale this year, ahead of the 70th anniversary to mark the end of Japan’s 1910-1945 colonial rule over the Korea Peninsula. Liberation Day falls on Aug. 15.The sex slavery victims and their supporters have rallied since 1992 outside the Japanese Embassy every Wednesday, demanding an apology and compensation from Japan for its wartime atrocities.

He was arrested by Japanese military police in 1928 and died at a prison in China in 1936.   During Japan's 36 years of colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula from 1910, many Korean independence activists like Shin moved to China to continue their anti-Japanese resistance movement.   The Shideng temple, which already had been demolished during Beijing's rapid urban development, is a reminder of the vanishing relics where Korean independence activists once worked.  Lee Deok-nam, a 71-year-old daughter-in-law of Shin, has been living in Beijing since the mid-2000s, and said it was ""deeply regrettable"" that such aging buildings were knocked down by developers.   ""Until the early 2000s, there were some places (where Shin once worked) in Beijing. But, for now, there is nothing left due to reconstruction projects,"" Lee said.Near the Wangfujing shopping street in Beijing, there is another aging building, which was used by the Japanese military police as a prison where Yi Yuk-sa, one of Korea's most famous poets and an independence activist, died.   Universally known by his pen name, Yi's works symbolize the spirit of Korean independence movements against Japan's harsh colonial rule.   In the 1930s, Yi studied in China, while making frequent contacts with a number of Korean independence activists.   Yi, who suffered symptoms of lung disease, was arrested in 1943 and transferred to the prison of the Japanese military police in Beijing, where he endured brutal torture. In 1944, Yi died in the prison.   The former prison is also facing demolition. Park Han-yong, an official at the Seoul-based Institute for Research in Collaborationist Activities, said, ""Along with Shanghai, Beijing was one of the centers for anti-Japanese independence movements for Korean activists.""   ""But efforts to preserve historical sites in Beijing have been neglected, compared with Shanghai,"" Park said.

The explosion nearly severed the ankle of 23-year-old Kim and the wider part of both legs of 21-year-old Ha.Following a two-day joint probe through Aug. 7 with the United Nations Command, the JCS has concluded that steel springs, firing pins and other perceived debris of the detonated devices collected from the scene corroborate with the wooden-boxed mines used by the North Korean military.“The incident has been found to be a clear provocation in which North Korean soldiers illegally breached the Military Demarcation Line and intentionally emplaced wooden-boxed mines,” said Koo Hong-mo, a senior JCS official in charge of operations, issuing condemnation over what he called a “nasty act that any normal military cannot even think of.” “Our military gravely urges North Korea to apologize and penalize those responsible. As we have repeated numerous times, we will have North Korea pay the severe price of its provocations.” The UNC issued a separate statement lambasting Pyongyang’s violation of the armistice agreement, calling for general-officer-level talks with its military. “The investigation determined that the devices were recently emplaced, and ruled out the possibility that these were legacy landmines which had drifted from their original placements due to rain or shifting soil,” the UNC said.

According to the study, day care centers on average close at 7:29 p.m., and 28.1 percent of the surveyed institutions offered programs even after their regular closing hours. Kindergartens, in comparison, mostly ran from 8:45 a.m. until 2:15 p.m.Labor Minister Lee Ki-kwon visits a day care center located inside an industrial complex in Seoul to spend time with children. The Labor Ministry recently announced its plan to establish more day care centers at industrial complexes to support children of factory workers, as well as to guarantee contract workers‘ rights to parental leaves. (Yonhap)While day care centers offer early morning classes as well as late-evening programs, kindergartens are more popular among parents with children aged 4-5, according to government statistics. Last year, 278,000 children aged 5 attended kindergartens, while only 162,000 children of the same age were placed in day care centers.Kim Eun-seol, a researcher at the Korea Institute of Child Care and Education, said this is because kindergartens offer programs that are more educational, while day care centers’ programs tend to focus more on nurturing and basic care. “Parents of children aged 4-5 prefer kindergartens because they want their kids to be prepared academically before entering elementary school when they turn six,” Kim told The Korea Herald. All kindergartens nationwide are regulated by Korea’s Ministry of Education, and therefore all of its teachers are required to have university or college degrees in early childhood education. Day care centers, on the other hand, are regulated by the Welfare Ministry. The minimum qualification to become a day care center worker is a high school diploma. According to Kim’s study, kindergarten teachers on average make about 1 million won ($857) more than day care workers monthly. The average monthly salary of kindergarten teachers was 2.74 million won, while that of day care workers was 1.81 million won. Tuition fees for private kindergartens are generally higher than at private day care centers. While high earning dual-income households have the option of hiring a nanny to drop off and pick up their children at kindergartens and even look after them at home, low-earning parents are often left with the sole option of having their children at day care centers up to more than 14 hours a day.“But it’s over-generalizing to say kindergartens are better than day care centers,” researcher Kim said. “There are so many kinds of day care centers. Some of them are public, while some of them are private. The quality of the programs as well as the teaching staff are all different by each and every institution. I think day care centers can be a great option for working parents as long as they find the right ones that fit their children’s needs.”Kim’s study also found that workers and teachers at public institutions -- both kindergartens and day care centers -- work significantly fewer hours but are paid more than those who work at private institutions.For example, teachers at public kindergartens on average worked 8 hours and 35 minutes daily, while those at private kindergartens worked 10 hours and 23 minutes each day. Teachers who have worked at public kindergartens for at least eight years were making 3.36 million won monthly as of last year, while those at private kindergartens with the same work experience were making 2.07 million won.Day care center workers were making less than kindergarten teachers, with 2.14 million won every month for those in public and 1.42 million won for those at private ones.A day care center employee who wanted to remain anonymous said if she had kids of her own in the future, she would choose to send them to kindergartens. Having a degree in early childhood education, she had worked as a teacher at a private kindergarten before taking her current position at a public day care center. “I’m not saying day care centers are bad. The one I’m working at offers decent educational programs on top of the nursery care,” she said. “But having to work long hours at day care centers makes it difficult for the staff to plan their classes ahead of time. At kindergartens, where classes end early, it’s relatively easier for teachers to think about what they want to do the next day and put extra effort into the curriculum.”Yoon Ji-young, a working mother, sent both of her children -- now seven and 11 -- to kindergartens. Yoon said she was only able to so because her mother-in-law helps with child care at home. “I just wasn’t very comfortable with the idea of my kids spending too much time at a day care center,” she said. “If they are going to play (than attend some kind of educational program), I thought it was much better to do it at home instead, with their sibling and grandmother than at an institution. But I think I wouldn’t have had the choice but to send my kids to day care centers if my mother-in-law’s help wasn’t available.”By Claire Lee(dyc@heraldcorp.com)","private kindergartens worked 10 hours ,20 percent of korea kindergartens ,private kindergartens worked 10 ,kindergarten teachers with 14 million ,at private kindergartens worked 10","['Korea', 'korean', 'kindergarten', 'Lee Ki - kwon', 'Seoul', 'the Labor Ministry', 'Kim Eun - seol', 'the Korea Institute of Child Care and Education', 'Kim', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea ’s Ministry of Education', 'the Welfare Ministry', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Ji - young', 'Yoon', 'Claire Lee(dyc@heraldcorp.com']",11,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26966518  0.46281326

According to the annual employment outlook by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, nearly 15 percent of the Korean salaried workers were paid the minimum wage or less as of 2013, more than double the average rate of 5.5 percent among the surveyed 21 countries. (Yonhap)The proportion for below-minimum wage workers in Korea was the highest in the OECD at 14.7 percent, followed by Latvia at 14.2 percent, Luxembourg at 12.3 percent and the Netherlands at 9 percent. Spain ranked the lowest on the list at 0.2 percent.Published in July, the OECD Employment Outlook for this year reviewed recent labor market trends and prospects in the club of advanced economies by gathering data on the minimum wage of its 19 member nations and two others -- Latvia and Colombia -- working to join the group. As of this month, 26 of the 34 member countries adopted some form of national minimum wage, with Germany being the latest addition. In the report, the OECD underscored the importance of the minimum wage system as a means to raise living standards at the bottom of the earnings ladder. Those affected most by the legal rate are the young, women and low-educated workers with lower productivity and weak bargaining power, it pointed out. In the United States, 4.3 percent of laborers were paid under the minimum wage, while 6.7 percent of Canadian workers were underpaid. Neighboring Japan only had 2 percent of salaried workers being underpaid.Colombia saw nearly 34 percent of underpaid workers only in the public sector, with the figures for the whole labor market being unavailable. Korean business leaders have cited an “excessively high minimum wage” as the reason behind the growing number of underpaid workers in Korea.In Belgium, on the other hand, the minimum wage level was as high as its median wage of all salaried workers, but only 0.3 percent of the working population was paid below the legal rate. Korea’s minimum wage ratio to median wage stands at 44.2 percent.Korea has seen a fierce debate in recent months between employers and employees over the extent of next year’s minimum wage increase. The labor bloc asked for a 79 percent rise from the current minimum wage at 5,580 won, arguing that the hike would curb the nation’s income inequality and boost consumer spending. The business circle, however, campaigned for a freeze, citing possible job losses and soaring production costs, especially for smaller companies. After months-long wrangling, the Minimum Wage Council, a trilateral group of employees, employers and labor experts, set the minimum wage for next year at 6,030 won, up 8.1 percent from this year’s rate. The government will officially announce next year’s legal rate on Wednesday.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","15 percent of the korean ,34 percent of underpaid workers ,minimum wage workers in korea ,next year minimum wage increase ,korea was the highest in","['South Korea', 'OECD', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'korean', 'Korea', 'OECD', 'Latvia', 'Luxembourg', 'Netherlands', 'Spain', 'the OECD Employment Outlook', 'Latvia', 'Colombia', 'Germany', 'OECD', 'the United States', 'canadian', 'Japan', 'Colombia', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Belgium', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'the Minimum Wage Council', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",11,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.82076567  0.4628635

The number of those in their 70s, in particular, increased by 3 1/2 times from 7 to 25 in the same period. Last year, a total of 1,081 Koreans were newly infected with HIV. Among them, about 60 percent said they contracted the virus through sex. The remaining 40 percent either said they didn’t know how and when the transmission took place, or chose not to comment. One patient contracted the HIV virus from his or her mother in utero. Elderly South Koreans receive their regular health check-ups at a medical facility. (Yonhap)HIV is most often spread through sexual contact, but can also be spread through contaminated needles, infected blood or blood products or from mother to child through birth or breastfeeding. HIV causes AIDS, which can destroy the body’s ability to fight infections and some cancers. The government predicts that medical costs for the elderly -- those aged 65 or older -- will continue to rise as the baby boomer (those born between 1955 and 1963) population begins to grow older, thereby doubling the current elderly demographic to more than 7.2 million.Last year, about one-third of total medical costs, 19.4 trillion won ($16.6 billion), was spent to treat the elderly. “As the elderly population is getting bigger and overall life expectancy is getting longer, concerns are rising about sexuality and aging issues,” said lawmaker Park. “There should be government support and educational programs for the elderly on how to maintain a healthy lifestyle as they age.” By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","081 koreans were newly infected ,number of hiv positive patients ,older increased dramatically from 2004 ,doubling the current elderly demographic ,19 trillion won 16 billion","['South Korea', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'South Koreans', 'Claire Lee']",12,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35405007  0.77207142

She signed up to teach women job seekers in Quang Nam, a province in Vietnam’s South Central Coast region, as part of Korea’s assistance program for developing countries.“I trained about 40 women who wished to be manicurists for about a month,” Lee told The Korea Herald. “I had an interpreter with me throughout all of the classes, but sometimes I didn’t really need to explain anything verbally because they already knew what to do. They were all very determined.”Ironically, labor policies for women hasn’t been Seoul’s forte; Korea has the highest wage gap by gender among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations. The employment rate for women in Korea in 2013, which stood at 53.9 percent, was in fact much lower than that in Vietnam in the same year -- 72 percent. According to a report last year by the World Economic Forum, Korea ranked 117th out of 142 countries on gender parity, below all of the OECD nations except Turkey.   Vietnamese female job seekers learn makeup skills in a job training center run and financed by Korea’s Ministry of Gender Equality and Family. (Ministry of Gender Equality and Family). Regardless, its gender equality project in Vietnam -- which mainly consists of offering job training programs for unemployed women -- has benefitted some 2,972 Vietnamese women since 2011 in hopes of offering more specialized fields of jobs. Among the women who received free job training, 1,239 were employed as manicurists, makeup artists and even started their own businesses as handicraft artists. “The second largest number of women immigrants residing in Korea are from Vietnam, following those from China,” said Oh Min-ok from the ministry in Seoul. “This certainly has played as one of the factors when we made our decision to launch this project there.”Korea’s Gender Equality Ministry currently runs and supports three job training centers in three different regions in Vietnam -- Quang Nam, Thai Binh and Can Tho. Starting this August, the centers are introducing new classes with different skills, including graphic design, retail strategy and cleaning. Textbooks gathering the centers’ four years of work will be published as well. All of the courses are either taught by Koreans who are experts in the specific job skills, including makeup or nail care, or locals who have been trained by Koreans to teach the classes. “All of the three centers are located in relatively remote regions. We are dealing with women who are not living in the cities and don’t have a lot of resources when seeking employment,” said Huh Hye-young, who currently works in Vietnam at the centers. She has been serving there since 2012.“Many of them work in farms owned by their families, but they are often out of work when there is no help needed. The purpose is to train them with skills that can eventually lead to possible employment, regardless of where they live.”One of the most popular classes has been nail art training. Because of Vietnam’s warm weather, manicure and pedicure services are becoming increasingly popular in the country, according to Huh. Although all of the training programs offered at the centers are free, not everyone who wishes to participate can take the classes. Every applicant has to go through an interview process in order to be selected. “Once, too many applied to take classes on nail art, so only about 50 percent of those who signed up were selected to participate,” said Huh.In spite of its high labor force participation rate of women, Vietnam was one of the few countries in the world where the gender pay gap actually widened in 2012-2013, according to International Labor Organization reports. Korea’s gender pay gap also still stands high, higher than the one in Vietnam. Korean women were paid 37.4 percent less than their male counterparts in 2012, while Vietnamese women made about 20 to 30 percent less than men in 2013.Studies by the World Bank show that women’s high employment participation in lower income countries derives from the fact that individuals cannot survive without working. The quality of the women’s work, therefore, usually remains poor, as they are often hired by their own family members for agricultural work, and are often unpaid for their labor.On the other hand, the reports pointed out that developed nations with high labor participation rate of women have extensive social protection coverage and are societies where part-time work is possible and accepted. Korea is also striving to reach such a level, as the country is still without a state-run unemployment assistance program and has among the longest work hours of the OECD nations. Most temporary workers are also not entitled to full-time benefits.Manicurist Lee said skills are what can lead to a woman’s independence, which also leads to dignity. Among students at the centers was Nguyen Thi Thau, a 29-year-old with a speech impairment, who had been struggling with job prospects because of her disability. After completing her courses in nail art, which she excelled in, she was soon hired by a local beauty salon.“Many of the women I taught are also working as home-visiting manicurists,” she said. “When you have the skills you need, you can still work even if you don’t have the money to start your own salon, or be employed by someone else. It gives you something that you can start with, even if you don’t have a lot of resources or opportunities. Then you don’t need to rely on somebody else. That’s why I found my experience in Vietnam rewarding.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","turkey vietnamese female job seekers ,vietnamese female job seekers learn ,vietnamese female job seekers ,women immigrants residing in korea ,972 vietnamese women since 2011","['Lee Ji - hyang', 'south korean', 'Vietnam', 'Quang Nam', 'Vietnam', 'Korea', 'Lee', 'the Korea Herald', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'Korea', 'Vietnam', 'the World Economic Forum', 'Korea', 'OECD', 'Turkey', 'vietnamese', 'Korea ’s', 'Ministry of Gender Equality and Family', 'Ministry of Gender Equality and Family', 'Vietnam', 'vietnamese', 'Korea', 'Vietnam', 'China', 'Seoul', 'Gender Equality Ministry', 'Vietnam', 'Thai Binh', 'can Tho', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'Vietnam', 'Vietnam', 'Vietnam', 'International Labor Organization', 'Korea', 'Vietnam', 'korean', 'vietnamese', 'the World Bank', 'Korea', 'OECD', 'Lee', 'Nguyen Thi Thau', 'Vietnam', 'Claire Lee']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.70650607  0.51335222

She had been on medication for severe postpartum depression. “The initial plan was to kill myself,” the mother told the police. “But I was afraid that my son would lead a miserable life without his mom. I was going to commit suicide after ending his life, but I became scared (to end my own life) after he died.”The tragedy is just one of the dramatically increasing number of child abuse cases in South Korea. According to the latest data released by the Welfare Ministry on Thursday, the number of child abuse cases increased by 50 percent in 2014 from the year before, with more than 80 percent of the abusers being parents. The number of child abuse cases increased by 50 percent in Korea in 2014 from the year before, with more than 80 percent of the abusers being parents. (123RF)This means 1.10 in every 1,000 Korean children was abused at least once last year, while only 0.73 in every 1,000 children experienced the same in 2013. Last year alone, 15,025 suspected cases were reported. Among them, 10,027 were confirmed as child abuse violations.The study showed that the largest number of cases, or 48 percent, involved more than one type of abuse, including physical abuse. The second most common type of abuse at 18.6 percent was child neglect, which is a pattern of failing to provide for a child’s basic needs -- including food, hygiene and clothing. About 15 percent of the cases involved emotional abuse, while 14.5 percent consisted of physical violence.Among the 10,027 confirmed abusers, 8,207 were the victims’ parents. The largest number of cases, 33 percent, were caused by the parents’ “lack of knowledge and skills in child care,” such as not being able to differentiate abuse and discipline. Twenty percent of the cases were triggered by the parents’ social isolation, as well as their stress stemming from financial difficulties. Ten percent of the abusers had conflicts with either their spouse or other family members. Also, the majority of the abusers, 32.4 percent, were unemployed. “Child abuse cases has been hard to crack down because it happens behind closed doors in the ‘private’ sphere,” said Lee Tae-ho from the National Child Protection Agency.“It is still viewed by many (Koreans) as a private family matter that need not involve the criminal justice system.” One of the child abuse victims Lee encountered had bruises all over her body when she was reported by her school teacher. Trying to hide her scars and bruises, the middle school student would always wear thick, black tights even in summer. Her parents would hit her whenever she didn’t meet her curfew, or did not dress “appropriately” for her age.When Lee visited the victim’s home to speak with her parents, they told him, “Who do you think you are to interfere with our private lives? We disciplined her because she’s ours and we love her so much. What more do you need?”Her father also told Lee that he, too, had been “disciplined” the same way by his parents when he was a child, and that he didn’t think ”there was anything wrong” with it.“There is still a general perception (in Korea) that a parent knows about his or her child the best, and that children are possessions or properties of their parents (rather than independent beings),” Lee said. “Korean culture (which emphasizes hierarchy and respect for the elders), has long favored parental rights over children’s rights. “The number of child abuse cases are increasing partly because more people are acknowledging what it is and report whenever they witness the victims or abusers.”Among the 10,027 young Korean victims, 14.6 percent of them were infants aged 0-3. The report by the Health Ministry said being exposed to abuse during the first four years of one’s life can be particularly dangerous, and it can severely damage a child’s social development and leave lifelong psychological scars. Abusive or neglectful behavior toward infants include limited physical contact with the child -- such as no kisses or hugs or other signs of affection -- and failing to bathe or feed the baby regularly. “As abused children cannot express emotions safely, adult survivors of this abuse can struggle with anger and have a difficulty maintaining relationships,” the report said. “It is necessary to make it mandatory for all parents with young infants to receive education on parenting, and for all medical institutions and health care workers to check for signs of child abuse when they receive children patients for regular health check-ups.”Overseas studies have long shown that personal stress influences a parent’s behavior toward their children. Parents who are financially struggling or having marriage stress have a higher chance of abusing -- or neglecting -- their children, according to a 1991 study by Michigan State University.Along with stress, social isolation of a parent because of having to raise a child alone has also been linked to child abuse and neglect, according to a 2002 report by the World Health Organization. Lee from the National Child Protection Agency said family preservation and therapy for both abusers and victims are as important as seeking justice for the damage done to children. “The issue cannot be stopped by just punishing the abusers,” he said. “In the long term, the government should make efforts to eliminate risk factors for child abuse, such as parental stress or financial difficulties. Welfare programs as well as psychological therapy are both needed in order to establish this.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","mother was arrested for running ,province during her tearful meeting ,after strangling her year old ,to kill myself the mother ,year old mother was arrested","['Cheongju', 'North Chungcheong Province', 'South Korea', 'the Welfare Ministry', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Lee Tae - ho', 'the National Child Protection Agency', 'Koreans', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Korea', 'Lee', 'korean', 'korean', 'the Health Ministry', 'Michigan State University', 'the World Health Organization', 'Lee', 'the National Child Protection Agency', 'Claire Lee']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.69254702  0.16587894

""I am sorry to the people for causing worries and discomfort,"" Hwang said, asking the people to return to their normal daily lives. (Yonhap)The prime minister also offered an apology for the country's poor early response to the outbreak of the disease.The government came under criticism that it had failed to bring the disease under control at an early date since the first outbreak was reported on May 26. Hwang also vowed to swiftly execute a supplementary budget bill that was passed through the National Assembly on Friday.After a three-week tug-of-war between the ruling and opposition parties, the parliament gave the nod to the 11.6 trillion-won ($9.9 billion) extra budget to cope with fallout from MERS, which has had a negative impact on Asia's fourth-largest economy. With the declaration, the government said it will scale down its temporary disease control center that was set up to deal with the MERS outbreak.However, it will continue to maintain a high level of watch against any new cases, the health ministry said.Monitoring efforts will include scanning all passengers for fever at the country's major airports and ports.The outbreak was also expected to change the way the country deals with infectious diseases in the future.Already, the government has given all medical institutions access to the so-called drug utilization review system, which the health insurance review agency used to determine any abuse or misuse of medicine. It can also provide information about a patient's previous conditions and possible exposure to any infectious diseases.The move comes as the country's first MERS patient, a 68-year-old male, has been partly blamed for the spread of the disease here. The man had failed to mention his trip to the Middle East, where he supposedly caught the MERS coronavirus, as well as his previous visits to other hospitals, apparently exposing tens of others to the disease.The health ministry said additional and more detailed steps to deal with infectious diseases in the future will likely be announced next month.

Led by Rep. Kang Chang-hee of the ruling Saenuri Party, the visit to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier initiated their three-day layover here, designed to display South Korea’s appreciation for Russia’s immense sacrifice and contribution during the six-year conflict, organizers said. The event came shortly after they arrived in the Russian capital 12 days after departing from Seoul, and before heading to Berlin via Warsaw on the Eurail.Earlier in the day, the participants celebrated their finish of the Trans-Siberian Railroad linking Vladivostok and Moscow, with the welcome from another some 250 people of Russia’s foreign and rail agencies and city government and others. “The ‘Eurasia Express’ has great meaning as it coincides with the 25th anniversary of the diplomatic relations between South Korea and Russia, as well as the 70th anniversary of Russia’s victory in World War II,” said Vladimir Yakunin, president of Russian Railways, at the ceremony.Seoul’s Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yong said the project will help remake the country into a peninsula, not an island disconnected from the continent due to the territorial division with North Korea. “It will reconnect South Korea as a peninsula, and the peninsula as a region, which bridges Eurasia and the Asia-Pacific. The railway marks a first step, not an end, that has such a significant meaning,” he said in his congratulatory remarks. By Shin Hyon-hee Korea Herald correspondent(heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","70th anniversary of russia victory ,journey in moscow on sunday ,soldier initiated their three day ,fallen soldiers during world war ,sunday reaching the last stop","['MOSCOW', 'Eurasia Express', 'Moscow', 'trans - siberian', 'Kang Chang - hee', 'Saenuri Party', 'South Korea ’s', 'Russia', 'russian', 'Seoul', 'Berlin', 'Warsaw', 'the Trans - Siberian Railroad', 'Vladivostok', 'Moscow', 'Russia', 'South Korea', 'Russia', 'Russia', 'Vladimir Yakunin', 'Russian', 'Seoul', 'Cho Tae - yong', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'Eurasia', 'Shin Hyon - hee', 'Korea Herald correspondent(heeshin@heraldcorp.com']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42488354  0.60450333

This marked a constant increase from 3.3 percent of the total criminal population in 2004. In contrast, the ratios of charged criminal suspects in the 20-30 age group and 31-40 age group decreased from 18.3 percent to 14.9 percent and 25.3 percent to 18.3 percent, respectively.Violent crimes and sexual offenses were also on the rise. About 6 percent of the violent crimes, including murder and mugging, committed in 2013 were by men and women aged 60 or older.There were 306 sex crimes committed by those aged 71 or older in 2012, but the figure jumped to 491 in 2014, according to police data revealed by Rep. You Dae-woon of the opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, “The advances in medical science have extended the life expectancy, but the indifference toward the elderly is leading to more sex-related crimes by seniors. The government should find ways to cope with this issue before it is too late,” You said. Crimes committed by the elderly became a hot topic after a local court issued an arrest warrant for a 82-year-old woman suspected of poisoning her neighbors with a soft drink containing pesticide last Tuesday, killing two. The incident in the rural area of North Gyeongsang Province sent shockwaves across the country as an elderly woman ― traditionally viewed as someone who should be protected ― turned out to be the key suspect.The increase in crimes related to the elderly is a result of the increase in average age of Korea’s population, an official from the Korea Institute of Criminology said. According to Statistics Korea, the country is expected to become a “super-aged nation” ― countries where more than one in five is 65 or older ― by 2026. As the elderly population continues to soar, more senior citizens are also becoming victims of crimes. The percentage of senior victims was 6.5 percent of the total crimes in 2004, but increased to 9.2 percent in 2013.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","pesticide last tuesday killing two ,south korea rapidly aging society ,last tuesday killing two ,in south korea rapidly aging ,pesticide last tuesday killing","['South Korea ’s', 'the Supreme Prosecutors ’ Office', 'You Dae - woon', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'the Korea Institute of Criminology', 'Statistics Korea']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.58405119  0.24988946

The issue has long been a constant source of tension between the two Koreas, which are still technically at war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.South Korea has said there are no legal grounds to prevent its activists from floating the leaflets, citing freedom of expression.A local court ruled earlier this year that South Korean authorities can intervene and stop the leafleting campaign if there is a clear threat to the safety of South Koreans.In October, the two Koreas exchanged machine gun fire across the border after the North apparently tried to shoot down balloons carrying anti-Pyongyang leaflets.

He has just finished his second internship at a big firm, with no full-time job lined up. Park, who holds a double degree in business and international relations, has applied to about 60 companies since January, but was only interviewed by three firms that eventually did not offer him any positions.“I spent an extra year after graduating high school to write my college entrance exam again, and I spent two years in the military,” Park told The Korea Herald. “I also took a year or two during my university years to travel the world and study for the bar exam, which I eventually gave up. I regret taking those years off now because I feel I’m falling behind everyone else.”Park is one of some 410,000 young South Koreans in their 20s who are not in school and out of work as of June this year, according to Statistics Korea on Sunday.  Young Koreans in Seoul protest against the government’s labor policies for the nation’s youth population, using a large, gold-colored spoon to criticize politicians and businessmen with prosperous backgrounds and therefore ""never experienced the difficulties faced by young job seekers today.” In the Korean language, someone born into a wealthy family is said to have “been born with a gold spoon in his or her mouth.” (Yonhap)The nation’s youth unemployment reached the highest this year since 2000, raising serious concerns about the government’s labor policies especially for the country’s younger population, as well as the limited job security among young contract workers. The number of unemployed young Koreans, which stood at 330,000 back in 2013, rose to 380,000 last year, and reached 410,000 in the first half of this year. This is the second consecutive year for the youth unemployment rate to peak since 2000 -- when the country was still reeling from the aftermaths of the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The statistics show that the government’s efforts to tackle youth unemployment have not been effective so far. The Ministry of Labor and Employment allocated 1.5 trillion won ($1.3 billion) this year for projects to combat youth unemployment, with some 40 policies -- including special programs for those who wish to seek employment overseas and free mentorship service -- specifically aiming to support young job seekers. In an effort to fight the low employment among the younger people, the ministry even formed a special task force in June to help them find positions or opportunities that match their skills or draw on their formal job training or education. Kim Soo-hyun, a researcher at the Seoul Institute, said the Asian financial crisis had a long-lasting impact on Korea’s job market. “As the market became unpredictable after the crisis, more companies preferred to hire contract workers with previous job experience over young, full-time workers for entry positions, who are difficult to dismiss even if the business goes down,” he wrote in his study on youth unemployment published last year.Kim Gwang-seok, a researcher at Hyundai Research Institute, also said the lack of full-time positions among young workers is linked to the high youth unemployment rate. According to Statistics Korea, 34.8 percent of Koreans aged 15-29 started their career with a contractual position as of May, meaning one-third of young Koreans participate in the workforce for the first time with a limited job security. Among them, 19.6 percent said their first job’s contract was less than a year.Part-time job opportunities have worked to spike the employment rate for the time being.According to the statistics, the number of Koreans in their 20s who were newly employed in fact increased by 56,000 last year from 2013.But according to lawmaker Chung Se-kyun from the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, the situation poses a more long-term problem on the whole, saying that the number of young Koreans aged 15-29 who are out of work would reach 1.16 million, if the statistics include those who “gave up” work, and those who are not actively seeking employment at all. Researcher Kim had a similar outlook. “If the number of contract positions increase while the full-time positions don’t, it will eventually increase the unemployment rate later on. “It’s because once the contract ends, the worker has to endure another period of unemployment until he or she finds a job,” Kim said.Seoul Institute’s Kim echoed the concerns. “Increasing number of contract jobs may raise the employment rate temporarily,” he wrote. “But in the long run, it can’t really be a solution to the essence of the problem. The limited job security among the young population is linked to many other social problems, including the rise of single households and low fertility rate.”Kim also suggested regulating the nation’s work hours -- it’s the longest among the OECD nations -- and introducing a state-run unemployment assistance program, which is currently nonexistent in Korea, could help tackle the problem. A separate survey by Statistics Korea also showed last week that a majority of the jobseekers tend to concentrate on similar positions.According to the survey, a total of 633,000 aged between 15 and 29 as of May this year were preparing for jobs. Of them, 34.9 percent said they were getting ready to become public servants, a rise of 6.9 percentage points from the previous year.Only 18.9 percent said they were looking for jobs in companies, meaning less than two out of 10 youths were willing to enter the business sector.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","just finished his second internship ,finished his second internship ,second internship at big firm ,his second internship at big ,korea also showed last week","['Park Jin - hyung', 'Park', 'the Korea Herald', 'South Koreans', 'Statistics Korea', 'Young Koreans', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'Koreans', 'asian', 'the Ministry of Labor', 'Employment', 'Kim Soo - hyun', 'the Seoul Institute', 'asian', 'Korea', 'Kim Gwang - seok', 'Hyundai Research Institute', 'Statistics Korea', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'Chung Se - kyun', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Koreans', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Seoul Institute ’s Kim', 'OECD', 'Korea', 'Statistics Korea', 'Claire Lee']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.79132348  0.45983213

However, the May tally marks a nearly 4 percent drop from about 38,100 new babies born in April.  South Korea, whose population is expected to peak in 2030, has been trying to push up its birthrate to prevent a decline in the national workforce. Such a development can result in more welfare expenses and damage the country's growth potential.  For the first five months of the year, childbirths gained 1.9 percent on-year to about 192,400 babies, according to the report.  In 2014, 435,300 babies were born in Asia's fourth-largest economy, down 0.3 percent on-year. The drop also followed a 9.9 percent plunge in the previous year.  The report showed about 28,000 couples tied the knot in May, down 1.1 percent from a year earlier.  The number of newlyweds is a good indicator of childbirths down the line in South Korea as very few children are born to single-parent families here.  The number of marriages had dropped 5.4 percent last year, following a 1.3 percent on-year drop in 2013.  For the January-May period, about 129,200 couples got married, up 0.1 percent from the same period last year.  In May, the number of divorces plunged 16.2 percent on-year to about 1,600. In the first five months of the year, the number of divorces shrank 7.8 percent on-year to about 43,500.  The number of deaths gained 3.2 percent on-year to some 22,900 in May.  In a separate report, the statistics office said the number of people changing their residency here surged 10.8 percent on-year to about 650,000 in June.

(Yonhap)The suspect has flatly denied the police’s accusation, repeating that she does not know about the case. The suspect, only identified by her surname Park, was at the scene, but didn’t call the police when she saw her neighbors collapsing after sipping the toxic drink, according to investigators. The North Gyeongsang Provincial Police Agency probing the case on Friday afternoon detained her and charged her with murder.The six seniors lost consciousness while foaming at the mouth and were immediately taken to hospital for treatment after sharing the soft drink which was later found to contain insecticide. Two died and four others fell into critical condition. One woman later regained consciousness. Park became a key suspect after investigators found a capless bottle of a health drink containing insecticide, the same substance used in the poisoned soda, at her residence on Friday.Police also found other bottles of the same drink inside her residence that had the same expiry date as the health drink containing the toxic substance. The 1.5-liter soda bottle shared by the neighbors had a cap from the health drink on it, raising suspicions that Park had put the insecticide in the soda bottle but mistakenly changed the lid.Adding to suspicions, Park was the only one who didn’t drink the contaminated soda at the time, according to the police. When her neighbor offered her the soda, Park refused, saying that she was already full. Police secured other evidence through the National Forensic Service that detected the pesticide in the suspect’s clothes and the handlebars of her electronic scooter. The suspect, meanwhile, reiterated that she was being framed by someone else who put the contaminated bottle near her house. A motive for the suspected murder has not yet been made known, but the police said she might have had a grudge against one of the victims. Investigators have tried to give Park a lie detector test. But the suspect refused, asserting her innocence, they added. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","pesticide tuesday during community meeting ,murder the six seniors lost ,her neighbors collapsing after sipping ,to contain insecticide two died ,of poisoning her six neighbors","['the Daegu District Court', 'Sangju', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'Park', 'the North Gyeongsang Provincial Police Agency', 'Park', 'Park', 'the National Forensic Service', 'Park']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61328757 -0.12918971

Before it took effect on Jan. 1, Korea had the cheapest average price -- 2,500 won -- for a pack cigarettes among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations.The move has been criticized by the public and some politicians, who claimed that it was an “indirect way of increasing the taxes” paid by the nation’s low-income population, whose smoking rate is higher than high-income earners.","35 percent of korean men ,fewer koreans are smoking because ,south korean men has dropped ,currently 35 percent of korean ,500 won for pack cigarettes","['south korean', 'korean', 'korean', 'Koreans', 'the Health Ministry', 'Korea', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.6475172   0.62425339

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development average is 1.25. The system in which family members provide basic care normally carried out by nursing staff in developed countries has been partly blamed for the recent Middle East respiratory outbreak. Many people who contracted the virus here did so while caring for their family members at MERS-affected hospitals. The Korean system in which family members provide basic care normally carried out by nursing staff in developed countries has been partly blamed for the recent Middle East respiratory outbreak. (Yonhap)The study, written by Hwang Na-mi at the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, predicted that it would require the government to spend 4.6 trillion won to offer full nursing care at 1,780 hospitals nationwide by 2020, and hire 47,922 more nurses to make it possible. The budget also includes the cost of purchasing hygiene and safety equipment for medical facilities, as well as building separate rooms where inpatients can spend time with visitors, away from the wards, the study said. Once the system is established, inpatients would face an increase in daily hospital bills of around 6,000 won to 10,000 won a day, but would not need to hire a personal care worker or have their family members look after them during hospital stays. The service would be provided by certified nurses. The Health Ministry launched pilot programs for such services twice in the past, in 2007 and 2010. According to a 2013 study by the Korea Health Industry Development Institute, patients who benefitted from the program in 2007 on average gave 9.1 points out of 10 when asked about their satisfaction with the service.

Pedestrians pass by the renewed Sewol protest site in Gwanghwamun Square in central Seoul, Sunday. YonhapFamily members of the victims have been staging a tent protest in Gwanghwamun Square since the father of teenage victim Kim Yoo-min started a hunger strike last year to urge the government to thoroughly investigate the deadly accident. While Kim ended the hunger strike after 46 days, the stay-in strike in the heart of Seoul has become a symbol of their fight as tens of civic activists, religious figures and even some politicians have joined the movement. Pope Francis also visited the site to comfort the bereaved families last year during his trip to Korea. Some right-wing activist groups, however, have continually urged the Sewol families to stop the demonstration, claiming that they are illegally occupying public space. The dozen tents set up in the square have blocked the area and the fountain that typically operates from April. Tens of activists, religious groups and a few family members of the victims still spend their days and night in the tents. “The rules and regulations must be equally imposed to all. Allowing the occupation over a year for those who didn’t get the official permit is problematic. The Sewol people monopolized the square where everyone should be able to enjoy their freedom of speech,” said conservative group Citizens United for Better Society. Under the law, the Seoul Metropolitan Government has full authority to allow public events or strikes in Gwanghwamun Square. Anyone wishing to hold an event is required to submit an application seven days prior. Technically, the bereaved families have never been permitted to stage the strike in the public site. The city government, however, practically approved of their actions. It even provided 13 tents to the families, citing safety concerns last year.Some extremist groups sued Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon and two other city officials in August last year, arguing that allowing the strike is “dereliction of their duty.” The probe is still underway. Despite the growing opposition, Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon has defended the demonstration.“I don’t understand what the big deal is about allowing the tent strikes, considering the agony and deep sorrow of the bereaved families,” Park said in a press conference in May. As part of the efforts to reduce the public inconvenience while keeping the spirit of the Sewol protest, the city and the protest participants agreed to remodel the protest site. Starting from Saturday, the main protest area blocking the public fountain site was cleared. Tents that had mostly been used for the stay of the protestors transformed into a place for a public altar, exhibitions of Sewol photographs and videos and a space for other events to remember the tragedy. “The remodeling aims to return Gwanghwamun Square to the public while keeping the protest spirit. We didn’t expect the protest would continue this long. The fight will go on until the Sewol issue is solved,” an official of the protest-leading civic group 416 Solidarity told The Korea Herald. Gwanghwamun Square is not the only place where the bereaved families face opposition. Dozens of residents in Paengmok Harbor in Jindo, South Jeolla Province, which is near the shipwreck site, filed a complaint to the Anticorruption and Civil Rights Commission late last month to ask for the removal of the vestiges of the Sewol tragedy in their neighborhood, citing business damage. Since the deadly accident happened, a group memorial altar was set up and yellow ribbons were hung along the port to mourn the deaths of the victims. Residents argued that the more than a year of mourning has significantly affected their businesses, adding that the government needs to ensure their mental and financial compensation. Despites such opposition, the Sewol victims’ family members continue their fight to investigate the cause and poor management of the tragedy. The controversial Sewol bill aiming to conduct a special probe into the deadly accident finally passed the National Assembly last November, but new controversy arose over a decree in the bill that protesters claimed would enable the government to possibly meddle in the investigation. Debate also brewed over the budget for the special Sewol committee.Activists have strongly lambasted the government for failing to allocate a budget for the special committee.The committee, which began operation this January, had been running on expenses provided by the maritime ministry until the subsidies were suspended in April, according to news reports. On Friday last week, the parliamentary committee on agriculture and maritime affairs agreed to allow a supplementary budget of 64 billion won ($57 million) for the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries only if the budget for the Sewol special committee is allocated, although Saenuri Party members initially opposed the idea.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","growing opposition seoul mayor park ,started hunger strike last year ,protest in gwanghwamun square since ,growing opposition seoul mayor ,extremist groups sued seoul mayor","['Seoul', 'pedestrian', 'Seoul', 'YonhapFamily', 'Kim Yoo - min', 'Kim', 'Seoul', 'Pope Francis', 'Korea', 'Citizens United for', 'Better Society', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Park', 'Sewol', 'Solidarity', 'the Korea Herald', 'Jindo', 'South Jeolla Province', 'the Anticorruption and Civil Rights Commission', 'the National Assembly', 'the Ministry of Oceans', 'Fisheries', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee \xa0 Hyun - jeong']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53303581  0.24412867

The total number of people diagnosed with MERS in South Korea remained unchanged at 186.   Ministry officials said the country may be able to declare an end to the MERS outbreak if it continues to see no new infections.   However, over 560 people still remain in isolation as suspected cases following possible exposure to the MERS coronavirus.   Since the country reported its first case on May 20, nearly 16,700 people have been in isolation for possible infections. So far, 16,102 of them have been released after showing no symptoms of MERS for more than the known maximum incubation period of 14 days for the disease.   Out of those diagnosed, 125 have been discharged from hospitals following complete recoveries.The remaining 26 were still hospitalized as of early Friday, according to the ministry.    Authorities, meanwhile, said as of midnight, KyungHee University Hospital in Gangdong, southeastern Seoul, will be allowed to resume normal operations after no new MERS cases have been reported there in the past two weeks. Several hospitals around the country were ordered to partially suspend treatment or were closed outright, after multiple cases of MERS were reported among patients and visitors. Restrictions on most have since been lifted.   MERS is a viral respiratory disease that is still fairly new to humans. The disease has claimed over 530 lives globally, posting a fatality rate of over 36 percent.   In South Korea, the fatality rate remains at 19.3 percent, with most people succumbing to MERS having underlying medical conditions.   There currently is no vaccine or treatment for the disease that was first reported only in 2012 in Saudi Arabia.

Though half of them were financially underprepared, the majority of the surveyed, or 63.9 percent, still viewed themselves as most responsible for their financial situation after retirement. Those who consider themselves to be entering retirement are mostly living on money provided by their offspring and relatives, followed by government subsidies, pensions and wages for labor. Around 80 percent of those yet to retire were not prepared at all for their post-retirement life, which could worsen elderly poverty here.  In the plural response-based poll, only 19.6 percent of the surveyed had a financial plan, with 50.4 percent of those respondents contributing to the public pension scheme, 45 percent saving money in banks and 25 percent investing on real estate. The biggest challenges facing the respondents in the run-up to their retirement were financial difficulties and health issues, according to the poll. South Korea has the highest rate of impoverished elderly among 34 developed nations, according to the 2013 Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development data. The poverty rate among senior citizens in Korea aged 65 or older was 48.6 percent in 2011, meaning that nearly 1 in 2 retirees are living in poverty, according to the government statistics. Early retirement does not help the growing problem of elderly poverty. Though the official retirement age was set at 58 as of 2014, the average age Korean workers retired was 53.  Starting from next year, the government will require the public sector and employers with 300 or more employees to extend the retirement age to 60 as part of efforts to improve job security and curb senior poverty.

The family members want compensation for physical and mental damages caused by the virus outbreak, said the Citizens’ Coalition for Economic Justice, a Seoul-based advocacy group for citizens’ rights. It is the first legal case being filed by virus victims’ family members.The plaintiffs claimed that the government and hospitals failed to block the spread of the virus and kept crucial information on MERS patients confidential, all while being aware that MERS was infectious. The government also violated its duty to protect the public from the danger, they added. “The MERS crisis clearly proves that the state’s epidemic control system and the private hospital management system have collapsed,” said CCEJ Secretary General Ko Gye-hyun. “I hope the lawsuit not only protects the victims' rights, but also tightens the government’s responsibility for health and antivirus measures.” The 173rd patient, who contracted the virus from the 76th patient in a hospital in the eastern capital, died two days after she was officially diagnosed with MERS. “If the quarantine system was well prepared, there wouldn’t have been a super-spreader and my mother wouldn't have to get infected,” said the son of the 173rd patient in the press conference Thursday.The bereaved family members of the 173rd patient and 45th patient will seek 100 million won ($88,000) and 300 million won in compensation, respectively, the civic group said. The quarantined family members will seek 6.7 million won in compensation. The amounts to be compensated were determined based on the actual income of the victims, it added. The CCEJ said it would consider filing additional compensation suits as more requests were submitted from those affected by the MERS crisis. The Welfare Ministry said that it does not have any particular subsidy plans for the MERS victims, aside from 13 million won of financial support for funerals and cremations. As of Friday afternoon, no additional cases of MERS had been reported for five consecutive days, keeping the number of confirmed cases at 186. The death toll also remained unchanged at 35.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","doctors friday expressed their frustrations ,virus outbreak said the citizens ,conference thursday the bereaved family ,the virus hit hospitals ,virus at parliamentary committee meeting","['Park Chang - il', 'Konyang University Hospital', 'Daejeon', 'the Citizens ’ Coalition for Economic Justice', 'Seoul', 'CCEJ', 'Ko Gye - hyun', 'CCEJ', 'the Welfare Ministry', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59550858  0.63258743

A total of 124 South Korean small and medium-sized enterprises are operating factories there.The South has rejected the communist neighbor's move, saying it is in breach of a 2004 agreement that calls for the two sides to set wages through consultations.In what could be a temporary relief, North Korea accepted South Korea's tentative offer in late May to pay wages at the current level, but Seoul and Pyongyang have yet to resolve the issue fully.In a separate report unveiled in April, the ministry said that the volume of inter-Korean trade hit a record high in 2014 on growth in exchanges at the industrial park despite Seoul's punitive sanctions on Pyongyang.The value of inter-Korean trade reached $2.34 billion last year, up 106.2 percent from a year earlier, it said.The joint factory park, which opened in 2004, is the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation. It has served as a major revenue source for the cash-strapped communist North, while South Korea has utilized cheap but skilled North Korean laborers.

It marks the lowest percentage ever and reflects the country's very low birth rate. As of 2014, the country's total fertility rate, or the average number of children that would be born to a woman over her lifetime, stood at 1.21, down from 1.47 in 2000.At the current pace, the percentage of people under 14 is expected to drop to 10.2 percent of the total by 2060.The statistical agency said the drop in young people will negatively impact the nation's labor force and senior citizens down the line.As of this year, 73 percent of South Korea's population is in the economically active range of 15-64, but this will plunge to 49.7 percent in 2060.In contrast, the percentage of people over 65, who generally do not hold jobs, is forecast to soar to 40.1 percent in 2060 from 3.1 percent this year.This translates into 101 senior citizens and children being supported by every 100 economically active people in 2060, up from 37 being supported this year. Such a shift will put a considerable burden on people who earn a living as well as the government.According to the data, South Korea's population stands at 51 million this year, placing it 27th in the world. In 2030, when the population is expected to peak at 52 million, it will rank 31st and fall to 49th in 2060 when the total number of people in the country will drop to 44 million.

According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Korea recorded 0.98 out of 1 point in the ranking of “Open, Useful, Reusable Government Data.” The average score of the 30 OECD members was 0.58 point. A higher score means the public information is more available and accessible on the national portal, and that the government actively supports the reuse of the data for creating public value, the Ministry of Government Administration and Home Affairs explained.The ranking was decided based on availability of information on national elections, the expenditure of both the central and municipal governments and census, accessibility of the information and the state support for the data reuse, it said.Korea recorded the highest points in the availability criteria as it has provided over 400 public data utilization services, the largest number among the countries. The “OUR Data Index” was introduced to better monitor and support the countries’ data policies after G8 countries adopted the Open Data Charter, the first international instrument to guide the implementation of open government data strategies. As part of the efforts to further boost the civil use of the public data, the ministry vowed to open up information on the business and real estate industries by this year. By 2017, it will also gradually release the highly demanded information of 36 fields such as education and health, the ministry added. The results came as the Seoul government has been under fire for not sharing information on the hospitals affected by Middle East respiratory syndrome in late May. While the state expressed concerns over the potential business damage to the MERS-hit medical facilities, the public had strongly urged the government to release the information as a preventive measure against the virus. Some civilians even voluntarily produced and shared their own online map denoting the MERS-hit hospitals. The government finally unveiled the list of hospitals in early June as the number of confirmed patients rose.

According to the poll by the Ministry of Employment and Labor, 72.8 percent of the 1,000 respondents aged over 20 said it was necessary to put the system in place ahead of the raise in the official retirement age next year. (Yonhap)Under the peak wage system, companies pay senior employees reduced salaries after the workers “peak” at a certain age, generally between 55 and 60, in return for extending the company retirement age by a few years. In the plural response-based poll, 56.3 percent of the supporters for the plan pointed to job security as the reason for supporting the system, followed by 37.6 percent expecting the system to generate jobs for young people and 35 percent seeking to save costs in the face of a prolonged retirement age. Of the supporters of the system, the majority said that a 10 to 20 percent decrease in their salaries was appropriate and employees should start to receive slashed salaries at age 55 when the system takes effect. Among those against the peak wage system, 44.5 percent thought that the companies should find alternate ways to improve competitiveness. Nearly 39 percent opposed the scheme in fear of wage cuts while 35.7 percent viewed the extension of the retirement age as their legal right, not subject to bargaining.With the official retirement age set to rise by two years to 60 next year, the government has pushed for expanding the system to the private sector to curb youth joblessness despite labor unions’ vocal opposition to the scheme.Shortly after the survey was released, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, one of the biggest labor unions in the nation, lashed out at the government for “misleading the public” with the survey.

Myohyang in North Pyongan Province, north of Pyongyang.Lee's planned visit has won much attention amid high prospects that she may meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.But Kim said nothing has been decided over whether Lee could meet with the North's leader.The North proposed that the ex-first lady arrive in the country by plane in consideration of her age and health conditions, he added.The planned visit comes amid chilled inter-Korean ties as the North has sharpened its verbal attacks against the South following the opening of a U.N. field office in Seoul tasked with monitoring Pyongyang's dismal human rights records.The North warned that Seoul will face catastrophic fallout in inter-Korean ties due to the U.N. move.Lee's late husband was the architect of the ""sunshine"" policy that actively pushed cross-border exchanges and reconciliation.

In response, the North's young leader said in a letter that he was ""looking forward to having Lee in Pyongyang once the weather got warmer in 2015.""In April, the peace center made a request for a prior contact over Lee's visit, but the North rejected it, citing ""complex inter-Korean circumstances.""

Some 69.3 percent said it was “convenient” to live alone in Seoul, while 7.4 percent said it was “inconvenient.”As for the difficulties faced by the single households scored between 1 and 10, 10 being the hardest, economical aspects received 6.77 points, followed by emotional factors such as loneliness (6.21), instability in housing (4.59), critical views from other people (4.38) and difficulties related to shopping and other daily life necessities (4.09).More than half, or 51.5 percent said they lived alone due to the distance from their workplace, while 37.1 percent said it was to become independent, 14 percent due to relocation or death of family members and 11.2 percent to prepare for employment or academic admission.In their free time, 57.8 percent said they watched television or videos, followed by those playing computer games or searching the Internet with 25.8 percent, those seeing cultural and arts events with 25 percent, resting with 24.9 percent and traveling or engaging in outdoor activities with 20 percent.Nearly half, or 46.4 percent, said they enjoyed such leisure activities by themselves, while 38.8 percent said they spent that time with their friends.

She was 89.Born in Pyongyang in 1925, Choi was kidnapped while she was on her way to visit her friend’s house in her hometown at age 16 in 1941. She was eventually sent to Harbin, China, to work as a sex slave for Japanese soldiers who were stationed there.   Choi Geum-seon, another South Korean victim of Japan’s sex slavery during World War II, died Sunday. (Yonhap)She eventually escaped after being enslaved for about a year and returned to Pyongyang. But she chose not to return to her family as she was afraid of being caught by the Japanese again. Instead Choi moved to Gyeomipo, which has since been renamed to Songnim in today’s North Hwanghae Province of North Korea, to work as a waitress at a cafe. It was in Gyeomipo where she met her future husband. She married him in 1944, six years before the Korean War began, and moved to Seoul with him in the same year. Choi is survived by her husband and their adopted daughter, according to the Gender Equality Ministry.Choi is the seventh South Korean victim of Japan’s wartime sex slavery to die this year. Last month, Kim Youn-hee, another victim who was forced to work as a sex worker in Japan, died of old age at 83. Scholars estimate that up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea and China, were forced to work in brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. Many of the victims, euphemistically called “comfort women,” are well over 80 years old.“Time is running out for the surviving victims,” said Gender Equality Minister Kim Hee-jung in a statement. “Japan must take this situation seriously and acknowledge the sufferings endured by the victims.”Among the 238 government-registered Korean victims, 190 have died.

Of the 535 people who fled the North between January and May this year, 444 were women, accounting for nearly 83 percent, according to statistics from the Unification Ministry. The figures marked the highest portion of women yet, though they were tentatively compiled while Seoul’s background checks continue on the newcomers and may fluctuate toward the end of the year, the ministry noted. Albeit with slight swings, the annual ratios have hovered in their 70s since 2006, reaching 73.1 percent in 2012, 75.6 percent in 2013 and 78.2 percent in 2014. “The proportion of women stood at about 7 percent before 1989 but has since showed an upward drift, amounting to 35 percent in 1997 and 42 percent in 2000, and in 2002 exceeded that of men,” the ministry said on its official website.   A sign points to the entrance of Daeseong-dong, the only civilian residential area within the southern part of the Demilitarized Zone. YonhapThe trend came as North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has reportedly been stepping up border controls and penalties for those who were caught escaping in order to stem the flow of defectors since he took power in December 2011.While the scrutiny became tougher for men with jobs in their towns, border regions or nearby China, housewives may have been able to take advantage of relatively loose surveillance, officials say. The overall number of North Korean refugees continues to decline on the back of Pyongyang’s heightened border security. More than 28,000 North Koreans have resettled in the South since the division of the peninsula. Despite some fluctuations, the yearly defections gradually rose from 1,384 in 2005 to 2,706 in 2011, before plunging to around 1,500 in 2012-13 and then to below 1,400 last year. Seoul has in recent years installed bells, phone boxes and guidance signs within the Demilitarized Zone to help ensure a safer cross-border journey for defectors, while facilitating those seeking to come to South Korea from a third country. After their arrival here, refugees usually spend 12 weeks at a state-run resettlement center for cultural education, therapy, and career consultations and training. They also receive living, job, education support and other assistance from the government.

224,224,MERS incubation period in doubt,"South Korean health authorities said Sunday they were tracing the route of infection for the most recent case of the Middle East respiratory syndrome, whose symptoms may have manifested a week after the estimated maximum incubation period of the disease.The country’s 186th patient, a 50-year-old cancer patient who was diagnosed with the disease Saturday, is the wife of a 55-year-old MERS patient, according to the ME...","South Korean health authorities said Sunday they were tracing the route of infection for the most recent case of the Middle East respiratory syndrome, whose symptoms may have manifested a week after the estimated maximum incubation period of the disease.The country’s 186th patient, a 50-year-old cancer patient who was diagnosed with the disease Saturday, is the wife of a 55-year-old MERS patient, according to the MERS special response team at the Health Ministry. Her husband was confirmed to have caught the disease on June 12, and was discharged Thursday after making a full recovery.According to the officials, the woman began showing her first symptom, a fever, on Thursday, 21 days after being isolated from her husband on June 11. The disease was thought to have a maximum dormancy period of 14 days. After her husband was confirmed to have been infected, she was quarantined but was released after 14 days.“It is likely she acquired the virus from her husband, and the symptoms belatedly showed up after her cancer treatment compromised her immune system,” Jeong Eun-gyeong of the MERS special response team said. If this is the case, the disease would have manifested about a week after the accepted maximum incubation period. While there have been similar cases of belated symptoms, the authorities have maintained that there is no evidence that the state-approved incubation period is inaccurate, and the patients are likely to have been belatedly diagnosed. But the three-week gap between her husband’s isolation and the manifestation of her symptoms raised the possibility that she may have been infected by MERS at Samsung Medical Center in Gangnam district, southern Seoul. Last Monday, she visited the Samsung hospital to receive cancer treatment, three days before first expressing symptoms.“We believe there is no possibility that patient No. 186 was exposed to medical staff infected with MERS. ... We are conducting further investigation on (her being infected via) other medical staff or patients, but such a possibility is low, for now,” Jeong said.If the latest patient turns out to have been infected at SMC, she will be the 91st person to have been infected at the facility. The hospital ― considered among the best in the country ― has accounted for nearly half of the 186 MERS cases in the country.As of Sunday, 15 of 16 MERS patients that were being treated at the facility had been transferred to other hospitals, and one was discharged after making a full recovery.Jeong explained that the extensive number of hospital medical staff who were exposed to MERS patients, and subsequently removed from duty, overburdened the remaining staff. As of Sunday, 12 members of the SMC staff were infected, while over 900 were being tested for infection. While the authorities did not say that the latest measure was intended to penalize SMC, it effectively removed the hospital from the frontlines of the MERS outbreak. The recent MERS outbreak has put the hospital’s capacity to deal with infectious diseases into question. The hospital was recently revealed to have failed to supply its staff with sufficient protective gear to, which is required in the handling of infectious diseases.As of Sunday, 37 of the 186 patients diagnosed with MERS had been hospitalized, with 12 in an unstable condition. Another 116 have fully recovered and been discharged. The MERS death toll stood at 33 for the fifth straight day.Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn urged the Health Ministry to swiftly provide financial support for hospitals who have suffered from the MERS outbreak. The government on Saturday announced it would allocate 16 billion won ($14.2 million) to support the hospitals.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","year old cancer patient ,seoul last monday she visited ,caught the disease on june ,showed up after her cancer ,50 year old cancer patient","['south korean', 'the Health Ministry', 'Jeong Eun - gyeong', 'Samsung Medical Center', 'Gangnam district', 'Seoul', 'Samsung', 'Jeong', 'SMC', 'Jeong', 'SMC', 'SMC', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'the Health Ministry', 'Yoon Min - sik']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5151161   0.60972893

According to a study jointly conducted by the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family along with Statistics Korea, employed moms, on average, worked two hours longer in terms of the length of labor both at work and home, and also had about an hour and 50 minutes less leisure time than stay-at-home mothers. Though working moms spent three hours less than full-time mothers on weekdays for housework, including child care, the former worked two hours and 27 minutes more in total when adding in labor hours for their paid jobs.On Saturdays and Sundays, women from double-income households spent two extra hours catching up on the housework that piled up over the week, the study found.By age, women in their 30s spent the longest at nine hours and 13 minutes a day, an hour more than the average of other age groups, on “obligatory maintenance activities” such as work, household chores, study and travel time.The average hours spent only on housework by women in their 30s was also longer than other age groups with four hours and 55 minutes. The study also showed that the burden of household responsibilities in Asia’s fourth-largest economy is still largely shouldered by mothers. Women spent nearly two hours more on housework and child care than their spouses, the study showed. Moms, regardless of their employment status, spent two hours and 27 minutes on housework while men were engaged in household chores only 31 minutes a day.In contrast, women in Australia, Canada and New Zealand did more than three hours of housework, but they were supported by their spouses who took care of the home for one hour and 50 minutes, nearly four times more than South Korean men.The clear gender imbalance on housework in South Korea may derive from the traditional gender roles of men being breadwinners and women taking charge of housework, as well as the lower rate of economically active women in the job market, the ministry said in its report.The statistics also showed that the female population surpassed the male population this year, with women aged 60 and over taking up 20.8 percent of the entire population.The employment rate of women came in at 49.5 percent, 21.9 percentage points lower than men but an increase of 0.7 percentage points over the year before.Those between 25 and 29 years of age showed the highest employment rate with 68.8 percent, but the ratio reduced to around 50 percent in the 30s when many women tend to get married and have children. The ratio rebounded to over 60 percent in the 40s.The rate of women going on to college reached 74.6 percent, surpassing men’s 67.6 percent.More women took up specialized professions, with 24.4 percent of medical doctors being women, showing a consistent increase from 13.6 percent in the 1980s. Some 26.4 percent and 64.3 percent of dentists and pharmacists were women, respectively.Political advancement by women, however, still remain low, with 22.9 percent of women winning in regional assembly elections last year and 15.7 percent in general elections in 2012, the statistics said.

More than 200,000 Korean and other Asian women were coerced into sexual servitude for Japanese troops at that time, according to historians. The victims are euphemistically dubbed ""comfort women.""  ""I can't even die without receiving an apology from the Japanese government,"" Kim said. ""Japan should not just sit back like that after having deceived young women to serve as slaves.""  She urged the Shinzo Abe administration to come clean on the matter.  The demonstration was 1,185th of its kind, organized by a Seoul-based civic group that calls itself the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan.  Every Wednesday, a handful of elderly Korean comfort women and supporters gather across the street from the Japanese Embassy in Seoul to voice their protest against Japan's lukewarm attitude on the issue.  It was the first time that a comfort woman held such a rally in front of the Japanese Embassy in Washington. It was co-organized by the Washington Coalition for Comfort Women Issues.     Japan claims that all legal responsibilities for its 1910-45 colonial rule of Korea were settled in a 1965 pact to normalize its relations with South Korea.  South Koreans, however, believe the Japanese administration has yet to offer a sincere apology and appropriate compensation for the victims.  ""We have to make efforts, along with the international community, for the punishment and implementation of legal responsibility for the crime, an issue that was not resolved 70 years ago,"" Yoon Mi-hyang, head of the Korean Council, said in the Washington rally.  The protesters also entered the embassy and held a protest rally. Ambassador Kenichiro Sasae refused to meet them in person.  Korean activists in California plan to organize similar demonstrations in other major U.S. cities where Japan's consular offices are located.

A list of the MERS-affected hospitals is daily updated and available on the ministry's website.  Meanwhile, the health ministry said another nurse at the Samsung hospital has tested positive in an initial test.  The person's diagnosis is pending on the outcome of a second test, which is expected later in the day, according to ministry officials.  In addition to those diagnosed, 2,238 people are currently in isolation as of Thursday for possible infection after coming in close contact with MERS patients.  The number dropped from 2,451 on the previous day. So far, some 13,821 others have been subject to isolation as suspected cases.Those subject to isolation are released after they show no symptoms of MERS for more than the known maximum incubation period of 14 days and test negative for the disease.  MERS is a viral respiratory disease whose symptoms include fever, coughing and shortness of breath. It had claimed over 400 lives throughout the country since it was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012.  The fatality rate of the disease had been tallied at above 40 percent until the outbreak here, but in South Korea the fatality rate remains at around 18 percent.

Nine years later, the president of Busan Port Authority, Lim Ki-tack, has been elected to head the United Nations maritime body. Lim Ki-tack (Yonhap)The 58-year-old veteran is the first South Korean to take the secretary-general position of the International Maritime Organization, the U.N. agency responsible for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution.“I first will take on my role to seek healthy growth of the world’s marine industry and set rules as the head of an U.N. organization,” Lim said.On Tuesday, Lim was chosen in a secret ballot vote of the 40-member IMO Council. He beat out five other candidates, from Cyprus, Russia, the Philippines, Denmark and Kenya, for the position.Lim’s four-year term will start on Jan. 1 and run until 2020, replacing incumbent Secretary-General Koji Sekimizu.Lim has nearly four decades of experience in the maritime industry and began attending IMO meetings as part of the South Korean delegation in 1986. He was named the chairman of the Subcommittee on Flag State Implementation from 2002 to 2004. Lim served a three-year tenure as the deputy permanent representative to the IMO starting in 2006. While serving in this capacity, he was in charge of all IMO work for South Korea.Headquartered in London, the IMO’s primary purpose is to develop and maintain a comprehensive regulatory framework for shipping with 171 member states and three associate members. South Korea joined the organization in 1962. Its areas of work include safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical cooperation, maritime security and the efficiency of shipping.South Korea has been consolidating its position as the world’s biggest shipbuilder, making the IMO’s influence on the country inevitable. “As the world‘s No. 1 country in shipbuilding and No. 5 in shipping, South Korea has been fostering the maritime industry under the IMO’s international standards,” Lim said. For instance, South Korean shipbuilding companies benefited from the IMO’s new rule introducing double-hull requirements for oil tankers, as they received a great number of orders for new tankers. IMO is the source of approximately 60 legal instruments that guide the regulatory development of its member states to improve safety at sea, facilitate trade among seafaring states and protect the maritime environment. It also adopted some 1,800 resolutions. “I plan to expand South Korea’s role in the international maritime realm and foster the country’s global reputation and its economy,” Lim said.

According to the data on types of employment in 3,233 companies, nearly 39 percent of 4.6 million Korean workers at large companies were hired temporarily by the companies or outsourced recruitment firms.Of the total number of workers, 918,000 laborers, or 20 percent, were hired by outsourced firms and dispatched to conglomerates, mostly in the building and shipping industries.(Yonhap)Eight out of 10 Koreans were directly hired by companies, but 23 percent of them were on temporary contracts. There have been rising concerns over the working conditions for temporary workers hired by external human resources firms who are then sent to conglomerates’ factories or construction sites. Labor circles have pointed out that they provide the same amount of work as permanently hired employees, but are paid less, leading to widening income disparity.The management bloc, however, believes that a flexible labor market is necessary in Korea‘s export-driven economy to lower production costs and maintain competitive edge over their foreign competitors. According to the data, the larger-sized companies were more likely to “indirectly” hire workers through outsourced firms. The firms with more than 1,000 employees had 23 percent of their workers recruited by human resources firms while those with less than 1,000 employees had only 13.4 percent indirectly hired. By industry, the construction sector, especially shipping and steel companies, generated the most temporary jobs at 44.6 percent, followed by the art and sports industry at 27.1 percent, manufacturing industry at 25 percent and retail sector at 22.9 percent. “When conglomerates hire workers through human resources agencies or their suppliers, it gets easier for them to dodge responsibility to protect them at work,” said Park Sung-sik, a spokesperson for the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions. “The level of ‘indirect employment’ in the construction industry is associated with the high number of industrial accidents,” he added.Since last year, the Ministry of Employment and Labor made it mandatory for companies with more than 300 staff members to release the information on the number of their employees in both temporary and permanent positions. The move comes as part of efforts to encourage Korean companies to improve their hiring structure through peer assessment, the government said. But the Korea Employers Federation blasted the scheme for “fixing the image that temporary jobs are low-quality and should be reduced in number.” The organization also pointed out loopholes in the system that it claimed makes it impossible to fully evaluate the job situation here.

No additional deaths were reported Monday.The nation’s index MERS patient, who was officially diagnosed on May 20 after visiting three different hospitals prior to his diagnosis at the Samsung Medical Center in southern Seoul, was also released from the quarantine facility Monday. It is believed that he spread the virus to some 30 others. The 68-year-old is currently being treated at a general medical facility.  A health care worker at Hallym University Medical Center, one of MERS-affected hospitals in Seoul, is taking a break after caring for MERS patients on Monday. (Yonhap)While the outbreak is once again showing signs of losing steam -- only three cases have been reported from June 24 through Monday, while 13 cases had been confirmed from June 20-23 -- the government announced a set of new preventive measures to deal with infectious diseases in the future. The Health Ministry is to expand the coverage of national health insurance for patients with infectious diseases, as well as those who are required to be isolated with negative room pressure in hospitals. The cost of installing the negative room pressure system will also be covered by the state-run health insurance, said Kwon Deok-cheol, a senior official at the Health Ministry’s MERS response headquarters. Negative air pressure rooms require a quarantine technique that prevents cross-contamination from room to room in medical facilities. It requires using a special ventilation system that produces negative pressure to make sure air flows into the isolation room but does not escape from the room. The system is normally used to quarantine patients with airborne contagious diseases including tuberculosis, and has been used to isolate confirmed MERS patients in Korea since last month.“It costs a lot to install negative air pressure rooms, and it also costs a lot to maintain them in good condition,” said Kwon. “Through this MERS outbreak we’ve realized that there is a severe shortage of negative pressure rooms nationwide and many of the already-existing ones haven’t been maintained properly. Starting very soon, the cost of installing and maintaining the system will be covered by the health insurance.”Kwon also said that all hospitals soon will be required to separate their emergency care units and special properties for patients who need to be isolated. All medical facilities will also be regularly evaluated on their safety practices on patients with contagious diseases. Hospitals will earn incentives or penalties according to their evaluation results, Kwon said.“All of the new preventive measures are to be finalized and confirmed in July,” said Jeong Eun-kyung from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at the Health Ministry. “We plan to support MERS-affected hospitals that have been shut down first. We may allocate more budget to help more hospitals in the future.”Some 90 medical facilities nationwide, including the Samsung Medical Center, have been affected by the outbreak. Some hospitals are still being monitored as potential MERS patients remain in their incubation period. More cases may be identified from these facilities, authorities said. The incubation period for those who were exposed to the virus at Hallym University Medical Center in Seoul ends on July 6. The Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong, where about 90 patients with kidney diseases are currently being treated in isolation, will be monitored until July 10.  By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","the virus has killed 32 ,monday afternoon the virus ,afternoon the virus has killed ,16 billion won 14 million ,patients in korea since last","['South Korea', 'Korea', 'the Samsung Medical Center', 'Seoul', 'Hallym University Medical Center', 'Seoul', 'the Health Ministry', 'Kwon Deok - cheol', 'the Health Ministry ’s', 'Korea', 'Kwon', 'Kwon', 'Jeong Eun - kyung', 'the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at', 'the Health Ministry', 'the Samsung Medical Center', 'Hallym University Medical Center', 'Seoul', 'the Kyung Hee University Hospital', 'Claire Lee']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37801445  0.4250668

A part-time job portal Alba Cheonguk conducted a survey on 1,437 part-timers from May 12-19 to find out whether employers offered working environments in accordance with the Labor Standards Act.  A trade union for part-timers hold a placard reading ""Part-timers are also laborers."" (Yonhap)Korean labor law requires all employers, regardless of their size, to distribute a contract to their employees for both parties to fill in. The contract stipulates wages, working hours and holiday arrangements, among other things. According to the survey, 53.5 percent of the respondents did not sign a written contract when they started their part-time jobs, with most of them just verbally agreeing to working conditions. Of them, 65.4 percent said that they did not sign a contract because their employers did not bring up the issue while 18.9 percent found it unnecessary and 15.2 percent were not aware of their duty to write a contract before offering their labor. Ha Ji-won, 21, was a temporary worker who only made a verbal contract before starting a job at a convenience store in Seoul. “My boss made no mention of signing a contract when I was hired,” said Ha, a university student in Seoul. “She just verbally and vaguely informed me of working hours, hourly pay.” “When I asked my employer whether I can sign a written contract, she seemed very upset.” Another poll of 597 companies by Alba Cheonguk from May 20-27 shed light on employers’ lack of awareness about settling working conditions in written form when hiring temporary workers. Only 47.6 percent of the companies said they should and would sign a contract, with nearly 49 percent being unwilling to do so. Nearly 4 percent of the business operators did not even know that they had a legal obligation to write a contract. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","hiring temporary workers only 47 ,monday part time job portal ,part time workers in korea ,korean labor law requires all ,another poll of 597 companies","['Korea', 'Alba Cheonguk', 'ha Ji - won', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Alba Cheonguk']",12,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4419876   0.52722579

(Ock Hyun-ju/The Korea Herald)As the final event of celebration for sexual minorities kicked off at 11:00 a.m., thousands of sexual minorities and spectators flocked to the Seoul Plaza where nearly 90 gay rights groups, embassies and global companies set up their booths to campaign for equal rights. Mark Lippert, the U.S. ambassador to Korea, also visited Seoul Plaza to look around the booths, take pictures and send a supportive message for the festival organization.The day’s festivities began at around 3:00 p.m. with a performance of a man in a black glitzy costume dancing to Madonna’s signature song “Like a Virgin.” Loud cheers erupted in the sea of people waving rainbow-colored fans. “We came here today to overcome and cure voices of hatred,” said Kang Myeong-jin, a leader of the festival organization committee in an opening speech. “Please help us to conclude the festival in a good manner.” Antigay groups hold placards that read ""Holy Korea"" and ""Homosexuality Out"" in Seoul Plaza, central Seoul, Sunday. (Ock Hyun-ju/The Korea Herald)Around the corner, hundreds of anti-LGBT campaigners, mostly right-wing and Protestant groups, beefed up their opposition against the event, with some calling for “Jesus,” singing gospels and holding up placards that read “homosexuality is against nature” from the early morning. They also set up a booth to collect signatures for a petition to outlaw homosexuality in Korea.Dozens of police buses were stationed around City Hall, with hundreds of police officers at the scene to prevent possible clashes between the LGBT groups and their opponents. A high school student Park So-young, who is lesbian, finally made her way to the parade for the first time after hesitating for several years due to her parents’ opposition against her sexuality. “I hesitated to come here at first, but I feel more confident to show my true self here after seeing many people like me and those who support gays,” said the 18-year-old, who was met with hostility and had to drop out of middle school after coming out at the age of 14. Park said that she felt sad about the antigay groups, pointing out that there is still a lot of work to be done to raise awareness on sexual minorities in the country.LGBT rights activists march forward holding a banner that read ""Seoul Against Homophobia"" at the pride parade in central Seoul, Sunday. (Ock Hyun-ju/The Korea Herald)The big day for the local LGBT community and its advocates was made even bigger with the Friday ruling in the U.S. that legalizes same-sex marriage across the nation.“The U.S. ruling indicates that countries around the world are slowly becoming more accepting of homosexuality,” she said, echoing hope for a change in Korea, too. Steve, an Irish national, who only wanted to be identified by his first name, said he came all the way from Chungcheong Province to celebrate Friday’s “monumental” ruling together with others in the gay pride parade. “The U.S. ruling is monumental because it means that gays are now more accepted in the world. I feel like it is an end of a battle for gay rights,” said the 25-year-old English teacher. But in Korean society Steve still feels “invisible,” as he still remains a “straight” guy at work out of fear for how Koreans would react to his sexual identity. “I am afraid to come out because there seem to be no regulations that can stop people from despising and discriminating against gays.” Marchers wave rainbow-colored flags at the pride parade in central Seoul, Sunday. (Ock Hyun-ju/The Korea Herald)The festival organization committee also tightened security for the event by issuing permits to take pictures at the scene only after checking ID cards. It also did not reveal the route for the Sunday parade until the last minute, citing the possibility of antigay protestors blocking its march forward. The pride parade faced a series of challenges before finally being staged Sunday afternoon, as antigay organizations attempted to prevent the parade from taking place.Christian groups began booking out the likely venues for the parade in May. They also camped out in front of Namdaemun Police Station to block the parade organizers from applying for a necessary permit to hold the event in central Seoul. When the Queer Cultural Festival opened on June 9, the festival participants were outnumbered at the event venue by protesters holding signs with slogans like “Stop Same-Sex Marriage” and “Gays Out: Homosexuals have no human rights.”At the height of the Middle East respiratory syndrome scare, the organizers admitted only 50 staff members to the opening show, urging others to follow by live broadcast on YouTube.  After the two-hour opening ceremony, thousands of participants started to march through central Seoul at around 5 p.m. in what organizers called “Korea‘s biggest pride parade in history.” Marchers follow a decorated truck carrying dancers and banners reading “Solidarity under the rainbow” in central Seoul, Sunday. (Ock Hyun-ju/The Korea Herald)The marchers followed dozens of decorated trucks carrying performers and banners reading “Marriage Equality” and “Solidarity under the Rainbow,” waving rainbow-colored banners, dancing and singing along to mostly K-pop music. They often confronted antigay campaigners who stood on the sidewalks of major streets shouting at marchers and holding placards that read “You are born by a mother and father,” “Come back to your beautiful family” and “Repent. Homosexuality is sin.” Antigay campaigners holds placards on a sidewalk, with dozens of police officers stationed in central Seoul, Sunday. (Ock Hyun-ju/The Korea Herald)The paraders cheered and shouted “We love you” in the faces of their opponents.One of the Christian groups tried to block the march by parking a bus on the route, but the police soon ordered the vehicle’s removal. The parade continued smoothly without major clashes. The police estimated about 6,000 people took part in the hour-long parade, but organizers said the number may have topped 20,000.Organizers said this year’s pride parade carries greater meaning as it marks the first time the parade was held in the heart of Seoul.

The Health Ministry said a 26-year-old doctor caught the virus while treating the 135th patient -- an emergency worker who was infected while taking a MERS patient to the hospital.   Park Chang-il, director of Konyang University Hospital in Daejeon, hugs the medical staff after the hospital reopened Friday. (Yonhap)As of Friday afternoon, one additional case and two more deaths were reported, bringing the total confirmed cases to 181 with 31 deaths. The fatality rate reached 17.1 percent. Of the infected, 35 patients are hospital-related workers, accounting for nearly 20 percent of the total cases. Four of them are SMC doctors, the authorities said. The ministry said that further spread by the latest confirmed patient is unlikely as the doctor has been isolated since June 17. The insufficient protective measures for medical staff is suspected to be the cause, they said.“Until June 17, the protective clothing of SMC staff had apparently been insufficient. The ministry has reinforced the measures since then,” the quarantine officials said. While the government has recommended the medical facilities to provide D-level protective equipment for medical staff, SMC only provided protective clothing called VRE -- which leaves the neck and ankles exposed -- until June 17, they added. As more and more medical staff are being exposed to the virus while treating the MERS patients, fresh concerns are growing over staff shortage at MERS-hit medical facilities. At a public hospital in Gangneung, Gangwon Province, 18 staff have been quarantined and 39 other workers are in self-isolation after a nurse was confirmed with MERS. Meanwhile, the 10th MERS patient who was being treated in China has fully recovered and left the hospital, the Health Ministry said. The 44-year-old caught the virus last month from his father who was infected from the very first MERS patient at a local hospital. Being unaware of his symptoms, he left for Guangzhou on a business trip via Hong Kong on May 26. Three days later, he was diagnosed with MERS and hospitalized. The patient’s medical cost was shouldered by the Chinese government, the authorities said. The Korean government has also covered the treatment cost for a Chinese who was infected here. The returning date of the Korean patient will be kept confidential, citing privacy, they added. Also, two MERS-hit hospitals in Daejeon were cleared from the cohort isolation measures earlier in the day, the city said. More than 75 patients and medical staff have been isolated in each hospital since June 5 after several cases were confirmed at the medical facilities.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","old doctor caught the virus ,after the hospital reopened friday ,caught the virus last month ,doctor caught the virus while ,virus health officials said friday","['another Samsung Medical Center', 'the Health Ministry', 'Park Chang - il', 'Konyang University Hospital', 'Daejeon', 'Yonhap)As', 'SMC', 'SMC', 'SMC', 'VRE', 'Gangneung', 'Gangwon Province', 'China', 'the Health Ministry', 'Guangzhou', 'Hong Kong', 'chinese', 'korean', 'Chinese', 'korean', 'Daejeon', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57559013  0.60754162

Her death was one of two reported by Seoul on Thursday, raising the nation’s death toll to 29 and the fatality rate of the disease to 16.1 percent. Health authorities also confirmed one new case at a Busan-based hospital, bringing the total number of MERS cases to 180.The late caregiver -- the nation’s 173rd MERS case -- is believed to have been exposed to the virus on June 5, when she accompanied her client to Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong in Seoul, where the 76th MERS patient was staying at the time. The 70-year-old, however, had never been informed about the exposure by the authorities, and therefore was never put under quarantine. Health care workers carry a suspected MERS patient at the Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong in Seoul on Thursday. (Yonhap)She started experiencing MERS symptoms on June 10, and visited a number of medical facilities in Gangdong district of Seoul, including am otolaryngology clinic, before she was hospitalized at the Hallym University Medical Center in Seoul on June 18. By that time, she had already developed pneumonia, a disease that can seriously deteriorate a MERS patient’s condition.She was eventually admitted to the hospital’s intensive care unit on June 20, and was officially diagnosed with MERS on June 22. She died on Wednesday, just two days after she learned of her MERS infection. Critics say the late caregiver could have been able to recover from the disease if she had been diagnosed earlier, especially since she did not have any preexisting medical conditions. Margaret Chan, the director-general of World Health Organization, stressed the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of MERS last week. “It is important for us to know that early treatment, you know, present yourself early during illness, would give you a better chance and better prospect for survival,” she told reporters in Seoul. The Health Ministry explained that the late patient’s client, who was treated at Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong’s emergency unit on June 5, did not report her caregiver’s visit to the facility to authorities. “Because the client never told us, she didn’t learn about the late patients’ existence until later,” said Jeong Eun-kyung from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at the Health Ministry. “The client said she didn’t say anything about who accompanied her to the hospital, because she ‘simply assumed her caregiver would be all right as she had always been healthy.’ We acknowledge that we should have handled the particular situation earlier, but such circumstances made it difficult.”In order to prevent such cases from happening again, the Health Ministry said it will make it mandatory for medical facilities to keep a record of all visitors to their emergency care units, including those who accompany the patients, starting Thursday. Authorities predict that some 2,135 people may have been exposed to the virus as the 173rd patient visited numerous medical facilities while showing MERS symptoms before being hospitalized. They are urging those who visited the Hallym University Medical Center in Seoul from May 17-22, Mok Cha-su internal medicine clinic (223 Sangil-dong, Gangdong-gu, Seoul) from June 10-11, Bon otolaryngology clinic (391 Godeok-ro, Gangdong-gu, Seoul) on June 15 and Gangdong neurosurgery clinic (45-24 Myeongil-dong Gangdong-gu, Seoul) on June 16 to let their doctors know that they may have been exposed to the virus should they seek medical help for any symptoms or diseases.The individuals are also asked to report to the authorities immediately should they experience MERS-like symptoms, including a high fever, coughing or shortness of breath, by calling 120 or contacting the nearest public health center.As of Thursday afternoon, 77 patients were being treated at hospitals, while 15 of them were in unstable condition. Seven more people had been discharged from medical facilities on the same day, raising the number of recovered patients to 74. Some 90 hospitals nationwide have been affected by the outbreak. Among the 180 confirmed patients, 34 of them are health care workers, 64 are those who visited inpatients in medical facilities and 82 are those who were exposed to the virus while being treated for their preexisting medical conditions at hospitals.

Executing the most mundane task of giving the children an allowance is becoming more of a feat each day.(Yonhap)Kim is one of the estimated 5 million low-wage workers who have been pleading for a drastic hike in the minimum wage next year to receive “what they deserve” for their labor. According to government statistics, 1 in 4 wage workers in Korea is “working poor,” suffering from in-work poverty, with 2 million of them being paid less than the minimum wage.Korea joins the legion of economies that toils in the recurrent debate over the efficacy of minimum wage in encouraging low-wage workers to become self-sufficient.Business leaders and economists here view it as an obstacle to economic recovery, while unionized workers see it as a key to economic growth. The Korea Employers Federation has argued that the minimum wage has risen too rapidly and it needs to be stabilized, voicing concerns over possible job losses. On the other hand, the nation’s largest trade unions ― the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions and Federation of Korean Trade Unions ― have maintained that the hike would tackle the nation’s income inequality and spur consumer spending.Since the government adopted the minimum wage in 1989, the Minimum Wage Council, a trilateral committee of labor experts, employees and employers, has set the minimum wage through discussion. This year, the discussion began on June 2 to decide the minimum wage for next year with an aim to reach a conclusion by June 29. After the committee turns in its consensus proposal, the government will officially make the rate public in August. But the labor circle and business bloc have continued to clash over the extent of the increase, casting a shadow over the passage of the proposal for next year’s minimum wage within a legal deadline. The labor unions have demanded a 79 percent rise from the current minimum wage at 5,580 won to 10,000 won, while employers have campaigned for a freeze.“The higher minimum wage is necessary to narrow the income gap and guarantee a basic standard of living for low-wage workers, which is also key to boosting the domestic economy,” the Federation of Korean Trade Unions said in a press release, calling on the business leaders to withdraw its proposal for a freeze. The union claimed that companies have unfairly benefited from the low minimum wage, citing that household income only increased by 5.7 percent on average when companies’ profits rose by an average of 9.8 percent from 2001-2013. Yi Jung-ah, a researcher at local socioeconomic think tank Institute For New Society, also backed the claims. “The pay raise will lead to economic growth in the long run by giving the low-income workers purchasing power as Korea’s growth model is wage-led, not profit-led,” Yi told The Korea Herald, citing a report by the International Labor Office released in 2012. In the report, the ILO categorized Korea’s economy as a wage-led growth model, meaning that it is more efficient for Korea to drive economic growth by raising workers’ wages rather than helping companies make profits. “Through research, I found that the poor tend to spend rather than save when they get extra money,” Yi said. “This means that the minimum wage increase could be the most powerful way to spur domestic spending here.” The increase can also prompt the employers to reduce working hours per person, which could create more jobs in the market, she added. But the employers association has protested the unionized workers’ proposal, saying that such drastic increase in the minimum wage could pose a formidable threat to small and medium-sized enterprises that are already faltering amid prolonged economic downturn. “The labor unions’ suggestion of a 70 percent jump in the minimum wage is unrealistic,” So Han-sub, an official from the Korea Federation of SMEs, told The Korea Herald. “The government has already raised the minimum wage too much and too quickly for the past decade, despite worsening business conditions, taking a toll on employers.” he said.The minimum wage has risen by an average of 8.8 percent from 1,865 won in 2001 to 5,580 won this year, with inflation increasing by 2.9 percent during the same period. “Labor is the biggest cost for small and medium-sized employers,” he said. “If all the companies go bankrupt (due to the wage hike), where would workers find a job?”According to a survey of 429 SMEs by Korea Employers Federation and Korea Federation of SMEs, more than half of the companies responded that they would lay off workers or not recruit new employees if the minimum wage were to increase. The surveyed companies also responded that 67.3 percent of their employees take home more than 1.6 million won per month, including bonuses and overtime pay, nearly 50 percent more than the monthly minimum wage. Choi Chang-kyu, an economics professor at Myeongji University, also thinks that the raised minimum wage has deterred companies from creating new jobs due to growing costs, resulting in fewer jobs for the young. “The shortage of jobs for the young is partially due to the constantly raised minimum wage,” Choi told The Korea Herald. “When the government intervenes in the labor market and sets the minimum wage higher than the market demands, the labor market stops the young from entering the labor force.”The unemployment rate for the young stood at 9.3 percent in May, significantly higher than the overall rate of 3.8 percent.Putting aside the effect of a pay raise on the domestic economy, another focal point in the wrangling between the labor and business bloc is whether to cover living costs of laborers’ families in the minimum wage. “It is not realistic for workers to live on the minimum wage in Korea while supporting their families,” Kim Jong-jin, a researcher for Korea Labor & Society Institute, told The Korea Herald. “The minimum wage is a part of social welfare policy to tackle income disparity and ensure a basic living standard for the marginalized,” Kim said, opposing employers’ perception that workers should be paid in accordance with the amount of work they put in. According to OECD data, a Korean single parent with two children at a minimum wage job in 2013 would need to work 58 hours a week to earn 50 percent of the median household income in Korea and get above the poverty line. The 58 hours ranks as the third most, behind the Czech Republic and Greece, among 25 OECD countries that have adopted the minimum wage system. Based on the data, the labor unions have claimed that the current minimum wage is far lower than the amount of money needed to support a family. The current minimum wage, which translates to 44,640 won a day and 1.16 million won a month for those who work eight hours a day, makes up 70 percent of the actual living expenses for a single household and only 32 percent of the living wages for a three-member household, according to labor unions. This means that it is “impossible” for one person in family to support the rest of its members, they said. But economics professor Choi noted that raising living conditions for workers and distributing wealth is the government’s job to do, not that of companies. “The government appears to pass the responsibility to take care of Koreans on to companies,” Choi said. “Rather than putting the burden on employers, the government should encourage them to create more jobs and put more people back to work.”While the management and labor circle are bickering over the extent of the wage hike, more focus should be on the social and economic structures that distress SMEs in the first place, the researcher Kim pointed out. “Beyond discussing how much to raise in the minimum wage, we should think about why SMEs are under pressure to keep their costs to a minimum in the first place,” Kim said. “It is not the minimum wage spike that puts a strain on small companies,” he said. “It is the unfair business practices between conglomerates and themselves that threaten their businesses.”Despite the government’s pledge to curb family-owned conglomerates’ power and foster smaller businesses, large companies have been accused of exploiting SMEs, which are often their suppliers, by cutting costs or pushing them out of business with their economies of scale. Kim Dong-kyu, an owner of cafe Bom Bom in southwestern Seoul, agreed. “In the short term, it could be difficult for us to cope with the rising costs to hire part-timers, but in the long term, I also think that the minimum wage should increase,” Kim told The Korea Herald. “What we (small businesses) fear more than the minimum wage increase is conglomerates who are expanding their businesses into every street, threatening small and independent shops,” he said. But behind the intensifying feud over how much to raise the minimum wage may be a more systematic problem: a lack of legal institution that allows the management and labor circles to “reasonably” discuss the issue. “The dispute over the minimum wage between laborers and business leaders repeats every year, with labor unions going as far as to stage strikes and protests,” Park Ji-soon, professor at Korea University Law School, told The Korea Herald. For the same statistics and data, the labor and business bloc have used different measurement methods, which often result in different understandings of the status of the current minimum wage in global rankings and the effects the wage hike would have on the local economy. “There should be a more systematic framework and common indicators to be used when setting the minimum wage,” Park said. “Such an important policy for the public good should not be a subject of political bargaining.”By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","single mother raising two teenage ,million won 400 per month ,mother raising two teenage sons ,largest trade unions the korean ,overtime pay nearly 50 percent","['Kim Ok - joo', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'the Korea Employers Federation', 'the korean Confederation of Trade Unions', 'Federation of Korean Trade Unions', 'the Minimum Wage Council', 'the Federation of Korean Trade Unions', 'Yi Jung - ah', 'Institute for New Society', 'Korea', 'Yi', 'the Korea Herald', 'the International Labor Office', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Han', 'the Korea Federation', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea Employers Federation', 'Korea Federation', 'Choi Chang - kyu', 'Myeongji University', 'Choi', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea', 'Kim Jong - jin', 'Korea Labor & Society Institute', 'the Korea Herald', 'Kim', 'OECD', 'korean', 'Korea', 'the Czech Republic', 'Greece', 'OECD', 'Choi', 'Koreans', 'Choi', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim Dong - kyu', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'the Korea Herald', 'Park Ji - soon', 'Korea University Law School', 'the Korea Herald', 'Park', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52767193  0.09817675

Women, white-collar workers and those in their 30s tended to feel less safe. More than 80 percent of the residents worried that their life cycle-related problems would increase in the future, while 81.4 percent said they were concerned about risks associated with their career and 70.1 percent were worried about the economy. Multiple responses were allowed in the survey. About 40 percent said they experienced anxiety in their daily life. Female workers, unemployed youth and senior citizens showed a tendency to particularly feel unstable about their life because of fast-changing living trends amid rising unemployment and elderly population rates, researchers said. The majority, or 88 percent of the surveyed, responded that they are exposed to information related to dangers from the media, followed by the Internet with 65.9 percent.About 45 percent of the respondents trusted information from experts, while less than 20 percent said the government’s information was credible.Recovering social trust is key to relieving public anxiety, researchers said. “Participative communication is necessary to boost the public trust. To resolve social conflicts, people need to reduce unnecessary misunderstandings with two-way communication,” they said. “To do so, individuals’ active participation is necessary.” The survey was conducted on 800 adults in the capital both online and off-line.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","dangerous women white collar workers ,half of seoul city residents ,rising unemployment and elderly population ,lot more dangerous women white ,percent of the residents worried","['Seoul City', 'the Seoul Institute', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",11,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.92298162  0.17962344

Both the mother, who was told of her full recovery from MERS on Tuesday, and her baby are doing well, they added.The 39-year-old is the world’s first MERS patient to have given birth to a healthy child, while also having recovered from the virus at the same time. The woman became Korea’s 109th MERS patient on June 11. Meanwhile, Seoul reported three more MERS cases Tuesday, bringing the number of confirmed patients to 175. However, no death was reported on the same day, while four more people have recovered and been discharged from hospitals. One of the four recovered individuals is the 14th patient, who is believed to have infected some 80 people while staying at Samsung Medical Center. As of Tuesday afternoon, Korea’s MERS fatality rate remained 15.4 percent. The woman, who was an inpatient at Samsung Medical Center in Seoul, was exposed to the virus while visiting her mother, who was admitted to the same hospital’s emergency center on May 27 for acute indigestion. At the time, the nation’s 14th MERS patient, who is considered a “superspreader,” was staying at the hospital’s emergency unit. Her father also accompanied the woman’s visit to the emergency unit. A patient and her daughter reunite 14 days after the intensive care unit of Eulji University Hospital in Daejeon was put on cohort isolation upon the death of a MERS patient. The unit was released from isolation Tuesday. (Yonhap)While pregnant, she became one of 85 people who were infected with MERS at the hospital, along with both her mother and father. Since her diagnosis on June 11, she had been staying at the hospital while being treated for her MERS symptoms, mainly mild muscle pain. According to Samsung Medical Center, she had already been asymptomatic since Monday, the day before she gave birth. According to Dr. Kim Jong-hwa, who performed the woman’s cesarean section, the woman had been preparing for a natural delivery, but had to undergo the procedure not because of MERS but as she abruptly developed a pregnancy complication. Her condition, placental abruption, happens when the placenta starts to come away from the inner wall of the uterus prior to delivery. All of the health care professionals who participated in the procedure wore protective gear to prevent any possibility of infection. Right after the delivery, the baby was tested for MERS infection and the results came out negative. On the same day, the mother was officially told that she had made a full recovery from MERS.“We are just very happy that both the mother and the baby are healthy,” said Dr. Kim in a statement.As of Tuesday afternoon, 54 people have recovered from MERS, while 27 have died. A total of 94 individuals are currently being treated under quarantine. Among them, 16 are in unstable condition.The number of those who are quarantined for possible infection dropped to 2,805 from 3,833 the day before. The Health Ministry said those who are quarantined at home are now banned from taking domestic flights on top of going overseas to prevent the spread of the outbreak. The ministry is also allowing health care workers at a number of hospitals to treat their outpatients by telephone. The facilities include Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong in Seoul and Asan Chungmu Hospital in Cheonan, Chungcheong Province. “This is only a temporary measure as these hospitals are currently banned from receiving outpatients,” said Kwon Deok-cheol from the Health Ministry. “No telephone treatments will be allowed once these hospitals go back to normal and start to receive outpatients as usual.”Kwon also confirmed that the 173rd patient, a 70-year-old caregiver, visited three different medical clinics before being hospitalized at the Hallym University Medical Center in Seoul, where she was eventually diagnosed with MERS.The three facilities are Bon otolaryngology clinic (391 Godeok-ro, Gangdong-gu, Seoul), Gangdong neurosurgery clinic (345-24 Myeongil-dong Gangdong-gu, Seoul) and Mok Cha-su internal medicine clinic (223 Sangil-dong, Gangdong-gu, Seoul). Those who visited Mok Cha-su internal medicine clinic from June 10-11, Bon otolaryngology clinic on June 15 or Gangdong neurosurgery clinic on June 16 are asked to let their doctors know that they may have been exposed to the virus should they seek medical help for any symptoms or diseases.To prevent possible infection, the Hallym University Medical Center also has been banned from performing any surgical procedures, as well as from receiving new patients and visitors.

Jo Kum-hyang and Rim Sol stepped into the limelight in November after respectively carrying out a solo take-off and landing exercise with the subsonic MiG-15 chasers, prompting the young ruler to laud them as “phoenixes,” the media said.Kim called for the cultivation of female aviators during a pilot rally in Pyongyang in April 2014, a rare directive in the extremely male-centered society. He had since instructed his aides to teach Jo and Rim the skills to fly hypersonic jets. Observing their operation of the MiG-21, a Russian fighter with a speed of around Mach 2.0, Kim expressed delight, calling them “flowers of the sky.”  North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is seen congratulating and posing for photos with the regime’s first female pilots of supersonic jets during flight training. (Yonhap)“They conducted their first solo flight (of the supersonic jet) readily and neatly despite unexpected circumstances,” the official Korea Central News Agency said, without elaborating. “(Kim) referred to them as a mirror and example that practically showed how all the soldiers follow through on the party’s training guidelines.” The communist country’s female air wing was reportedly launched in 1993, but most of its members have been flying old, propeller-powered aircraft. Among the executives who accompanied the leader were Hwang Pyong-so, director of the Korean People’s Army’s general political bureau, and O Kum-chol, vice chief of the KPA general staff, the agency noted.

Pyongyang announced the decision late Friday via email under the name of Jon Kuk-man, chairman of its university sports association. It had planned to dispatch 75 athletes and 33 officials to the competition set for a 12-day run from July 3. “The letter cited political reasons resulting from the establishment of the U.N. human rights office in Seoul,” Kim Yoon-suk, secretary-general of the steering committee, said at a news conference. “We’re working to verify the true intentions behind the email in cooperation with the Unification Ministry. … It is still premature to conclude that North Korea’s pullout has been confirmed.” Yoon Jang-hyun, mayor of Gwangju and president of the panel, expressed regret but expressed his hope of a possible turnaround in Pyongyang’s decision. “With an open mind, we will hope for and request North Korea’s participation until the last minute.” The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights is scheduled to open the field structure here on Tuesday to monitor and document the oppressive regime’s rampant rights breaches in line with a recommendation in February 2014 by the Commission of Inquiry. The project has incurred the wrath of the Kim Jong-un regime as the COI’s landmark report brought global attention to the issue to a new height. In its wake, the U.N. Security Council formally set North Korea’s dismal human rights situation as a standalone item on its agenda for the first time last year, paving the way to bring perpetrators including the young ruler to justice. “Human rights is a universal value, and it should not be a problem to host an office of international organizations such as one for human rights,” ministry spokesman Lim Byeong-cheol said at a press briefing. Even in times of heightened tension, sports events have long set the rare stage for inter-Korean people-to-people exchanges, especially given Kim’s widely reported affection for them. The communist neighbor also took part in the Daegu Universiade in 2003, and the Asian Games in 2002 in Busan and 2014 in Incheon.Pyongyang’s latest announcement marks yet another setback to Seoul’s efforts to break the long-festering cross-border standoff and bring about a thaw as the two Koreas celebrate the 70th anniversary of the peninsula’s liberation from Japanese colonial rule this year. Under its initial plan unveiled in March, North Korea sought to compete in athletics, diving, artistic gymnastics, rhythmic gymnastics, table tennis, judo, women’s football and handball. But the outlook for its participation had grown murky in recent weeks after it repeatedly missed the deadlines for formal registration. The regime’s about-face is also likely to set a hurdle for the competition because some events such as women’s football and handball may have to redraw lots.

Among the 10 medical facilities, six of them were large hospitals that housed more than 800 beds for patients. The largest number of the surveyed nurses -– 73 of them -– were infected with tuberculosis while serving in emergency rooms, while 60 of them were infected with influenza. A total of 43 of them were infected with chicken pox and 41 with acute viral hepatitis. Three nurses were infected with AIDS while working in emergency care. More than 65 percent of the surveyed nurses said their hospitals aren’t equipped with an adequate stock of sterilization equipment, and that it was not always easy to grab their safety gear as it was often placed too far away from where they were working. “It turned out that the nurses don’t wear their safety gear -- including goggles and protective apparel -- the most in emergency situations, especially when they are placing their patients on ventilators or inserting tubes into a patient’s airways,” said professor Kim in her scholarly article. “It is critical to repeatedly educate health care workers on their safety protocol, and all of them should be given full access to protective gear.”As of Monday, 33 health care workers, including doctors and nurses, had been infected with MERS-CoV. They account for 19.2 percent of all 172 confirmed patients in the country.

Pyongyang's total fertility rate, which stood at 2.3 in 1990, has slipped to 2 in 2010, while it has also become an aging society since 2004 where more than 7 percent of the population is aged over 65, according to the report by the Bank of Korea.The statistics used for the report were based on the United Nations' World Population Prospects, which estimates the population of countries in the 1950-2100 period.The report noted that while the North's population is aging at a relatively slower clip compared with the South, the pace is still roughly 10 years faster than developing countries.The report, meanwhile, projected the integration of the two Koreas to possibly delay aging in the two countries. The two Koreas are likely to become an aged society, where more than 14 percent of the population is aged 65 or older, in 2022 if they are integrated, whereas the period will come in 2018 for South Korea if the two countries remain separated.

Since the authorities confirmed the first case of a patient with the virus on May 20, the nation has fallen into a deeper state of panic with each passing day, pushing the people to change their life patterns to best prepare themselves for the worst-case scenario ― the virus being transmitted to the general community.From school buses filled with children and teachers donning masks, to empty streets in the evenings with many grown-ups canceling dinner gatherings in order to return home as soon as possible, a growing number of South Koreans are fast adapting themselves to a new environment. Washing hands frequently and avoiding the public areas as much as possible have become a “must” daily ritual for many, not just because of the government’s repeated guideline but also because of people’s voluntary sense of self-protection raised to block the virus’ spread.The most affected area of society is the nation’s medical sector, with people refraining to visit if not suffering from life-threatening illnesses.  A woman walks on a street in Myeong-dong, a popular area for both local shoppers and foreign tourists, in central Seoul, Saturday. (Yonhap)After it was announced that nearly all MERS-confirmed patients were found to have caught the virus at medical facilities, non-MERS patients who need to see doctors on a regular basis refuse to visit the medical facilities. “My mom hasn’t seen the doctor since MERS hit the country, although she really needs to go for her kidney problem. She says she won’t go until the government officially announces that the virus is subsiding,” said 28-year-old office worker Yoon Hee-sik. “Some have joked that there will be more deaths from avoiding doctors than by MERS.” Both small and large hospitals have seen a drop in outpatient visits, regardless of whether they were hit by MERS. “Our number of patients fell by 20 percent in a month. No matter how much effort we put into cleaning and sterilization measures, they just do not visit,” said an oriental medical doctor in the capital who wished to remain anonymous. Many tended to avoid wedding ceremonies, especially who raise toddlers or are pregnant, citing the virus concerns. If necessary, some show up in protective masks. “Although I’m worried about the virus, I couldn’t miss my sister’s wedding this weekend. So I wore a mask throughout the whole ceremony,” said Jeong Eun-young, who is seven months pregnant. Other business sectors have also suffered from the aftermath of MERS.According to a survey conducted on some 650 restaurants by the Korea Food Service Industry Management Institute, average sales in early June plummeted by nearly 40 percent compared to before the MERS crisis.“Group reservations sharply dropped. The main source of my business is group dinners but many regular customers have canceled,” said a 29-year-old surnamed Song, who owns a restaurant in Gangnam, Seoul. As people tend to call off group dinner plans, the number of drunk driving accidents has also dropped. According to data by the National Police Agency, the number of drunk driving accidents fell to about 600 cases in the first half of this month, down 41 percent than the same period last year. The police have suspended drunk driving crackdowns near MERS-hit hospitals as part of its efforts to support virus-containment work. “Even without crackdowns conducted in June, the drunk driving accident rate dropped, which indicates that the public concerns over MERS is serious,” said Rep. You Dae-woon of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy. On the other hand, the food delivery business has seen a sharp rise in sales. According to the food delivery application Baedal Minjok, the number of app users surged by 23 percent on June 13-14 compared to two weeks ago. The tourism industry, which was firstly hit by MERS, still faces difficulties. Jejudo Island was most recently hit, after the 141st MERS patient was found to have toured the island despite having some symptoms. While the quarantine authorities immediately isolated those who closely contacted the patient, and took preventive measures, public concerns remained. The number of Jejudo tourists on June 19-20 declined by 13 percent compared to last year, according to the Jeju Special Self-Governing Provincial Tourism Association. The flight booking rate between Seoul and Jejudo halved while the accommodation reservation rate plummeted by 40 to 50 percent, it added.The overall tourism industry, however, is seeing a gradual recovery. The growth in travel cancellations to Seoul is reportedly slowing as the virus outbreak subsides. According to the state-run Korea Tourism Organization, about 1,800 foreign travelers called off their trips to South Korea on Friday, only up 1.43 percent from that of the previous day. The figure is lower than the number of cancellations Wednesday, which exceeded 3,700, rising by 3.15 percent from the day before. From June 1-18, a total of 123,390 foreign travelers canceled their trips, with the majority from China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. While the KTO said that the foreign tourists who booked flights in July and August seem to be cautiously watching the situation in Korea, it projected that the number of tourists could tumble by up to 30 percent this month.

In her eyes, sexual minorities’ rights in Korea are largely undermined, attacked by Korean political leaders whose concerns are mainly conservative Christian groups that give them votes. “Sexual minorities do not matter for them,” Woo said. On May 29, the festival committee applied for a permit to hold a gay pride parade scheduled for June 28 at Seoul Plaza, central Seoul. The next day, the police rejected its application, citing traffic disruptions and possible clashes with opponents during the parade. But the Seoul Administrative Court on Tuesday ruled in favor of the LGBT activists, invalidating the police ban on the pride parade, a decision that drew fierce protests from anti-gay groups. “Assemblies can be prohibited only when they pose a direct and clear threat to public order,” the court said in the ruling. “Banning assemblies should be used as a last resort when there are no options left.”The LGBT activists, which had denounced the police decision as “politically motivated,” welcomed the court ruling. “The ruling carries a lot of weight, meaning that sexual minorities should also be able to voice their opinions in our society as members of a democratic country,” the Korea Queer Festival Organization Committee said in a press release. Chang Suh-yeon, an attorney for Lawyers for a Democratic Society, also viewed the court ruling as a decision to respect minorities’ rights to be free and fairly treated, noting that the ban did not have legal basis in the first place. “The police law allows them to restrict a right to stage a parade, citing traffic disruption, but the upper law, the constitution, stipulates that a right to demonstrate must be protected, especially when demonstrations are held peacefully,” Chang told The Korea Herald.(Left photo) Participants attend the opening ceremony of the Korea Queer Festival 2015 at Seoul Plaza in downtown Seoul on June 9, holding up cards that say “We become stronger as we connect.” Protesters, meanwhile, hold a rally opposing the event in front of Deoksugung Palace near the plaza earlier in the day. (Yonhap)However, anti-LGBT groups, mainly conservative and Protestant groups, expressed their disappointment about the ruling. The Korean Association of Church Communication said in a press release that allowing such a large-scale parade in Seoul would expose the public to Middle East respiratory syndrome. With the virus engulfing the nation, Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon should cancel the event, considering “public sentiment” and “common sense,” it said. Christian groups booked out the likely venues for the parade, which LGBT groups see as a tactic to stop the event. They also camped out in front of Namdaemun Police Station to block the parade organizers from applying for a necessary permit. When the Queer Cultural Festival opened on June 9, anti-gay groups staged protests alongside the festival participants, holding signs with slogans like “Stop Same-Sex Marriage” and “Gays Out: Homosexuals have no human rights.”Last year, Christian activists disrupted the parade held in Sinchon, northwestern Seoul, by lying down in the street.The main reasons behind their vocal opposition were “social costs” and “the Bible’s teachings.” “According to the Bible, homosexuality is a sin. It is morally and ethically wrong,” an official from the Korean Association of Church Communication told The Korea Herald. “But most of all, homosexuality could increase unnecessary social costs.”“Those who made a personally wrong choice should not put a burden on our society,” he said, adding that the government would end up spending more to support patients infected with AIDS. “And why do gays have to take to streets at the center of Seoul to be naked and show their sexual identity when there are kids and students watching them?” he added. Sexual minorities still live largely on the fringes of Korean society as the majority of Koreans remain intolerant of homosexuality, with a Gallup poll ranking Korea at 69th among 123 nations in terms of gay-friendly countries.According to a 2014 survey of some 2,000 Koreans aged 19 or older by the local think tank Asan Institute for Policy Studies, only 23.7 percent of respondents had little or no objection to gays, meaning that the majority of Korean adults still remain somewhat hostile to homosexuality. The intolerance was notable especially among those in their 50s and 60s, with only 13.8 percent and 7.1 percent tolerant of homosexuals, respectively.But the negative perception about gays will likely change over time with a generational shift as the survey showed that nearly half of those in their 20s were OK with homosexuals, up from 26.7 percent in 2010. Following the court ruling, the gay pride parade, the final event of celebration for sexual minorities, will take place as scheduled on June 28 in the center of Seoul. The sexual minorities and their supporters will march across central Seoul for about an hour, starting from Seoul Plaza. The organization expects that more than 30,000 people will participate in the event. “By holding the parade at Seoul Plaza, a space for all citizens, we hope to reach out to the public,” LGBT activist Woo said. “We don’t want to hide. We want to show to the world that we are also living as a member of this society.” By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","lgbt activists invalidating the police ,gay pride parade the final ,fierce protests from anti gay ,police barred the local lesbian ,june anti gay groups staged","['south korean', 'Seoul', 'Woo Ji - young', 'the Korea Queer Festival Organization Committee', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea', 'korean', 'christian', 'Seoul', 'the Seoul Administrative Court', 'lgbt', 'ban', 'LGBT', 'the Korea Queer Festival Organization Committee', 'Chang Suh - yeon', 'Lawyers for a Democratic Society', 'Chang', 'Korea', 'the Korea', 'Seoul', 'anti - lgbt', 'protestant', 'the Korean Association of Church Communication', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'christian', 'LGBT', 'Namdaemun Police Station', 'christian', 'Sinchon', 'Seoul', 'the Korean Association of Church Communication', 'the Korea Herald', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'Koreans', 'Gallup', 'Korea', 'Koreans', 'Asan Institute for Policy Studies', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'LGBT', 'Woo', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36000037  0.31432116

The Sydney-headquartered Institute for Economics and Peace has since 2007 been gauging the peacefulness of 162 countries based on 23 qualitative and quantitative indicators on the level of safety and security in society, the extent of domestic and international conflict and the degree of militarization. In its ninth edition, South Korea saw its position up 10 notches from last year, reflecting a relative easing of cross-border tensions. North Korea was placed 153rd, among the bottom 10. Topping the list for the second straight year was Iceland, followed by Denmark, Austria, New Zealand and Switzerland. Japan was deemed the most peaceful nation in East Asia, ranking eighth, while the scores of China and some Southeast Asian countries declined due to their territorial brawls in the South China Sea. Of the total 162 countries, 81 have become more peaceful and 78 less. The most substantial changes in the index were recorded for the Middle East and North Africa on the back of an upsurge in violence related to sectarian strife and civil conflicts, as well as a rise of the Islamic State extremist group. “(The Asia-Pacific) contains the most diversity, with three countries in the top 10 and a single country, North Korea, in the bottom 10 of the overall rankings. The South China Sea remains a potential area for conflict, with countries involved in the dispute ― China, Vietnam and the Philippines ― all showing a worsening of their scores in the 2015 index,” the independent think tank said in the report. “The laggard of the region, North Korea, remains a concern for global peace with continued belligerence and isolation.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","10 notches from last year ,worldwide peace index released thursday ,korea was placed 153rd among ,ninth edition south korea saw ,ranked 42nd in worldwide peace","['South Korea', 'Institute for Economics', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Iceland', 'Denmark', 'Austria', 'New Zealand', 'Switzerland', 'Japan', 'China', 'southeast asian', 'North Africa', 'Islamic', 'North Korea', 'China', 'Vietnam', 'Philippines', 'North Korea', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.6266216   0.44558814

The benchmark index KOSPI dipped 0.7 percent on the day. Foreigners have snapped up nearly 10 trillion won of local shares this year, helping push up the local equity market. Market watchers expected foreigners may remain net sellers for a while as the U.S. Federal Reserve is on track to raise interest rates as early as September. ""The U.S. Fed could give a signal for an interest rate hike in September in the upcoming meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee,"" said Ji Ki-ho, a researcher at LIG Investment & Securities. Some pointed out that subdued hope for second-quarter earnings of major exporters lessens appeal of their equities. ""Foreign buying has recently declined as earnings estimates for the auto, IT, shipbuilding and transportation industries have inched down,"" said Kang Bong-joo, a researcher at Meritz Securities.

Crowded families of 5 to 10 people survive on rice porridge and onions each day. In late May, Jane Pearce, the country director of the United Nations World Food Program, visited the camp and went inside one family’s tent as part of her regular field trip.Jane Pearce, country director of the United Nations World Food Program. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)“The temperature inside was over 65 degrees Celsius, and obviously being distressed, they started yelling and complaining,” Pearce told The Korea Herald on Wednesday. “I tried to calm them down. I told them, ‘I will do everything I can to help. I am going to Korea, Japan, Australia and Belgium to ask for assistance.’” “Then they all stopped,” Pearce added. “The women grabbed and kissed me. Despite the misery in their lives, this is the spirit of the Iraqi people ― warm, strong, resilient and proud.”Pearce came to Korea last week to raise awareness of the humanitarian crises in Iraq, and raise funds from the Korean government. The U.N. staff is reaching out to the international media to keep Iraq on the global agenda, she said. The Australian director has worked with the WFP for over 20 years, serving assignments in Zaire, Rwanda, Tanzania, North Korea and Iraq. Ravaged by decades of wars with Iran and the U.S., and fight against the Islamic State and the Levant, the Iraqis are struggling to establish the most basic normalcy in their lives, explained Pearce. Out of the 36 million people of Iraq, 8.2 million are in need of immediate humanitarian aid. People have opened their homes to their displaced compatriots, and the government has provided food, shelter, water, health care, education and money to over 3 million displaced citizens. Iraqi children from the Baharka camp for internally displaced persons in city Erbil in northern Iraq. (Mohammed Al Bahbahani / WFP)“We don’t really see an end to it. The crises in Syria, Yemen, Libya, Ukraine, Nigeria, South Sudan, Nepal and other parts of the world have completely stretched our money and manpower,” Pearce said. “It is already 50 degrees Celsius in Baghdad, and the temperature is rising. Unless we get an immediate injection of cash, we will have to start shutting down up to half of our operations.”Due to lack of funding, the WFP has already started cutting rations by half to 800 calories a day. To deliver the “bare minimum” of service to keep people alive, the U.N. organization needs $160 million for the next six months, while the global humanitarian community needs $500 million, said the director.The new Iraq government is working hard to harmonize ethnic and religious groups and reconstruct the nation, but it simply cannot cope with the scale of the catastrophes and chaos, stressed Pearce. One-third of the country in the northwestern provinces of Anbar, Ninewa and Salah al-Din is controlled by the ISIS terrorists, who have committed rape, torture, enslavement and killing by beheading, crucifixion, suicide-bombing and live-burning. The survivors of the violence are suffering from depression and trauma, and female suicides have risen sharply, according to the WFP. “The crises are multiplying at a time when the funding is drying up,” Pearce underscored, adding that there are now more displaced people around the world than at any time since the Second World War. “The number has increased year after year after year,” she highlighted.The Korean government has been highly supportive through the international community and the WFP, the director noted. Through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Korea International Cooperation Agency, Korea donated $31 million to the WFP last year.The WFP and Korean government hold annual consultations to strengthen the partnership. The Korean government aims to bolster its multilateral assistance alongside the bilateral contribution through the KOICA, the MOFA said in a press release.Pearce said that foreign aid workers are well protected by the U.N. security forces, and do not feel unsafe in their operation. She travels between Baghdad and Sulaymaniah, where the ISIS does not pose a direct threat. Baghdad remains a heavily fortified area, a part of the “Green Zone” where the weapon is not cocked, unlike the rest of the country, which falls under the “Red Zone” with weapons readied at all times.“I have the greatest job in the world,” Pearce said, adding that despite being emotionally draining, her work is also “incredibly rewarding.”“I remind myself why I have to work 20 hours a day, 7 days a week, for months on end. I try to connect with the people by regularly visiting them. I would not do anything else.”By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","porridge and onions each day ,onions each day in late ,million displaced citizens iraqi children ,50 degrees celsius in baghdad ,food program visited the camp","['Iraq', 'Jane Pearce', 'the United Nations World Food Program', 'Jane Pearce', 'the United Nations World Food Program', 'Joel Lee', 'Pearce', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Australia', 'Belgium', 'Pearce', 'iraqi', 'Korea', 'Iraq', 'korean', 'U.N.', 'Iraq', 'australian', 'WFP', 'Zaire', 'Rwanda', 'Tanzania', 'North Korea', 'Iraq', 'Iran', 'U.S.', 'Islamic', 'Levant', 'Iraqis', 'Pearce', 'Iraq', 'iraqi', 'Baharka', 'Erbil', 'Iraq', 'Mohammed Al Bahbahani', 'Syria', 'Yemen', 'Libya', 'Ukraine', 'Nigeria', 'South Sudan', 'Nepal', 'Pearce', 'Baghdad', 'WFP', 'U.N.', 'Iraq', 'Pearce', 'Anbar', 'Ninewa', 'Salah al - Din', 'isis', 'WFP', 'Pearce', 'korean', 'WFP', 'the Ministry of Foreign Affairs', 'Korea International Cooperation Agency', 'Korea', 'WFP', 'WFP', 'korean', 'korean', 'KOICA', 'MOFA', 'Pearce', 'U.N.', 'Baghdad', 'isis', 'Baghdad', 'Pearce', 'Joel Lee']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66130292  0.76163238

We don’t have specific details of the situation,” said an official from Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education. “The health authorities tell us nothing.”The complaint, if true, implied that the SMOE -- entrusted with the task of ensuring the well-being of all students attending public institutes in the city -- is being kept in the relative dark concerning students’ health status amid an ongoing outbreak. It sparked concerns about its capacity to properly deal with the MERS situation, after the country’s first student patient was confirmed earlier in the day.Although the ministry released a press release confirming that the teen patient -- a 16-year-old high schooler -- is attending a Seoul-based high school, the SMOE said it was not even sure of the relevant facts.The officials said they learned about the student patient by inquiring at the health center in Gangnam-gu, southern Seoul, where he was diagnosed with the disease. One SMOE official said that she learned other details of the teen patient in question through media reports that were collected in official documents -- which were used in turn to brief the media.“I looked it up in the news. The health authorities are not telling us anything,” she said. “Regarding MERS patients, neither the Education Ministry nor local education offices have due information. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and the Health Ministry hold the authorities. The ministry tells us the information about the patient,” said a high-ranking official from the Education Ministry.There have been concerns that such monopoly of information could be a recipe for disaster, as the local education office -- which has the authority to cancel classes at times of high risk of contagion -- is left in the dark about the MERS situation in schools.Under the current system, health authorities alert the patients with their diagnosis. Each student is to report his or her case to the school, which in turn reports it to local education offices. But there is no regulation that mandates students to report one’s case to the school, meaning the school -- and consequently the education offices -- runs the risk of not keeping accurate track of a possible MERS outbreak among its students.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","relative dark concerning students health ,schooler is attending seoul ,dark concerning students health status ,disaster as the local education ,dark concerning students health","['the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education', 'the Education Ministry', 'Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education', 'SMOE', 'Seoul', 'SMOE', 'Gangnam - gu', 'Seoul', 'SMOE', 'the Education Ministry', 'the Korea Centers for Disease Control', 'the Health Ministry', 'the Education Ministry', 'Yoon Min - sik']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5433265   0.19498284

Song Tie, deputy director of the Guangdong's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told the Chinese newspaper that the likelihood of more outbreaks in China is low due to tight disease control.

There currently is no vaccine or treatment for the disease.The lack of treatment for the disease is apparently adding to what many medical experts here have called groundless fears, despite a steady increase in the number of people diagnosed.The five new confirmed cases included an Air Force chief master sergeant, which represented the first MERS case among members of the military.The 45-year-old servicemember was in the same hospital as the first MERS patient, but health ministry officials said it was more likely to be a case of tertiary transmission of the disease from another person who had contracted the MERS coronavirus from the first patient at the hospital.Such speculation is based on the fact that the man began showing symptoms of MERS past the maximum known incubation period of 14 days for the disease since his last possible contact with the first patient on May 17, they noted.The four other cases are also believed to be tertiary transmission cases.Tertiary transmission of the disease means any person diagnosed with MERS can transmit the disease, making anyone who has come in close contact with any of the patients subject to quarantine.Previously, the government had only isolated some 100 people who had come in close contact with the first patient.Since the first tertiary transmission case was confirmed Tuesday, the number has shot up to more than 1,600 as of Thursday.The health ministry is conducting a DNA test of the MERS coronavirus to see whether there has been any mutation of the virus that could explain what it believes to be an unusually fast and wide spreading of the disease that had only affected 1,142 people in 23 countries since it was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012.The outcome of the test was expected later Friday.The ministry said a team of experts from the World Health Organization was set to visit the country, possibly next week, to check for any reasons for the spread of the disease in South Korea, which it said is showing different patterns and speed from the spread in Saudi Arabia, where more than 1,000 confirmed cases have been reported since 2012.Despite repeated claims from the government that the disease is not out of control and appeals to the people to carry on with their daily lives, more than 1,160 schools, including some 400 kindergartens and a dozen colleges, have gone into a temporary shutdown out of fears over the disease.

With public criticism mounting, the president held an emergency meeting with ministers and medical experts for the first time Wednesday to seek measures to contain the MERS virus that had killed two and infected 30 as of Wednesday afternoon. The president said she would form a task force team after the meeting to identify the starting point of the virus and the route of the infection. The government would disclose the findings to dissolve public fears, she said. Despite Cheong Wa Dae‘s efforts to curb the growing fears, grumbling that the nation’s top office has been sitting back and ignoring the severity of the situation has been escalating.Earlier in the day, both major political parties blasted authorities for failing to block the deadly virus in the early stages and causing public panic by lackadaisically handling the crisis.The main opposition party leader slammed the Health Ministry saying it has already lost public trust for its “incompetent response,” and also demanded Park’s office to directly take charge of the response measures. “The president should handle the matter herself and have Cheong Wa Dae take the role of a control tower,” said New Politics Alliance for Democracy chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in.He also urged the government to form a pan-governmental organization to effectively contain the virus and take necessary measures to reassure the public.NPAD floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul also attacked Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo, holding him responsible for worsening the situation. “The crisis appears to have worsened partly because the health minister and vice minister are not experts on medical and public health,” he said. “The government needs to take countermeasures by listening to health experts and organizations before it becomes too late.”The minister is a former scholar on pension systems. The opposition floor leader also claimed that the government is poorly handling the matter like it did with the sinking of the Sewol ferry that killed more than 300 passengers last year.“The government shows no willingness to take charge of the crisis like how it was with the Sewol crisis. It still looks confused,” he said, referring to vast criticism the government faced for failing to save most of the passengers with belated rescue operations.The ruling Saenuri Party also stepped up criticism of the government’s botched MERS response and urged the government to proclaim a state of emergency in order to take every possible measure to contain the virus.“The party, the government and the presidential office together need to declare a state of emergency over the MERS crisis and concentrate all efforts to resolve the matter,” said Saenuri floor leader Rep. Yoo Seung-min.He also demanded the government consider disclosing relevant information on the disease to dispel public anxiety on the virus. The Health Ministry has been rejecting calls to share the names of medical hospitals where confirmed MERS patients either stayed or visited, despite strong public demand. The ministry said it would, instead, start releasing the list of all suspected and confirmed patients only to hospitals and health care workers in the country on Wednesday. Rumors have been swirling on social media in South Korea that the authorities have already failed to place a number of patients suspected of the disease under quarantine, allowing them to move around the country. Hundreds of schools and kindergartens across the country have decided to suspend classes, many at the request of parents concerned about the health of their children.The Health Ministry said Wednesday that more than 1,300 people are being monitored for possible infection.

The government’s decision to keep secret the list of hospitals holding MERS patients worsened public anger. The confirmation of two tertiary infections early Tuesday exacerbated the public’s fear.The ministry’s failure to contain MERS will add to pressure on Moon to resign, local analysts said.“This is a full-fledged political crisis, not to mention the obvious health concerns,” said Lee Jun-han, a professor of politics at Incheon National University.“If someone in Hong Kong or China falls victim to MERS, this could escalate into an international incident that invites negative attention on Korea. Moon will likely be compelled to resign after the crisis,” Lee added.Health and Welfare Minister Moon Hyung-pyo. (Yonhap)A Korean man suspected of having MERS traveled to Hong Kong late last month. Officials there confirmed the man of having MERS, and have quarantined over 80 people who may have caught the virus from him.President Park Geun-hye named Moon, then a senior economist at the Korea Development Institute, a public think tank, as her welfare minister in December 2013, primarily to drive through Park’s civil service pension reforms, which aimed to reduce the pension system’s reliance on public funds.Moon finished that task last month, when the parliament approved reductions in annuities to former civil servants. The reform came after weeks of controversy centered on Moon, as he had likened opposition demands that social security be widened without tax increases, to “piracy from future taxpayers.”Moon’s critics, including hard-liners in the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, had demanded the minister’s resignation, calling Moon’s comments “provocative” and “undermining of parliamentary debate.”“Moon was viewed as a Park loyalist by defending the president’s reforms against the opposition,” Lee said. “But he is viewed as a policy failure right now due to MERS,” he added.Professor Kim Men-geon at Kyung Hee University said despite mounting pressure, Moon may continue to keep his job.“There was pressure on Moon to resign then ... but I think that there is the chance that the president will keep Moon as her minister (after the MERS crisis ends),” Kim said.Considering the president’s multiple failures to draw public support for nominees to senior Cabinet posts, she will likely oppose holding “yet another” confirmation hearing, Kim added.Park’s Cabinet nominees have attracted negative political opinion during their parliamentary confirmation hearings. “Remember that President Park kept her chief of staff, Kim Ki-choon, in his post for months, despite continued public calls for him to resign,” Kim said.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","tuesday exacerbated the public fear ,tertiary infections early tuesday exacerbated ,infections early tuesday exacerbated the ,worsened public anger the confirmation ,infections early tuesday exacerbated","['Moon Hyung - pyo', 'Moon', 'Lee Jun - han', 'Incheon National University', 'Hong Kong', 'China', 'Korea', 'Moon', 'Lee', 'Welfare', 'Moon Hyung - pyo', 'Yonhap)A korean', 'Hong Kong', 'Park Geun', 'Moon', 'the Korea Development Institute', 'Park', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Moon ’s', 'Park', 'Lee', 'Kim Men - geon', 'Kyung Hee University', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Kim', 'Cabinet', 'Kim', 'Park ’s', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'Kim', 'Jeong Hunny']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.12240753  0.36560515

The bill was endorsed early Friday in line with an ongoing debate over the government enforcement decree of the special Sewol bill that dictates the government’s investigation into the Sewol ferry sinking in April 2014.Cheong Wa Dae expressed objections to the bill, saying that the revision would violate the constitutional separation of powers among the legislative, executive and judiciary branches.“(The bill) would paralyze the executive branch’s work,” said Kim Sung-woo, senior presidential secretary of public affairs. “The revised bill allows the legislature to control the government’s enforcement decree, which resides in the executive branch’s own authority,” said Kim.The revision has been a sticking point during last-minute negotiations between the rival parties as the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy held up endorsements of other bills, including the civil pension reform, unless the ruling Saenuri Party agreed to the fortified legislative control of the government decrees.The decree on the Sewol probe announced on May 11, allows the government to name key members of the probe panel to investigate the cause of the Sewol sinking. The opposition and some families of the Sewol victims have claimed that the decree would enable the government to meddle in the investigation by placing public officials in the probe’s executive positions. Meanwhile, the lawmakers downplayed the government’s concerns. “I can’t grasp exactly which part (of the amendment) would violate the separation of powers,” said Yoo Seung-min, the floor leader of the ruling Saenuri Party, on Friday. NPAD floor leader Lee Jong-kul hailed the revision, saying that it will be a “prime opportunity” to bring back the balance of power between the executive and the legislature. Yoon Pyeong-joong, a professor at Hanshin University said that the government’s concern about separation of powers was “not convincing,” because it has exercised more power than other branches under Korea’s long-held presidential system.

The passage of the antismoking bill came after 11 attempts dating back to 2002. It requires image and word warnings on cigarette packs.The amendment to the National Health Promotion Act, aimed at deterring Koreans from smoking by highlighting its dangers, mandates that pictorial warning labels cover more than half of the cigarette packs, with the image making up at least 30 percent of the packaging.Violators of the law will face up to a year in jail or up to 10 million won ($9,000) in fines, or revocation of the company’s business license.The bill will take effect next December after an 18-month grace period.However, an unclear clause in the new plan, which stipulates that the images on cigarette packs must not be “excessively” repulsive, will likely spark controversy between the authorities and tobacco industry.Korea continues to show a high smoking rate, particularly among men, of which 37.6 percent smoke, according to the latest Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development health data. It is the second-highest of the OECD countries, following Greece.As part of the antismoking campaign, the government raised tobacco prices by 2,000 won per pack in January. The health authorities further plan to revise the Tobacco Business Act to ban convenience stores from advertising cigarettes and to designate indoor sports facilities as non-smoking areas in a bid to lower the men’s smoking rate to 29 percent, the average level for men among OECD countries, by 2020.

More than 20 USFK research personnel were exposed to it, but they were not infected, USFK officials said, adding they were not aware that the sample contained live bacteria.The group also called on the U.S. and South Korea to improve what it calls the “unreasonable” status of forces agreement that governs the stationing of U.S. forces in Korea. It argued that the SOFA should make it necessary for Washington to consult with Seoul on shipments of dangerous biological and chemical materials.Media reports surfaced Friday alleging that the USFK has run a laboratory using anthrax since 1998, amid growing public criticism of its alleged failure to consult with Seoul over its handling of the lethal pathogen.The USFK said that it was in the process of verifying when the lab was established.The U.S. was reported to have installed its first lab at a USFK installation, mindful of North Korea’s longtime pursuit of chemical and biological weapons, before building labs in overseas locations. The North began research biological weapons in the early 1960s.

The ministry said the number of people on foreign spouse visas in the country dropped to 150,000 as of last month, about a 1 percent year-on-year decrease.The figure began to gradually fall last October, especially among women. The number of women marriage visa holders stood at about 127,000 last month, down by 1.5 percent compared to September, the authorities said. The strengthened visa regulations was the main cause of the decline, they said. As part of the efforts to prevent international marriage fraud while ensuring stability in living arrangements, the government has required an elementary level of Korean language skills for F-6 visa seekers since April last year. The new rules ask visa applicants to submit scores on the Test of Proficiency in Korean or certificates from government-approved language courses. Couples that are able to communicate in another language are exempt from the language requirements. The ministry also limited the number of times an individual could sponsor a marriage visa from twice to once in five years.The visa requirements were strengthened in response to reports of related social problems, such as human trafficking or domestic violence against foreign wives.

She suffered from a mystery lung-related disease for more than a decade. “When the symptoms first showed years ago, doctors couldn’t figure out the cause. She received pneumonia treatment because the symptoms were similar. But her condition didn’t get better,” Lee recalled. It was around the time she gave birth to their second son in 2001, he told The Korea Herald.In 2011, the couple finally found out that she was one of the many victims associated with a toxic humidifier disinfectant. The health authorities discovered that there was a “significant association” between the use of the humidifier disinfectant and lung-related diseases, especially among children and pregnant women.  Victims of the effects of humidifier disinfectant hold a campaign in front of the Houses of Parliament in London on May 19. (Yonhap)Lee’s family used Oxy Ssak Ssak, a liquid humidifier disinfectant produced by British company Reckitt Benckiser, every winter from 2001 to 2010, he said. Oxy Ssak Ssak, which was only sold in Korea from 2002, had a market share of about 80 percent in Korea among 20 similar other brands. All products were later withdrawn from the local market.As of now, more than 500 Korean users of humidifier disinfectants are reported to have been affected, with 221 confirmed to have suffered lung damage, the Korean authorities said. Of them, 92 died of lung-related diseases. The civic groups argue that the official death toll should be 142, as victims of other types of diseases need to be included. Lee and other victims’ families are now gearing up to launch a legal battle against the disinfectant’s manufacturer. The group of victims’ families and activist group Asian Citizen’s Center for Environment and Health vowed Wednesday to seek legal action against the company over the deaths of more than 100 people. “We are currently discussing the case with two British law firms. The lawyers said civil and criminal suits are both likely,” ACCEH director Lim Heung-kyu told The Korea Herald. The victims’ families and Korean activists visited the Reckitt Benckiser headquarters earlier this month to urge the company to take responsibility and issue an apology. They claimed that the company falsely advertised its products as safe even though the disinfectant contained toxic substances. The Korean Free Trade Commission has also confirmed that the Berkshire-based company was guilty of wrongly promoting its product as “safe for humans.” In response, the headquarters only provided a document, asking them to talk to the Korean branch of Reckitt Benckiser, the victims’ group said. The Korean branch office, however, has also remained silent on the issue despite the results of the government’s official inquiry. Regarding the lawsuit, it refused to comment, simply saying, “We have at all times sought to act in good faith and in the best interests of all parties. We have no comment on the legal action.”So far, most of the victims’ families have not received compensation, either from the government or the company, except for coverage for the medical costs from the government. They filed a lawsuit against the government for negligence in product monitoring but they lost the case earlier this year. The local court ruled that the state could not take responsibility for the deaths as there was no evidence that authorities knew of the harmfulness of the disinfectant in advance. The Environment Ministry, however, recently designated Asan Medical Center in Seoul as the main hospital to look for a causal link between the chemical exposure and the illnesses as part of efforts to further confirm the health impacts of the chemicals, officials said. AMC will also monitor the health records of the disinfectant victims and their families and take charge of their health care and treatment, they added.

The CDC has said the disease is only transmitted through direct and close contact.Following the notification, the man has also been admitted to a Chinese hospital where he is now undergoing a test for MERS and treatment for possible infection of the disease, the official told reporters, adding the outcome of the test is expected late Thursday or early Friday.The official said the country has also offered to send a team of medical inspectors to the Chinese hospital, but that China has turned down the offer.The man was one of 73 people who have been placed in isolation at their own homes so far after coming in close contact with the first patient, who reportedly caught the MERS virus while traveling to the Middle East in mid-April.The man's 76-year-old father was the third person in the country to be diagnosed with MERS.

According to a survey conducted by the Seoul Metropolitan Government, couples splitting up after living together for over two decades accounted for 32 percent of the total divorce cases last year, about 10 percentage points higher than that of newlywed couples with less than four years of marriage.Last year, 19,500 couples divorced, while about 65,000 couples tied the knot, the survey said.The change in the perception toward marriage, coupled with improved economic environment and increased life expectancy, contributed to the growing divorce rate among the elderly, the city speculated.The average age of divorcees was 47.8 for men and 44.8 for women. The average age was 10 years younger than two decades ago, city officials said.Meanwhile, the average age of men getting married was 32.8 and women 30.7, about two years older than 10 years ago, they added.About 40 percent of the brides were aged 30 and over, followed by 37 percent in their 20s, they said. The public perception toward marriage has also changed, another survey showed. About 41 percent of the respondents replied that marriage is a choice, showing a 7 percent on-year jump. The number of those who considered marriage as an obligation also dropped by 6 percentage points to 13.4 percent. The rest said it is better to get married if possible. The survey was conducted on 37,000 Koreans across the country, including 4,400 Seoul City residents. By gender, men were more conservative toward marriage. About 45 percent of men responded that it is better to get married while the same number of women said marriage was a matter of choice. Meanwhile, disapproval toward divorce decreased by 3 percentage points to 41.7 percent. Around 12 percent said they were okay with divorce if there was a substantial reason.By Lee Hyun-jeong  (rene@heraldcorp.com)","19 500 couples divorced while ,newlyweds in seoul demonstrating fast ,seoul metropolitan government couples splitting ,total divorce cases last year ,500 couples divorced while about","['Seoul', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Koreans', 'Seoul City', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48861811  0.52792823

It was the highest on-year gain since a 9.2 percent increase in October 2012.The on-year increase was also the sharpest reported for the month of March since the agency began tracking related data in 2000.The rise comes after the number of childbirths rose 1.2 percent on-year in January before contracting 3 percent in February. For the first three months of 2015, 117,700 babies were born in Asia's fourth-largest economy, up 1.5 percent from 116,000 tallied for the January-March period of last year.""The number of women over 35 having babies played a part in the rise of newborn numbers last month,"" an official from the statistical office said. ""The number of babies born to mothers between 35 and 39 rose 1.7 percentage point.""South Korea, whose population is expected to peak in 2030, has been trying to push up its birthrate to prevent a decline in the national workforce. Such a development can result in more welfare expenses and damage the country's growth potential. The report also showed that about 27,200 couples tied the knot in March, an 8.8 percent increase from the year before. The monthly number also represents a sharp increase from the 20,900 people who were married in the second month of 2015.Newlywed numbers are a good indicator of childbirths down the line in South Korea because very few children are born to single-parent families.The number of divorces, meanwhile, fell 3.2 percent on-year to 9,200, while there were 26,500 deaths, up 9.1 percent on-year, the statistical office said.In a separate report, the agency said that the number of people changing their residence in April dipped 0.4 percent on-year, to 649,000. This is down from the 771,000 who moved in March. Of the total, 68.4 percent moved within the same city or province, with the remainder moving further away.

She never drinks tap water, citing an unpleasant chemical smell and safety concerns. Worried about her family’s health, she has installed a water purifier at home instead. “There’s a weird smell in tap water. How can you trust tap water that comes through old underground pipes? It’s always better to be safer,” Han said. Han is part of the majority of Koreans who are reluctant to drink tap water, and prefer to use a water purifier or purchase bottled water at home.According to a survey conducted by the Environment Ministry on 12,000 individuals in 2013, only about 10 percent responded that they drank water directly from the tap, whether it is boiled or not. About 55 percent said they drank tap water only after boiling to ensure safety. Elementary school studentsdrink tap water at their school in Seoul. (Seoul Metropolitan Government)More than 30 percent of those surveyed responded that they distrust the quality of tap water because of concerns over old water pipes and water tanks. About 28 percent of respondents said they were worried about sanitation at reservoirs. But only about 55 percent answered that they were willing to drink tap water if all such concerns were resolved.Despite emphasis from experts who stress that Korea’s tap water quality is among the best in the world, public distrust over the quality of tap water has been prevalent for quite some time.According to a United Nations’ report in 2003, Korea’s water quality ranked eighth in the world, with its high-tech water treatment facilities and management. Finland topped the chart, followed by Canada and New Zealand. The U.S. took the 12th spot, the report said. To ensure water safety, the Korean government monitors tap water quality around the clock against a minimum of 59 criteria, including checks on residual chlorine levels, pH and various types of bacteria. Along with the mandated monitoring criteria, municipal governments impose their own higher water standards at their own discretion, with over 150 criteria. For example, Seoul City monitors 163 variables while Busan looks at 260, officials said.  Children drink tap water in this stock photo provided by Seoul Metropolitan Government.This is not only above the World Health Organization’s recommended level but also more detailed than other countries, they said.In the U.S. and Japan, the number of water quality criteria monitored is around 111. The tap water drinking rate, however, is much higher than in Seoul. As of 2013, 82 percent of Americans and 78 percent of Japanese replied that they drank tap water. In New York, about 80 percent of residents drink tap water despite concerns about old water pipes (most of which are more than 100 years old) and chlorine use, the officials explained.For instance, more than 4 milligrams per liter of chlorine is added to water in New York for germ prevention, while Seoul keeps the minimum amount at 0.2 milligrams per liter. But this, which often leads to stronger chemical smell, seemingly does not deter New Yorkers from drinking water from the tap. Americans have acknowledged that a small amount of chlorine does not pose health issues and is an essential substance for disinfection, thanks to the government’s efforts to raise public awareness of this, the officials explained.Despite the authorities’ efforts to maintain the high quality of tap water, the public has preferred to drink water filtered through water purifiers or purchase bottled water. Some critics pointed out that such public distrust was triggered by the infamous phenol leak accident that prompted water scare across the country in the early 1990s.In 1991, an undiluted solution of phenol was leaked twice from an electronic component factory in Daegu into the Nakdonggang River. The accident caused extreme odors in the region’s tap water, and serious headaches and vomiting among residents who drank it. “Once a water accident happens in one region just like the phenol leak, it causes nationwide fear as water circulates the country, no matter how well the government responded to the accident. People who raise children especially react sensitively to water accidents,” said Chung Deuk-mo, the director general of Waterworks Research Institute, an affiliated organization of Seoul Metropolitan Government. Along with the phenol leak, aged underground pipes added to the water distrust following several reported cases of red water, experts said. As part of the efforts to guarantee pipe sanitation, the government has worked on replacing water pipes with new, rust-proof ones. “Those pipes aged over two decades are recommended to be replaced. Water flows through pipes upon pressure. Because massive pressure hits the pipes every day, the pipe connections can be twisted, chipped off or even rust,” an official from the Environment Ministry told The Korea Herald, wishing not to be identified.About 180,000 kilometers of water pipes are installed underground across the country, with 70 percent having been laid, replaced or improved in the last 20 years. About 30 percent are awaiting replacement, with most of them in private housing. Replacing the pipes at private housing is at each homeowner’s discretion, officials said. As pipe replacement for an individual home costs around 2 million won ($1,800), many residents have been reluctant to take the responsibility, citing cost burden. To encourage people to replace their pipes, city governments have offered subsidies for those wishing to replace them. In the case of Seoul, the city expanded the subsidy from 50 percent to 80 percent of the cost in an aim to complete the replacement by 2020, officials said. The capital has also completed more than 96 percent of the public water pipe replacement, due to be finished by 2018, with about 470 kilometers remaining, they added.While various factors have led to public distrust, one of the prevalent reasons that Koreans avoid drinking tap water is their sensitivity toward the unpleasant taste that derives from chlorine, experts said. “Many people tend to feel the unpleasant smell and taste from tap water because of chlorine. But chlorine is essential to ensuring water safety as it prevents bacteria propagation,” said water expert Lee Yoon-jin at Konyang University in South Chungcheong Province.In order to have better tasting drinking water while avoiding safety concerns, many Koreans have installed water purifiers at home, thinking that smell-free water is likely safer. The scale of the water purifier market is around 1.5 trillion won a year, Seoul officials said. Experts, however, underscore that purified water is actually not safer than the tap water. “Water filtered through purifiers may seem safer but it can actually lower the water quality unless the filters are regularly replaced. The interior cleaning of purifiers is systematically not easy, and the purifier’s faucet can increase bacteria propagation as it is exposed to the air,” said environment engineering professor Choi Suing-il at Korea University in Seoul. In 2013, more than half of 100 water purifiers in Seoul were found to have had substandard drinking water, the capital’s random inspection report showed. A few were reported to have had about 110 times more germs than average, with one even having colon bacillus, the city said. “All water purifiers contain activated carbon to remove chlorine, which is the source of the chemical smell that many dislike. As the germ-fighter substance is eliminated, the water is naturally exposed to various bacteria and germs,” Choi added. The more serious problem of water purifiers is that some types of water purifiers even eliminate all the important nutrients contained in tap water, experts said. “Because tap water is sourced from rivers, such as the Hangang River, it contains various minerals such as calcium and magnesium, with around 20 to 30 milligrams per liter,” a Seoul City official said.Some express health concerns over the chlorine use but experts highlight that a small amount is harmless.“Chlorine is a chemical, therefore it can be harmful to health if one is over-exposed. One study showed that it can be detrimental if people are constantly exposed to chlorine over 3,000 ppm over a long period. But unless more than 1,000 milligrams per liter or 1,000 ppm is added to the water, there’s no need to worry,” said Kim Dong-keun, the general director of Citizens Network for Tap Water, adding that bacteria contamination of water due to a lack of chlorine could be more harmful.The government, meanwhile, continues to put efforts into promoting the safety of tap water.Seoul City, for instance, announced last month it would provide free-of-charge quality tests for tap water at some 300,000 homes and improve their water supply facilities. It has also signed up for an insurance to compensate citizens who suffer damage from any water pollution.The city has been providing bottled tap water since 2001, branding the products under the name Arisu in 2004 to rehabilitate its image.In March this year, Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon joined a network of some 72 government organizations and civic organizations to only use tap water by installing Arisu drinking fountains at all of its office buildings.Civic groups stress that achieving the cleanliness of tap water and enjoying it is a basic right of the public. “Improving the tap water credibility and expanding the culture of drinking tap water is crucial. Having safe water is not only a basic public right but also part of welfare. People should realize the importance of the cheapest, yet the most vital, benefit to their daily lives,” said Kim.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Saturday urged Southeast Asian nations to deal with the causes behind a growing humanitarian crisis that has forced thousands of people from Myanmar and Bangladesh to flee by sea, leaving many still stranded in boats.  Rohingya migrants sit inside their temporary shelter in Bayeun, Aceh province, Indonesia, Sunday, May 24, 2015. Thousands of migrants - about half of them Bangladeshi and the others minority Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar - have landed ashore in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand since May 10. Thousands more are believed to be trapped at sea, and the United Nations has warned that time is running out. (AP-Yonhap)Ban said he has been discussing the emergency with regional leaders in Myanmar, Malaysia and Thailand, among others, and urged them to provide search and rescue operations and options for resettlement and reintegration.""It's important to save human lives,'' Ban said on a visit to Hanoi, Vietnam. But he also said it was important not to send the migrants back to dangerous situations in their home countries.More than 3,600 people -- about half of them from Bangladesh and the others minority Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar -- have landed ashore in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand since May 10. Thousands more are believed to be trapped at sea, and the United Nations has warned that time is running out.Four Malaysian navy ships began searching for boats Friday, according to navy chief Abdul Aziz Jaafar, who said three helicopters and three other ships were on standby. The Malaysian search is a positive step, but the operation is limited to Malaysia's territorial waters.A spokesman for the U.S. Pentagon said Thursday that Washington was readying air patrols to aid in the search. A U.S. Embassy spokeswoman in Bangkok, Melissa Sweeney, told The Associated Press in an email Saturday that the offer of assistance was still awaiting clearance.""We're actively engaging with the governments of the region to obtain their support and permissions for staging these flights,'' she said.Last week, Malaysia and Indonesia announced they would provide temporary shelter to the migrants for up to one year, and the U.S. has said it will settle some of them permanently.Speaking Friday in Myanmar, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said the Rohingya fleeing the predominantly Buddhist nation were risking perilous journeys and putting their lives in the hands of human traffickers because ``they are in despair and don't see a future'' at home.The Rohingya, numbering around 1.3 million, have been identified by the United Nations as one of the most persecuted minorities in the world. They have been denied citizenship and chased off their land in the latest bout of ethnic violence that left them with little access to education, medical care or freedom to move around.After Myanmar took steps to transition from dictatorship to democracy in 2011, newfound freedoms of expression gave voice to Buddhist extremists who spewed hatred against the religious minority and said Muslims were taking over the country. Attacks that followed left hundreds dead. Another 140,000 Rohingya were driven from their homes and are now living under apartheid-like conditions in crowded displacement camps.Myanmar's government says the Rohingya are illegal migrants from Bangladesh, even though most have lived in Myanmar for generations. Bangladesh also does not recognize them as citizens. Blinken said Myanmar needs to shoulder some responsibility for the crisis. ""The root of the problem for those leaving Myanmar is the political and social situation on the ground,'' he told reporters in Yangon.He said Rohingya Muslims ""should have a path to citizenship.'' He added, ""The uncertainty that comes from not having any status is one of the things that may drive people to leave.""Blinken said he made that point when he met with Myanmar President Thein Sein, the army commander-in-chief and other top officials.The persecution of the Rohingya has sent more than 100,000 fleeing to neighboring Southeast Asian countries. But in recent weeks, the exodus has erupted into a humanitarian crisis. Because of arrests after a crackdown on human trafficking networks in the region, captains earlier this month started abandoning boats that were packed with Rohingya as well as Bangladeshis escaping poverty.Myanmar's navy found two fishing trawlers filled with 208 men during a patrol off Rakhine state, the main point of departure for fleeing Rohingya.Zaw Htay, director of the presidential office, said the men were identified as Bangladeshi and would be sent to the neighboring country.After initially saying it might boycott a meeting next Friday in Thailand to address the problem, Myanmar agreed to attend, saying the invitation letter did not use the term Rohingya and did not say that Myanmar was solely to blame.""We are ready to cooperate with other governments to resolve the ongoing problems through constructive engagement and on humanitarian grounds,'' Zaw Htay said.","bangladeshis escaping poverty myanmar navy ,crowded displacement camps myanmar government ,in crowded displacement camps myanmar ,as bangladeshis escaping poverty myanmar ,stranded in boats rohingya migrants","['YANGON', 'Myanmar', 'AP', 'U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'southeast asian', 'Myanmar', 'Bangladesh', 'Rohingya', 'Bayeun', 'Aceh province', 'Indonesia', 'Bangladeshi', 'Rohingya Muslims', 'Myanmar', 'Indonesia', 'Malaysia', 'Thailand', 'the United Nations', 'AP - Yonhap)Ban', 'Myanmar', 'Malaysia', 'Thailand', 'Ban', 'Hanoi', 'Vietnam', 'Bangladesh', 'Rohingya Muslims', 'Myanmar', 'Indonesia', 'Malaysia', 'Thailand', 'the United Nations', 'malaysian', 'Abdul Aziz Jaafar', 'malaysian', 'Malaysia', 'U.S.', 'Pentagon', 'Washington', 'U.S. Embassy', 'Bangkok', 'Melissa Sweeney', 'the Associated Press', 'Malaysia', 'Indonesia', 'U.S.', 'Myanmar', 'U.S.', 'State', 'Anthony Blinken', 'Rohingya', 'buddhist', 'Rohingya', 'the United Nations', 'Myanmar', 'buddhist', 'Muslims', 'Rohingya', 'Myanmar', 'Rohingya', 'Bangladesh', 'Myanmar', 'Bangladesh', 'Blinken', 'Myanmar', 'Myanmar', 'Yangon', 'Rohingya Muslims', 'Myanmar', 'Thein Sein', 'Rohingya', 'southeast asian', 'Rohingya', 'bangladeshis', 'Myanmar', 'Rakhine', 'Rohingya', 'Zaw Htay', 'Bangladeshi', 'Thailand', 'Myanmar', 'Rohingya', 'Myanmar']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48679557 -0.01469259

He is expected to remain in power.Only one opposition lawmaker won a seat in Ethiopia's 547-seat parliament in the 2010 election, which watchdog groups said was marred by intimidation and the harassment of opposition activists.Those allegations have persisted for this election.","90 million people hailemariam desalegn ,elections the country first since ,former university professor turned politician ,90 million people hailemariam ,million people hailemariam desalegn former","['ADDIS ABABA', 'Ethiopia', 'AP', 'ethiopian', 'Meles Zenawi', 'east african', 'Hailemariam Desalegn', 'Ethiopia']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.06399298  0.587982

""We were able to be citizens' diplomats.""She voiced hope that their move could become the beginning of contacts across the ""artificial barrier"" to promote peace and understanding between the two Koreas.The group arrived in Pyongyang on Tuesday to meet with North Korean women to deliver their message and marched down to the South via the western corridor along the Gyeongui railway.Originally, they planned to walk through the truce village of Panmunjom, which sits in the middle of the DMZ. But they had to change plans by accepting Seoul's recommendation to march through the western land route.The truce village sits in the middle of the DMZ, which is guarded by stone-faced soldiers on each side of the military demarcation line. Passing through the truce village is a violation of the truce treaty, according to the United Nations Command.""We've come here to (help) end war. I think that it is the first step in a right direction,"" said Leymah Gbowee, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2011 for her role in leading a Liberian women's movement that helped bring an end to her country's brutal civil war.She said the activists feel ""privileged"" to be able to come across the DMZ, but they also feel sad as there are so many families separated by the Korean War.The activists said that the purpose of the DMZ crossing is to express hope that Korean families separated by the Korean War will be united someday and military tensions between the two sides can be reduced. But some critics claimed that the event would not help resolve North Korea's nuclear weapons program and human rights violation.The peace march also met with criticism here as anti-Pyongyang activists claimed that the female activists have pro-Pyongyang stances, citing a report by the North's media. A group of conservative activists held a rally in front of Imjingak, a park near the border to protest against them.North Korea's Rodong Sinmun, the communist party's official newspaper, reported last week that they ""praised"" the North's late founder Kim Il-sung at his birthplace.

Such developments have even affected companies like Hyundai Merchant Marines (HMM), South Korea's No. 2 shipping line, which is the largest shareholder of Hyundai Asan Corp., a company which runs tours to Mount Kumgang resort in North Korea. The resort has been closed since 2008, when a North Korean guard shot killed a South Korean tourist at the resort.HMM shares, which stood at 23,658 won (US$21.7) in May 24, 2010, traded at 9,110 won as of Friday.""Whenever there is a thaw in relations stock prices rose sharply, but they plunged when the North tested a nuclear device, fired off rockets or engaged in other forms of aggressive behavior,"" FnGuide said.The sudden cancellation of UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's trip to Kaesong last week hurt stock prices, it said.While there has been a move to set aside more funds to prepare for eventual unification, most of the money has gone to companies that can benefit from the expected rise in demand for infrastructure building, education and health services in North Korea, FnGuide said.

According to a survey conducted by the Seoul Metropolitan Government last year, 73.2 percent of surveyed husbands in the capital responded that they are content with their spouses, with 40 percent being very satisfied. For wives, however, only 62.6 percent said they are satisfied with their husbands. Over 10 percent of women said they are unsatisfied with their counterparts, more than double men’s dissatisfaction level toward wives, officials said. The two-week survey was conducted with some 4,400 Seoul residents as the country marks National Spouse Day on Thursday, they said. At 58 percent, men were also more content with their parents-in-law than women were, the survey added. This is 12.5 percent higher than the women’s satisfaction toward their parents-in-law. The survey also showed that housework was not equally shared despite both parties acknowledging of the need for equivalent work shares. About 53 percent of women and 44 percent of men agreed that chores should be equally shared, as more wives tend to continue their career after marriage. In reality, however, only 15.4 percent of the surveyed couples replied that they shoulder the housework together. About 24 percent said that wives mostly take charges of domestic work. Among double-income couples, only 20 percent said they take care of the household chores together, while 23 percent said that only the wife does all the domestic work.During weekends, around 50 percent of both men and women picked watching TV as the most common activity. For the second-most common activity, husbands chose “taking a rest” while wives said “doing household work,” with 40.6 percent and 44 percent, respectively. Only 13.8 percent of men said they do the housework on weekends. Meanwhile, the data also showed that more respondents prefer double income families.About 45 percent replied that women should continue to work regardless of marriage or domestic workloads. This is nearly a 16 percent jump compared to 1998, officials said. While around 70 percent of both parties responded that they have experienced career stress, more women tended to suffer from housework stress with 51.3 percent, higher by 13.5 percent than that of husbands, the survey said.By Lee Hyun-jeong  (rene@heraldcorp.com)","double income couples only 20 ,work among double income couples ,their husbands over 10 percent ,korean men are more satisfied ,73 percent of surveyed husbands","['south korean', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Seoul', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",12,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64268404  0.70087862

Of the total, 89,000 were people in their 20s.  This is the highest number since 97,000 were tallied in January 2003. The number is equal to 15.1 percent of all unemployed people in the cited month.  The increase is noteworthy because in the past, unemployment usually peaked in February when people graduated from school and started to fall in the following months.  This year, however, unemployment numbers reached 79,000 in February, then fell to 71,000 in March before rising again.  The statistical office also said there was an increase in the number of people in their 20s who did not seek to find work at all.  Some 250,000 people in their 20s did not try to find a job last month, up 16.3 percent from the year before.  The overall drop in employment numbers and a tendency of more people opting not to find work come as companies are cutting back on hiring in the face of economic and labor market uncertainties.   South Korea's mandatory retirement age will be raised to 60 starting in 2016, making it hard for companies to hire new workers.  According to the Korea Employers Federation, 377 companies with more than 100 employees will scale back hiring by 3.6 percent this year compared with 2014  Related to the latest development, the Korea Employment Information Service said the drop in hiring is also being influenced by fewer people quitting jobs in the face of economic uncertainty that is limiting the number of vacancies available.  It said another reason why youth unemployment numbers rose is because companies do not want to spend money on training new workers and prefer people with job experience.

294,294,[Herald Interview] Agency calls for health care support for North Korea,"When Lee Soo-ku, president of the Korea Foundation for International Healthcare, visited a dental facility in North Korea for the first time in the early 2000s, he was almost speechless. “There was literally nothing except a few very basic instruments,” he said. “There was a mouth mirror and an extractor.

That’s about it.”Lee, who is also a practicing dentist, has been serving as the head of the KOFIH since 2012. His organization is the only South Korean public agency that provides health care support to North Korea. Some of its ongoing projects include establishing a health screening center in the Gaeseong Industrial Complex for North Korean workers, as well as supporting North Korean tuberculosis patients in its northern free-trade city of Rason. Lee Soo-ku, president of Korea Foundation for International Healthcare, speaks during an interview with The Korea Herald in Seoul on Wednesday. (Lee Sang-sub/The Korea Herald)In 2008, the agency completed its renovation of the Onjeong Community Hospital in North Korea’s Goseong County. The hospital, which is responsible for about 5,000 people living in the county, now has fully-equipped facilities including a dental clinic. But Lee said South Korea was still not doing enough to support North Koreans who are in need of quality health care, especially pregnant women, tuberculosis patients, and children suffering from chronic malnutrition.“Many experts estimate that about 8 percent of the entire North Korean population is suffering from tuberculosis,” he said. “As many already know, a lot of North Koreans are malnourished. Those who suffer from malnutrition are especially vulnerable to TB. And because anti-TB drugs can cause a number of adverse effects, such as drug-induced hepatitis, taking the drug can be especially painful and difficult for malnourished patients.”Lee said because of malnutrition and scarcity of medicines, the number of North Korean patients with multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis is rising. MDR-TB is a form of TB infection caused by bacteria that are resistant to at least two of the most powerful first-line treatment anti-TB drugs. The condition, which is much more dangerous and difficult to treat than TB, is often caused by the TB patient not taking the medication properly, or stopping his or her treatment due to expense or scarcity of medicines.“This is why I suggested establishing a health screening center at the Gaeseong Industrial Complex. If 8 percent of the entire population is suffering from TB, I assumed there could also be patients among those who work at the complex,” he said. “There are some 54,000 North Korean workers working at the complex, along with about 800 South Korean workers. But the size of the clinic for North Korean workers is about one-fifth size of the one for South Korean workers. “Supporting North Korean TB patients cannot be done by simply sending anti-TB drugs,” he added. “What is needed is a solid residential and medical facility that can quarantine MDR-TB patients, TB-screening equipment for prompt detection of infectious patients and stronger measures to combat malnutrition in the country.”North Korea’s health care system, which emphasized free cost and preventive care, fell apart during the “Arduous March” ― a great famine that accompanied the country’s economic crisis from 1994 to 1998. According to a number of North Korean defectors interviewed by the KOFIH, a lot of doctors in the North aren’t paid enough or paid at all, and therefore aren’t motivated to do their jobs. Many of them are involved in illicit drug sales.Because patients are assigned to a specific doctor in the region by the regime, they are not allowed to see other medical professionals even if they are not satisfied with the treatment they get from their designated doctor. As a result, those with money bribe the doctors that they would like to see, while the impoverished are often left with no health care options.Some of the most vulnerable to the current system include pregnant women. As of 2010, North Korea’s maternal mortality ratio was 81 women per 100,000 live births. South Korea’s ratio was 16, while Japan and China’s ratios were 5 and 37, respectively. According to KOFIH’s 2013 data, less than 10 percent of North Korea’s obstetricians and gynecologists have been trained in newborn care, and no family doctors in small regional clinics have been trained in emergency obstetric and newborn care, childbirth and general gynecology. Data also showed that small regional clinics’ medical equipment for childbirth were in poor condition. More than 70 percent of emergency obstetrical kits at the clinics either were either in poor condition or could not be used, while 68.3 percent of equipment needed for intravenous therapy were also in poor condition. Also, 68.3 percent of the sterilizers were in poor maintenance. Poor sterilization of medical equipment can lead to infection of patients in the facility. In North Korea, 15 percent of women who die due to complications from pregnancy or childbirth die from sepsis, a whole-body inflammation caused by an infection. To foster experts on North Korean health care, the KOFIH has been running a special educational program for activists and health care professionals since 2013. Lee stressed that humanitarian support for North Koreans should not be affected by inter-Korean relations. Some of the KOFIH’s projects were suspended after the North’s 2010 sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan.“President Park Geun-hye said she’d expand humanitarian support for North Korea during her recent Dresden speech and I thought she was taking the right approach,” he said. “We should think of giving health care support to North Korea as preparation for the two Koreas’ unification.”He said one of the most critical issues was malnutrition of North Korean children. “A lot of North Korean children are experiencing so many health problems because of malnutrition. And one of them is iodine deficiency,” he said. “Lack of iodine can severely affect a child’s brain and intellectual prowess, which can lead to developmental disabilities. If we don’t do anything about this, there will be more social costs to tackle this issue in the future, especially after reunification.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","clinic for north korean workers ,the only south korean public ,dental facility in north korea ,2010 north korea maternal mortality ,north korean tuberculosis patients","['Lee Soo - ku', 'the Korea Foundation for International Healthcare', 'North Korea', 'KOFIH', 'south korean', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'Rason', 'Lee Soo - ku', 'Korea Foundation for International Healthcare', 'the Korea Herald', 'Seoul', 'Lee Sang - sub', 'the Onjeong Community Hospital', 'North Korea ’s', 'Goseong County', 'Lee', 'South Korea', 'North Koreans', 'north korean', 'North Koreans', 'TB', 'north korean', 'MDR - TB', 'TB', 'TB', 'TB', 'TB', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'MDR', 'Korea', 'north korean', 'KOFIH', 'North Korea ’s', 'South Korea ’s', 'Japan', 'China', 'KOFIH ’s 2013', 'North Korea ’s', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'KOFIH', 'Lee', 'North Koreans', 'inter - korean', 'south korean', 'Cheonan', 'Park Geun - hye', 'North Korea', 'Dresden', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'Claire Lee']",10,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.1146393   0.46248731

While she currently has no signs of the brain disease, Kim recently visited her doctor to find out if there are any options available for an early diagnosis. “Dementia is a terrible disease,” Kim said. “After losing my own mother to the very disease, I wanted to be proactive and minimize my risks as much as possible before it is too late.”Her doctor suggested Kim get a FDG-PET scan, a medical imaging technique that produces a 3-D image functional process in the body. The test, which uses a small close of a radioactive drug to show differences between healthy and diseased tissue, is used to make a diagnosis for dementia management or prognosis. According to the National Evidence-based Healthcare Collaborating Agency, the test has a 79 percent chance of correctly identifying those with dementia, and a 60 percent chance of correctly identifying those without the disease. The test, however, is expensive and currently not covered by the national health insurance program. The cost of a single scan ranges from 600,000 won ($550) to 1.2 million won.  Senior citizens are encouraged to exercise regularly, as physical inactivity is known to be a major risk factor for dementia. (Yonhap)While Kim is still willing to undergo the scan, most Koreans ― 68.8 percent ― are reluctant to receive the test mostly because of its cost, according to the latest study by the NECA. Meanwhile, the number of dementia patients increased by 12.8 percent from 2013 to 2014, from 38,217 to 43,974. The cost to treat the patients increased by 18.8 percent in the same time period. Last year, Koreans spent 1.17 trillion won to treat the brain disease, while about one-third of total medical cost ― 19.4 trillion won ― was spent on treating the elderly who already account for 11.9 percent of the total Korean population. While the elderly population is rapidly increasing, dementia is considered one of the most serious threats to the country’s future economy. Health authorities predict the number of people with the disease will exceed the number of those who are aged 65 or older by 2024, and that it will cost some 43.5 trillion won to treat by 2030. Experts say early diagnosis is important as it allows a person to get the maximum benefit from available treatments and provides an opportunity for clinical trials or studies. “Those who are aged 60 or older, and those who have close family members who have suffered dementia are encouraged to take the FDG-PET scan,” said Seo Seong-woo from the NECA.“From our research, 60.6 percent of the surveyed individuals said they are willing to participate in clinical trials and 88.3 percent said they would start receiving any available treatments immediately once they are diagnosed with the disease.”The government has been making a number of efforts to prevent the disease, including banning on-campus drinking and introducing workout programs for the elderly. According to the Health Ministry, a heavy drinker is 7.42 times more likely than a person who does not drink to develop dementia. Also, physical inactivity is considered one of the major risk factors for dementia, as indicated by more than 80 percent of the elderly spending their leisure time watching TV. For Kim, spending 1 million won for her FDG-PET scan is worth it not only for herself, but also for her children. “I spent 1.2 million won a month for the last two years of my mother’s life, as she was staying at a residential medical facility for the elderly,” she said. “I believe doing everything that I can to prevent or delay the process of the disease would save more money in the end. It’ll be less of a burden ― both financially and emotionally ― for my children as well.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","lost her mother to dementia ,her mother to dementia three ,year old housewife lost her ,mother to dementia three years ,old housewife lost her mother","['Kim Seon - hwa', 'Kim', 'Dementia', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'FDG', 'PET', 'the National Evidence', 'Healthcare Collaborating Agency', 'Kim', 'Koreans', 'NECA', 'Koreans', 'korean', 'FDG', 'PET', 'Seo Seong - woo', 'the Health Ministry', 'Kim', 'FDG', 'PET', 'Claire Lee']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.81583816 -0.29535547

Kim Kyok-sik died Sunday of respiratory failure at the age of 77 after suffering from an unidentified cancer, according to the Rodong Sinmun, the communist party's official newspaper.South Korean officials said he is believed to have led the North's torpedo attack on a South Korean warship in March 2010 and the shelling of Yeongpyeong Island in the Yellow Sea eight months later. He was in charge of the 4th Corps in Hwanghae Province near the western border with the South at that time.The deadly sinking of South Korean naval corvette Cheonan killed 46 sailors. The North's shelling of the border island left four people including two civilians dead, the first North Korean artillery attack on home soil since the 1950-53 Korean War.The two Koreas are still technically at war as the Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.Kim was named as the North's armed forces minister in October2012 before being replaced by Jang Jong-nam in May 2013. Later, he was tapped as the chief of the KPA's General Staff.The People's Armed Forces Ministry is equivalent to South Korea's Defense Ministry and is placed under the control of the communist country's top policy-making body.The Ministry of Unification declined to comment on Kim's death but added that there is no change in the Seoul government's stance over the need to keep its punitive sanctions against North Korea following the warship sinking.Since May 2010, South Korea has imposed sanctions on the North by banning economic and cultural exchanges to punish the North's torpedoing of the warship. Seoul has called for Pyongyang to take responsibility for the incident, but the North has denied its role.""Seoul's basic stance over the warship sinking and the punitive sanctions remains intact,"" Lim Byeong-cheol, the ministry spokesman, told a press briefing.

Seniors have increasingly committed more crimes in recent years than before, with the total number of cases reaching 77,260 in 2013, up 12.2 percent from 2011, according to data by the Korean National Police Agency. In particular, the increase in the number of violent crimes including murder, robbery, rape and arson, committed by senior citizens was noticeable, showing a 39.9 percent jump during the two-year period. A total of 1,062 violent crime cases were reported to the police in 2013. The number of sexual crimes by seniors rose most rapidly from 608 in 2011 to 819 cases in 2013. The population aged 65 and older rose by 9.6 percent during the cited two years.The majority of the senior offenders said that they committed violent crimes “impulsively” while some did so due to dissatisfaction with reality or trouble with family, according to the police data. Experts point to economic difficulties, illness and loneliness as the reasons behind the upward trend of serious crimes by seniors. “Behind the crimes are seniors who failed to position themselves and find a role in society after retirement,” said Jang Joong-oh, a research fellow from Korean Institute of Criminology in his 2009 study on the elderly crime. “Also, the elderly tend to commit crimes to secure money they need to maintain the quality of life they used to have before they retired,” he said. Korea has the highest poverty rate for the elderly among OECD countries, with about 48.6 percent of those aged 65 and older categorized as poor in 2011. The rate for seniors who live alone is even higher at 74 percent.About 1 in 3 seniors suffers from depression, with 89.2 percent of them chronically ill from high blood pressure, diabetes or arthritic conditions. One in 10 said that they felt suicidal, mostly due to economic reasons, according to a government survey.“To prevent crimes by the elderly, the government needs to create jobs and expands welfare benefits for the age group while leading seniors to participate more in social activities,” Jang said in his study.

I just love them. I cannot specifically describe the reason,” the 57-year-old scholar, who heads the Holoce Ecosystem Conservation Research Institution in Hoengseong, Gangwon Province, told The Korea Herald. “When you see their colors, it’s indescribably beautiful.”Lee Kang-woon, director of the Holoce Ecosystem Conservation Research Institution in Hoengseong, Gangwon Province, poses during an interview with The Korea Herald in Seoul. (Lee Sang-sub/The Korea Herald)His affection for insects has transformed him into one of the country’s leading scholars in the fields of entomology and biodiversity. Beyond his individual research, he has also strived to raise awareness about rare insect species and nurture future entomologists. In 1997, Lee bought 73,000-square-meter swaths of forest in the province and established the insect research institution. He has exhibited about 4,300 species of insects. At a series of laboratories in the institute, some 900 types of insects are being raised. The director named his institution after “Holocene,” referring to the fourth period of Cenozoic era ― from 15,000 years ago up to now ― to highlight the urgency of preserving biodiversity.Lee is conducting a number of projects with six researchers at his institute, with the aim of developing endangered species and analyzing the characteristics of each insect. One project includes a study on matching larva with their host plants. Information about which host plant feeds which larva has been unknown. “Insects spawn only on certain plants they choose. Once hatched, the insect lives without parents’ help. Parents then live on the pod and essence of the plant,” he said. “Naturally, insects of parents and children never compete for food.”For more than a decade, he has discovered the relationships of about 600 types of larva and their respective host plants. “The study suggests that natural enemies of plants are insects. Plants spout out various chemical substances to battle against insects, and those substances make the bitterness that we taste from the plants,” he added. “Without insects, we cannot enjoy the good taste of plants and vegetables.” Along with the project on larva and host plants, the entomologist has carried out a long-term study on global warming effects on the ecosystem through insects. As the emergence of insects from pupa to butterflies change according to different temperatures, Lee recorded this data for five types of butterflies for eight years to look into whether their life cycle is affected by climate change. “Once you understand the ecology of insects, the global warming impacts are recognizable. Just as flowers tend to blossom earlier, the hibernation period of insects is getting shorter,” he said. Of all the ongoing projects, his top priority has been preserving endangered species such as the Apollo Butterfly, dung beetles and giant water bugs. Starting with only two Apollo Butterflies, Lee has so far reproduced 500 of the butterflies over the past several years. While raising them, he discovered an interesting characteristic three years ago.“It was a cold day when the temperature dropped to around minus 27 degrees Celsius. Surprisingly, one hatched out from the egg in the cold weather. I found out that there is an intracellular freezing substance in the Apollo Butterfly,” he said. “I’m sure this substance can be beneficially used in our life someday.”In a different laboratory, he breeds giant water bugs in a large water tank. Most of the bugs have vanished due to the use of pesticides, Lee said. He spends around 40 million won ($37,000) a year on just feeding them as they only eat large fish. Outside of the institute’s building, the director also raises two cows because their excrement is essential to breeding the nearly extinct dung beetles. “What feeds dung beetles is not the cow’s excrement but the grass in it. Because most cows are forced to eat fodder and not grass these days, dung beetles have not been able to survive,” Lee said. All of these preservation efforts have been possible as HECRI has been designated a “non-habitat preservation institution” by the government, Lee said. Only those with designation can legally undertake the work of increasing the number of endangered insects or animals. As of this year, about 20 organizations are allowed to artificially raise and reproduce endangered species to prevent extinction, the Environment Ministry said. Lee has also been working for 16 years on publishing an illustrated book about some 500 types of larvae, one of the most in-depth in the world, he said. Larval research has not been globally active as it takes a long time and larvae drastically transform during growth, making it difficult to follow the full life cycle ― other studies have focused on only full-grown insects, not larvae. Thousands of types of larvae are still unidentified in Korea, Lee added. “Knowing the characteristics and identities of larvae is important because their substances they have can serve as useful resources,” he said. “Moths have always been killed by pesticides in the agricultural industry. If we know the characteristics of each type of larva, it will help farmers effectively target them with a small amount of pesticide.” The illustrated book is expected to be completed by next year. Lee’s organization is also open to those who want to experience nature and get a glimpse into the insect world. Lee has run on-site biodiversity classes for students since 1997, usually during school vacations. Upon reservation, private classes are also available year-round. The HECRI director was awarded the Camellia Medal of the Order of Civil Merit last year in recognition of his efforts into preserving endangered insects and raising awareness about them. It marked the first time an insect expert received the award. He previously won three other awards including the best environment award from Gangwon Province in 2004. What drives him is not just a love for insects, but also a sense of responsibility as tight budgets and an insufficient labor force sometimes pose challenges. “For me, running HECRI has been a sense of duty for the public. I need to raise both insect experts and endangered species for the country. My only hope is to save as many endangered species on the peninsula as I can,” Lee said.

Just over 10,000 men committed suicide in 2013, compared to just over 4,300 women. This means 39.8 per 100,000 men and 17.3 per 100,000 women committed suicide that year, according to a recent study published by the Korea Institute of Criminology. Korea has one of the highest suicide rates among OECD countries, with 29.1 Koreans per 100,000 people taking their own lives, compared to the OECD average of 12.1. The reasons why men ― and particularly older men ― are at the highest risk for suicide are complex and still being researched, but it can include loss of social status and economic power, and a sense of isolation, said Bark Hyung-min, a research fellow at KIC who led the study.One of the major factors behind the high suicide rate among Korean men could be the traditional gender role that has long expected men to financially support their families, he said. “When Korean middle-aged men get older, fall ill and lose their control of family assets, they become more vulnerable, which might lead to suicide,” Bark told The Korea Herald. The most vulnerable group to suicide were male seniors aged over 80, with 168.9 deaths per 100,000. The suicide rate for those in their 70s and 60s was also much higher than other age groups, at 110.4 and 64.6 per 100,000, respectively. Researcher Bark found two types of Korean elderly males who commit suicide: those who do not want to burden their children and those who grow estranged from their families as they get older.Defying the general pattern that suicide rates are higher for young people than the elderly, Korea saw a rare increase in the number of suicides as men got older, Bark noted. “The socioeconomic burden on Korean seniors seems to be greater than in other countries. The government should invest more resources in expanding welfare for the elderly to tackle the nation’s high suicide rates.” By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","10 000 men committed suicide ,100 000 women committed suicide ,men had double the suicide ,highest suicide rates among oecd ,000 men committed suicide in","['Korea', 'the Korea Institute of Criminology', 'Korea', 'OECD', 'Koreans', 'OECD', 'Bark Hyung - min', 'korean', 'korean', 'Bark', 'the Korea Herald', 'Bark', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Bark', 'korean', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.86787897  0.65093988

Hong Joon-pyo’s stellar legal and political career is facing uncertainty as he faces a prosecutorial summons Friday as a key suspect in a burgeoning graft scandal.The prosecution said Wednesday that it would summon Hong on Friday morning at 10 a.m. to question him over allegations that he received 100 million won ($93,000) from late Keangnam chairman Sung Woan-jong in 2011. Hong is the the first of the eight political heavyweights involved in the high-profile bribery scandal to be questioned by the prosecution.Hong will also sit face-to-face with his junior prosecutors, a drastic turn of events for the former star prosecutor who gained respect and fame after investigating a number of crime rings and brought corrupt high-profile figures to court in the 1980s-1990s.The prosecution decided to call in Hong after the authorities obtained testimony from Yoon Seong-mo, the former vice president of Keangnam Enterprises, who claimed that he was the one who carried the political funds to the former four-term lawmaker four years ago. Hong was then running for chairman of the Grand National Party, the precursor to the ruling Saenuri Party. South Gyeongsang Province Gov. Hong Joon-pyo. (Yonhap)But almost every day, the sharp-tongued governor has intensely resisted authorities’ attempt to press him over the graft allegation. He denied his involvement in the alleged bribery and counterattacked the prosecution, claiming that the officers may have controlled Yoon and fixed his testimony. During the four rounds of interrogations, Yoon testified that he delivered the money to Hong on Sung’s request. Yoon said the then-GNP lawmaker was with him when he gave the money to Hong’s aides, according to the prosecution. The governor tried to water down the claim, raising fresh speculation that Yoon has been making inconsistent testimonies. Hong claimed Yoon’s memory was not accurate because he delivered Sung’s money to many politicians. The bribery allegation escalated after Sung was found dead in an apparent suicide last month with a memo in his pocket that listed the names of eight politicians and the amount of money he claimed to have delivered to them. Hong’s name was listed next to the amount of 100 million won. Hong also argued that the prosecution would not be able to take Sung’s memo or voice recordings as key evidence in court as they are not credible. The prosecution appears confident about the case as authorities have also interrogated Hong’s aide to cross-check Yoon’s testimony. For the prosecution, the outcome of summoning Hong is crucial as they are also tasked to reveal the truth behind the scandal that involves President Park Geun-hye’s close confidants including former Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo and incumbent Chief of Staff Lee Byung-kee.But the question remains on how the prosecution could indict Hong on bribery charges with a lack of concrete evidence to prove him guilty. Pundits said it would not be easy to bring the ex-prosecutor to court as he knows the process well.Hong rose to social stardom as he probed a slot machine gambling case and the politicians behind the illegal underground business in 1993. He also investigated high-profile cases such as the labor-management dispute of Hyundai Heavy Industries in 1987 and organized crime in the early 1990s.He earned his first parliamentary seat in 1996 and served in various high-level posts in the GNP including party chairman, floor leader and Supreme Council member. He was elected as governor in a by-election in December 2012 and was reelected to the post last year.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","he faces prosecutorial summons friday ,prosecutorial summons friday as key ,politicians the bribery allegation escalated ,faces prosecutorial summons friday ,his junior prosecutors drastic turn","['South Gyeongsang Province', 'Hong Joon - pyo ’s', 'Hong', 'Keangnam', 'Sung Woan - jong', 'Hong', 'Hong', 'Yoon Seong - mo', 'Keangnam Enterprises', 'the Grand National Party', 'Saenuri Party', 'South Gyeongsang Province', 'Hong Joon - pyo', 'Yoon', 'Yoon', 'Sung ’s', 'Yoon', 'Hong', 'Yoon', 'Sung ’s', 'Sung', 'Hong', 'Sung ’s', 'Yoon ’s', 'Hong', 'Park Geun', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Lee Byung - kee', 'Hong', 'Hyundai Heavy Industries', 'Supreme Council', 'Cho Chung - un']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28742233  0.16287573

According to Seoul Metropolitan Government, 20.4 percent of male and 19.5 percent of female students in sixth grade were either overweight or obese as of 2013. The average weight of boys was 45.5 kilograms with an average height of 150.5 centimeters.

According to Seoul Metropolitan Government, 20.4 percent of male and 19.5 percent of female students in sixth grade were either overweight or obese as of 2013. The average weight of boys was 45.5 kilograms with an average height of 150.5 centimeters. Girls recorded 43.7 kilograms with a height of 151.2 centimeters, it said. Those with a body mass index or BMI between 25 and 30 are defined as overweight, and above 30 is considered obesity. The BMI is calculated as weight divided by height squared.Other recent local studies have shown that youth obesity is on the rise in the country. The Education Ministry reported that the obesity rate of elementary to high school students increased to 15 percent last year, up 3.4 percent from 2006. Experts warned that childhood obesity can lead to adult obesity.A local study reported that 70 percent of those who were overweight between ages 10 and 13 ended up obese as adults. About 15 percent of 6-month-old obese toddlers and 41 percent of 7-year-old overweight children were also diagnosed as obese as adults. Childhood obesity can cause insulin resistance syndrome risks such as high blood pressure or hyperlipidemia, and even mental problems, the experts added.“To cure child obesity, the matter should be viewed at the family level. Treatment of acknowledgement and behavior correction should be actively taken, not just depending on drugs,” Seoul National University pediatrics professor Moon Jin-soo said at a health conference last month. “The government should pay attention to successful cases in other countries where active public measures lowered the child obesity rate,” he added. Meanwhile, Seoul City data also showed that 84.3 percent of elementary school students in the capital participated in private education last year, a nearly 6 percent drop from 2007. The number of private education hours spent also dropped while the cost soared. Children spent 7.1 hours a week on average at private acadamies, about two hours less than in 2007. The average cost of tuition, however, hiked 25 percent to 365,000 won ($338) per month.As of last year, the total number of elementary school students in Seoul City reached 458,000, the lowest figure since the city government started keeping record in 1965, officials said. The number steadily increased from 565,000 students in 1965 to a record high of about 1.2 million in 1982. The figure, however, began to slide due to the low birthrate, they added. The number of newborns in the capital declined to a record low to 830,500 last year, nearly half of the figure recorded in 1992, the data showed. Children aged between 6 and 11 accounted for 4.4 percent of the city’s total population last year, tumbling by half compared to 1994, it added.

Students with different backgrounds, competence and skills ask different questions. This is a benefit for (students’) work in classrooms,” Dommers told The Korea Herald.Han Dommers, head of the education promotion department at EP-NufficHe explained that having an international classroom can be beneficial in several aspects, such as students are given an opportunity to meet people from other countries and work with them at the early stages of their lives ― the knowledge and network they build helps students pursue professional goals in their later lives.“You gain an interest in the country. When you do business, you know what kind of multinational staff the country has, what they can do there and where to find business,” he said.Dommers added that Dutch people historically understood the importance of the international experience, speaking from his own experience as a former diplomat. Rising as a global force in the 17th century through international trading, Dutch people appreciate the value of understanding and connecting with people from other countries. Even today, a foreign visitor asking for directions in the streets of the Hague can encounter at least a dozen Dutch people ― fluent in English ― eager to help.“I think we’re very open. When people from other countries visit, we are very hospitable,” he said. “The other day, someone wanted to see where Prince Henrik lived and we ended up just talking about the royal family.”Dommers also said Dutch people are not afraid of making mistakes when they speak in English, which is another reason behind their relatively high English skills.“We know we cannot speak perfectly because it’s not our native language. But that is okay because if you don’t speak, you don’t learn. You don’t connect (with people from other countries),” he said.The international aspect of Dutch education is reflected in the country’s some 2,100 higher education study programs and courses conducted in English, the most in continental Europe. This has helped to attract students from across the world to the Netherlands, which in turn has helped to prove the value of an international classroom. “International classrooms in particular can present challenges, because you have people from different backgrounds and cultures,” he said. “You don’t have time to learn everything, so if you talk with people from other countries it is always helpful.”But diversity in education is not just confined to working with classmates of different backgrounds. Dommers said students need to be pioneers to uncover the different aspects of the education. He said they should not be afraid to ask questions and challenge lecturers about their classes and not be content with just being fed the same information.As such, Dommers said the recent rise in online education ― such as Massive Open Online Courses ― have both benefits and shortcomings.“It is still important to meet each other and interact. When you ask questions via the Internet, it’s two-dimensional,” he said. He added that student-teacher interaction, critical to students’ developing creativity, is limited online.Despite its shortcomings, online education can help students with less financial means receive an education at a foreign university. The challenge is how to create ways for students to reap the benefits of an international classroom through the Internet.More open interaction with other students is one thing that some Korean students can work more on, Dommers said. But he also said he was impressed with the diligence and intelligence of Koreans when he worked with them, and Korean students in the Netherlands can help develop a foundation for connecting the two countries in the future.According to Dommers, this “public diplomacy” is a more abstract advantage of diverse education. By maintaining contact and understanding with each other, students from different countries can bring the two countries closer, he said. “What I like about Korean students is that they can become ambassadors for the relationship between Korea and the Netherlands,” Dommers said. “Of course, we need formal ambassadors for diplomatic relations. But in this era, we also need people from other countries who now work and live here to be ambassadors in other things in life.”By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","network they build helps students ,in education diversity helps improve ,challenge lecturers about their classes ,an international classroom international classrooms ,cooperation in education diversity helps","['Nyenrode Business Universiteit', 'Netherlands', 'Netherlands', 'Dutch', 'Han Dommers', 'EP - Nuffic', 'the Korea Herald', 'Han Dommers', 'EP - NufficHe', 'dutch', 'dutch', 'Hague', 'dutch', 'dutch', 'dutch', 'Netherlands', 'korean', 'Koreans', 'korean', 'Netherlands', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Netherlands', 'Yoon Min - sik']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.0905267   0.34455493

Seoul is home to more than 10 million people, about one-fifth of South Korea's population.The number of South Koreans tying the knot in 2014 fell for the third straight year to 305,000, official data showed.This translates into lower birth rates, which South Korea has seen enough of in recent years.In 2014, the birth rate remained at the historic low of 8.6 live births per 1,000 people for the second straight year.Even by absolute terms, South Koreans gave birth to 435,300 babies last year, the second lowest since the data were first collected in 1970.The results intensify concerns that falling birth rates would stem South Korea's growth potential since fewer young people will be able to support a growing number of senior citizens.Last year, South Korea had the fastest aging population among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 34 mostly rich nations.

Moon, however, did not elaborate on whether or not he would retain his post. “Without pointing fingers, we will look back on our deficiency and start afresh with a do-or-die resolution,” Moon said.  Moon Jae-in, the leader of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, attends a party meeting in the National Assembly in Seoul on Thursday. (Yonhap)Moon also urged the party members to stick together as it faces a long-term process of reform.“Taking this as medication, we will reform and integrate the party in a longer-term perspective.”The remark came amid mounting demands for the opposition leader to take responsibility for the defeats and set a new direction for the party’s agenda. Despite Moon’s determination to start afresh, the opposition party is widely expected to be forced to reform ahead of the general elections in April next year. Later in the afternoon, Moon met Ahn Cheol-soo, former party chairman and presidential candidate, at a closed-door meeting to discuss ways to save the troubled party and reunite its members divided over the defeats. During the meeting, Ahn suggested to Moon that they nominate a single candidate for the NPAD’s new floor leader to replace Woo Yoon-keun, as he feared voting may deepen the factional feuds.An interparty feud is likely to intensify between loyalists of former presidents Roh Moo-hyun and Kim Dae-jung as they are expected to clash over control. Moon was one of Roh’s closest allies and the central figure in the pro-Roh faction. But the defeats in the by-election are expected to weaken his leadership in the party and provide a reason for another faction in the party, namely the “DJ line” or the “Dongkyodong faction,” to demand reform.Particularly, the surprising victory of a party defector in the NPAD’s stronghold of Gwangju is expected to boost efforts to create a new opposition bloc. Kim Tae-ho (front), a Supreme Council member of the ruling Saenuri Party, carries party leader Kim Moo-sung on his back during a party meeting in the National Assembly in Seoul on Thursday. (Yonhap)Chun Jung-bae won in the by-election held in Gwangju as an independent candidate after defecting from the NPAD. He said he would gather forces in the Honam, the nation’s southwestern region, and produce new and talented politicians who could inherit the legacy of former President Kim Dae-jung. With his victory, pundits said Chun would start to create his own party with the support from the region before the general election next year. Chun’s move is expected to deal a blow to the NPAD, they added.The ruling Saenuri Party, on the other hand, stepped up efforts to push ahead with its reform drive on labor and the public sector, boosted by its victory in the by-elections on Wednesday. The party took three of four seats up for grabs despite a high-profile corruption scandal involving top government and party officials.Cheong Wa Dae also welcomed the outcome of the election and said it would take it as a message by the people to go ahead with the reform drive.“The latest decision by the people may mean a stern order to end political strife to reenergize the economy and to reform politics,” presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook said.The ruling party is likely to press the opposition party over a reform measure on the public servants’ pension system as the deadline nears. The rival parties have agreed to end the discussion on the reform measure by May 2.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","apologized thursday for the party ,thursday for the party crushing ,to reform politics presidential ,for the party crushing defeats ,alliance for democracy apologized thursday","['Korea', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Moon Jae - in', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'the National Assembly', 'Seoul', 'Moon', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Moon', 'Woo Yoon - keun', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'Moon', 'Roh ’s', 'pro - roh', 'NPAD ’s', 'Kim Tae - ho', 'Supreme Council', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'the National Assembly', 'Seoul', 'Yonhap)Chun Jung - bae', 'Honam', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'Chun', 'Chun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Cheong', 'Dae', 'Min Kyung - wook', 'Cho Chung - un']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51147014  0.26437482

According to the Welfare Ministry, Koreans donated 12.49 trillion won ($11.9 billion) in 2013, which is 1.5 times the donations in 2006 ― 8.14 trillion won. Total donations in 2013 accounted for 0.87 percent of gross domestic product. The ministry said while Koreans are donating more funds, the amount remains low compared to average donations in other countries. In the U.S., the total donations made up 2 percent of its GDP last year, while in New Zealand it was 1.35 percent.In 2013, 34.5 percent of all Koreans aged 15 or older donated funds at least once. In 2006, the figure was 31.6 percent.Data also showed that Koreans in their 40s, those with higher education degrees and with high income tended to donate the most. While 44.9 percent of all Koreans in their 40s were making donations, only 24.8 percent of Koreans in their 20s did so in 2013.More than half of university graduates were making donations, while 17.2 percent of those who finished up to elementary school were doing so. Those who work in high-paid specialized fields, such as physicians and lawyers, were donating the most among all occupations with 58.2 percent, while those who work in the fishing and agricultural industry were donating the least with 25.3 percent.Meanwhile, 17.7 percent of all Koreans aged 15 or older were taking part in volunteer work as of 2013 compared to 13 percent in 1999. Data also found that 55 percent of those who volunteered also donated to charities.Teens were most active in volunteering among all age groups, seemingly related to the additional merits students receive while applying for colleges. Data showed that 75.4 percent of Koreans aged 15 to 19 have volunteered at least once in their lives as of 2013, while 7.8 percent of those in their 60s had the same experience. The largest number of teen volunteers were middle school students.Among adult volunteers, the largest group was working in high-paid jobs and had university degrees. Those who never attended middle school and those who work in the service sector volunteered the least. The ministry said those who make donations or volunteer are more likely to be satisfied with their lives and feel connected to their communities. “We plan to support those who are willing to make donations or volunteer with the right opportunities, and keep track of the statistics every year,” the ministry said.

Almost 50 percent of them said they were willing to put their family’s needs above their own once tying the knot. Young people account for 19 percent of the entire Korean population as of this year, according to data. However, the youth population has been on a constant decline over the last four decades. In the 1970s, they accounted for 35.1 percent of the population and 21.2 percent in 2010. The government expects that they will only make up 11.4 percent of the nation’s entire population by 2060 at the current low birthrate ― 1.19 children per woman.The number of school-aged youths ― ages 6 to 21 ― also decreased from 10 million in 2010 to 8.9 million this year. As of 2015, they accounted for 17.5 percent of the overall population.Meanwhile, the elderly population has continued to grow. Koreans aged 65 or older accounted for 12.6 percent of the total population in 2013, and the proportion of the elderly is forecast to exceed 20 percent by 2026 and 50 percent by 2100.

She finally secured one after 50 failed attempts to even get her resume through the first stage of the job interview. Her efforts included months of listening to special Internet classes and crammed studies for Chinese upon tips that some companies offer merits for multilingual skills. “As more companies opt to hire experienced workers, it seems that the doors for newbies seem to get narrower and more crowded,” Lee said.More than a million inexperienced jobseekers like Lee, have been facing growing competition from experienced candidates for their first jobs, as Korean companies increasingly prefer the latter amid mounting economic uncertainties.According to one of Korea’s biggest job search engines Saramin, one in four job postings on the site were geared toward skilled workers only. Only 5.5 percent of the jobs were posted for inexperienced jobseekers. About half of the total job openings were for both university graduates and those with experience. Companies in certain industries including IT, construction, manufacturing, chemical, design and media have been more actively seeking skilled employees, the tally showed.“We prefer to hire people with work experience of less than five years since they can use their skills at work right away,” said Kim Ji-hoon, who manages human resources at a Seoul-based manufacturing company. “The experienced take only a few months to achieve results while it takes at least a year for companies to train new employees and make sure they adjust to the corporate culture,” he added. For companies, hiring university applicants is part of a long-term investment strategy to nurture future leaders. But the deepening economic downturn deters them from recruiting students, Kim said. Yoon Ji-soo, who delayed her graduation to look for a job, said the situation was “frustrating.” “I can feel that experienced workers have a competitive edge in the job market,” said the 23-year-old, who majored in politics at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.“It is an irony that the companies want experienced workers but at the same time favor young job applicants. We all need somewhere to begin our career, don’t we?” she said. Lee Chang-won, director at Wage and Job Research center in Korea Labor Institute, pointed out that the companies’ preference for skilled employees could increase and prolong the youth unemployment situation, especially during the economic slump.South Korea’s youth unemployment rate stands at 9.2 percent, according to the latest official statistics, much higher than the overall unemployment rate of 4 percent. The real unemployment rate, which includes those marginally attached to the labor force and those employed part time, is over double that at 21.8 percent. However, in the long run, it is positive that more jobs are available for experienced workers, according to Lee.“The increase in labor mobility is necessary to reduce the skills-job mismatch,” the director said. “The society just needs more trainee systems and internship programs to help young job seekers to gain work experience.”By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","korea biggest job search engines ,million inexperienced jobseekers like lee ,years trying to get job ,more than million inexperienced jobseekers ,korea biggest job search","['Lee Hyun', 'chinese', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Saramin', 'Kim Ji - hoon', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'Yoon Ji - soo', 'Hankuk University of Foreign Studies', 'Lee Chang - won', 'Korea Labor Institute', 'South Korea ’s', 'Lee', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",11,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51272762  0.41686007

An index of between 20 and 40 indicates that the two neighbors face heightened tensions, while that between 40 and 60 signifies a mix of both cooperation and conflicts.   The fall in the overall index came as experts assessed that the two countries' mutual exchanges had become less frequent than before.   For one, a sub-index that evaluates inter-Korean relations based on the South's aid to the North and exchange of human resources plunged to 40.5 over the cited period from the previous quarter's 50.4, according to the survey.   ""We should promote open-door policies with North Korea by engaging in more multilateral cooperation and business projects at the non-governmental level,"" said Choi Sung-keun, a researcher at HRI.   The survey, however, said experts have forecast an improved outlook for the current quarter.         Those surveyed said they anticipate the peace index to move up to 40.2 in the second quarter, according to the HRI survey.

It usually consists of two-year contracts.   The average amount of jeonse stood at a record high 71 percent of home prices in the first quarter, it said. Jeonse prices have consistently outpaced home price gains for some time.  ""Low interest rates and less jeonse homes on the market, as home owners switch to monthly rent, are all contributing to the rise in rent for these homes,"" the KDI said.  The think tank said outstanding mortgage loans reached 465.8 trillion won ($435 billion) as of late February, up 3.8 trillion won from a month earlier. The increase in bank loans comes as authorities eased loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios that made borrowing easier.  In the second quarter, the number of new homes reaching the market will rise, but a drop in the number of available homes in Seoul and nearby Gyeonggi Province may push up rent prices, the KDI predicted.

The suicide rate per 100,000 for this age group stood at 7.8, up from 7.4 in 2003.  Ten years ago, traffic accidents topped the list with a rate of 9.6 per 100,000, with suicide coming in second, the report showed.  In 2013, traffic accidents were the No. 2 cause of death with a rate of 4.4 per 100,000, while cancer came next at 3.1.  The nation's suicide rate has been on the rise since the early 1990s. It peaked in 1998 before declining slightly afterwards. Since 2000, the rate has generally been growing again.  On the plus side, the report showed that 7.9 percent of teens thought of suicide in 2014, down 3.3 percentage points from 11.2 percent in 2012. Many said pressure to get good grades and matters related to school caused them to feel suicidal, with economic factors contributing to the pressure.  In regards to health, 61.4 percent of young people between the ages 13 and 24 said they suffered from chronic stress in 2014, with pressure from school and work being the main contributors.   The report showed 9.2 percent of teenagers in middle and high school smoked with 16.7 percent having drunk some form of alcohol.  According to the report, those in the 9-24 age group accounted for 19 percent of the country's total population as of 2013.   The ratio marked the lowest since the related data started to be compiled in 1970, when it stood at 35.1. At this rate, young people will make up just 11.4 percent of the population in 2060.  The sharp decline was attributed to fewer marriages and the country's chronically low birthrate.    Among school-age children, those from multicultural families reached 67,806 in 2014, up a sharp 21.6 percent or 12,026 from the year before. This is equal to 1.1 percent of more than 6.33 million students in the country last year, with numbers expected to rise steadily in the near future.  Internet use among young people, meanwhile, edged up last year compared to 2013. Teenagers spent an average of 14.4 hours per week on the Internet from 14.1 hours the year before.  On social issues, 56.8 percent of young people under 24 said they can live alone without getting married, with 93.5 percent saying they believed in equal rights between men and women, according to the report.

With the growing trend, the figure is estimated to reach 30.1 percent by 2030, it said. Meanwhile, the number of family groups of one child or unmarried adults living with two parents is expected to drop to 25.4 percent by the same year. It recorded 33.6 percent this year, down 16 percent from 2000. Along with single households, the number of other types of “mini-households” is also estimated to hike, officials said. Couple households, which accounted for 13.5 percent this year, are predicted to make up 17.9 percent of the total by 2030. Single-parent households will grow to 11.2 percent, up 0.7 percent from this year, the data said. The number of households with grandparents and grandchildren is also projected to double to 1.3 percent by 2030, it added. The city government said the increasing number of those who are unmarried, divorced or separated contributed to the rise of “mini-households,” along with the low birthrate and growing aging population.

Upon her return, she is expected to find a replacement for Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo, who last week offered his resignation after being accused of receiving money from deceased businessman Sung Woan-jong. Seven others from Park’s administration and the ruling Saenuri Party were also embroiled in the scandal, which is a major blow to Park. Lee has already relayed his duties as premier to Deputy Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan, and Park is expected to accept his resignation shortly after her return home, according to officials.Finding Lee’s replacement appears to be a daunting task, considering the past nomination fiascos that have ailed the Park administration: Three out of five prime ministerial candidates were felled by scandal prior to even taking office. Observers like politics professor Choi Young-jin of Choong-ang University have speculated that Lee’s successor is likely to be a politician with a neutral image to procure support from both ruling and opposition parties.Cheong Wa Dae is reportedly working on finding the next candidate for the premier, although some speculate the actual announcement may come after the parliamentary by-elections slated for Wednesday.Finding Lee’s replacement, however, appears to be the tip of the iceberg as Park faces a bitter struggle to regain the public’s trust.Some of those suspected of receiving money from Sung include people who were in charge of finance at Park’s election campaign during the 2012 presidential election, sparking suspicion the money was used as an illegal election fund.The main opposition New Politics for Alliance has defined the scandal as an illegal election funds case and suggested an independent parliamentary investigation. The party also protested against the ruling party’s “attempt to throw the blame” to the opposition by highlighting questions behind Sung’s special pardon by former President Roh Moo-hyun.“The integrity and legitimacy of Park administration is completely compromised, yet it continues to water down (the scandal) by dragging the opposition along instead of investigating the eight involved,” said NPAD leader Moon Jae-in. He added that Park is the “direct beneficiary” of the alleged transaction since the money supposedly given by Sung was used as election funds. “Park and Cheong Wa Dae must step away from commanding the investigation, and guarantee a fair probe,” Moon said. The Saenuri Party attempted to diffuse public frustration over the weekend.“The president will issue an apology of some form concerning the scandal during the investigation process,” Saenuri Party chief Rep. Kim Moo-sung told reporters Sunday.Kim also said the next prime minister should be someone that could “bring the people together.”Upon her return, Park is expected to boost her political and social reform drive to overhaul the labor, education, public office and finance sectors, but she is likely to be cold-shouldered by the opposition, with intensifying protests from the involved parties.The government has so far warned stern punishment for those participating in last week’s strike against the government’s pension plans, a key element of Park’s social reform.Park’s approval rating dropped 5 percentage points to 34 percentage points immediately after the scandal, according to Gallup Korea. The president’s most recent approval rating ― announced Friday ― went up slightly to 35 percent.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","recent graft scandal that left ,2012 presidential election sparking suspicion ,her recent latin america tour ,presidential election sparking suspicion ,weekend the president will issue","['Park Geun - hye', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Sung Woan - jong', 'Park ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park', 'Lee', 'Choi Kyung - hwan', 'Park', 'Park', 'Choi Young - jin', 'Choong - ang University', 'Lee', 'Dae', 'Park', 'Park ’s', 'New Politics for Alliance', 'Sung ’s', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Park', 'NPAD', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Park', 'Sung', 'Moon', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Kim', 'Park', 'Park', 'Park ’s', 'Gallup Korea', 'Yoon Min - sik']",0,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.43017173  0.53583598

""They said last week they'd be in touch later after dealing with some complicated issues. They said the invitation to Lee still stands.""  Kim was referring to a letter addressed to Lee by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in December. Lee had sent a wreath of flowers across the border to mark the third anniversary of the death of Kim Jong-un's father, Kim Jong-il. In the letter, Kim Jong-un wrote that he was looking forward to having Lee in Pyongyang once the weather got warmer in 2015.  Kim Sung-jae said that because Kim Jong-un may be visiting Russia early in May for Moscow's commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, sometime later in the month will be better suited for Lee's trip.  ""If we don't hear back from our North Korean counterparts later this month or early next month, then we will contact them again,"" Kim Sung-jae said. ""Since Kim Jong-un himself extended the invitation, I don't think we'll need to discuss whether (Lee) will meet with him.""  Lee had first expressed her wish to travel to North Korea for humanitarian purposes when she met with South Korean President Park Geun-hye in October. Park then indicated she would approve such a trip once a formal request is made. North Korea also gave her a green light.  Any trip by South Koreans to North Korea requires the South Korean government's approval along with the North's consent. The two technically remain in a state of war since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.  Lee, 92, made her last trip to Pyongyang in 2011 to attend the funeral of former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. She met with the younger Kim then.  Kim Dae-jung is popular in North Korea for his ""sunshine"" policy of actively pushing cross-border exchanges and reconciliation. After holding the first inter-Korean summit with the then North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, in 2000, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize the same year.  Lee joined her husband on that trip to Pyongyang.  Lee's move comes amid high inter-Korean tension over South Korea's joint military exercises with the United States.  South Korea completed Foal Eagle, its annual joint military exercise with the U.S., last week, as North Korea renewed its yearly threat of retaliation over what it claims is a rehearsal for a northward invasion.  With Foal Eagle out of the way, optimists expect the two Koreas to seek ways to ease tension. Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo, Seoul's point man on Pyongyang, said at a recent press briefing that he was counting on ""more progress"" in the inter-Korean relations after April.  The Koreas, though, have at least one outstanding thorny issue: a wage row at the joint Kaesong Industrial Complex.  They've been embroiled in the wage dispute since North Korea in March unilaterally increased the minimum wage by 5.18 percent to $74. South Korea hasn't accepted the move, saying that the North violated a prior agreement that calls for the two sides to jointly set the wages. The annual increase has been capped at 5 percent.   The two Koreas on Friday agreed to hold further talks on the issue.

The Korean Confederation of Trade Union, one of two major labor groups, staged massive sit-in protests in Seoul and other areas. Organizers claimed about 260,000 workers participated in the strike. At Seoul Plaza, about 8,000 protestors gathered to stage protests. They urged the government to stop labor reform policies, scrap its controversial pension reform plan and raise the minimum wage to 10,000 won ($9.20) per hour.  Thousands of union workers hold a massive sit-in protest at Seoul Plaza on Friday. (Yonhap)The police said it dispatched about 9,500 officers to prevent potential violent clashes. “The rally is inevitable if the government tries to push for labor reform policies and pension reform,” said the KCTU in a statement. “We also demand a raise to the minimum wage.” The government vowed to take stern action as members of the left-leaning teachers group and unionized civil servants were participating in the protests across the country.Ministers released a joint statement Thursday and warned that public officials who attended the protests would face severe punishment. By law, public officials are banned from taking part in collective action. The ministry said it could also press criminal charges against those who orchestrated the protests. The Education Ministry also threatened that teachers would face punishment if they attended the rally, stressing their participation would disrupt classes.Concerns were raised for possible disruption in public offices and schools as teachers and civil servants said they would collectively take paid leave to attend the strike. No major disruption was reported, as some teachers canceled their plans to participate in the rallies or joined the protests after classes, due to fear from the authorities’ warning.

No major violence was reported during the strike as of early afternoon although some clashes are expected from street rallies nationwide slated for later in the day. The Park Geun-hye government's drive for a more flexible labor market and revision of the pension system for government employees have been resisted by unionized workers. The government has pledged to deal sternly with the illegal strike.  Police have threatened to round up key KFTU officials on charges of business obstruction and expel civil servants who join the strike.

The report also showed that about 7 out of 10 children took extra classes, mostly English, at day care centers or kindergarten.Nearly 95 percent of Korean households with children aged 3-5 said they used private education programs, the highest level of all age groups, the report said. World Without Worries About Shadow Education, a civic group, said in its analysis of the survey the education market for the preschool group grew much faster than that of elementary and middle schools. The monthly tuition for private preschool education jumped 29,500 won to 108,400 won per child on average while elementary and middle school programs saw an average rise of 3,000 won per student over a year. The rapid increase of private education costs for preschoolers reflects parents paying much more attention to early education than the past, the group claimed.“The government should come up with a mitigating strategy to address the soaring cost of education for preschoolers,” said Yun Ji-hee, the head of the Seoul-based advocacy group. “We urge the government to review the education program for preschoolers. Before the kids enter (primary) school, for example, learning Korean should come before learning English,” Yun said.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","south korean parents spent trillion ,education parents spent 515 billion ,korean parents spent trillion ,korean parents spent trillion won ,parents spent trillion won billion","['south korean', 'the Korea Institute of Childcare and Education', 'korean', 'Yun Ji - hee', 'Seoul', 'Korean', 'Yun', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",11,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48169234  0.46270242

Groups of left-leaning teachers and unionized public servants said they would also support the general strike, defying the government warnings that all participants would face legal charges.The government on Thursday threatened to take stern action against civil servants and teachers who participate in the protest, saying they would be abandoning their duties and causing social chaos. The Korea Teachers and Education Workers’ Union, or KTU, announced that up to 10,000 of its 53,000 members are expected to take part in the rally and strike, led by the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions. Teachers will take a leave of absence prior to the event in order to minimize setbacks in school lesson plans, the KTU said. Topping the agenda for the KCTU’s general strike are demanding the government to scrap its controversial pension reform plan for public officials, and raising the minimum wage to 10,000 won ($9.20) per hour. The KTU will hold a rally at Seoul Plaza in the afternoon and join the KCTU’s movement in which an estimated 200,000 workers and civil servants are expected to join from across the country. On Saturday, teachers will take part in nationwide protests against the civil servants pension reform.In a meeting of the nation’s vice superintendents, the Education Ministry warned the KTU not to push ahead with its plans.Korean law stipulates that public officials should not take collective action unrelated to their duties and prohibits education workers from partaking in illegal disputes. “Schools must uphold laws in all cases, and teaching and learning should be protected at all times. These must not be infringed by illegal acts of some organizations,” said Vice Education Minister Kim Jae-choon at the meeting. “The ministry condones legal activities by teacher unions, but will sternly deal with illegal actions that infringe upon students’ rights to learn and sparks confusion within education circles.”A ministry official said if the KTU carries out its plans, the ministry would file charges against all participants and demand local education offices conduct disciplinary action. The government Thursday released a joint statement criticizing “illegal action by public officials.”“We are in a critical moment where we have to focus our nation’s efforts on revitalizing the economy. It is regretful that some civil servants’ unions are pushing ahead with the strike, when most of the officials are fulfilling their duties,” it said. Despite the government’s disapproval, the KTU reiterated its decision to go ahead with the strike and rally. “Current law bans teachers from taking part in collective action. Without it, teachers only have limited options to express their opinions,” said the KTU. “The government is violating the human rights of teachers by banning us from rightfully taking a leave of absence to participate in a rally.”By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","nationwide rally friday to protest ,rally friday to protest against ,rally friday to protest ,nationwide protests against the civil ,to hold nationwide rally friday","['the Korea Teachers and Education Workers ’ Union', 'KTU', 'the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions', 'KTU', 'KTU', 'KCTU ’s', 'the Education Ministry', 'KTU', 'korean', 'Kim Jae - choon', 'KTU', 'KTU', 'KTU', 'Yoon Min - sik']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33614752  0.16653863

This followed a 0.6 percent on-year dip in 2012 and 1.3 percent fall in 2013. Last year's numbers are the lowest tallied since 2003, when 302,503 people got married.""The drop stemmed from fewer people in the marriageable age group along with a steady drop in Koreans marrying foreigners,"" said Yoon Yean-ok, director of population statistics at the agency.The decline comes as the average age of people getting married hit an all-time high last year, rising to 32.4 for men from 32.2 in the previous year. The average age for women rose to 29.8 from 29.6.These ages are the highest since 1990, when the agency began to provide related marriage data. At that time, the average age for men to marry was 27.8, with women marrying at an average age of 24.8.The data underscores concerns that a decline in the number of people getting married will result in fewer children down the road.A drop in childbirths can hurt a country's growth potential and lead to a surge in welfare outlays because fewer young people will have to support a growing number of senior citizens.The number of marriages between Koreans and foreigners stood at 23,316 last year, down 10.2 percent from the year before, when the total hit 25,963. These marriages accounted for 7.6 percent of the total number of people tying the knot last year.Last year's numbers mark the fourth year in a row that the number of marriages between Korean nationals and foreigners declined.The data also showed that the number of divorced people totaled 115,510 last year, up 0.2 percent from a year earlier.

As his behavior became distracting, Kim told him numerous times to stop. The student responded by pounding on the desk and swinging his pen with his fingers.Alarmed by the student’s behavior, the teacher consulted with the parents, only to find out the teen was addicted to the Internet. “He was an introvert who didn’t have many friends in school, and both of his parents were working. As an only child, he would spend a lot of time alone at home,” Kim wrote in a report submitted to an NGO specializing in education and youth rights. Students learn about the danger of Internet addiction at a middle school in Seoul. (Yonhap)“Unlike many teens who are addicted to online games, he was actually addicted to online chatting. He said when he was offline, he was constantly worried about what his friends, all of whom he met and interacted with online, would be talking about without him in the chatrooms. Most of his social activities were taking place in cyberspace, and being offline made him feel extremely anxious and isolated.”The student is one of a growing number of South Korean teens who are addicted to the Internet and smartphones. According to the latest government data, the number of teenagers who are at risk of Internet or smartphone addiction has been rising over the past three years.As of last year, 29 percent of all teenagers were at risk of smartphone addiction, while 12.5 percent were at risk of Internet addiction disorder. Data also found that children of double-income families and single-parent households are most likely to develop media addiction.“Most addictions are not just caused by what people are addicted to. For example, game addiction is not solely caused by the game itself. There is always something else,” said Cho Hye-jin, who has met teen Internet addicts at the National Information Society Agency. “A lot of the times, teen Internet addicts have problems with their relationships with their family members or friends. It can also be related to a lack of parental presence or attention. Very often, they start by using the Internet, games and SNS as a way to indulge their social or emotional needs (that are not being met by their parents).”Symptoms of Internet addiction can have extremely negative effects on teenagers and their lives, experts said. Signs of addiction include difficulty waking up for school, feelings of anxiousness when they are not online including shakiness and moodiness, sleep disturbance and having trouble completing tasks at school and home. The addiction may also lead to isolation from family and friends.One of the teen smartphone addicts currently being treated at the National Information Society Agency physically attacked her parents when she had her smartphone taken away. The middle school student threatened to commit suicide if she did not get her phone back, and repeatedly claimed that she would be bullied at school if she did not constantly participate in KakaoTalk group conversations. The teen was eventually taken to the agency after her parents thought she was spending too much time alone with her phone.“Children who are addicted to the Internet have a high chance of missing out on normal teen life and experiences, which are crucial for the successful transition into adulthood,” said Kim Sung-byuk, who oversees media policies for teenagers at the Gender Equality Ministry.An unhappy childhood or teenage years may also lead to addiction. A man in his early 20s was treated at the National Information Society Agency last year for online game addiction. Growing up, he was often emotionally abused by his stepfather, while his mother was negligent. When he was bullied as a teenager by his classmates, he was not convinced that his parents would help him, so he endured the abuse without telling anyone. However, he received good grades and eventually enrolled in a university, but soon afterward he became addicted to online games. Before seeking help at the agency, he had been skipping all of his classes to play games in his room alone. He claimed it was the only way for him to “relieve stress and communicate with the world.”“The key is to find out exactly what caused the addiction, rather than simply getting rid of what the person is addicted to,” said Cho from the agency. “Banning games from game addicts won’t solve the situation. Once the real cause of the addiction, such as family problems, is solved, the addiction usually goes away naturally. This is why parents of teen addicts are also encouraged to receive therapy, because they can very often be the cause of their child’s addictive behaviors.”Meanwhile, the number of double-income families keeps increasing in Korea. As of 2013, there are more than 5 million double-income households, accounting for 43 percent of all households in the country. Psychiatrist Jeong Yu-sook from Samsung Medical Center said a lack of parental presence, combined with smartphone overuse, may generate undesirable consequences for children and teenagers. “It just takes away their chance to socialize as young children,” she said. “When a person is not socialized enough as a child or a teenager, they have a higher chance of developing personality disorders, such as narcissistic personality disorder.”A high school teacher, who only wanted to be identified with her last name Oh, feels today’s hyper-connected culture inevitably affects the way Korean teenagers socialize with one another ― but not necessarily in a positive way.“I’ve seen my students using KakaoTalk for occasions that require you to do it in person or at least through a phone call,” she said. “They’d break up with their boyfriends or girlfriends by sending a single text message. They’d cut off all contact with someone they didn’t want to be friends anymore ― by just ignoring texts and not texting at all ― instead of explaining in person why they wanted to end the relationship. This concerns me about our next generation.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","middle school math teacher noticed ,internet addiction at middle school ,personality disorder high school teacher ,school math teacher noticed ,jung middle school math teacher","['Kim Seon - jung', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'Cho Hye - jin', 'the National Information Society Agency', 'SNS', 'the National Information Society Agency', 'KakaoTalk', 'Kim Sung - byuk', 'the Gender Equality Ministry', 'the National Information Society Agency', 'Cho', 'Korea', 'Jeong Yu - sook', 'Samsung Medical Center', 'korean', 'KakaoTalk', 'Claire Lee']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65092951  0.12287457

The government is committed to pushing forward key reforms in the labor market aimed at helping young people find work, resolving uncertainties surrounding standard wages and reducing overall working hours, he said.Extending the country's retirement age will be linked to the introduction of a wage peak system that can be a win-win arrangement for both older and younger generations, Choi added.""The goal is to pass labor-related bills through parliament this month,"" Choi said. ""Timing is extremely important. Further delays will adversely affect expectations for an economic recovery.""If labor unions want to do the right thing and tackle critical issues such as youth unemployment, they should try to engage in constructive dialogue, he said.Earlier this week, the labor ministry made clear that staging a strike over government policies or future legislative action is not allowed under the country's labor law.The KCTU insists that the government is trying to implement changes that will worsen labor market conditions and hurt the livelihoods of ordinary citizens.The upcoming strike aims to halt the government's push, the labor union said, adding that it will use the walkout to compel the government to raise minimum pay to 10,000 won ($9.20) per hour and compel it to respect basic labor rights.The KCTU said some 70 percent of its members will join the one-day walkout, with teachers, government employees, metal and construction workers as well as those in the clerical and service sectors to participate.

About 15,000 adults aged 30 or older in Seoul City and Gyeonggi Province die earlier than they otherwise would each year because of air pollution, especially fine dust, the report said. This accounts for about 16 percent of the yearly death toll of those aged over 30 in the two regions. The report was jointly authored by occupational and environmental medicine professor Leem Jong-han at Inha University and environmental engineering professor Kim Soon-tae at Ajou University. The study was conducted to look into the effects of fine dust on the death rates in the regions. Fine dust or particulate matter, or PM-10, refers to airborne particles 10 micrometers or less in diameter. It is known to cause respiratory problems and other diseases, especially in toddlers and the elderly. The study showed that fine dust contributed to the rising hospitalization rate among all generations.Fine dust contributed to some 55,000 hospitalizations for asthma attacks and 12,000 hospitalizations for respiratory problems each year. About 12,000 people were also hospitalized for cardiovascular diseases, it said. The researchers also noted that PM-10 caused some 1,400 cases of lung cancer. This is the first time that lung cancer has been directly attributed to fine dust, it added. They projected that the death rate would rise if pollution levels remained the same, to more than 25,000 a year by 2024. But they said the toll may fall to about 10,900 if the government meets its PM-10 reduction target of 30 micrograms per cubic meter in the metropolitan area. “From a public health perspective, reducing the fine dust level is critical in lowering the death toll in the metropolitan area,” Leem said.

Inside its 13th-century castle estate, students from all over the world discuss issues of international business. Nyenrode was founded by Dutch industry leaders such as KLM, Shell and Philips in 1946. Since then, it has focused on showing students how to cope with dynamic, real-world challenges instead of simply transferring knowledge.“It’s not about theory ― it’s about practice. Can you use that theory tomorrow? This is why we invite a lot of our alumni and top entrepreneurs to also teach here,” said Misa Dzoljic, a rector magnificus and the CEO of the school. His title alone offers hints at the school’s principles of “for and by business.”Potential applicants of the Nyenrode Business Universiteit’s MBA program pose at the University campus. (Nyenrode Business Universiteit)Entrepreneurship along with leadership have always been one of the university’s key values, he explained, but it is just as important for future leaders to be responsible. While it is important for leaders to seek profit for their organization, Dzoljic explained that leadership and entrepreneurship without stewardship can be “devastating” in the business world. Balancing leadership and entrepreneurship is essential in ensuring that people take responsibility not only for stakeholders but also for the future generations he said.Bob de Wit, professor of strategic leadership, pointed out that social responsibility is one of biggest changes for today’s companies. He took the example of Nike, a behemoth in the field of sports products which became embroiled in a scandal over child labor.De Wit pointed out that students from the University of Oregon ― which had a close relationship with the company ― worked to form a governance organization that monitored its activities to ensure that it acted socially responsible. “Only on the basis of meeting the society’s needs, you can be profitable,” he said.Nyenrode has made plenty of efforts not to become outdated in a rapidly changing society. As part of such efforts, it has emphasized practical learning and firsthand experience in the business world. In the course of practical learning, students are challenged to understand, analyze and come up with the ideal solution for the challenge at hand. Last month, an “MBA Weekend” for potential applicants of the school’s international MBA program took place. During the weekend, students participated in one of the program’s classes where they were to provide business consultation for a newly appointed fictional company leader dealing with an embezzlement case.In the animated discussions that ensued, they presented various options including firing the corrupt officials, sending them to a lower position, conducting an internal probe and even leaking the case to the press.“If I was the CEO in this situation, I would’ve stopped the presentation and said that’s enough,” said Christo Nel, program director of the full-time international MBA and executive MBA programs, during one of the presentations. His issue was not that the ideas were bad, but the dragging first minutes of the presentation.Speaking from his experience running a business consulting firm, Nel explained that the CEO would not sit through a presentation where the content is what he or she already knows.“Students are required to move from merely understanding the problem to deeply analyzing and coming up with execution plans,” he said. “This is the key thing that management and organizations want. They want people who can not only analyze the situation, but also come up with recommendations on how to (address) it.”Also for lecturers in MBA courses, it is important to understand that teaching everything one knows is impossible, Nel said. The main thing is to select key pieces of information needed to stimulate students’ learning.“We want to create people who are critical thinkers, analysts, decision-makers and executioners of plan,” Nel explained.In the course of training for such qualities, students are asked to self-evaluate their goals, merits and motivations, explained Victoria Bressers, the school’s adviser for careers and personal development. In addition, students are also motivated to become leaders.“As a student, you learn to work in groups, and you don’t always work with people you get on well with. Students learn how they work best and how they can get the best out of other people, because that is (the) quality of a leader,” she said.While discussion-based lessons are relatively common in education today, perhaps one of Nyenrode’s most distinctive offerings is its “Meet the CEO” sessions, in which participants of the international MBA programs visit organizations to interact with the CEO and his or her team. Desiree Van Gorp, Nyenrode’s associate dean of degrees programs, explained that such a method allows students to get a better feel for the industry and learn which issues are at stake in the actual field.“The idea is to have students get different experiences working with many different companies,” she said. “They also get to see what the CEOs are like and how they got to where they are right now.”Students are also given an opportunity for practical application of their knowledge while building their network at the professional level. The point, however, is not to just acquire experience, but to make plausible solutions for the organization related to problems it may be facing. “It demands a lot from the student. You don’t just sit there ― you are really required to deliver.”Dzoljic explained that the university has been keeping a close relationship with the business world. He added this is why many of the faculty members retain positions outside the university.“We encourage, sometimes demand that they (the faculty) are practicing outside, so they know what is going on outside these beautiful walls. This is very important for students because they will see immediately when (professors) are just teaching out of books,” he said.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","founded by dutch industry leaders ,the country only private university ,mba weekend for potential applicants ,campus nyenrode business universiteit entrepreneurship ,newly appointed fictional company leader","['dutch', 'Amsterdam', 'Breukelen', 'Vecht', 'Nyenrode Business Universiteit', 'dutch', 'KLM', 'Shell and Philips', 'Misa Dzoljic', 'the Nyenrode Business Universiteit ’s', 'University', 'Dzoljic', 'Bob de Wit', 'Nike', 'De Wit', 'the University of Oregon', 'Christo Nel', 'Nel', 'Nel', 'Nel', 'Victoria Bressers', 'Desiree Van Gorp', 'Yoon Min - sik']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41336873  0.64249402

A total of about 10,000 people protested at Gwanghwamun Square, a place where demonstrations have been taking place on-and-off since the ferry sinking. They clashed with the police as they were attempting to march toward Cheong Wa Dae.  Supporters of the victims of the Sewol ferry sinking clash with police on Saturday as they march toward Gwanghwamun Square in Seoul. (Yonhap)The police used water cannons and pepper spray to push the protesters away from the police line. In response, some protestors damaged police buses and tore away police protective gear. A total of 100 protestors were taken into custody for police investigation.Police said Sunday 74 of its men were injured. Reports said nine of the bereaved families and activists were hurt during the clash.The police came under fire for infringing upon the right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. Amnesty International called the police action an “unnecessary use of force” and that it constituted “an insult to the victims and a violation of the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly,” in a press release on Friday. “The clampdown against an overwhelming peaceful protest is totally unjustified, unnecessary and an insult to both the victims of the Sewol ferry tragedy and their families,” said Arnold Fang, East Asia Researcher at Amnesty International.The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy jumped into the criticism, comparing the police’s decision to take 100 protestors into custody to actions taken during the authoritarian military regime in South Korea in the 1970s.“We are frustrated with the demise of civil rights and democratic values in Korea. We urge the police to release those taken into custody, including relatives of the victims of the ferry sinking and average citizens,” said NPAD Spokesperson Kim Sung-soo.Police held a press briefing on Sunday and said all those who violated the law will be punished.For this, they will set up an investigative headquarters at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency and create special teams for the probe at 15 other district police agencies.“A number of officers were hurt while police equipment and buses were damaged,” the police said, adding that they would seek compensation from the rally’s organizer.The Sewol ferry sank on April 16, 2014, leaving 295 dead and nine missing.

I hope that you will join that effort,” added Kim, who is a former professor at the Communist College in the North. Kim defected to the South in 2004.Touching on the North’s cyber capabilities, Kim highlighted the role of Bureau 121, a key unit that he said consisted of “gifted” cyber-warriors in their 20s. The unit is conducting a campaign, dubbed the “Plan to Investigate International Natural Energies,” in which the North conducts hacking missions to steal technological information from the U.S., Britain, France, China and Russia.

The main opposition, New Politics Alliance for Democracy, also vowed a low-key campaign. “We will refrain from singing campaign songs and shouting political slogans. We will wear yellow ribbons in honor of the victims of the Sewol sinking,” said an official from the opposition party. The election is scheduled to take place on April 29 and will fill four seats in Seoul, Gwangju, Incheon, and in Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province. Three seats in Seoul, Gwangju and Seongnam were vacated by the Unified Progressive Party’s dissolution by the Constitutional Court in December. A seat in Incheon is also being contested as the incumbent lawmaker lost his seat after he violated election laws. Constituents in Seoul’s Gwanak-B and Gwangju’s Seo-gu have traditionally favored liberal parties. Since the 13th general election in 1988, liberal party candidates have won every election in those districts. On the other hand, constituents in Incheon and Seongnam have voted for conservative parties in recent years. Political experts said the coming election will be influenced by graft scandals surrounding deceased businessman Sung Wan-jong, who claimed he gave illicit money to high ranking government officials. “The latest events could work in favor of the NAPD,” said Lee Jung-hee, political science professor of Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. “But that doesn’t mean the NAPD will be assured of victory.

Among the surveyed women aged 30 to 64, those who received education for seven years or less were eight times more likely to develop diabetes than women who received education for 12 years or more.Also, women who belong to the poorest 25 percent of the same age group were five times more likely to develop the disease than those who belong to the wealthiest 25 percent. Socioeconomic status and education level play an important role in health care and prevention of diabetes, according to experts. (Yonhap)“Public policies for the prevention and management of diabetes should be targeted toward people of lower socioeconomic status, especially middle-aged females,” the researchers, led by professor Kim Dae-jung, wrote in the paper.“The association between the prevalence of diabetes and education level was more prominent in females and did not change after full adjustment for family history of diabetes, BMI, smoking status, alcohol intake, physical activity, and residence.”The study found that Koreans with higher socioeconomic status consume more vegetables and fruits, exercise more, and visit doctors more frequently than low-income earners. They also consumed less fat and sugar, and had lower blood pressure than those who belonged to the poorest 25 percent.Overseas studies have long shown that people with higher levels of education and higher income have lower rates of many chronic diseases than those with less education and lower income.According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S., women in their 20s and over with no university degrees were more likely to be obese than those with a bachelor’s degree or higher from 2007 to 2010. Also, 23 percent of all children raised by parents who had less than a high school education were obese in the same time period, while only 9 percent of children with parents with a higher education degrees had the same condition according to a CDC report released in 2012. Another recent Korean study has also showed that less educated Korean women have a higher chance of dying of cancer, especially breast and cervical cancers. The study, organized by Samsung Medical Center, showed that the effects of socioeconomic inequality on women’s cancer mortality were rising in Korea. Diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases suffered by Korea’s elderly population. As of last year, 22.6 percent of all Koreans aged 65 or older have diabetes, while 90 percent of all elderly people have chronic diseases including diabetes, high blood pressure and arthritis. While some of the biggest risk factors for diabetes are obesity and unhealthy diets, one third of Korea’s elderly population was obese as of last year. Obesity is also more prevalent in elderly women than men in Korea. As of 2012, 40 percent of Korean women aged 65 or older were obese, while only 25.7 percent of their male counterparts were.While Korea is one is one of the most-educated nations in the world ― 80 percent of young Koreans aged 25 to 34 attended university as of 2012 ―- the vast majority of today’s elderly population, 92 percent, did not receive higher education. According to government data, 32 percent of the elderly never attended middle school, while 30.5 percent of them never received any education at all as of last year. However, the study by Ajou University found that the association between diabetes and education in middle-aged men was less pronounced ― prevalence was nearly six times higher in the least-educated group. The association between income and diabetes among the same group was only significant for men in the poorest quartile.And there was no significant association between the prevalence of diabetes and education level among the Korean elderly, regardless of their sex. The risk of diabetes, heart disease and stroke goes up as people get older. Kim, who organized the research, pointed out that a previous study in southern Germany had shown similar results among the senior population. “Age may attenuate the effect of socioeconomic status on diabetes among the elderly,” he wrote in the study.Dr. Song Yoon-mi, who researched the cancer mortality rate of Korean women earlier this year, said the statistics show that low education level may have a higher impact on women’s lives than men’s, as well as their physical and emotional well-being. Limited knowledge and lack of access to information are some of the factors that increase women’s risk of dying of illnesses. The number of Korean women who never finished elementary school and died of breast cancer increased from 4,250 in 2001 to 14,550 in 2011.“Certainly, more women are educated today than in the past,” Song said. “But this also means that todays’ women with low education level may experience more discrimination and disparity nowadays.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","14 000 patients with diabetes ,000 patients with diabetes nationwide ,diabetes in middle aged korean ,women cancer mortality were rising ,socioeconomic inequality on women cancer","['korean', 'Ajou University', 'yonhap)“public', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'BMI', 'Koreans', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'U.S.', 'CDC', 'korean', 'korean', 'Samsung Medical Center', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Koreans', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Koreans', 'Ajou University', 'korean', 'Kim', 'Germany', 'Song Yoon - mi', 'korean', 'korean', 'song', 'Claire Lee']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41418806  0.49966514

One of the biggest factors behind this growth is the country’s growing elderly population, many of whom prefer traditional Korean medicine over Western medicine, according to the government. More than 60 percent of Koreans who visited traditional medicine clinics last year were aged 50 or older, and the largest number of patients sought help for back pain and hip or lumbar dislocations. “Traditional Korean medicine has been traditionally preferred by the elderly for pain-related conditions because it offers non-surgical treatment options, such as acupuncture,” said Ji Eun-young from the Health Insurance and Assessment Service. “Since the country’s baby boomers, who are currently aged 51 to 59, are entering their 60s this year, the spending on traditional Korean medicine is inevitably rising,” said Kim Han-jung, another official at the agency. “The population of baby boomers is as big as the total elderly population.”The largest number of all patients ― 60 percent ― chose to receive acupuncture, while 16.2 percent sought cupping treatment, a therapeutic technique which involves suction. Among all patients, 64 percent were women.The number of traditional medicine clinics and doctors have also increased since 2010. The number of clinics increased from 12,637 on 2010 to 14,093 last year, while the number of doctors rose from 20,356 to 23,653 in the same period. Some in the health sector say the reason many elderly patients prefer traditional Korean medicine has to do with Korea’s low rates of prescriptions of pain killers, including opioids. Koreans are prescribed less than 47 percent of the opiate consumption level that the WHO considers adequate for chronic pain relief, according to 2010 data. “As many elderly patients often fear the adverse effects of opioids, they look for other options, such as acupuncture or hot springs,” said Lee Jong-ho, director of international drugmaker Mundipharma’s Korea and Southeast Asia division.Prior to the release of government data, there had been an intense debate whether or not it was ethical ― or even safe ― for traditional Korean doctors to use conventional medical equipment, such as ultrasound and X-ray machines. Currently, the Korean law allows traditional medical professionals to use all non-traditional medical scanning equipment except for MRI and CT scanners. However, a number of traditional doctors have faced lawsuits filed by doctors who practice Western medicine, who claim it is dangerous for those who are not trained in medical science to use any conventional medical equipment. According to Lee Jin-woo, who oversees Korean traditional medicine policies at the Health Ministry, a number of cases have been won by conventional doctors in the past ― which eventually prohibited the specific traditional doctors from using certain devices. As a part of its deregulation agenda, the Office of Government Policy Coordination announced earlier this year that it was considering a law that lets traditional doctors to use non-traditional medical devices without having to worry about being sued by regular physicians. The announcement triggered fierce opposition from the Korean Medical Association, which represents 100,000 physicians. “By considering to allow traditional doctors to use medical equipment without any regulations, the government is putting the citizens’ health and safety at risk,” the KMA said in a recent statement.The Association of Korean Medicine, a representative body of Korean traditional doctors, said the latest statistics proved that Koreans needed more traditional medicine that is combined with modern technology.“The demand is certainly there, and we are aware that the majority of patients who come to us are those with joint problems or suffering from chronic pain,” said Kim Ji-ho, the spokesman of the organization.“Once we are allowed to use X-ray machines and ultrasound, we would be able to offer more quality services to those with joint or muscle problems, as it will make it easier for us to make a more accurate diagnosis.”In spite of the increase, however, the total amount spent on traditional Korean medical care only accounts for 4 percent of total medical spending last year, according to the Health Ministry.

337,337,Half-price college tuition is hardly complete,"The Education Ministry and Rep.

Kim Sang-min of the ruling Saenuri Party held a forum on Tuesday on the Park Geun-hye administration’s “half-price” college tuition policy. In a self-styled pat on the back, they deemed it a “mission accomplished” and talked about future challenges. Their “celebration,” however, seemed to leave many college students perplexed. They asked how the government could deem their job complete when actual tuition costs remain largely unchanged, let alone cut in half as promised by Park as one of her key presidential campaign pledges.According to Korea Higher Education Research Institute, the average tuition for private and public colleges in 2014 were 7.34 million won and 4.18 million won, respectively, compared to 7.39 million and 4.19 million in 2012 when the policy officially kicked off. “What has changed? My friends and I still pay pretty much the same amount for tuition,” said a student surnamed Yoo at Ewha Womans University.Such disparity in perception stems from the fact that the governmental policy, while called half-priced tuition, is actually about reducing the financial burden for tuition by repressing tuition hikes, encouraging colleges to expand their scholarship programs and increasing state-funded scholarships for students from low-income families.According to the ministry, the annual college tuition at all public and private colleges reached about 14 trillion won in 2011. The state scholarship program for 2015 is earmarked at 3.9 trillion won, while the colleges’ overall scholarships account for 2.4 trillion won, and the accumulated amount of tuition cuts between 2012 and 2015 is expected to be about 710 billion won. This adds up to about 7 trillion won, half of the 14 trillion won, thus halving the financial burden on class fees for students, at least according to the ministry. Mission accomplished? Hardly.The 2.4 trillion won in school scholarships is a key factor in the policy. But the colleges were already providing 1.8 trillion won worth of scholarships in 2011, independent of the half-price tuition policy.While the actual increase is only by 600 million won, the ministry was seen to be highlighting the total amount of 2.4 trillion won, leading many to misperceive the actual scope of government-led measures as bigger than it actually is.“(The ministry) is just basically playing with words here. By definition, additional acquirement (of scholarships) should be separated from the already existing ones,” an official from the KHERI pointed out.Apart from the contentious use of the term “half-price tuition,” there is also no guarantee that colleges nationwide would continue to refrain from raising tuition fees.Earlier this year, Ewha announced that it would raise its tuition by 2.4 percent, the maximum amount set by the government this year. But after an unscheduled visit by Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea, the university abruptly announced that it would freeze the fees, sparking suspicions that Hwang’s visit may have pressured one of the priciest universities in Korea to alter its plans. This raises another question about the policy’s sustainability: Will the minister have to pay a special visit to each university and college every time it decides to defy the government guidelines?In its earlier report, the KHERI has pointed out that the cut-price tuition policy depends largely on the colleges’ efforts. Even Hwang himself has acknowledged that securing various sources of funding to supplement the policy was crucial to keeping it running.The KHERI official also pointed out that the ministry has drastically cut the budget for “type 2” scholarships. The type 2 scholarship is provided as an incentive for colleges that choose not to raise tuition.“Right after the type 2 was introduced, the average tuition at private and public colleges dropped by 4.7 percent and 3.9 percent. But after the budget cut, the cut rate dwindled noticeably,” he said. According to the KHERI, the tuition cut rates at the colleges dropped to 0.3-0.5 percent below those in 2013-2014. There has even been talk about abolishing the type 2 scholarship altogether, but experts have raised concerns that it will lead to a series of tuition hikes.How long can the Education Ministry repress overall tuition hikes? If the colleges choose not to comply, what would be its countermove? Is it even plausible as a long-term plan?The “success” of the half-price college tuition policy comes with multiple strings attached ― ones that the government has to address before touting its “accomplishments.” By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","repressing tuition hikes encouraging colleges ,party held forum on tuesday ,tuition hikes encouraging colleges ,ministry the annual college tuition ,tuition hikes encouraging colleges to","['the Education Ministry', 'Kim Sang - min', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park', 'Korea Higher Education Research Institute', 'Yoo', 'Ewha Womans University', 'KHERI', 'Ewha', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'Hwang', 'Korea', 'KHERI', 'KHERI', 'KHERI', 'the Education Ministry', 'Yoon Min - sik']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.09513829  0.55943674

Almost one-third of elderly women, in particular, were living by themselves. The number of elderly people who lived by themselves increased from 13.6 percent to 23 percent from 1994 to 2014. “Living on one’s own can lead to social isolation and this puts elderly women at a greater risk especially in emergency situations,” the report said. Also, only 18.3 percent of elderly women were receiving national pension payments last year, while 50 percent of their male counterparts were benefitting from the public pension service. Most women in the postwar generation, who are today’s senior citizens, lived as housewives and did not pay pension premiums as they never participated in the labor force.Also, 78.6 percent of elderly women were suffering from two or more diseases at the same time last year, compared to about 63 percent of elderly men. Female seniors were also more prone to depression and lack of functional independence, such as the inability to walk, than elderly men.Almost 90 percent of all senior citizens were suffering from chronic diseases such as high blood pressure and diabetes as of last year. More than 80 percent of the elderly were spending their leisure time watching TV. The number of senior citizens who received higher education increased from 2.1 percent to 7.8 percent from 1994 to 2014. At the same time, 32 percent never attended middle school, while 30.5 percent of the elderly never received an education at all.Meanwhile, 89 percent of all respondents said they opposed the idea of receiving life-sustaining medical treatment ― any treatment that serves to prolong life without reversing the underlying medical condition ― should they be diagnosed with an incurable disease.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","public pension service most women ,32 percent of elderly women ,korean elderly women ,pension service most women ,pension service most women in","['korean', 'Claire Lee']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23603022  0.14896627

I couldn’t see her before going to bed. And when I woke up this morning, she already left for work.”“It’s OK! It’s OK!” the kids tell him loudly with impish grins, as the teacher consoles him. “Going to work doesn’t mean your mom doesn’t love you. I’m sure she misses you at work right now.” Parents participate in a reading session at a state-run child care center in Gangil-dong, Seoul on March 11. Seoul City has designated every Wednesday of a second week as an open child care center day for better interaction between teachers and parents. (Yonhap)At Sungwon, one of the state-run day care centers, children arrive as early as 7:30 a.m. and stay as late as 9 p.m. Many of them are children of double-income families, whose parents don’t have any extended family members to help with child care. As of 2013, there are more than 5 million double-income households in Korea, accounting for 43 percent of all households in the country. With an increasing number of women in the workforce, along with poor work-life balance, more young parents are said to be suffering from parental stress, which inevitably reflects on the well-being of their children.Park Chun-hwa, one of the day care workers at Sungwon, said she’s been witnessing a growing number of children with behavioral and developmental problems ― many of them apparently resulting from the lack of interaction with their parents. One of the kids she’s taken care of, who was 3 years old, hadn’t been toilet trained and arrived at the center wearing diapers on his first day.“I would train him during weekdays, but he’d return the next week in wet diapers again,” she told The Korea Herald. “Being busy as a working parent is one thing. But there are also responsibilities that all parents should be fulfilling.”For a 30-year-old working mother surnamed Jung with a 4-year-old son, the biggest challenge about child care is the sense of helplessness. With both her parents and in-laws living about four hours away from Seoul, Jung currently sends her child to a day care center, where he spends about eight to 10 hours a day. “On top of the stress from work, the worst feeling is this sense of living in the dark,” she told The Korea Herald. “I’m supposed to be in charge of child care but very often I have no idea if I’m doing it right. My son was a late talker, and I was devastated thinking it was my fault (because I couldn’t quit my job for him). I would constantly think I may be doing something wrong and it would make me anxious, guilty and even depressed.”Overseas studies have long shown that personal stress influences a parent’s behavior toward their children. Parents who are financially struggling or having marriage stress have a higher chance of abusing ― or neglecting ― their children, according to a 1991 study by Michigan State University.Along with stress, social isolation of a parent because of having to raise a child alone has also been linked to child abuse and neglect, according to a 2002 report by the World Health Organization. On top of poor work-life balance, the limited number of public day care centers has been a problem for many parents in recent years. While the state-run facilities ― known for their quality programs and cheaper tuition ― have been popular among parents, very few have benefited from the service because of their scarcity. As of 2012, public day care centers only accounted for 5.2 percent of all day care facilities in the country, according to Korea Institute of Child Care and Education.But ultimately, healthy and constructive child care depends on individual efforts by the parents, experts said.Choi Yoon-sook, the president of Sungwon Day Care Center, said it was important for parents to actively seek help for parental stress if needed and educate themselves on child care. Physical and mental well-being of a parent, as well as their awareness and knowledge, are important for their child’s development, she said.“Children are a mirror of their parents,” she said. “If a child is not paying attention when someone else is talking, the chances are his parents don’t pay attention to him when he tries to talk to them.”Choi said a significant factor in parental abuse is that many of the abusers mistake violence as a way to discipline their children. In Korea, the number of child abuse cases increased by 44 percent last year from 2013, with 80 percent of the abusers being parents.According to the 2002 WHO report, many child abuse survivors develop a number of psychological problems, including anxiety disorders and depression as well as feelings of shame and guilt.“This is why educating parents is important,” she said. “I really think there should be more support and educational programs for young parents.”For working parents with limited time, Choi said it’s about quality not quantity. “Try to give your full attention to your child every day, even if it means just 30 minutes a day,” she said. “You have to be consistent. The point is to do it every day and build trust over time. This eventually lets your child know that you care in spite of your busy schedule.”An Hui-jean, a professional counsellor, advises parents to put their spouses before their children, as “happy marriages produce happy children.” Most Korean families have traditionally been child-centric, she said, meaning many parents would sacrifice their marital or personal happiness to support their children. “Your first priority should be your spouse and yourself, not your children ― always,” she said. “Marriage, not children, is the foundation of a family. Studies have shown that those who were raised by content parents who put their marriage first are happier than those who grew up in child-centric homes led by unhappy parents or parents with marital conflict.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","my mom came home late ,every morning at sungwon daycare ,classroom why the whole class ,mom came home late ,mom came home late last","['Seongsu - dong', 'Seoul', 'Gangil - dong', 'Seoul', 'Seoul City', 'Yonhap)At Sungwon', 'Korea', 'Park Chun - hwa', 'Sungwon', 'the Korea Herald', 'Jung', 'Seoul', 'Jung', 'the Korea Herald', 'Michigan State University', 'the World Health Organization', 'Korea Institute of Child Care and Education', 'Choi Yoon - sook', 'Sungwon Day Care Center', 'Korea', 'who', 'Choi', 'Hui', 'korean', 'Claire Lee']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42529294  0.4174352

Yoon Myung-hwa (center), Seoul education office’s students’ rights officer, arrives at Choongam High School in northern Seoul to verify allegations about the school’s actions regarding school meals on Wednesday. YonhapIn doing so, the vice principal is said to have used coarse words ranging from “stop eating” to “beat it.”He is also said to have checked each student’s name from a list and told them how much they owed in meal fees in front of other students. With the incident receiving extensive media coverage, and going viral on the Internet, the school’s principal issued an official statement through the school’s home page on Tuesday.In the statement, principal Bang Sang-kuk said that the vice principal denies using coarse language, but that he would take “appropriate action” if related reports prove to be true. The vice principal also posted a statement saying that he could not help but check the list as the school is weighed down with snowballing late payments. According to the statement, about 6 million won ($5,500) of meal fees was unpaid in March, and that those who graduated earlier this year left nearly 40 million won in unpaid meal fees. While the school denies it, the development comes as the row over free school meals reignited in the political arena. South Gyeongsang Province Governor Hong Joon-pyo’s push to end free school meals has incited strong opposition from parents and progressive politicians including Rep. Moon Jae-in, chairman of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy.

(Yonhap)A foreign language high school specializes in foreign language education. They are widely considered as elite as only students with top grades are granted admission.According to the committee, Seoul Foreign Language High School has been among the top in terms of the number of graduates that were accepted at colleges and universities. They demanded that the SMOE should unveil the evaluation scores. But an SMOE official said the Seoul Foreign Language High School generally received low scores and refused to disclose the actual numbers, stating that the hearing has not yet taken place. Jo said the committee plans to hold protests about the “unjust selection” by the SMOE every day until the hearing next Tuesday, when both schools will submit their explanations.As of Monday, Younghoon International School did not reveal plans to hold protests. However, it faces a much more daunting battle protecting its status, as a recent admission fraud has already placed it in the firing line. Last year, an appellate court also confirmed a prison term for a former Younghoon chief for a series of irregularities related to admission processes. The school claimed to have successfully rooted out corruption and vowed to fight to retain its status at the hearing.Korean law stipulates that any school that has been found guilty of grade tampering or admission or accounting fraud can have their status stripped by local education authorities. An SMOE official said schools can receive an extension or extra credit on their assessment if they provide a sufficient explanation and plans for improvement at the hearing. If the education office decides to cancel their designation, it must lodge a request for the Education Ministry’s approval ― which is mandated under the recently-revised ordinance on the operations of specialized schools ― within 20 days of the hearing. The government then has 50 days to reach a decision, although it can choose to delay its decision for two months.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","protest monday denouncing seoul education ,school held protest monday denouncing ,held protest monday denouncing seoul ,monday denouncing seoul education authorities ,protest monday denouncing seoul","['Seoul', 'the Seoul Education Office of Education', 'Seoul', 'Jo Dae - yeon', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education', 'SMOE', 'SMOE', 'the Seoul Foreign Language High School', 'Jo', 'SMOE', 'Younghoon International School', 'Younghoon', 'korean', 'SMOE', 'the Education Ministry ’s', 'Yoon Min - sik']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.13032095  0.13147558

Moon Jae-in upped the ante against his rival party Monday, saying he would attend the hearing for an investigation into an overseas resource development project, and demanded former president Lee Myung-bak join him. “The Saenuri Party insisted that the former president Lee would attend the hearing as long as I joined him. Fair enough. I will attend the hearing, and you should join me,” said Moon from the New Politics Alliance for Democracy. The ruling party, however, rejected the demand. “It is nothing but an attempt to play politics,” said Rep. Kim Mu-sung, leader of the ruling Saenuri Party. “If the allegation proves to be true, then he (former president) should attend the hearing. So far, no allegation has been proven. I can only imagine that they (opposition party) don’t want to continue the committee anymore,” said Kim.Moon’s remarks come amid a political tug-of-war surrounding the investigation into an overseas resource development project, otherwise known as “energy diplomacy,” which has been under fire for causing massive losses and wasting taxpayer’s money. Last December, the National Assembly set up a committee to investigate if there were any wrongdoings in the project. The two major parties, however, have been at odds over how to run the committee, particularly regarding a hearing for key players, including former President Lee.The opposition party has constantly demanded the former president should attend the hearing, saying he has been in charge of the project from the beginning. The party has also asked other key aides to Lee to attend. It urged the committee to extend its service beyond the expiration date of April 7, noting the failure to find anything until now. “President Lee spearheaded the energy development project. I think he has an obligation to answer the allegations. I urge him to come out and face the truth,” said Moon. “I also want to hear the response of chairman Kim, the leader of ruling Saenuri Party, to my request,” Moon added. As for the extension of the committee’s operation date, the ruling party left it open for discussion. “The party will discuss the matter with the committee’s members,” said Rep. Yoo Seung-min Saenuri Party Floor Leader. The project has been the most talked-about political scandal in Korea. It has cost 31.4 trillion won ($28 billion) in taxpayer’s money, according to Board of Audit and Inspection of Korea.

He noted, however, that what is important is for the Japanese government to ""seriously think about ways and make efforts to overcome the past (and move) toward future-oriented bilateral ties.""  In 2011, only 4 out of 18 total textbooks contained Tokyo's claim that South Korea is illegally occupying Dokdo, where a small dispatch of Seoul's police are stationed as a token of its ownership.  This year, the number jumped to 13, representing the Abe administration's attempt to bolster its efforts to lay claim to Dokdo.  South Korean Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo condemned Japan's move as regretful.  ""Japan can't deny or hide the past history for long,"" Lee told reporters at a luncheon.  Japan's move, which South Korean officials describe as a provocation, apparently undermined efforts to improve relations between the neighboring nations. Seoul-Tokyo ties have long been strained despite brisk economic and cultural exchanges due to long-standing stand-offs over territory and shared history.  It's a legacy of Japan's brutal colonial rule of Korea from 1910-45. South Koreans believe Japan has never offered a sincere apology for its wartime atrocities.  Continued disputes between Seoul and Tokyo are a major stumbling block to Washington's push for closer trilateral cooperation in regional security amid growing military threats from Pyongyang.  Amid persisting tension, Japan's Kyodo news agency cited diplomatic sources as saying on Monday that the two countries will hold their first security dialogue in more than five years next Tuesday.  The dialogue, involving senior foreign affairs and defense officials from both sides, was launched in 1998 to discuss each other's defense policies and North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. It has been suspended since the last session in December 2009 due to disputes over shared history.  Asked to verify the report, Noh said the two sides have yet to agree on a specific date, although talks have been under way.

She and her husband, a retiree in his late 60s, spent almost 200 million won ($182,000) for his wedding and housing, thinking they were still financially safe with their personal savings and private pension payments. But things turned difficult for them when Kim’s mother, 80, was diagnosed with dementia three years ago. In spite of the medical treatment paid by the couple, Kim’s mother’s condition quickly worsened ― to a degree where she could not recognize her own children. Kim, who suffers from her own health problems including osteoporosis, is thinking of placing their mother, who currently lives with Kim, in a residential medical facility for the elderly. “I thought my husband and I were well prepared for our post-retirement years, but I’m not sure anymore,” she said. “I don’t want my mother to stay at an ill-equipped facility, but the ones that I like cost about 1.3 million to 1.5 million won a month. My husband is diabetic and I have osteoporosis. We don’t have major health issues, but I’m just constantly worried about our finances because I don’t know what will happen next.”Kim is one of more than 6.8 million baby boomers (those born 1955 to 1963) who are entering their 60s this year. The government predicts that medical costs for the elderly will continue to rise as the boomers’ population begins to grow older, thereby doubling the current elderly demographic ― those aged 65 or older ― to more than 7.2 million.“It is certainly worrisome because the cost for the boomers increased by 31 percent from 2010 to 2014, which is more than the cost for those currently aged 65 or 74 increased in the same time period, at 20. 3 percent,” said an official from the Health Ministry. Last year, about one-third of total medical costs ― 19.4 trillion won ― was spent to treat the elderly, who already account for 11.9 percent of the total Korean population. The cost increased by 10.4 percent from the year before, mostly due to the increased number of those aged 75 or older who sought medical help for dementia and cerebrovascular diseases, according to the latest government data. While the cost for those aged 65 to 74 increased by 20.3 percent from 2010 to 2014, the cost for individuals aged 75 or older rose dramatically by 69.9 percent in the same period. Among patients aged 75 or older, the cost to treat dementia increased by 138.4 percent from 2010 to 2014, while the cost to treat Parkinson’s disease rose by 204.5 percent in the five-year period. Shin Hyun-chul, a researcher at the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, said while many baby boomers today are supporting their parents ― mostly aged 75 or older ― with their medical costs, it is unclear if they would be able to receive support from their children if they become ill in their later years. “All we know for sure is that the cost will be huge to treat baby boomers,” he said. “But we don’t know who is going to pay for it.”Experts say both the physical and mental well-being of the elderly is already at risk. According to the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, almost 70 percent of all senior citizens either lived by themselves or with their spouses. The average monthly income for a single elderly person was 799,400 won, which is less than half the country’s average household income at 3.53 million won. About 35 percent of their income was from national pension payments, while 23.8 percent came from their children. Only 27.8 percent of their income was from their own work.Korea’s elderly suicide rate was 81.9 for every 100,000 in the population in 2012, the highest among the OECD. According to data from the National Assembly Budget Office, 73.6 percent of senior citizens from 2006-2012 thought of killing themselves the most when they faced financial difficulties or illnesses. The poverty rate for elderly households was 49.3 percent in 2013, according to Statistics Korea.Almost 90 percent of the elderly were also suffering from chronic diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure, while one-third were either depressed or obese as of last year. Physical inactivity is considered one of the major risk factors for dementia, as indicated by more than 80 percent of the elderly spending their leisure time watching TV. The Health Ministry expects that the number of those with dementia will exceed those who are aged 65 or older by 2024.Professor Lee Geum-yong, who specializes in welfare programs for the elderly at Sangmyung University, said the government should develop preventive measures to combat aging-related diseases, especially dementia. “I think the only actions we can take are preventive ones, as we can’t stop the baby boomers from growing old,” he said.Studies have shown that an appropriate lifestyle, including a healthy diet, regular exercise and an active social life, can delay or prevent brain disease. “Local health and welfare centers should take on that role. Senior citizens should learn to socialize with others and exercise regularly. They should also be introduced to more recreational activities, so they can avoid drinking or just spending their time alone at home.”Even for many millennials, their parents’ post-retirement years are some of their biggest worries. “I don’t know if I should even get married, because once I start supporting my own kids, I wouldn’t be able to support my parents,” said a 27-year-old who wished to be identified only as Park. Her parents do not have a lot of retirement savings and the only income they’d have as retirees would be national pension payments. Park currently works as an intern at a large conglomerate and does not support them.“Once, my mother told me that her generation is the last generation to support their parents and the last to be ‘abandoned’ by their children. I don’t think she understands the situation of today’s labor market. What she said makes me sad and anxious (to get a full-time job) at the same time.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","millennials their parents post retirement ,year old housewife sometimes secretly ,her son wedding four years ,year old housewife ,diagnosed with dementia three years","['Kim Nan - hee', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'the Health Ministry', 'korean', 'Shin Hyun - chul', 'the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service', 'the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs', 'Korea', 'OECD', 'the National Assembly Budget Office', 'Statistics Korea', 'the Health Ministry', 'Lee Geum - yong', 'Sangmyung University', 'Park', 'Claire Lee']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.95737708  0.34902522

They plan to march to downtown Seoul in protest of the mandate on investigating the cause and measures related to the disaster. (Yonhap)“I am optimistic that the government will repeal the mandate,” Lee said Friday at Gwanghwamun Square in Seoul where some of the bereaved families have been camping in protest of the government’s allegedly lackluster effort to investigate the disaster.“It is clear to anyone who read the mandate that independent inquiries into the accident are impossible,” Lee said.The mandate will take effect midnight Tuesday, if not repealed. It authorizes the Oceans Ministry to dispatch its officials to the investigation committee’s strategy division. They will have the power to audit investigators’ budgets and report the committee’s activities to the government. Critics, including lawmakers in the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, the minor opposition Justice Party, have also denounced the downsizing of the committee’s membership from 120 to 90. Of the 90 members, 43 will be nongovernment officials. Critics argue that the mandate is a culmination of the government’s efforts to mute the probe.Two previous investigations into the Sewol disaster prompted further controversy as some of the family members claimed all those responsible for the accident have not been punished. Parliamentary probes were conducted in June last year, but left more questions than answers, some families said.Prosecutorial investigations resulted in the imprisonment of the ferry’s crew members, who abandoned the sinking Sewol after telling passengers to stay in their cabins during the accident. Lee Jun-seok, the Sewol’s captain, was sentenced to 36 years in November 2014.Prosecutors imprisoned maritime regulators accused of condoning safety violations and receiving kickbacks, including a Coast Guard official who was imprisoned. The official failed to tell passengers to evacuate during the accident, even though he had access to loudspeakers on his ship, judges said.The Sewol investigation has been a hotbed of political debate, as some opposition lawmakers have been criticized for publicizing a series of allegations against government bodies, including the presidential office last year.Progressives, on the other hand, criticized the conservatives for depicting their move as “politically motivated,” which they claimed was an attempt to cover up the fundamental cause of the tragedy.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","hold rally in seoul sunday ,rally in seoul sunday they ,rally in seoul sunday ,disaster hold rally in seoul ,sewol ferry disaster hold rally","['Seoul', 'the Oceans Ministry', 'the Coast Guard', 'Ansan', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Seoul', 'Lee', 'Seoul', 'Lee', 'the Oceans Ministry', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Justice Party', 'sewol', 'Lee Jun - seok', 'Coast Guard', 'Jeong Hunny']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50708222 -0.04027323

With a water tower built by the Korea International Cooperation Agency, she is now able to focus on her study, dreaming of becoming a math teacher one day. Now, her family and some 3,200 villagers no longer suffer from diarrhea, skin irritations and water-borne infectious diseases. “Since the arrival of the borehole, we’ve been enjoying its good, positive impact as we no longer have to go to faraway wells. I love going to school without having to worry about water,” Sow said. Belly Namary is one of the 12 towns with a collective population of about 100,000 that are basking in the transformation in their lives, powered by enhanced access to water. The facility is capable of storing 150 tons of water, hoisted from aquifers 300 to 400 meters below the surface. The water is available for 300 CFA francs (50 cents) per ton, which means an average family of 20 people pay around 1,500 to 2,000 CFA francs a month. The funds are spent on repair and maintenance, officials say. KOICA initiated the project in 2010 with a budget of $5.5 million, including the installment of generators and pumps, training local engineers and managers, and public education on sanitation.  Students cultivate crops at a model farm built by the Korea International Cooperation Agency at a technical high school in Thies, Senegal. (KOICA)“The water tower marks the first-ever system in Belly Namary’s 230-year history in which the residents are capable of drawing water in their own neighborhood,” said Jung Rak-myeong, director of Dongbu Engineering, which is in charge of the project in Senegal.“We had provided necessary training for five months until the end of March so that locals can operate the system on their own.” While France, Japan and other donors opted to dig larger wells in urban areas, KOICA turned to rural communities to shore up water supply and agricultural development, the mainstay of the country’s economy, in line with the Senegalese government’s request. Dakar aims to install 300 water towers throughout the country by 2017 and increase access to potable water from the current 66 percent to 82 percent in rural areas and 100 percent in cities over the next five years. “The main difference with other donor countries is that Korea has an advantage in that once it decides, it goes quickly and implements; in some cases we end up waiting three years before the work begins,” said Diene Faye, secretary of state for rural hydraulics, in an interview with visiting Korean reporters. “They are also flexible and open such as when forecasting problems and preparing for and adapting to them ... We appreciate their commitment to capacity building as well.” Most residents of Belly Namary make a living by working in 64 plantation fields raising cows, sheep and goats, which requires a constant flow of water. But its absence had forced many to wander from place to place, while others traveled on foot for up to four hours every day to often-contaminated traditional wells. To cater to the urgent sanitation needs, KOICA set up model toilets and shower facilities in several households and provided hygiene education, according to Song Ki-jeong, representative of KOICA’s Senegal office. With the program nearing an end, the grant-aid agency plans to launch another $5 million project in the coming months in which it will erect 10 boreholes for three years. “In the past, water shortages were a big problem, especially feeding animals,” said Oumou Nariel Sow, a housewife. “We couldn’t prepare for meals, girls could not go to school and animals died. With the borehole, we’re able to enjoy good quality water ― animals are healthy and people look better.” In Thies, some 57 kilometers east of capital Dakar, KOICA supports agricultural development by setting up an automatic irrigation system and teaching cultivation techniques at a model farm built within a technical high school. The institution, Lycee d’Enseigne­ment Technique et de la Formation Professionnelle, offers high-quality vocational education in areas such as electric engineering, electronics, architecture and automobiles to about 1,100 students. Some 100 of them are agriculture majors and after graduation a majority will go to college or land a job at state agricultural agencies.“I was deeply touched when students came out to look after their crops out of their regular class hours,” says Lim Seung-hwi, a 24-year-old KOICA volunteer. “Thanks to the automation, the students no longer have to spend most of the two-hour class watering the plants and can learn other useful knowledge.”The $30,000 program is designed to raise agricultural efficiency, crop yields and eventually revenue. Lim teaches new farming tools and introduces tools and how to use them, including food processing and fertilization techniques, says Name Ndack Dior Sarre, an 18-year-old student. “Irrigation is crucial to the sustainable management of water and plant nutrition. Before we started the automatic scheme, farmers had given water by hand, which resulted in lots of water wasted and greater physical labor,” says Daour Sene, principal of the school. “With agriculture being the main source of income here, the main goal of this project is to teach promising farmers and scale up the farming area from here all the way to Darka, while raising the self-sufficiency of vegetables at home and exports.” On a sunny day afternoon, the lush leaves of lettuce and other salad greens were flourishing. Onions, carrots and tomatoes were among other staples, but the type of crops depend on the demand from the area, with mango and papaya being newly tested. Albeit small in scale, the project is aimed at contributing to Senegal’s efforts to boost food supplies around the country and lay the foundation for secondary and tertiary industries, KOICA’s Song said. Senegal President Macky Sall has unveiled a vision to foster competitive, diversified and sustainable agriculture. The Accelerated Program for Agriculture in Senegal, or PRACAS, focuses on pushing up self-sufficiency in rice and outputs and exports in groundnuts, fruits and vegetables, increasing rural incomes and expanding jobs.Dogo Seck, General Secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Equipment, expressed hope that Korea’s knowhow and assistance will spur the drive. He said he has found similarities between PRACAS and the Saemaul movement, a 1970-80s rural reform initiative, such as the significance of human commitment. “To realize PRACAS, we’re working on how to mobilize labor in agriculture in partnership with Korean corporations,” he said in an interview. “I believe we can take some lessons from Saemaul’s success in Korea to apply similar solutions for socioeconomic development in Senegal.” By Shin Hyon-hee, Korea Herald correspondent (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","math teacher one day ,hour class watering the plants ,girls in her rural community ,year old student irrigation ,revenue lim teaches new farming","['BELLY NAMARY / THIES', 'Nariel Sow', 'Belly Namary', 'Senegal', 'French', 'the Korea International Cooperation Agency', 'Belly Namary', 'the Korea International Cooperation Agency', 'Thies', 'Senegal', 'Belly Namary ’s', 'Jung Rak - myeong', 'Dongbu Engineering', 'Senegal', 'France', 'Japan', 'KOICA', 'Senegalese', 'Korea', 'Diene Faye', 'korean', 'Belly Namary', 'KOICA', 'Song Ki - jeong', 'KOICA ’s Senegal', 'Oumou Nariel Sow', 'thie', 'Dakar', 'KOICA', 'Lim Seung - hwi', 'KOICA', 'Name Ndack Dior Sarre', 'Daour Sene', 'Darka', 'Senegal ’s', 'KOICA ’s Song', 'Macky Sall', 'the Accelerated Program for Agriculture in Senegal', 'the Ministry of Agriculture', 'Rural Equipment', 'Korea', 'praca', 'Saemaul', 'korean', 'Saemaul ’s', 'Korea', 'Senegal', 'Shin Hyon - hee', 'Korea Herald']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53706056  0.23076011

After months of an agonizing search for an alternative, a 38-year-old father of 1-year-old twins made an “unthinkable” decision to become a stay-at-home dad for the next year.Lee Dong-hoon joined the pioneering 4.4 percent of fathers in the country that spurned conventional thinking and took a leave of absence.The day he became the “mom,” he saw his wife ― who felt guilty about leaving her children behind, but excited to get back to “real world” ― return to work after a yearlong spell of maternity leave.As he turned around, two sets of twinkling eyes stared back at him, as if to say, “So what can you do for us?”A month has passed, and he is sure he is now quite good at it. Sometimes better than his wife.Jeong Min-seong, a father on paternity leave since last June for his 19-month-old son, also says he is quite confident now, as he feeds his boy, bathes him, takes him to day care, and does pretty much what all mothers do.“Although I’ve got the hang of it now, I do worry whether I fail to give him the delicate care that his mom could provide.”What helped him was a gathering of other fathers on paternity leave. “Although we have nothing else in common, sharing tips helped prevent the so-called ‘child care solitude,’” he said.For Lee, the day goes by unbelievably quickly, yet ironically slowly. Half the time he is feeding and cleaning after babies with astonishingly large stomachs and clumsy fingers. Sometimes the children’s grandmother or the aunt stops by, which he says is like finding an oasis at a desert.“I won’t say it’s not hard. But I also cannot say which is harder, going to work or taking care of the babies. ... It’s a different kind of hard,” he said.What was more difficult was the process of making the decision to switch roles. His friends told him he must be crazy, while his parents and in-laws remained in fraught silence.It meant he was putting an abrupt halt to his 11-year-long career, a frightful scenario for the older generation.The decision, however, was inevitable. “The only other option was to have the kids stay at the day care center for 12 straight hours every day, which still would have required us to hire help and juggle schedules among the grandparents.”His colleagues at work were surprisingly supportive, as they knew, many from personal experience, how hard it is to balance work and raising children. For many of them, he was a source of envy as they relied on their parents to take care of their own kids, like the 64.5 percent of dual-income households nationwide, according to Statistics Korea figures from 2014.A 40-year-old father of two surnamed Park, agrees the atmosphere has changed slowly yet significantly since he took his paternity leave three years ago.“Back then, it was hard even to broach the subject. Now, I see more of my male subordinates discuss it openly and the company being more understanding, thanks to outpouring media reports on dads’ new roles and expanding government support for paternal child care,” Park said.The government has been pushing to urge more fathers to take paternity leave, largely as part of the efforts to fight the country’s low birthrate. A company that refuses to grant paternity leave would face a penalty of up to 5 million won. Last year, a total of 3,421 fathers took paternity leave, compared to 2,293 a year before. While still small, it marked a 49 percent year-on-year increase. “I don’t think my case represents the changing role between a man and a woman, but rather, the changing priorities in life. Earning money for the family is no longer the biggest contribution to the family, but to be more family-oriented,” Lee said.The reality, however, is still at a baby’s step. Of the fathers on paternity leave nationwide, 53 percent of them are employed at large companies with at least 300 employees according to statistics from the Employment Ministry, meaning workers at smaller workplaces are still neglected by the system. Asked whether they would recommend other dads to take the leave, all three said, “definitely.”“You get to see a world that you could not see. It’s the best decision I made,” Park said.As the minority man in the still overwhelmingly feminine world of child care, Lee does still have to fight small battles each day.As he proudly takes a walk with one of the twins in a stroller and another on his back, people watch him with looks of half-pity and half-curiosity. He is the only man in the daily child care class that his toddlers attend, and it is near impossible to find a men’s restroom with a diaper changer.“It doesn’t faze me though. If I let it bother me, I wouldn’t have made the decision in the first place.”Already his “sacrifice” is paying off. His wife, who had nagged at him for most of the past year, has turned noticeably affectionate. His children learned to say “appa” (daddy) before “eomma” (mommy). He gloats as he watches his wife prod the twins to say “eomma.” Finally, peace has arrived.

Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights plans to open a field structure in Seoul in the coming months to monitor and study the situation across the border. This is in line with a recommendation in February 2014 by the Commission of Inquiry. “We will never accept the rash acts by the (South Korean) puppet forces, who are devoured by the delusion of a unification (by absorption) and make stern responses,” Rodong Sinmun said. “Our warning against the U.N. office was never meant to be empty talk,” the paper stated, referring to a statement released Monday by the North’s Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea, which is in charge of cross-border affairs, that it will not “sit idle.” The North said if the U.N. office was established, it would be the “very first target of our merciless punishment.” The paper also accused Seoul of consistently conspiring to topple the regime, citing Pyongyang’s recent detainment of two South Koreans which it claims are spies. “The (South Korean) puppet forces are speaking of trust and dialogue in words, while colluding with the U.S. to frantically press ahead with joint military exercises aimed at invading the North and further intensifying mistrust and confrontation between the North and South through a human rights-themed plot,” the paper said. “As the puppets are fueling fratricidal confrontation, we have already clearly made sure that the chances are gone for inter-Korean dialogue and improvement for the relationship, and what’s left is confrontation by force.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","ruling workers party denounced seoul ,north korea lashed out thursday ,workers party denounced seoul ,workers party denounced seoul support ,pyongyang ruling workers party denounced","['North Korea', 'U.N.', 'Seoul', 'North Korea ’s', 'Pyongyang', 'Workers ’ Party', 'Seoul', 'U.N.', 'north korean', 'the U.N.

Cho, however, said she “would like to apologize to victims. I regret my wrongdoings and ask for clemency,” as the judges gave her an opportunity to express her feelings.  Former Korean Air executive Cho Hyun-ah (Yonhap)During the first trial hearing of the so-called “nut rage” appeal case at Seoul High Court, Cho’s attorney reiterated an earlier argument that air carriers’ movement on landing strips is not included in the flight route under the current law.The 40-year-old de facto heiress of Korean Air was found to have ordered crewmembers of a flight from New York to Seoul on Dec. 5, 2014, that was taxiing to return to the airport gate at John F. Kennedy International Airport.Cho’s attorney claimed the nation’s aviation-related laws have ambiguous stipulations on the flight route ― whether or not the landing routes at airports are interpreted as a flight route.The attorney further asserted that a flight’s movement of 20 meters on land is not supervised under aviation security law, asking for the court’s mercy.In February, Seoul Seobu District Court found her guilty on several counts ― forcing flight route deviation, obstructing aviation safety and assaulting two cabin crewmembers physically and verbally.The court, however, dismissed the charges raised by the prosecution that Cho obstructed the duties of Korean Air executives, employees and inspectors from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transportation immediately after the incident.Prosecutors said Cho tried to destroy evidence of her behavior in the plane by abusing her authority as the vice president.Cho has been in prison for more than 90 days since she was taken into custody on Dec. 30.Park Chang-jin, the cabin manager who was deplaned by Cho, backed up several of the charges during his testimony at the district court trials. Cho was reportedly dissatisfied with the way Park’s junior attendant served her macadamia nuts ― in a bag and not on a plate.Meanwhile, the district court also handed down a jail term of eight months to a Korean Air executive director.

Cautiously peering around, the woman appeared lost until she heard a familiar language from the other side of the room.“May I help you?” said 44-year-old Chinese worker Chen Jhi-hong in her mother tongue. The woman rushed to Chen as though she had found a savior. Chen asked for help in changing her home address for her registration. After a smooth process carrying out the task, the woman left feeling satisfied and protected. Three women from multicultural backgrounds help a foreign resident at Seongdong-gu Office in eastern Seoul. (Seongdong-gu Office)Chen is one of three Korean-speaking workers with non-Korean backgrounds at the office. She provides administrative support for foreign residents. Interpreting and translating in her mother tongue for expats, she serves as an important connection between the Korean community and Chinese residents. Adjusting to Korean society was not smooth for Chen, like many other expats in Korea.Chen came to Seoul in 2003 after marrying a Korean man. At first she struggled with cultural barriers and lost confidence when she was engaging in social activities.“I stayed home until my son was able to go to kindergarten. One day, my 5-year-old cried, saying his teacher seemed to dislike him. I wanted to ask the teacher what was going on but I couldn’t because I had not learned Korean,” she said.After that incident, she put enormous effort into studying Korean. Reminiscing about the difficulties she faced in the past, Chen has worked at the Seongdong-gu Office since last year in the hopes of helping others with similar hardships. “Whenever Chinese people thank me, I feel touched. It makes me realize that I can do something meaningful for others,” she said. “I’m so grateful to be here.” As successful as Chen’s job may be, her opportunity to help is still a rarity.As of January, 19 foreigners worked for the Seoul Metropolitan Government, including at district offices. Of the 25 district offices in the capital, seven have hired 10 foreign workers. Among them, only four are marriage immigrants with multicultural backgrounds, with three working at Seongdong-gu Office and one at Songpa-gu Office. The employees are hired as contracted workers and are yet to secure regular positions, according to the city.Like Chen, Kim So-yeong from the Philippines also benefited from the opportunity to help, which she attributes to her Korean-language skills. She was naturalized as a Korean citizen after marrying a Korean in 1997.To make a living for her two daughters, Kim first worked at a private company and academy before moving to the Seongdong-gu office in 2011. The 43-year-old Filipino is in charge of supporting English-speaking foreigners. “Many expats visiting here to ask me about job recruiting opportunities. I hope there are some training programs in which foreigners can learn useful skills and acquire certificates,” she said. Letiphuonghni from Vietnam works with Kim. She heard about the job two years ago from the Multicultural Family Support Center, which is run by the government. She mainly deals with interpretation and translation for Vietnamese residents. The 28-year-old adjusted relatively easily to her new environment. “Although the language difficulty still bothers me sometimes, I enjoy living here. I love Korean food and the transportation system here,” she said. “Even though I cannot see my family in Vietnam, everything is good here.”While she appreciates her job at the office, she still sometimes faces prejudice. “Even though there are a lot of multicultural families with Vietnamese roots here, some still view me with prejudice.

However, almost 57 percent of those who developed the symptoms chose not to see a gynecologist.Also, of 708 teenagers surveyed by the think tank, 42.1 percent said they had experienced such symptoms, but only 23.5 percent of them chose to seek medical help. The women who didn’t see doctors either took no action or purchased medicine such as antibiotics at a pharmacy.Researcher Lee Sang-rim, who participated in the study, said young women, including teenagers, should be encouraged to see gynecologists regularly regardless of their marital status. Some gynecological diseases such as vaginal infections can cause infertility if left untreated. “This should be done as a way to support women’s reproductive health,” she said. “In order to do this, the public perception on women’s health and sex life must change.”Some of the women surveyed for the research said they were not comfortable with discussing their sex life with doctors ― especially male doctors ― while being single, while others said they were worried about being seen as unmarried and pregnant to other patients at the clinic. More than 50 percent of the surveyed adult women and 64 percent of the surveyed teenagers said people would “think oddly” of single women who visit gynecology clinics. “I think the general perception of single women seeing gynecologists is that they are either pregnant or have some kind of sexually transmitted disease,” said a university student who did not want to be named. “While many young people are sexually active before getting married, I think the norm is that unmarried women are still expected to act as if they are virgins and not openly talk about their sex life. You are only allowed to talk openly about sex once you are married.”Researchers said parents and teachers should be educated on young women’s reproductive health to tackle the issue, and more preconception care ― medical treatments one receives before getting pregnant ― should be covered by the national health insurance. “Public sex education should also include a section about women’s reproductive health,” the report said. “Gynecologists should also receive a training on how to treat young, single women with the necessary consideration and care.” By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","gynecologist also of 708 teenagers ,majority of korean single women ,women who didn see doctors ,of single women seeing gynecologists ,social prejudice against unmarried women","['korean', 'the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs', 'Lee Sang - rim', 'Claire Lee']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66247213  0.49633092

Activists hold a rally against the investigative authority's raids on offices of some civic groups, which distributed handouts criticizing the Park Geun-hye administration, in front of the Jeonbuk District Police Agency in Jeonju, North Jeolla Province on Mar. 17. (Yonhap)Park said the on-the-spot inspections and raids would eventually have a “chilling effect” on the whole of society, as they discouraged citizens from publicly expressing their political views in a free manner.“It could also bring a loss of national prestige on the international stage, while Korea’s Constitution stipulates the freedom of expression of any individual,” he said.Asked about the tolerance band, he cited the case of the United States, whose administration generally tolerates expression as long as it is not believed to pose a “clear and present danger” to the nation or social security.“Korea’s case is irrelevant to public danger. It is just focused on the president’s honor (as to whether or not citizens defamed the president).”Korea has seen its global assessment in the freedom of expression continue to fall over the past few years. The country’s rankings in media and Internet freedom have been demoted by the United Nations and the nongovernmental organization Freedom House.France-based watchdog Reporters Without Borders, which ranked Korea at 31st in the media sector in 2006, lowered it to 50th in 2012 and 60th among 180 countries in 2015.According to Transparency International, Korea ranks 46th among 177 countries in the Corruption Perceptions Index as of 2013. Korea scored 55 out of 100 ― it ranked 39th in 2010.The Korean unit of TI said that the drop because the worst performing Korean prosecutors were being assigned to corruption.On Feb. 25, Amnesty International said in its annual report that the second year of Park’s administration showed a regressive trend in the realization of human rights, citing various concerns, such as barriers to the freedom of assembly and expression, as well as the government’s increasing restriction on the freedom of expression by using the National Security Law to intimidate and imprison people.Amnesty International took issue with the anti-North Korean National Security Law, which bans any activities that support or promote North Korea’s political ideas.Following the authorities’ investigation into the activists, NGOs claimed the government was applying a double standard in terms of the freedom of expression, saying that it has, in contrast, taken a lukewarm stance toward conservative groups distributing anti-North Korea leaflets across the border.Police have taken a back seat over the launches of balloons loaded with anti-Pyongyang leaflets, citing freedom of expression, despite concerns from neighboring residents upon North Korea’s retaliation threats.“In contrast, police hampered our move to fly handouts in yellow balloons (in October) demanding an inquiry into the president regarding the Sewol ferry sinking disaster,” said a spokesperson for the civic group Democratic Rights Solidarity.Police reportedly warned that the balloons could be a threat to passersby in the streets in terms of safety as the bundles of yellow balloons were again wrapped carried in bigger stick-type transparent balloons. Professor Park argued that, in that case, the sending of leaflets to the North should be a bigger priority for a crackdown, as residents in the inter-Korean border districts fear that the propaganda balloons could spark provocations by the North.Moves condemning the government continue to escalate.An activist group at Korea University on March 18 urged for an immediate halt to a police investigation into the distribution of leaflets criticizing the president, saying it held back freedom of expression.In a statement they criticized the police searching Byun’s home and his wife’s office. “It is trampling on the freedom and rights of the people by probing someone for handing out leaflets that mention the president’s past ... police should stick to their duty of protecting people’s freedom and rights,” the statement said.In the last three months of 2014, the criminal investigative authority stepped back from its earlier plan to carry out real-time monitoring of postings and messages of smartphone users amid a severe backlash from the public.After being severely denounced over the past few days for its move to conduct alleged surveillance of ordinary mobile users, the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office said it decided to drop the plan.There has also been recent debate over reports that the National Election Commission is considering revising the elections law to slap a penalty of up to 2 million won on those who post or spread comments online and offline that aggravate regionalism, especially during an election period.Although the move was aimed to tackle out-of-control Internet arguments between politically hostile regions, the idea was also criticized for potentially damaging freedom of expression.The issue of freedom of expression has also spread overseas, with the Japanese government stating on March 25 that it has brought up the matter of a Sankei Shimbun journalist being tried in South Korea on charges of defaming Park at the United Nations Human Rights Council. The Japanese government has been claiming Tatsuya Kato, former head of Sankei Shimbun’s Seoul bureau, should not be “arbitrarily” punished for the “freedom of press that is the basis of democracy.”Kato has been undergoing trial since October last year after his article in August delved into the whereabouts of Park during the April 11 Sewol ferry sinking tragedy.

The group with the disorder also had a 2.2 times higher risk of depression.The average body mass index of the group with the disorder was 17.6, which was much lower than what the World Health Organization considers as a healthy weight range for East Asians, from 18.5 to 22.9.“Underweight individuals who try to lose weight while they think they are obese are at risk ― both physically and psychologically,” said Dr. Lee Jung-kwon, one of the researchers. “Society needs to pay more attention so these individuals don’t end up making tragic choices.”Overseas studies have shown that extreme weight perceptions ― seeing oneself as overweight or obese ― may be a suicide warning sign, especially among teenage girls. Widespread media images of skinny bodies also affect people’s perception of “normal bodies,” studies have shown.In Korea, more than 90 percent of patients with bulimia nervosa, one of the most common eating disorders, are women, and about 70 percent of them are in their 20s and 30s.The condition is characterized by binge eating followed by an attempt to purge the intake, such as by vomiting, or excessive exercise ― mostly because of an extensive concern with body image and weight. Those with the disorder usually have an additional psychiatric disorder, such as anxiety or mood disorders.Korea’s suicide rate has been the highest among OECD nations since 2003.

The people will lead it. If they think arresting the leaders will stop it, they are wrong,"" said Tian Chua, vice president of Anwar's People's Justice Party.Zainuddin Ahmad, a top Kuala Lumpur police official, said protesters would not be allowed to gather.""The street procession is banned. Police will not hesitate to take any action, including arrests, if people defy the ban or break any laws,"" he said.The United States has been among the international critics of Anwar's conviction and the crackdown on dissent, saying both raised questions over the rule of law in Malaysia.Anwar denies the charge that he sodomised a former male aide in 2008.He says it was fabricated by Malaysia's long-ruling government to halt a run of opposition electoral gains that have raised the spectre of the country's first regime change since independence in 1957.Facing ebbing voter support, Prime Minister Najib Razak promised in 2011 to end the authoritarian tactics of his ruling United Malays National Organisation (UMNO).But after that failed to win back voters in 2013 polls, his regime launched a tightening clampdown that has seen dozens of government opponents hauled for up sedition or other charges over the past year.Anwar's daughter Nurul Izzah, a member of parliament, is among several people arrested in recent weeks as anger over her father's jailing has spiked.Charged with sedition, she was released on March 17 after a night in jail.In a statement released Friday, Nurul, 34, said Malaysia was sliding toward becoming a ""police state"". Najib has defended the crackdown by saying dissent cannot be allowed to jeopardise stability.The three most recent arrests included Mohamad Sabu, deputy president of the opposition Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), who was detained early Saturday.Rafizi Ramli, a vice president of Anwar's party, and activist Hishammuddin Rais, a frequent government critic, were arrested Friday. Zainuddin, the police official, confirmed Rafizi's arrest but declined comment on the others.All three men remained in custody, the opposition said.On March 7, several thousand demonstrators had marched through Kuala Lumpur demanding Anwar's release and shouting ""Down with Najib"".

Eight protesters also faced charges of interfering with public functions over the clash, a police officer said.""Ma Ying-jeou sells out Taiwan,"" one protester shouted in footage aired by local television.Ma's office issued a statement condemning violence. ""Taiwan is a society with the rule of law. Any political appeal should base on the rule of law and should not cross the boundary of peace,"" it said.The route was originally due to be launched on March 5, but was postponed due to those objections.China later slightly modified the M503 route but is pressing ahead with the launch.The other three routes have been indefinitely postponed, according to Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration.The government has said that negotiations with China over the routes will help safeguard the island's aviation security. It has also said that Chinese fighter jets would not use M503.China considers self-ruled Taiwan a part of its territory awaiting reunification, by force if necessary. They split in 1949 at the end of a civil war.Ties have improved markedly since Ma came to power in 2008 on a China-friendly platform, but some fear Taiwan is becoming over-dependent on the mainland.","taiwanese police on saturday arrested ,launch the protesters arrested saturday ,latest protest against china planned ,the protesters arrested saturday ,police on saturday arrested 13","['TAIPEI', 'AFP', 'taiwanese', 'China', 'Taiwan Solidarity Union', 'Ma Ying - jeou', 'Taipei', 'China', 'Zhejiang', 'Fuzhou', 'Xiamen', 'Fujian province', 'Beijing', 'Taiwan', 'Taiwan', 'Taiwan', 'China', 'Taiwan', 'Civil Aeronautics Administration', 'China', 'chinese', 'Taiwan', 'Ma', 'China', 'Taiwan']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23940107  0.61066681

But the burden is increasingly getting heavier for Korean parents, who are culturally and traditionally obligated to pay for an expensive wedding ceremony and, in many cases, chip in to buy a house for the newlyweds. It is a baffling situation for most Korean parents, many of whom have retired or are retiring in a couple of years in a society where state-led social safety net is tenuous and getting a new job after retirement is extremely difficult, if not outright impossible. For outsiders, a simple question arises. Why do Korean couples depend on their parents so much for their own wedding and often force them to cough up the money to buy an expensive apartment in Seoul?First and foremost, today’s Koreans planning to get married do not have enough income. Youth unemployment has already crossed 10 percent and many young couples, who land jobs late or give up looking for a job, cannot pay for the marriage expenses on their own. But the cost of a wedding remains high. Couples together usually spend over 100 million won ($90,000) for a mainstream wedding ceremony, according to a survey of 1,000 people done by the state-run Korea Consumer Agency in 2013. The amount does not include the housing cost for the newlywed.This figure is beyond the reach of a young Korean whose average monthly salary is 3.1 million won, according to data compiled by the Ministry of Labor.Expenditure on the wedding per person breaks down to engagement ceremony (2.5 million won), wedding gifts for in-laws and couples (7 million won), wedding ceremony (12 million won) and honeymoon (4 million won). Apart from the wedding expenditure, the newlywed should also prepare a marital house. The average housing price ― either buying or renting under the jonse system ― of newly-weds in Seoul during the last two years stood at around 180 million won, according to a local wedding planner Duowed. Financial burden on retired parentsChildren’s reliance on their parents is the biggest financial concern for many parents, who are retired or close to it.A recent survey of 400 people in their 50s done by Shinhan Bank showed that 64 percent of those questioned said their biggest financial concern of postretirement is their children’s marriage. A survey of 300 people over 50s done by the local media outlet JoongAng Ilbo showed that 75.3 percent of the respondents said they either supported their children’s wedding or are willing to support it in the future. And 65.3 percent of the respondents said financial support for their children’s wedding is a parents’ duty. Lim, a father of two sons who declined to be identified fully, married off both his sons in recent years. Having retired last year, he used most of his retirement funds for his children’s wedding and houses. “Although I feel a sense of pride for marrying off my sons, I am still concerned about me and my wife’s future,” he said.Lim said he is now seeking a daily job such as a janitor or security guard for his later years. “Due to social sentiments it is not easy for parents to openly talk about retirement concerns with their children who are about to be married. Children should first understand the situation of their parents’ postretirement and have a candid conversation with them,” said Kim Dong-yeop, a director of Mirae Asset Retirement institute.Parents’ involvement in weddingAs many young Koreans rely on their parents financially for their marriage, the excessive involvement of the parents in the wedding planning sometimes creates conflicts. “It is difficult to find a house and have a decent wedding ceremony without financial support from their parents. So, parents’ approval and involvement in the wedding is important,” said Ham In-hee, a professor of Ewha Womans University. Korea’s wedding procedure, although it varies from person to person, often follows a similar rule. First, the groom’s family prepares a marital house, whose average price is around 180 million won in Seoul. Then, the bride spends 10 percent of the housing price, to buy wedding gifts for in-laws. Traditionally, the groom’s family returns half of the amount to the bride, who then buys wedding gifts such as luxury bags for herself. Some couples break off their engagement during this procedure because the expected amount of money often differs between the two families. Park, 30, who only wanted to be identified by her first name, recently called off her wedding with her fianc, a lawyer, a week before their wedding. Their conflicts started when the mother-in-law asked her family to buy a Mercedes-Benz car, which costs around 80 million won, for her son in return for the house they bought. Park’s family, who was glad to have a lawyer son-in-law, borrowed the money from the bank and bought the car for him. However, it didn’t stop there. Two weeks before the wedding, Park’s mother-in-law scolded her for not buying luxury watches as wedding gifts for the in-laws, saying, “This is because you were not well educated in your family.”“I could no longer continue the wedding planning,” Park said, with a sigh. Kim, 32, who also declined to be identified fully, too broke off her engagement with her fianc. The rich parents of her fianc bought a house in Seoul worth 500 million won.“In return, they asked us to buy wedding gifts worth 50 million won, equivalent of 10 percent of the housing price. We could not afford it and this led to an emotional battle between the parents,” Kim said. “It is natural that many couples have a feud ahead of the wedding. However, once their parents excessively intervene, most of them cut the relationship,” Hwang Hyun-ok, the planner, said. “Nowadays, many young couples want to break away from this tradition and opt for a simple wedding. However, when they fail to persuade their parents, who want to showoff to their friends and relatives, conflicts often occur,” said Hwang Hyun-ok, a chief planner of a local wedding consulting company Denam Wedding.By Shin Ji-hye (shinjh@heraldcorp.com)","getting heavier for korean parents ,weddingas many young koreans rely ,situation for most korean parents ,couples who land jobs late ,heavier for korean parents","['Korea', 'korean', 'korean', 'korean', 'Seoul?First', 'Koreans', 'Korea Consumer Agency', 'Korean', 'the Ministry of Labor', 'Seoul', 'duowe', 'Shinhan Bank', 'JoongAng Ilbo', 'Lim', 'Lim', 'Kim Dong - yeop', 'Mirae Asset Retirement', 'Koreans', 'Ewha Womans University', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Mercedes - Benz', 'Park ’s', 'Park', 'Kim', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'Hwang Hyun - ok', 'Hwang Hyun - ok', 'Denam wedding', 'Shin Ji - hye']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59234118  0.31310302

It also reflected changing norms in a traditionally patriarchal Korean society.“Amid a rapid rise in individualism and sexual openness, perceptions of marriage and sex are also changing,” the judges said at the hearing. While the court stoutly maintained that adultery was unethical, it said the law had to adapt to changing values among members of its society, including attitudes to love and sexuality. Divorce in South Korea, which is rooted in Confucian principles and patriarchal gender roles, was not too long ago considered unthinkable.Before the country’s recent industrialization, “families and households were the primary units of … economic activity,” according to Noriko O. Tsuya and Larry L. Bumpass, editors of “Marriage, Work and Family Life in Comparative Perspective.”“Women, and to a lesser degree, men depended on the ensuing family relations and kin network, and conjugal and parent-child relations were considered unbreakable, lifelong commitments,” wrote professors Tsuya and Bumpass.With the rise of individual wage earners displacing family-based production, “the once sacred notions of marriage ... and obligations to one’s family (gave way) to individual well-being and self-satisfaction.”The shift from collectivistic values to individualistic self-identity is illustrated in the rise of the “love marriage” in place of the conventional arranged marriage that were traditionally family alliances, “the joining of two ancestral lineages,” according to “Culture and Customs of Korea,” written by Donald N. Clark. Koreans are now marrying later and choosing to have fewer or no children, according to census data. The fertility rate has rapidly declined since the 1970s and reached a record low in 2005 in the country with the lowest birthrate among OECD member states.The crude divorce rate also increased sevenfold from 0.5 per 1,000 in 1975 to 3.5 in 2003 before declining to 2.6 in 2005, which nonetheless surpasses the rates in EU countries and Japan, according to Statistics Korea. Premarital sex is almost universal, though out-of-wedlock childbearing remains extremely low at 1-2 percent of all births, according to a 2009 study by Lee Sam-sik from the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs. Accompanying these trends is a steady increase in socioeconomic gender equality. The female labor force participation rate, which comprised one-quarter in 1970 and rose to one-half in 1996, is currently at 55.6 percent, though it remains lower than the OECD average rate of 61.8 percent.“We cannot ignore the intensifying debate in this changing society that free engagement in sexual self-choice is being considered with regard to self-respect and the pursuit of happiness,” said the Constitutional Court on Feb. 26 on the petition against the adultery law.But the judges drew attention to the “undeniable fact” that the anticheating law had historically protected women, who were economically disadvantaged, giving them important leverage to secure compensation and alimony in the case of divorce.The Constitutional Court, however, cited other more recent laws in the civil court that now guarantee custody without gender prejudice and help protect underprivileged women in place of the adultery law. In fact, the adultery law was often used by husbands as a resort for revenge and to acquire financial benefit over “temporarily wayward housewives,” according to the court.Since the law, which punishes adultery for up to two years in prison, takes effect only when and for as long as a spouse presses charges, “the adulterer and his or her lover’s legal fates (hung) completely in the partner’s hands.” The most high-profile such case was in October 2008, when legal debate and public interest over the 1953 statute reached its peak. Korean actress Ok So-ri filed a petition against the adultery law, following her husband actor Park Chul’s lawsuit against her for having an extramarital sexual relationship with his friend, an operatic pop singer. Ok’s lawyers said the statute had “degenerated into a means of revenge” and that it constituted a “serious violation” of its citizens’ right to sexual freedom. Justice Kim Hee-ok said during the legal hearing that the adultery law “punished an act that ought only to be criticized ethically.” The Constitutional Court came one vote short of overturning the law. Ok and her lover were sentenced to eight and six months in prison, respectively, suspended for two years. For the most part, however, incidents of adultery were not prosecuted in criminal court. The Constitutional Court cited figures showing that less than 10 percent of reported adultery cases resulted in prison sentences as proof that the adultery law was “markedly weakening” as a punitive resort. Though about 30 percent of 2,000 surveyed men admitted to having extramarital sex, over 20 percent of those who committed adultery faced legal penalties, according to the Korean Women’s Development Institute in 2014. The Constitutional Court ruled that the adultery law was “completely ineffective” in saving marriages, which had often already broken down by the time the cases reached the criminal court, and that there was “no existing positive research” supporting its deterrent effect. Seven of the nine judges declared that “the sustainment of marriage should be entrusted to the free will and love of spouses,” rather than the state, which should be “less intrusive and controlling” over individuals’ right to self-choice. South Korea was until February one of only three non-Muslim Asian countries, along with Taiwan and the Philippines, to criminalize adultery.

Moon Jae-in visited a military unit near the border with North Korea on Wednesday, in an apparent bid to erase public perceptions of his party as being Pyongyang sympathizers.Wearing a marine’s uniform, complete with protective headgear and camouflage face paint, the New Politics Alliance for Democracy chairman visited the 2nd Marine Division as rival parties geared up for next month’s by-elections. Four districts, three of which had been held by a now-disbanded minor leftist party, will be contested in the April polls. New Politics Alliance for Democracy leader Rep. Moon Jae-in takes a ride on an amphibious armored vehicle during his visit to the 2nd Marine Division at Gimpo, Gyeonggi Province, Wednesday. (Yonhap)Moon timed his visit to the outpost to coincide with the eve of the fifth anniversary of the North’s 2010 sinking of the South Korean naval corvette Cheonan, an incident that the North has repeatedly denied culpability for.His visit also comes after his party reissued statements criticizing the North’s 2010 attack, seemingly to rebuke the ruling Saenuri Party’s attempt to hold the NPAD accountable for allegedly supporting pro-North forces. This comes in light of the attack on U.S. Ambassador to Seoul Mark Lippert earlier this month by a leftist extremist.“The Cheonan sinking was the result of a failed national security policy led by the Saenuri Party,” Moon said during his stop at the marine base near the West Sea.“Instead of using the incident to improve the nation’s defense posture, the Saenuri Party used it to frame others as pro-North figures.”Many voters view the NPAD as being too soft on Pyongyang. The party is also the political offspring of past administrations that gave millions in aid to the North, money that conservatives in the South suspect eventually helped the North pay for its nuclear program.With next month’s by-elections seen as an opportunity for Moon to prove his leadership and restore his party’s approval ratings, the NPAD has been intensifying moves to clean up its reputation.“Public opinion here has been conservative in terms of the nation’s North Korea policy, and liberal in terms of its domestic economic policies,” said Yun Seong-yi, professor of Korean politics at Kyung Hee University in Seoul.“The NPAD must pursue a centrist agenda on national security to increase its political support base.”But another expert asserted that whether the NPAD succeeded in rallying more voters to its cause would depend on something more than the party’s own efforts.“Political positioning is not accomplished by yourself,” said Choi Young-jin, professor of political thinking at Chung-Ang University in Seoul.“There must be other extremist parties on the spectrum for a party to be considered as a more moderate and centrist group.“There are far-left and far-right parties in Japan and Europe that allow moderate parties to successfully position themselves in the center during elections.”This means the NPAD needs the more left-leaning minor opposition Justice Party to expand its public standing and be considered a centrist political group, Choi said.The far-left Unified Progressive Party was dissolved late last year by the Constitutional Court, which cited risk to public security as it supported North Korean political philosophies.The NPAD’s efforts to boost its national security credentials also continued with its criticism of the Saenuri Party.The party released a statement Wednesday against Saenuri chair Rep. Kim Moo-sung for his comments Tuesday, which virtually admitted that the North was a nuclear state.Kim had cited the North’s three nuclear tests as grounds for it to be considered a nuclear power in a speech at Busan. Foreign policy experts have cautioned that such comments could support the North’s ambitions of gaining unofficial international approval for its nuclear program, overthrowing decades of efforts to denuclearize the hermit state.

The 35-year-old had no income at the time and was relying on a state subsidy to take care of her son. It took her a year and a half to win the case, with the court ordering her ex to pay her 300,000 won ($270) every month.Kim’s uphill battle, however, continued, as her ex-boyfriend cut off all contact shortly after the verdict, leaving Kim still empty-handed.“I didn’t want to go through that lawsuit ever again. ... It was the most stressful thing I’d ever done,” she told The Korea Herald. “What is worse is that all that stress was for nothing.” Kim is one of some 390,000 single parents in Korea who have never received child support from the other parent. In 2012, 83 percent of all single parents in the country said they were never paid child support. Of those, only 4.6 percent filed a lawsuit. Even among those who won their cases, 77.4 percent said they did not receive support from the other parent, in spite of a judgement from the court. As of 2014, 77.3 percent of all Korean single parents were women. In order to tackle the problem, the Gender Equality Ministry will begin the operation of an agency on Wednesday to support child-rearing single parents by enforcing child support payments. Those who utilize the agency’s services will be able to sue the other parent for a child support order for free and hire a collector to collect overdue payments. The agency will also help parents track down the other parent should they cut off contact to avoid payments. “The main goal of this newly launched service is to provide a safe environment for children of single-parent households and guarantee their access to necessary resources,” said Park Bok-soon, a scholar who participated in the foundation of the agency. Korea’s lack of late child support payment penalties, as well as enforcement, are linked to the country’s high overseas adoption rates, as well as the low income of single-parent households. About 90 percent of Korean adoptees are born to unwed, single mothers who have few resources to raise their children alone and are vulnerable to social stigmatization.According to government data, the average monthly income of single-parent households was 1.72 million won, which is less than half the average of all households in the country at 3.53 million won. Meanwhile, it costs about 5 million won to file a lawsuit to get child support. Shannon Doona Heit, a Korean adoptee and a Seoul-based activist, said the establishment of the agency was a “step in the right direction as far as ensuring the rights of unwed mothers to be able to raise their children.”“I think (Korea’s high overseas adoption rate) has been a combined problem of lack of paternal responsibility, both time and money, as well as lack of support from the government,” Heit said.“Knowing they are unable to enforce child support from the father, knowing the discrimination they’ll face in the workplace, knowing the lack of government support, many women feel adoption is their only realistic option.”The Korean government currently offers a monthly allowance of 150,000 won for domestic adoptive parents for child care costs, but 100,000 won for single parents including unwed and divorced mothers. Even for mother Kim, having to raise her son alone was the biggest challenge. The beauty industry worker was forced to take multiple part-time jobs to support her baby while she stayed at a single mothers’ shelter. Before taking her current job, Kim’s monthly income was unstable, ranging from as little as 300,000 won up to 1 million won. “I thought maybe it was better for him if I just gave him up for adoption,” she said. Kim pursued her lawsuit with the support of the state-run Korea Legal Aid Corporation, which is collaborating with the Gender Ministry for the newly launched service. Kim’s experience, however, was not positive, as even her own lawyer suggested that she withdraw the case and “persuade” her ex’s family instead. “The lawyer once told me to visit my ex’s parents on traditional holidays with the baby,” she said. “He said once they see the baby, maybe the families would change their mind and decide to support him. If that was the case, I wouldn’t have filed the suit to begin with. “This is why the lawsuit was so stressful. ... Imagine a lawsuit where you have to persuade your own lawyer.”Kim Eun-hee, a Daegu-based activist for single parents’ rights, said laws should be further fortified to impose a criminal penalty for overdue child support payments. The activist said she witnessed a number of single mothers being threatened by fathers of their babies. One mother, for instance, withdrew her case after her ex-boyfriend’s mother verbally attacked her for “ruining her son’s reputation,” and threatened to take custody of the child. “The new service seems promising, but I’m not sure how much of a change it will bring,” she said. “From our personal experiences, we doubt that civil punishments would do much.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","unwed mother sued her ex ,ex boyfriend mother verbally attacked ,an unwed mother sued her ,mother sued her ex boyfriend ,young an unwed mother sued","['Kim Sun - young', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'the Korea Herald', 'Kim', 'Korea', 'korean', 'the Gender Equality Ministry', 'Park Bok - soon', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Doona Heit', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'Heit', 'korean', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Korea Legal Aid Corporation', 'the Gender Ministry', 'Kim', 'Eun - hee', 'Daegu', 'Claire Lee']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.77514684 -0.07624151

Chile, Israel and Turkey made up the top three, while Finland was the most free of conflict factors.Over the past few years, Korea has seen a widening income gap, along with worsening press freedom. According to Statistics Korea, the country’s poverty gap ― the disparity between median household income and average income of the poor ― marked 36.4 percent in 2014, increasing each year from 34.5 percent in 2011.Korea’s press freedom ranking has also been weakening, according to Reporters Without Borders, from 50th overall in 2013 to 57th in 2014 and 60th this year.In a comprehensive “social conflict” index combining both conflict factors and conflict-management competence, South Korea was ranked fifth worst out of 24 countries. Turkey, Greece, Chile and Italy were ranked highest, while the Scandinavian trio of Denmark, Finland and Sweden were least vulnerable to conflict.“Both the social conflict and social conflict-management indices showed a meaningful correlation with economic development, but not conflict factors. This implies that we need to focus more on positive aspects from managing social conflicts,” the report said.

The news was quickly followed by reports concerning other celebrity couples. Lee Min-ho (left) and Suzy. OSENAs related stories poured out, other headlines got less attention. Among such stories included news concerning former President Lee Myung-bak. On Monday, The Herald Business, a sister paper of The Korea Herald, raised concerns that the Korea Resources Corp. may have given some companies favorable treatment in extending more than 280 billion won ($254 million) in loans, citing information provided by Rep. Kim Je-nam of the minor opposition Justice Party.According to data Kim acquired from the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, the state-run company provided 29 companies with more than 282.2 billion won in low-interest loans during the five years of the Lee Myung-bak administration. During his term, former President Lee Myung-bak emphasized the need to develop natural resources overseas, and his so-called “resource diplomacy” has since become a subject of parliamentary investigation, as many of the massive investments led by Lee ended up with huge losses. Entertainment industry officials have since told various news outlets that using celebrity news to cover up political issues is unheard of. But major celebrity news have been broken in similar timing to controversial news concerning hot-button political and social issues in the past.The timing at which the news of Lee-Suzy couple was released appears to have fed the conspiracy theory. The news broke on Monday, but all photographs released by the outlet that broke the story were taken more than a week earlier.

Although the view is often photo-worthy, the experience has become less and less pleasant in recent years, as a thick smog of ultrafine dust blurs out what otherwise had been an arresting contrast of blues.“I always carry a protective mask in my bag to wear whenever the ultrafine dust advisories are issued,” she said. Korea is indeed more dust-shrouded than ever. Students learn how to wear protective masks at Gangseo Elementary School in western Seoul last week. (Yonhap)Along with yellow dust from China in spring, ultrafine dust or particulate matter 2.5 ― particles 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter ― have become a major threat to public health. Last year, the Seoul Metropolitan Government issued ultrafine alerts 11 times, triple the number from the year before, city officials said. The capital also saw an average ultrafine dust concentration of 25.2 micrograms per cubic meter in 2012, which is more than double the safe level advised by the World Health Organization, according to the Environment Ministry. In the same year, other major metropolitan cities such as New York, London and Paris reached only around 15 micrograms per cubic meter. Health concerns are escalating as PM-2.5 can lead to much more serious health problems than other larger particles.“Ultrafine dust is so small that it not only causes respiratory problems but also enters the circulatory system unlike other types of dust,” said Kim Woon-soo, a senior research fellow at the Seoul Institute.While China has generally been blamed for the murky air in the case of yellow dust, the significantly lesser-known cause of the ultrafine dust comes from home, experts say.Recent studies have found that the majority of PM 2.5 here originates from within the peninsula.In 2013, ultrafine dust from China only accounted for 30 to 50 percent of the total, the government’s data showed. The rest was triggered by local coal-fired power plants and diesel cars. Ultrafine dust from coal-fired plants According to Greenpeace East Asia in Seoul, about 60 percent of ultrafine dust came from coal combustion in 2011. Of this, emissions from coal-fired power plants accounted for 3.4 percent. While the PM 2.5 emission amount from the plants seems minimal, experts noted that other emissions from the power facilities are secondary sources of ultrafine dust. Yeongheung Coal Power Plant in Incheon (Greenpeace)“When coal is combusted, nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides are emitted as gases. But the problem is that these gases turn into nitrate and sulphate after chemically reacting with other substances, becoming secondary particles of PM 2.5,” said environmental health professor Lee Jong-tae at Korea University. “It is believed that the secondary ultrafine dust accounts for 20 to 50 percent of the total ultrafine dust.” According to the Seoul Metropolitan Government’s data in 2009, 41 percent of the ultrafine dust was composed of the secondary products created in the air. With both the primary and secondary pollutants coming from the coal-fired facilities, Greenpeace has estimated that ultrafine particles could be responsible for up to 1,600 deaths a year.The death toll could reach 2,800 by 2021 if the government pushes ahead with the construction plan for additional coal-fired power facilities, the global environment organization said. As of January, Korea has been running 53 coal-fired power stations with a generation capacity of 26,273 megawatts, supporting 40 percent of the nationwide electricity usage.Having limited options for natural energy sources, the government has mainly relied on coal-fired plants, citing the low-cost and simple operation process. As part of the state’s electricity supply scheme, 24 additional plants are either under construction or will be built in six years. “While other countries are putting efforts into reducing the coal usage, the Korean government is anachronously perceiving the situation despite how more people are dying early because of the increasing coal-fired power stations,” claimed Greenpeace campaigner Son Min-woo. Environmentalists argue that the government should at least tighten the monitoring regulations over the coal-related power stations to protect the public health as well as the environment. Under Korean environmental law, all facility owners are mandated to keep the emission level of harmful waste under a certain limit. If the limit is exceeded, the facility in question can face a shutdown.But coal-fired power stations have never been forced to close regardless of the emission level, due to several legal loopholes, the activists said.According to the Clean Air Conservation Act, the facilities that excessively released pollutants can be exempt from suspension if the punishment is likely to “substantially” impede the livelihood of the country’s residents, national economy and public interest. The Environment Ministry, instead, imposes a fine up to 200 million won ($178,000). The decision of whether to shut down the facility solely depends on the authority of provisional governors or city mayors, the Environment Ministry said. “The current regulation only serves as a special favor for the coal-fired power plants,” campaigner Son said. “The state needs to strengthen the anti-emission rules so that the facilities actually work on reducing releasing pollutants.” Diesel cars ― another culprit of ultrafine dust While coal is considered one of the main sources of ultrafine dust, vehicles -― diesel cars in particular ― are also known to attribute to the phenomenon. “Compared to other types of cars, diesel vehicles release much more PM 2.5 and other pollutants such as carbon monoxide or hydrocarbon,” said Korea Environment Institute senior researcher Kang Kwang-kyu.The Environment Ministry’s recent data showed that diesel cars emit about 30 times more ultrafine dust than other vehicles. The WHO has also confirmed that diesel exhaust fumes can cause cancer. Acknowledging the health risk, the Environment Ministry and some municipalities have put efforts into reducing the number of diesel cars for a decade while encouraging the diesel vehicle owners to equip the cars with pollutant-reducing devices.In yet another paradoxical move, however, the government announced last year that it would introduce diesel taxis starting this September in a bid to alleviate financial difficulties of cab companies.Under the plan, the Transport Ministry will provide fuel subsidies for 10,000 diesel cabs every year. Currently, only LPG taxis drivers are eligible for financial assistance.“Compared to private vehicles, the driving mileage of cabs is eight to 10 times longer, which means that running one diesel taxi is equivalent to riding eight to 10 cars. In other words, allowing 10,000 diesel cabs will be the same as having pollutants from 80,000 to 100,000 cars with much more PM 2.5,” said Song Sang-seok, secretary-general of Network for Green Transport.Faced by public concerns over the negative environmental impact, Seoul City said it would not implement the government’s initiative to increase the number of diesel taxis.The Environment Ministry also said it would tighten the monitoring measures over pollutants from diesel cabs, a move experts derided as being wasteful and ineffective.“Throughout the past decade, the government injected trillions of won to improve air quality. While one side of the government is attempting to save the environment, the other side is putting those efforts to waste,” Song said.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","health last year the seoul ,work every morning 29 year ,year old office worker kim ,china in spring ultrafine dust ,000 diesel cabs every year","['the Hangang River', 'Seoul', 'Kim Soo - hyun', 'Korea', 'Gangseo Elementary School', 'Seoul', 'China', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'the World Health Organization', 'the Environment Ministry', 'New York', 'London', 'Paris', 'Kim Woon - soo', 'the Seoul Institute', 'China', 'China', 'Seoul', 'Lee Jong - tae', 'Korea University', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government ’s', 'Greenpeace', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Greenpeace', 'Son Min - woo', 'korean', 'the Environment Ministry', 'the Environment Ministry', 'diesel', 'Korea Environment Institute', 'Kang Kwang - kyu', 'the Environment Ministry ’s', 'who', 'the Environment Ministry', 'the Transport Ministry', 'lpg', 'Song Sang', 'Network for Green Transport', 'Seoul City', 'the Environment Ministry', 'Song', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.9084639   0.79668528

Accurate numbers are unavailable, however, due to the lack of government oversight. Unconfirmed tallies by dog meat lovers in 2012 put annual consumption at 2 million dogs.Numbers are unclear because the Livestock Products Sanitary Control Act, a law setting safety rules in the butchering of farm animals, does not label dogs as meat subject to sanitary rules, making government regulation over dog slaughterhouses a legal impossibility. Neither does it explicitly outlaw dog eating. Even when provincial laws ban dog eating, enforcement is lax.

Dogs are also rarely checked for human-transmittable diseases before distribution in meat markets.Animal rights activists cite these practices as grounds justifying the abolition of dog eating in South Korea.Dog meat advocates, however, say such a move is extreme.

In contrast, young people under 14, whose numbers are directly tied to births, made up 14.3 percent of the total population in 2014 from 14.7 percent the year before and 21.1 percent in 2000.The statistical office said at the current pace, the percentage of senior citizens will rise to 24.3 percent in 2030 and 32.3 percent a decade later. The figures come amid growing fears that South Korea is fast approaching the ""aged society"" boundary in which more than 14 percent of the population is 65 or older. The government expects the country will become a super-aged society around 2026 when at least 20 percent of the people will be over 65. South Korea became an ""aging society"" in 2000, when the ratio topped 7 percent.Experts have expressed concerns that the aging population, coupled with low birth rates, poses a serious threat to the nation's economy as it could lead to fewer working people and increased spending on health and welfare.The latest data then showed that every 100 working-age people supported the livelihoods of 17.3 senior citizens last year, with this number expected to triple to 100 people providing for 57.2 senior citizens in 2040.Affected by falling birth rates, the country's population will peak at about 52.16 million in 2030 before dropping to 51.09 million by 2040, the agency forecast.The statistical office said the number of people tying the knot fell 1.3 percent to 323,000 last year, with those getting a divorce standing at 114,000, or a rise of 0.9 percent.The percentage of economically active people rose 0.9 percentage point on-year to 62.4 percent, with numbers going up for both men and women.The employment rate stood at 60.2 percent for last year, a gain of 0.7 percentage point vis-a-vis 2013.The findings also showed South Koreans are growing more health conscious.

Two years ago, the divorced father of three was diagnosed with cerebellar ataxia, a rare brain disease with no effective treatment.Unable to move and work and with no viable help from his families, he relied on government-certified nannies to take care of his kids -― aged 10, 7 and 5 ― in the evenings and on weekends when they are out of school and a state-run day care center.But things have gotten much more difficult for Seok this year as the Gender Ministry cut its budget for the child care program by 458 million won ($418,360). With the cut, families with children aged 3 months to 12 years can now utilize the service for a maximum of 480 hours a year, compared to the previous 720. This means a daily nanny can only stay for an hour and 33 minutes a day.“I need nannies to come in every day because of my medical condition,” Seok told The Korea Herald. “But after the budget cuts, my nanny can only stay for less than two hours a day ― which is devastating. The weekends are the worst ... They are just at home with me, but I literally cannot do anything for them.”Since the Gender Equality Ministry established the program in 2007, the number of households who use the service increased dramatically from 6,000 to 54,362 in 2013. This year’s budget cut is expected to deal a blow to such households as well as nannies hired by the government for the service.For Jeong Seoum-gyul, a 36-year-old working mother in Daegu, the limited hours of the program have turned into a financial burden. The part-time school teacher who also works at a car washing service had been relying on nannies to take care of her 29-month-old daughter.While the daughter stayed at a day care center, nannies were Jeong’s only resort when she worked from 4 a.m. to 7 a.m. at a car wash with her husband every morning.Now, because of the limited hours of the service, Jeong feels she is only left with terrible options.“I either have to quit my job at the car wash or hire a nanny from a private company to take care of my daughter starting at 4 a.m., though I don’t know if any nanny (from a private company) would be even willing to work at 4 a.m.,” Jeong told The Korea Herald.“Either way, I would have to spend at least about 600,000 won ($533) more every month. For people like us who have to make ends meet, that’s not a small cost,” Jeong said. What disturbs Jeong most, she said, is that the government decided to cut back the program without warning.“I wish they at least had told me in advance so I could have planned ahead,” Jeong said.“They told us the decision very abruptly without offering any alternative options for us. It feels almost as if I’ve been conned by the government.”The ministry explains that the latest budget cut was due to “overlapping” child care programs offered by other ministries. The Education Ministry, for instance, offers an after-school child care service where schools look after children of working parents after classes are over. The Welfare Ministry, for its part, provides special child care services for babies aged from 6 to 36 months.“Parents still tend to prefer having nannies take care of their children at their homes instead of placing the children at day care centers,” Gender Minister Kim Hee-jung had said in last year’s National Assembly meeting. She criticized the Strategy and Finance Ministry for citing similar programs as a way to downsize the budget.The Gender Ministry said it would continue to seek ways to expand the program.“We acknowledge that some may find the things (resulting from the budget cuts) difficult,” said Song Young-gwang from the ministry. “We’ll continue to have discussions to tackle the issues.”Meanwhile, the government’s budget curtailment is also affecting the nannies, who have already been struggling with low wages, weak job security and the government’s unilateral decisions on employment terms. As of February 2014, a total of 13,889 have been hired by the government for the child care service.Among many welfare workers hired by the government, nannies working for the child care program earn the lowest wages ― 6,000 won ($5.30) an hour. Those who care for the elderly earn 7,425 won, while those who work for people with disabilities make 8,810 won.Although the government raised the nannies’ hourly wage from 5,500 won to 6,000 won this year, the workers were informed in September that they would no longer receive extra stipends for transportation. Up until September, the workers were given 1,000 won to 1,500 won per commute.Lee Kyung-seon, a nanny based in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province, now spends about 100,000 won additionally every month because she no longer receives the transportation allowance.“I make 12,000 won to care for a child for two hours, and I spend 4,000 won on transportation. So in the end, I am only making 4,000 won an hour, which is lower than the minimum wage ― 5,580 won,” she told The Korea Herald.Observers said the government’s decision overlooks the Labor Law, which states in Article 94 that an employer must consult with the majority of workers when amending rules of employment, and seek their consent if the rules are to be modified unfavorably for workers.The workers say the Gender Ministry informed them of the cut via text message.“Transportation cost is just one of many problems,” said labor attorney Kim Min-cheol. “The nannies must be given a total of 15 days of vacation every year by law. If they don’t get these days off, they should be paid extra. But I know many nannies who didn’t know the vacation time even existed.“The government as an employer cannot go against the nation’s labor law,” he added. “This should be fixed.”Kwon, a nanny in Gwangju, said she only learned about the country’s Labor Standards Act last year, after almost eight years of working as a government-certified caretaker. After the transportation allowance cut, she commutes by walking, which takes about 40 minutes each way.“It was extremely shocking and disillusioning to find out that the government, not even a private company, does not follow the labor law.”The government has been stepping up efforts in recent years to provide a better welfare and support system for mothers nationwide, in an effort to fight the declining birthrate and aging society.Despite President Park Geun-hye’s renewed emphasis in February on the need to tackle the population crisis, parents say they still suffer from inconsistent policies that fail to fully reflect reality.Korea’s birthrate stood at 1.18 child per woman last year ― the lowest in the OECD. An inadequate number of state-run child care facilities as well as poor work-life balance for double-income married couples have been considered some of the key contributing factors.The government predicts that the nation’s military would be short of 84,000 soldiers by 2030, and almost half of the entire population will be 65 or older by 2100 at the current birthrate.Jeong, the working mother in Daegu, said she and her husband recently decided against expanding their family.“It seems like having a second child is a privilege for those who have money and resources,” she said.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","40 year old single father ,the budget cuts my nanny ,the divorced father of three ,year old single father living ,her husband recently decided against","['Seok Gwang - soo', 'Pohang', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'Seok', 'Gender Ministry', 'Seok', 'the Korea Herald', 'the Gender Equality Ministry', 'Jeong Seoum', 'Daegu', 'Jeong', 'Jeong', 'Jeong', 'the Korea Herald', 'Jeong', 'Jeong', 'Jeong', 'the Education Ministry', 'the Welfare Ministry', 'Gender', 'Kim Hee - jung', 'National Assembly', 'Strategy', 'Finance Ministry', 'the Gender Ministry', 'Song Young', 'Lee Kyung - seon', 'Suwon', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'the Korea Herald', 'Gender Ministry', 'Kim Min - cheol', 'Park Geun', 'Korea', 'OECD', 'Jeong', 'Daegu', 'Claire Lee']",13,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.60562658  0.35780203

A little over 25 percent said they have witnessed or heard of others experiencing the same.  The most common type of harassment involved unwanted physical contact at 57.6 percent, followed by verbal harassment at 45.5 percent.  More than half, or 54.5 percent, of the victims said the offenders were other students who were their senior. Some 27.3 percent said they were harassed by professors.  Most of the victims did not confront the offenders directly, with 66.7 percent letting the incident slide and 30.3 percent suggesting they should stop. A little over 24 percent said they thought it was their fault.  Some 58 percent of those who did not confront the offenders said they thought doing so would not solve the problem, while 48.4 percent said they had not expected to be harassed. Some 45 percent said they were afraid of rumors spreading.  Nearly 60 percent of those who witnessed or heard of others being harassed said they didn't intervene. The most common reason was because the incident didn't directly concern them at 41.8 percent.  SNU has been at the center of mounting concerns over sexual harassment at universities. In December, a math professor at SNU was criminally charged with groping nearly a dozen of his or other universities' female students between 2008 and 2013.  In February, sources at SNU said several male students allegedly touched their female peers' private parts inappropriately at a retreat in 2012.

The poll was conducted on 810 foreigners who visited last year, with over half being from Asian countries, the state-run organization said.  Samgyupsal BibimbapAmerican visitors rated Korean food the highest at 82.44, followed by Japanese and Europeans at 78.54 and 77.82, the report said. Chinese visitors, who made up the largest percentage of respondents, graded Korean cuisine the lowest at 70. “While American or Janapese people tend to visit here as free travel, many Chinese tourists come through agency-led travel packages, having limited options to explore the cuisine, thereby eating at restaurants where the quality is not guaranteed,” said the KCTI’s research fellow Kwon Tae-il. “But the figure of 70 cannot be said to be seriously low.” Tourists loved bibimbap the most at around 35 percent, followed by bulgogi at 33 percent. Samgyeop-sal, grilled pork belly, took the third spot at 30 percent.Travelers’ favorite food differed by nationality. While Japanese visitors loved galbi, or ribs, and Chinese preferred samgyeop-sal, Westerners from European countries or the U.S. enjoyed bulgogi the most, the survey revealed. Tourists disliked grilled fish the most, followed by cold noodles and rice soup. Traditional stews such as doenjang jjigae, made with soybean paste, and kimchi jjigae were also rated as unsatisfactory, it added. When choosing a restaurant during their travels, foreign visitors considered the taste as the most important factor, at 81 percent. The freshness of ingredients, menu diversity and service quality were also regarded as essential in their decision-making. Respondents of the survey comprised 350 Chinese, 126 Japanese and 190 visitors from other Asian countries. Around 60 Americans, 43 Europeans and 41 people from other nations also took part in the survey.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","bibimbapamerican visitors rated korean food ,rated korean food the highest ,samgyupsal bibimbapamerican visitors rated korean ,visitors rated korean food the ,visitors rated korean food","['Korea', 'korean', 'korean', 'the Korea Culture and Tourism Institute', 'asian', 'Samgyupsal BibimbapAmerican', 'korean', 'Japanese', 'Europeans', 'chinese', 'korean', 'american', 'janapese', 'chinese', 'Kwon Tae - il', 'japanese', 'chinese', 'westerner', 'european', 'U.S.', 'Chinese', 'japanese', 'asian', 'Americans', 'Europeans', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.13496456  0.81883854

The number of obese Korean men had doubled since 2003, while the number of Korean women with the condition increased by 30 percent in the same period.While the Health Ministry says higher consumption of fast food and physical inactivity are likely to be the major risk factors, some experts think the statistics have to do with something else ― the nation’s collective sleep deprivation.  Neurologist Lee Hyang-woon examines a patient at the Epilepsy and Sleep Center at Ewha Womans University Mokdong Hospital in Seoul. (Ewha Womans University)Mokdong HospitalOverseas studies show that those who are consistently sleep deprived ― getting less than seven to eight hours nightly ― have a higher risk of depression, Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and obesity. In 2013, a single Korean person on average slept less than seven hours a day, which was the lowest among the countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Also in the same year, Koreans worked the second-longest hours among members of the OECD, 30 percent longer than the OECD average.“One thing that sleep does is balance our appetite,” said neurologist Lee Hyang-woon. “It does that by regulating the levels of the hormones that control our feelings of fullness and hunger. Those who are sleep-deprived may often feel that they need to eat more. Lack of sleep can also disrupt fat metabolism.”A recent overseas study suggested that missing just 30 minutes of sleep during weeknights could lead to obesity and other health problems. Especially, weekday sleep debt may lead to long-term metabolic disruption that promotes the onset of or worsening of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, the study found.The study, authored by professor Shahrad Taheri at Cornell Medical College in Doha, Qatar, also found that catching up on sleep on weekends did not do anything to reverse the effects of weekday sleep debt.Meanwhile, the number of Koreans with depression, which can be both the cause and result of insomnia, also increased from 556,000 in 2009 to 665,000 in 2013.Lee said this may be also linked to lack of sleep, especially REM sleep. Also called paradoxical sleep, REM sleep lets us forget what we don’t particularly want to remember, like a “second gut,” the sleep specialist said. “It somehow reads your subconscious mind and selects what will be permanently stored in your long-term memories, and what will be deleted,” she said. “This is why many people feel much better after a good night’s sleep, even if they had a bad day the day before.”As REM sleep is thought to be essential for memory consolidation, feelings and moods, not getting enough of it can bring a number of undesirable consequences.“If you don’t get enough REM sleep, it’s easy for you to become anxious, depressed and hysterical,” she said.“It also makes it hard for you to focus and makes you more easily irritated, and this can eventually lead to sleep disorders.”Lee also noted that many Koreans have poor sleep hygiene. Sleep hygiene is a variety of practices that are required to have normal nighttime sleep and full daytime alertness.“One of the biggest problems is that there is too much noise and light in the city,” the sleep specialist said. “Try to block out all distracting noise and eliminate as much light as possible. And don’t play with your phone at least for an hour before bedtime. Don’t place your electronic devices on your bed.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","korean men had doubled since ,obesity in 2013 single korean ,obese korean men had doubled ,men had doubled since 2003 ,weeknights could lead to obesity","['South Korea ’s', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'korean', 'korean', 'the Health Ministry', 'Lee Hyang - woon', 'the Epilepsy and Sleep Center at', 'Ewha Womans University Mokdong Hospital', 'Seoul', 'Ewha Womans', 'korean', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'Koreans', 'OECD', 'OECD', 'Lee Hyang - woon', 'Shahrad Taheri', 'Cornell Medical College', 'Doha', 'Qatar', 'Koreans', 'rem', 'rem', 'Koreans', 'Claire Lee']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.90459406  0.82472217

(123rf)A total of 10.6 percent migrant wives lived in such regions in 2012, while only 2.6 percent of Korean women were residing in the areas.Cho also quoted a study by Kyungpook National University which found that female marriage immigrants from Vietnam ― the university surveyed 180 ― hardly gained any weight while pregnant, and often did not show up for their regular checkups during and after pregnancies.“Showing up for your regular checkups while you are pregnant is extremely important, because it lets your doctor detect any problems early on,” Cho told The Korea Herald. “At the same time, it’s hard for pregnant women not to gain weight. Not gaining much weight means the mother may be suffering from malnutrition or severe morning sickness. Those two findings tell us that these mothers do not have either enough money, information or family support for their food and medical needs.”In fact, a 2013 study by professor Kim Young-mee at the Red Cross College of Nursing at Chung-Ang University found that 35.9 percent of Korean husbands and 54.6 percent of Korean mothers-in-law of 120 immigrant wives were not aware of or had little knowledge of postpartum culture in the women’s home countries. Kim, who is also a professional nurse, has taught many marriage immigrants as well as their Korean family members the importance of nutrition during pregnancy.She has witnessed many foreign-born women being forced to eat Korean food only while suffering from morning sickness and after giving birth, as their in-laws and spouses wanted them to assimilate into Korean culture as soon as possible. As a result, the women sometimes ended up skipping meals. Some in-laws simply didn’t like the smell of non-Korean food in their house, she said.“Many of the women told me that it was especially hard for them to cope with the smell of Korea’s fermented dishes, such as kimchi, as well as the smell of garlic when they are dealing with morning sickness,” she told The Korea Herald. “One of the women I know was from Mongolia, and she had never eaten any seafood before moving to Korea. And all of the sudden, she was expected to eat miyeokguk ― a seaweed soup traditionally served on birthdays and to women who have just given birth. I was also told that many of the in-laws don’t even explain what miyeoguk means in Korea’s postpartum culture, and simply force their daughters-in-law to eat it.”Kim said mutual understanding and assimilation is very important in multicultural households. Infants born with low birth weight ― often caused by insufficient prenatal care, poor nutrition of the mother as well as preterm birth ― carry a higher risk of infection, developmental delays and even obesity, according to Kim and Cho.“It’s disheartening to see cultural conflicts in households negatively affecting the newborns’ health,” Kim said. “All pregnant women should be allowed to eat what they would like to eat the most.”About 70 percent of multicultural families in South Korea consist of Korean husbands and foreign-born wives, mostly from Southeast Asian countries and China. The women on average marry their Korean spouses at age 26.9, and 80 percent of them become pregnant within the first two years of marriage.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","babies than korean women study ,35 percent of korean husbands ,weight babies than korean women ,forced to eat korean food ,to poor nutrition during pregnancy","['Kimchi', 'Doenjangjjigae', 'Koreans', 'korean', 'korean', 'Cho Geum - jun', 'Korea University Guro Hospital', 'korean', 'korean', 'Cho', 'Kyungpook National University', 'Vietnam', 'Cho', 'the Korea Herald', 'Kim Young - mee', 'the Red Cross College', 'Chung - Ang University', 'korean', 'korean', 'Kim', 'korean', 'korean', 'korean', 'non - korean', 'Korea ’s', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Kim', 'Cho', 'Kim', 'South Korea', 'korean', 'southeast asian', 'China', 'korean', 'Claire Lee']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.78564298  0.13772301

Wearing a ritzy yellow jacket, the president appeared excited about her nine-day trip onboard Air Force One last Sunday, telling reporters that she would generate a “second Middle East boom” for South Korean companies making inroads into the oil-rich nations, and that was why she was “diligently” traveling around.Park’s spontaneous speech appeared to show the trip meant a lot to her. Indeed, the four-nation tour, her first overseas trip this year, was widely viewed as an opportunity for the president to reclaim the people’s attention. A series of political scandals as well as the government’s inconsistent policies on tax and health insurance have damaged her credibility. Her lack of communication with the public only boosted her authoritarian image. Last month, her approval ratings plummeted to below 30 percent, the lowest rating since she assumed office in early 2013.To restore public confidence, Park spent the first two months of this year conducting a partial Cabinet reshuffle and reorganizing the presidential office. And just two days before she left for the Middle East, Park replaced her chief secretary ― the last piece of puzzle to complete her new lineup. She was definitely ready for a fresh start.Then something unexpected happened during her overseas trip, again.Mark Lippert, the youngest-ever U.S. ambassador to Korea, was attacked by an ultraleft South Korean activist. Pictures of Lippert’s face covered with blood dominated news coverage both in Korea and the U.S. just when she was ready to show off her illustrious sales diplomacy that helped Korean firms inch closer to the nuclear plant project, worth $2 billion, in Saudi Arabia.Korean officials in Abu Dhabi responded fast, delivering Park’s reaction to the knife attack. But it was obvious that they had been taken aback by the news, knowing that Park’s sales diplomacy would lose steam.This is not the first time that one of her overseas trips has been overshadowed by unforeseen accidents.On her first trip to the United States in May 2013, then-presidential spokesman Yoon Chang-jung sexually assaulted a Korean-American hired to help the Seoul delegation in Washington.When Park was visiting China in June the same year, minutes recorded during the 2007 inter-Korean summit were disclosed, putting the country in a deep ideological turmoil. A rebellion conspiracy involving a progressive lawmaker as well as a scandal involving an ex-top prosecutor’s son born out of wedlock stirred controversy during her trip to Russia and Vietnam in September 2013.She was also pressed to apologize over backtracking on a welfare pledge during the APEC summit held in Indonesia and to withdraw her nomination of prime minister-designate Moon Chang-keuk over his pro-Japanese past remarks during her trip to Central Asia last year.In October, the ruling Saenuri chief Rep. Kim Moo-sung, who has been regarded as Park’s bittersweet rival, generated controversy when he proposed a constitutional amendment during her trip to Italy.Despite her efforts to start afresh, the jinx on her overseas trips continued with the knife attack on the U.S. envoy this time.According to local pollster Gallup Korea, her approval rating rose 4 percentage points, much lower than expected, from last week to 37 percent, probably due to the Middle East trip. Respondents answered positively on her work and diplomacy skills, which have produced notable economic achievements.For South Korean presidents, a trip to the Middle East has often provided a dramatic turnaround during their terms.The late former President Roh Moo-hyun made a surprise visit to the Korean troops in Iraq in 2004 when there was political division over Korea’s extension of its troop deployment there. Meanwhile, Park’s predecessor Lee Myung-bak signed a landmark $20 billion nuclear plant deal with the United Arab Emirates in 2009, which opened the door for Korean firms to make inroads into global markets with domestically developed technology.It is too bad that no amount of planning could have prepared Park for yet another unfavorable event.By Cho Chung-un, Korea Herald correspondent(christory@heraldcorp.com)","four nation tour her first ,korean presidents trip to the ,nation tour her first overseas ,president appeared excited about her ,tour her first overseas trip","['Park Geun', 'south korean', 'Park', 'Cabinet', 'Park', 'Mark Lippert', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'south korean', 'Lippert ’s', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'korean', 'Saudi Arabia', 'korean', 'Abu Dhabi', 'Park ’s', 'Park', 'the United States', 'Yoon Chang - jung', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Park', 'China', 'inter - korean', 'Russia', 'Vietnam', 'APEC', 'Indonesia', 'Moon Chang - keuk', 'pro - japanese', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Park ’s', 'Italy', 'U.S.', 'Gallup Korea', 'south korean', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'korean', 'Iraq', 'Korea', 'Park ’s', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'the United Arab Emirates', 'korean', 'Cho Chung - un', 'Korea Herald correspondent(christory@heraldcorp.com']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36967304  0.56062222

Of them, women from the Philippines accounted for the highest number ― 45 percent.About 33 percent of all women who have considered the idea said it was because they want to spend their later years in their home countries, while 31 percent said they would like their children to be educated outside Korea.“It is possible for many members of South Korea’s multicultural families to emigrate to the countries of their mothers’ or wives’ origin in future,” the researchers wrote in the report.The study also found that 63.6 percent of the surveyed women have wired funds to their families in their home countries at least once in the past year. Those from the Philippines were again the highest. While 86.7 percent of Filipino wives said they have sent money to their families, 67.8 percent of Vietnamese women and 45.2 percent of Chinese wives said the same.While 47.6 percent said they sent money as gifts on holidays, 41.9 percent said the funds were to help their families back home financially. Meanwhile, 9.1 percent said they wired funds to invest in properties or businesses in their home countries.

Mark Lippert sustained cuts to his face and wrist in a knife attack by a South Korean activist who voiced his opposition to joint military drills with the U.S. The exercises are part of Seoul and Washington's efforts to better deter threats from North Korea.A preliminary probe showed that the assailant, Kim Ki-jong, had been to North Korea seven times between 1999 and 2007. He also tried to erect an altar at the heart of Seoul in memory of late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il in December 2011 shortly after he died.""We defined this case as one carried out by pro-North forces and agreed to thoroughly determine the truth and who was behind it,"" Rep. Yoo Seong-min, the floor leader of the ruling party, said in a press briefing following the meeting that was also attended by Prime Minister Lee One-koo; President Park Geun-hye's chief of staff, Lee Byung-kee; and Saenuri Party Chairman Kim Moo-sung, among others.The officials also agreed to make joint efforts to ensure the incident causes no harm to the South Korea-U.S. alliance and beef up security for foreign missions here, Yoo said.With enough evidence, the assailant could be charged with violating South Korea's National Security Law, which bans South Koreans from publicly sympathizing with the North Korean government, according to local authorities.The main opposition party New Politics Alliance for Democracy (NPAD) also condemned the attack, calling it an ""unprecedented act of terror"" and an ""unpardonable serious crime.""The party, however, expressed caution against exaggerating the incident or using it for political gain.""Some people's excessive claim that (Kim) attacked the South Korea-U.S. alliance is inappropriate,"" Rep. Jung Chung-rai of NPAD said during a party meeting.In South Korea, conservative parties such as Park's Saenuri Party have often stirred up anti-North Korean sentiment to rally support.On Thursday, Park, who is on a four-nation tour of the Middle East, called the incident an attack on the South Korea-U.S. alliance.

The year 2015 marks the 70th anniversaries of Korea’s liberation and the 95th anniversary of Yu’s passing in prison.The official naming ceremony will be held at the end of April, when the submarine will be unveiled, the Navy said.Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co. is constructing the submarine, which will be delivered to the Navy in November 2016 following test runs.According to the Navy, the submarine will be deployed in anti-vessel and anti-submarine operations. It will be equipped with an indigenous submarine-launched cruise missile, called the Haeseong, with a range of 1,000 kilometers, along with torpedoes.The Navy said the sub’s maximum underwater speed is 20 knots, and it can travel between South Korea and Hawaii without refueling.The diesel-powered submarine will be operated by Air Independent Propulsion, which bolsters the vessel’s submerged endurance and allows the crew to carry out underwater missions for up to two weeks without access to atmospheric oxygen. Yu is an iconic symbol of the March 1 independence movement.The Japanese arrested the teenager and sentenced her to seven years in prison, where she died at age 18, apparently due to harsh torture.The Navy has named its earlier Type 214 submarines after former military heroes and independence fighters. Most recently, the fifth sub in the class was dubbed “Yun Bong-gil,” after the patriot who killed two high-ranking Japanese officials and wounded several others by hurling a bomb during the birthday celebration of the Japanese emperor in 1932 in Shanghai. Yun was later executed. (Yonhap)","the first submarine bearing woman ,1902 1920 female student activist ,first submarine bearing woman ,new submarine for the south ,first submarine bearing woman name","['the south korean Navy', 'Navy', 'Yu Gwan - sun', 'Japan', 'Navy', 'Navy', 'Navy', 'Yu ’s', 'Korea', 'Yu ’s', 'Navy', 'Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co.', 'Navy', 'Navy', 'Haeseong', 'Navy', 'South Korea', 'Hawaii', 'Air Independent Propulsion', 'Japanese', 'Navy', 'Yun Bong - gil', 'japanese', 'japanese', 'Shanghai']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.14533024  0.34640807

The ministry offers incentives to employees to recruit families to the child care program, according to a public document released last year. However, the ministry grants higher rewards for recruiting top-income families than for recruiting families from the lowest-income group -- the poorest and most in need of assistance, the official added.(Yonhap)“The ministry wants to promote the fact that many people are benefiting from the service, but they want to save as much money as much as possible,” said the official of the Precarious Workers’ Union in the Public Sector.“This is their way of increasing the number of subscribers while minimizing their support cost for the poor. The more top-earning families they recruit to the service, the more money the ministry saves.”  The total number of households that use the service, in which government-certified nannies come to the household to care for the children, nearly doubled from 27,400 in 2010 to 54,300 in 2014.In that period, the proportion of subscribers from the top income bracket increased from 26 percent to 38 percent, but figure from the lowest quartile dropped significantly from 54 percent to 41 percent. The ministry subsidizes the child care service for the bottom three income brackets by 1,250 won to 4,500 won an hour, while the top-earning quartile -- households earning 4.83 million won or more per month -- pays the full price of 6,000 won an hour for the service.Households with three or more children, households with a person with disabilities, and single-parent households are prioritized for government subsidies.The ministry, for its part, said the service was becoming more popular among top-earning families because more people learned that they could use the service as long as they paid the full price themselves. “Many used to think you could use the service only if you were eligible for the government support,” said Song Young-gwang, who oversees the child support programs.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","for recruiting top income families ,income families than for recruiting ,earning families because more people ,employees to recruit families ,recruiting top income families than","['the Gender Equality Ministry', 'the Precarious Workers ’ Union', 'the Public Sector', 'household', 'Song Young', 'Claire Lee']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38669902  0.34103793

Four medical staff in Seoul were confirmed to have been infected with the virus in September last year by a 68-year-old woman who was suffering from severe fever due to thrombocytopenia syndrome, or SFTS, a fatal disease contracted through tick bites. Hospital sources suspect that the virus was transmitted while the staff were conducting cardiopulmonary resuscitation on the patient, officials said. She died of blood poisoning one day after she was hospitalized. While all staff were quickly cured under treatment, one medial resident had to be hospitalized for a week with serious symptoms, they said. This first case was belatedly reported to the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the health authorities said. The syndrome, which causes fever, vomiting, diarrhea and multiple organ failure, has been found to have a fatality rate of around 10 percent. No direct vaccines have been created so far. Korea has had a higher fatality rate from the tick-borne virus since 2013. Of 36 confirmed patients in 2013, 16 died from tick bites ― a fatality rate of 47.2 percent. From January to August last year, 10 of 24 patients died from the tick virus.While SFTS fears gripped the country at the time, the health authorities had only warned of tick bites, not of secondary infection. Human-to-human transmission was thought to be nearly impossible. Five cases of human-to-human transmission have been reported in China, with three cases involving intrafamily transmission, the authorities said. Stern precautionary measures should be taken when a suspected case of the virus infection is reported since it can be transmitted through blood or respiratory secretions, experts said.Doctors advised people to wear long clothes when spending time in the wild and to wash their clothing as soon as they return home.

The North has so far neither accepted nor rejected the proposal Seoul issued in late December.  ""Spreading (of leaflets) is in the sphere of the right to free expression per se, but it is not proper to do it openly and as if to show off,"" Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo said in an interpellation session.   The government is ""taking this issue seriously,"" Lee said, adding that he will come up with ways to address the issue.  Opposition lawmakers and residents of the border towns where the campaigns are launched have strongly called on the government to stop the leaflet scattering, citing the safety and military risks it could bring.   The government has, however, been inactive in taking action against the campaigns, repeating its stance that basically it is something that the civic sector should decide for themselves.  Earlier in the session, the new prime minister also vowed his utmost efforts in pursuing his duty as the country's second-highest official. It was Lee's first appearance in an interpellation session since being sworn into office earlier in the month.  ""I am feeling a heavy sense of duty and responsibility,"" the prime minister said in his opening remarks.  ""Above all, I will put all of my efforts in reforming every sector and the top priority will be put on reviving the economy,"" Lee said, also vowing smoother communication with citizens.

A decade later, that statistic jumped to 29.1 out of 100,000.However, the death rate of women with higher education who developed breast cancer decreased from 10.41 out of 100,000 in 2001 to 9.88 in 2011.More less-educated women are also dying from cervical cancer, according to the study. The death rate of those who never finished high school and suffered cervical cancer jumped from 6.24 out of 100,000 in 2011 to 9.15 a decade later. The mortality rate of women who never attended high school and suffered cervical cancer, in particular, more than doubled from 2001 to 2011 ― from 4.78 out of 100,000 to 11.78.Meanwhile, the rate of those who attended university only rose from 1.60 out of 100,000 in 2001 to 1.72 in 2011.Women with limited education between the age of 25 and 44 had a higher risk of dying from women’s cancers than those in the age range of 45 to 64, according to the report. “So many more women are now educated compared to the past,” said Dr. Song Yoon-mi, who organized the research. “But this also means those with limited education may experience more inequality nowadays. Limited knowledge about women’s cancers, and lack of access to information and quality health care are some of the factors that increased their risk of dying from the diseases.”Meanwhile, South Korea is one of the most-educated nations in the world.

This represents a 4.8 percent increase from the year before.  The result from the survey conducted on households with two or more members is the highest tallied since the office started taking related data in 2003.  In 2003, the average was 6,359 won, rising to 9,021 won in 2010 and 10,751 won in 2013.  Data indicated a steady rise in demand for low-alcohol soju as well as beer. Soju is a distilled beverage made up of ethanol and water.  ""The growing trend by consumers to buy wine and other imported liquor and drink them at home further pushed up numbers,"" an agency official said.  The top 20 percent of households in income spent an average of 14,657 won per month, compared to 6,861 won for the lowest income earning group.  In contrast, outlays in cigarettes continued to decline last year. Data showed monthly spending on cigarettes stood at 16,573 won, down 4 percent from the year before. This is the lowest number on record.  Outlays reached a high of 22,062 won in 2006, and after a repetition of losses and gains in the following years, it started to dip from 2011 onwards. In 2011, household spending on cigarettes stood at 18,450 won, while this was down to 17,263 won in 2013.  Unlike alcoholic beverages, middle and mid-to-lower income households spent the most on cigarettes.   As of 2013, 42.5 percent of South Korean men over 19 smoked, down 6.9 percentage point from 49.4 percent in 2003.  The government said it wants to bring down the smoking rate for men to 35 percent by 2016 and 29 percent in 2020, which should be on par with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development average.  As of Jan. 1, the government had jacked up the average price of cigarettes by 80 percent to 4,500 won from 2,500 won.

More than 800 micrograms leads to a yellow dust warning.  People are advised to stay indoors when yellow dust advisories or warnings are in place. When going outside, they are advised to wear protective glasses and yellow-dust masks.  As of 8 p.m., Seoul's atmospheric concentration levels of ""particulate matter (PM)-10"" pollutants recorded 692 micrograms per cubic meter.  PM-10 refers to airborne particles 10 micrometers or less in diameter.

There, the virus’ worst epidemic in history continues to unfold. Dozens of new patients pour every week into the Goderich treatment center in the suburbs of the capital Freetown. The 100-bed hospital, run by Italian relief group Emergency, is hardly able to keep track of patients’ names, let alone their progress. Short of hands, doctors and nurses from around the world work double shifts, scrambling to spare yet another life. The seemingly never-ending deaths of her patients, many of them small children, traumatized and dismayed the 31-year-old seasoned critical care nurse. What helped her pull herself together, she says, was the camaraderie of the international staff, her sense of mission and her newfound awareness of the power of life ― even at the edge of death. Capt. Lee Tae-heon, a Navy surgeon, attends a patient at the Ebola treatment center in Goderich in the suburbs of Freetown, Sierra Leone. (MOFA)“Before our duty came to an end, I was taking a final tour around the facility and bumped into a security guard who survived Ebola after being cared for at another center in Lakka,” Hong said in a recent interview.“I offered my congratulations but he seemed so gloomy. It turned out that he was the sole survivor in his six-member family; his parents, brothers and sisters had all died. “Hearing that he was slowly recovering and trying to rebuild his life with a new job in Goderich, I felt sad but also gained strength, realizing that we could have a positive impact on the patients and their families.”Hong’s team ― the first of its kind to respond to an overseas epidemic ― included nine other surgeons and nurses from the military and the private sector. They were discharged on Feb. 15 following a 21-day mandatory quarantine program after serving for about 30 days in the West African country starting Dec. 27. The outbreak is reported to have killed at least 9,400 people worldwide since last March, according to the World Health Organization. Seoul has pledged $5.6 million to help contain the pandemic through the U.N., the WHO, UNICEF and other organizations.A third batch of staff is scheduled to begin medical activities at Goderich on Monday following training in the U.K. and elsewhere. Its scale was downsized in line with the ongoing fall in new confirmed cases. During the interview, most of the seven participants appeared young, vigorous and aglow with a feeling of achievement. All of the members are well and showing no signs of post-traumatic stress disorder, they said. Lt. Col. Oh Dae-kun, a 39-year-old Army surgeon, said the best day was when the number of deaths was exceeded by the number of those who were dismissed from the hospital. “Probably all of us must have been quite shocked by the ill patients and some other factors there. But that did not turn into something that overwhelmed us ― I believe that the positive, worthwhile things we went through during our stay outshone the difficult parts,” he added. The participants had to fight not only the opposition of their families and friends over the risk of contracting the virus, but also rampant public fears of the spread of the deadly disease in order to press ahead with their choice to go. Health experts and diplomats also expressed concerns over what they called a “panic-like” scare that prompted the government to bar the entry of Guinean officials slated to take part in a telecommunication conference, a Seoul university to revoke its invitation for Nigerian students and Korean Air to temporarily halt flights to Nairobi. Shin Hyoung-shik, who led the squad and is director for infectious diseases at the National Medical Center in Seoul, said the toughest moment was when a team member was sent for monitoring in Germany after the worker’s finger was scraped by a needle while collecting blood from a patient. The official was eventually declared uninfected and returned home.“Frankly I initially thought the quarantine scheme was not so scientifically established,” the 51-year-old doctor said. “Having stayed here for three weeks, however, I came to believe that it is a realistic one that prevents confusion to a certain degree. If I had caught a cold at home after returning, there would have been lots of confusion.” With a growing need for Korea to take a bigger role in global issues, many team members called for sustained efforts to improve the country’s capability and better prepare for a possible future crisis at home and abroad. Officials from the foreign, defense and health ministries are also exploring ways to capitalize on the latest mission and contribute to Sierra Leone’s reconstruction, including partnerships with international agencies. “There have not been sufficient studies on Ebola because there were not many cases around the world,” Shin added. “Through this experience, we should expand our capacity in terms of both research and treatment to help respond to any future outbreak of infectious, fatal diseases whether they be in Africa or Latin America.”Oh, the military doctor, echoed Shin’s view, stressing the significance of intra-agency collaboration in tackling a major emergency, and technology in upgrading the country’s response. “As a soldier, I couldn’t help but think of chemical warfare with North Korea given the security situation on the peninsula and how to improve the operation of mobile hospitals and management of patient data,” he said.“The WHO’s central role in the Ebola outbreak could also provide lessons to us especially in the wake of the Sewol ferry disaster ― we can take a page from it in setting up our own control tower for crisis management and developing comprehensive manuals and guidelines.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","new patients pour every week ,virus worst epidemic in history ,security guard who survived ebola ,sisters had all died hearing ,patients pour every week into","['Sierra Leone', 'Korea', 'Goderich', 'Freetown', 'italian', 'Lee Tae - heon', 'Navy', 'Goderich', 'Freetown , Sierra Leone', 'Lakka', 'Goderich', 'west african', 'the World Health Organization', 'Seoul', 'U.N.', 'WHO', 'Goderich', 'U.K.', 'Army', 'guinean', 'Seoul', 'nigerian', 'Korean Air', 'Nairobi', 'Shin Hyoung - shik', 'the National Medical Center', 'Seoul', 'Germany', 'Korea', 'Sierra Leone ’s', 'Shin', 'Shin ’s', 'North Korea', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47561195  0.69232631

All of the participants were single in 2000.According to the study, women with either master’s or doctorate degrees were 58.3 percent less likely to marry than those who only had undergraduate degrees.Also, women with undergraduate degrees were 7.8 percent less likely to tie the knot than those who never finished high school.One of the reasons behind the statistics is that women with graduate school degrees find it more difficult to find a spouse with equal or higher education or income, according to the research.While women’s marriage prospects were heavily affected by education, men’s were most affected by income level. According to the research, Korean men who were employed were 1.65 times likelier to get married than those who were not working. Full-time male employees were 1.6 times likelier to tie the knot than male contract workers.The South Korean government considers the nation’s increasing number of late marriages as a key reason behind the country’s critically low birthrate. “On top of the increased number of people with higher education degrees, more people are deciding to get married late because it costs a lot of time and money to find the right spouse,” said researcher Kim Seong-jun. “I also discovered that men tend to give up on or put off marriage indefinitely as it takes them a lot of time to find jobs they are satisfied with.”A local think tank last year said it would take 29 years on average for a newly married, double-income couple to save enough to lease an apartment in Seoul ― costing about 280 million won ($256,000) as a lump-sum deposit under Korea’s “jeonse” real-estate system ― if they choose to avoid borrowing. Overseas studies have shown that low marriage rates of educated women in the past also had to do with the cultural idea of hypergamy ― the notion that women should marry up and men should marry down educationally and economically ― as it helped to maintain the traditional gender roles.

Park Joo-sun of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy. While the Education Ministry requests data on sex offenses, universities are not mandated by law to comply. A ministry official said required data was collected on demand.“It is impossible to form an appropriate policy if (the ministry) is oblivious to reality,” Park said. “Despite the rampant sex crimes by university professors, the ministry failed to determine exactly how serious the problem was.”According to ministry data compiled by Park, 100 sex offense cases occurred from 2010 to 2014. But the ministry’s data left out major universities including Seoul National University and Korea University, both of which were embroiled in sex scandals involving professors. A math professor at SNU was arrested in December on the charge of groping several of his students, sparking shock and anger across the country.Last month, SNU students agreed to hold a school-wide online survey on sex offense on campus. They also vowed to determine if the school provided sufficient help for victims through its student rights center.A recent survey by a presidential committee on young people’s needs found that 65.3 percent of students victimized sexually by a professor did not take any action, due to fear of receiving disadvantages.In light of mounting public fury over revelations of university sex crimes, the Education Ministry advised all colleges to revise their regulations so that professors accused of sex offense cannot quit their jobs. When a faculty member accused of sex crime quits his or her post, the school inquiry and any disciplinary actions are discontinued. Faculty members of state-run colleges are banned by law from doing so, but no such restriction exists for faculty members of private colleges, allowing some professors to dodge punishment by the school. Saenuri Party Rep. Joo Ho-young recently proposed a bill to prevent any member of a privately run educational institute from resigning after a criminal indictment.

In the Philippines, 10 South Koreans were killed last year while 13 were murdered there in 2013. Four Korean drug dealers were executed in China last year alone.There are also growing concerns that South Korean citizens are not safe from possible attacks by terrorists following the recent purported killing of two Japanese hostages by the Islamic State.Seoul has imposed travel bans on six countries ― Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Afghanistan and Yemen. More than 1,000 South Korean workers are known to be in Iraq while about 40 nationals are in Yemen and Libya, respectively.The government has been keeping close tabs on the possible impact of Muslim fundamentalism on its citizens since a South Korean teenager vanished in Turkey earlier last month.

It called for measures to raise the confidence.The people's confidence in school teachers also remained low.Only 18 percent of the respondents said they have trust in the ability and attitude of elementary, middle and high school teachers, while 40.7 percent said they didn't, a contributing factor to the nation's high dependence on private education.The 2014 survey was conducted twice in July-August and November last year.

Most are elementary schools located in the smaller fishing or farming communities, with poor education infrastructure.Another 130 schools have just one new student. A branch of Yeonam elementary school in Ulsan had just one first year student in 2013 and 2014, but failed to recruit anyone this year. A total of 11 elementary schools had less than 10 first year students for 2015, according to Ulsan Metropolitan Office of Education.South Jeolla was the hardest hit region with 47 schools without freshmen this year, as against 16 in 2014. According to officials, 11 schools in the area have just one student, which means they are likely to shut down soon.Last year, 17 schools in the area were shut down and seven more will face the ax in March.In January, Gangwon Provincial Office of Education announced it would grant additional recruitment for 68 high schools with low freshmen retention rates. But a total of 19 schools in the province failed to get even one applicant.“Such a low retention rate is due to both the growing trend of people leaving rural areas and the overall number of students declining. We have no choice but to work on improving our education programs to attract more students,” said a GPOE official.Korea is expected to have around 1.59 million middle school students this year, according to local private education firm Haneul Education, which will be 120,000 less than last year. The firm, citing Education Ministry data, noted that it was the biggest-ever decline in that particular category. The number of high school students declined by about 20,000.But the number of elementary school students is projected to be similar to last year, which shows that the students-to-seniors ratio in rural areas is also to blame. In 2013, only 6.9 percent of the population in Gangwon Province has 14 or younger, a significant decrease from 11.4 percent in 2003. In the same year, senior citizens jumped from 26.3 percent to 36.8 percent.

Korea was followed by Sweden, Portugal, Bulgaria and Chile, which recorded dissatisfaction rates of 17.8 percent, 16.2 percent, 14.6 percent and 13.9 percent. The OCED average was 9.46 percent. By analyzing the answers of 105,000 Korean teachers who took the OECD’s Teaching and Learning International Survey, Yang also discovered 36.1 percent of them would choose a different career if they had a choice. The leader in this particular category was Sweden at 46.1 percent.The discontent among Korean teachers was in stark contrast to Korean teachers’ relatively high average pay. The annual salary of Korean teachers typically peaked at $76,432 while the OECD average was $57,621.Korean teachers expressed difficulty dealing with students while having to carry out administrative duties. Stress was also one of the main reasons teachers were dissatisfied with their jobs. A study by the Korean Federation of Teachers’ Association showed that in 2013, violations of teachers’ rights increased for the fifth consecutive year. The most common causes of complaint were verbal abuse, threats and physical violence from students and their parents.An Education Ministry study showed that 5,562 cases of rights violation for teachers occurred in 2013.The immense pressure at work sometimes leads to mental conditions. According to Rep. Lee Elisa of the ruling Saenuri Party, 112 teachers either left their jobs permanently or temporarily in 2014 after suffering from mental illness, up from 69 the year before.A high school teacher in Gwangju died by suicide in January. The 55-year-old teacher had been suffering from severe depression.

And it is common for young women who were anorexic during their teen years to suffer from bulimia nervosa in their 20s and 30s.”Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by binge eating followed by an attempt to purge the intake, such as by vomiting, or excessive exercise ― mostly because of an extensive concern with body image and weight. Many patients with bulimia nervosa have an additional psychiatric disorder, such as anxiety or mood disorders. Antidepressants are commonly used to treat bulimia nervosa. According to the National Health Insurance Service, a total of 1,796 Koreans sought medical help for the eating disorder in 2013. Among them, 93.8 percent ― 1,684 people ― were women, while only 6.2 percent were men. Among the female patients, those in their 20s and 30s accounted for 71 percent of the total. Most male patients were also in their 20s and 30s.The number of bulimia cases in Korea rose from 1,501 in 2008 to 1,796 in 2013.

An annual report by state-run Statistics Korea showed that the unemployment rate in the 15-29 age bracket reached a record 9 percent in 2014.Even after employment, South Koreans face notoriously long working hours, 44.6 hours per week in 2013, the highest among advanced economies, according to government data.The poll also highlighted growing disparity in job opportunities for students from high-income and low-income households.A total 67.3 percent of students who identified themselves as coming from high-income families said they believe they will get jobs they want. The rate fell to 45.4 percent for students who classified themselves as a member of a low-income household.""This comes in line with growing social concerns over solidifying succession of wealth and poverty, where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer,"" said Kim Byung-gyu, an official who managed the survey. Contrary to the common notion that the younger generation devalues the life of stay-at-home parents, 60.1 percent said ""staying at home is as valuable as working.""

Last October, the launch of balloons carrying these leaflets incited Pyongyang to fire machine guns at them, with some of the rounds falling near a town lying south of the Demilitarized Zone.Residents in South Korean border towns have rallied against the campaigns, although the groups, mostly comprised of North Korean refugees, have gone on unfazed. Seoul says it can't stop leaflet launches because it is a matter of free speech.The sources at the National Human Rights Commission of Korea said eight out of 11 standing committee members sided with the groups at a plenary meeting on Jan. 26. This means the commission will send a statement to the government asking it not to crack down on  or ban leaflet scattering.Two committee members voted against it, while the remaining one abstained, the sources added.Proponents of the campaign cited freedom of speech to back up their claims.""The privately organized spread of propaganda leaflets is a form of free speech protected by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,"" the sources quoted the final statement as saying.""Restricting these scatterings is like listening to the North's demands at the expense of South Koreans' human rights.""The opponents said the safety of border town residents outweighs freedom of speech.""Inhibiting the campaign does not violate the freedom of speech because saving residents' lives and their safety is for the greater common good,"" Jang Myung-sook, one of the two opponents, said.An NHRCK official, who requested anonymity, also said the fact that eight committee members voted against banning the leaflets just shows the political bias of the institution.

But Japan has long attempted to whitewash the atrocity.The sexual slavery issue has been the biggest thorn in frayed relations between Japan and South Korea, with Seoul demanding Japan take steps to address the grievances of elderly Korean victims of the atrocity and Japan refusing to do so.The American historians said in the joint statement that there have been debates about whether the number of victims is in the tens of thousands or the hundreds of thousands and what precise role the military played in their procurement.However, careful research by Tokyo's Chuo University professor Yoshimi Yoshiaki in Japanese government archives and accounts from survivors throughout Asia made it beyond doubt that there existed state-sponsored sexual slavery, they said.""Many of the women were conscripted against their will and taken to stations at the front where they had no freedom of movement. Survivors have described being raped by officers and beaten for attempting to escape,"" the statement said.Still, conservative Japanese politicians have deployed legalistic arguments in order to deny state responsibility, while others have slandered the survivors. Right-wing extremists have threatened and tried to intimidate journalists and scholars involved in documenting the system and the stories of its victims, the scholars said.The statement is scheduled to appear in the March edition of the ""Perspectives of History,"" the official publication of the American Historical Association.Following is the list of the 19 scholars who co-signed the joint statement.Jeremy Adelman, Princeton UniversityW.

Compared to 2013, the tally represents a 21 percent spike in the nabbed shipments. Weight and value also increased 54 percent and 62 percent, respectively.  There were 50.8 kilograms of methamphetamine last year, the largest amount detected since 2003 and enough for 1.68 million drug users. The total is significantly higher than 30.2 kilograms detected the year before. Other drugs caught included marijuana, synthetic cannabis and cocaine.  Methamphetamine, also called philopon in Korea, a potent central nervous system stimulant, is the most popular form of drugs circulated in the country. A kilogram of philopon is worth 3 billion won.  KCS said that the spike in numbers last year is related to more large crime syndicates handling methamphetamine trafficking from manufacturing bases in China and Hong Kong.  Of all methamphetamine shipments, 47.8 kilograms worth was linked to crime organizations.   The customs office said there was a sharp rise in private trafficking as well, with users attempting to bring in the drugs through international mail.  Last year, 228 packages were detected worth 3.3 billion won, up significantly from 139 packages and 1.1 billion won. The KCS said it had caught 10 teenagers trying to buy illegal drugs from foreign Internet sites.  Officials warned that there is a rising move to use South Korean nationals as couriers or mules and that they can be dealt severely for drug trafficking offences in foreign countries.  KCS said it plans to join the CATalyst program set up by the World Customs Organization to prevent the spread of illegal drugs.

""But that can only happen if this cult leadership system is completely dismantled. And the only way to do that is if the Kim family is effectively displaced, is effectively removed from the scene, and a new leadership comes into place."" Such blunt words from a high-ranking U.N. official are unusual, although common among American officials. Darusman said previous proposals submitted to the U.N. trying to persuade or force North Korea to improve its human rights record were mostly ""rhetorical"" exercises.  But he said this resolution, passed by the General Assembly in December, is more significant because it holds Kim responsible based on a 372-page report of findings presented last year by the U.N.-backed Commission of Inquiry that detailed arbitrary detention, torture, executions and political prison camps. ""This is a sea change in the position of the international community,"" Darusman said during a recent visit to Tokyo. The North Koreans ""are in their most vulnerable position at this stage, whenever the culpability and responsibility of the supreme leader is brought out in full glare of the international public scrutiny.""North Korea's intense response has included threats of more nuclear tests, mass rallies across the country, a bitter smear campaign against defectors who cooperated in the U.N. report and repeated allegations that Washington orchestrated the whole thing in an attempt at speeding a regime change. Its state media last week railed yet again against the U.N. findings, saying ""those who cooked up the 'report' are all bribed political swindlers and despicable human scum."" It called Darusman, the former attorney general of Indonesia, an ""opportunist.""In a rare flurry of talks, North Korean diplomats at the U.N. lobbied frenetically to get Kim's culpability out of the resolution without success. The proposal is now on the agenda of the Security Council, which is expected this year to make a decision on whether the issue should be referred to the International Criminal Court at The Hague.  Just before the resolution passed the General Assembly, the North Korean diplomatic mission to the U.N. sought a meeting with Darusman to get the wording deleted. During the meeting with Ri Hung Sik, North Korea's ambassador-at-large, the North Koreans indicated their future was at stake, Darusman said.  ""They said that other people will take over, and the hardliners will be taking over,"" Darusman said, suggesting a schism may already be forming between factions scrambling to prove themselves more loyal and more effective in protecting the leadership. ""They wouldn't have to mention that to us, but I don't know. I'm taking it at face value."" But here's the reality check about the resolution: The likelihood of criminal proceedings against Kim is minuscule. It would likely be shot down by China or Russia, which have veto power on the Security Council. Also, while more than 120 countries support the International Criminal Court, the United States isn't one of them, so it is somewhat awkward for Washington to push that option too hard.  But even without bringing Kim to court, Darusman said, the placement of North Korean human rights on the Security Council agenda means Pyongyang will face increasing scrutiny from the international community. He said ally China will be under pressure to either distance itself from Pyongyang or lose credibility. ""It may seem remote, but at some stage it is conceivable that China cannot afford to be continuously associated with a regime that is universally sanctioned by the international community,"" he said. ""Something will give."" Washington, meanwhile, is turning up the heat following the massive cyberattack on Sony Pictures.     ""We are under no illusions about the DPRK's willingness to abandon its illicit weapons, provocations, and human rights abuses on its own. We will apply pressure both multilaterally and unilaterally,"" Sung Kim, Washington's special representative for North Korea policy, testified in Congress last month. ""The leadership in Pyongyang faces ever-sharper choices."" North Korea's official name is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.   Extricating North Korea from the personality cult of the Kim family would be a genuine challenge under any circumstances.  The country's founder, Kim Il Sung, and his son and successor, Kim Jong Il, permeate every facet of daily life. Citizens wear Kim lapel pins everywhere they go. Portraits and statuary of the father and son are everywhere. In Pyongyang at midnight every night, a ghostly dirge commemorating the elder Kim blares from loudspeakers through the darkness. According to the U.N. commission's findings and the testimony of many defectors, North Koreans who dare criticize the Kim family are punished severely and face horrific treatment in prison camps around the country. North Korea says that isn't true, and routinely accuses defectors of being ""human scum"" and criminals. Officials vociferously deny speculation of disunity within their ranks.  In an interview with the AP in Pyongyang in October, two North Korean legal experts attempted to discredit the U.N. campaign and its findings -- which they called an ""anti-DPRK plot"" -- and defended the prison system that has long been the core area of concern. ""In a word, the political camps do not exist in our country,"" said Ri Kyong Chol, director of the international law department at Pyongyang's Academy of Social Sciences. ""The difference between the common and the anti-state criminals is that the anti-state criminals get more severe punishment than the common criminals."" But Ri said common and anti-state inmates are not segregated.  ""I think every country has prisons to imprison those criminals who have committed crimes against the state,"" he said. But in North Korea, ""there are no different prisons for that.""

Under the new scheme, some people with an annual income of less than 55 million won ($50,700) are required to pay additional taxes this year.Before the revision, many wage earners were able to get tax refunds, which were commonly referred to as a bonus or extra wage.The new tax settlement scheme has angered the public, prompting the government and the ruling party to push for revision of the tax code to ensure that it offers additional tax refunds to eligible taxpayers.The survey, conducted between Tuesday and Thursday, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.

Despite my unconventional career background, I felt this was my last opportunity to follow a new career path. I studied children’s education and psychology at Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul before heading to the UAE to work for Emirates Group. I spent eight years flying as a cabin crew member and two years as a senior trainer at Emirates Group Training College in Dubai. It is difficult to move away from 10 years in the aviation without reeducation. I started to think about the steps I would need to take for a new career. I was convinced that an MBA would present new opportunities that I wanted, but before selecting a school I had to consider my options ― what I wanted to do with an MBA, what I need to do, and which school would help me pursue my dream.First, I decided I wanted to become a brand manager in a leading luxury company. Then, I needed to combine the leadership skills I had developed from my previous job with the business and management skills I would gain from an MBA. Listing these skill sets helped me decide the subjects I wanted to focus on, and create timelines for summer internships and job interviews. Finally, I realized studying in France would provide the best route to my dream job. Why? France is the home of luxury, and Paris is at its heart. HEC Paris offers leading courses associated with luxury, in addition to rigorous academic programs and exchange opportunities all over the world. Due to the school’s relationship with other top management schools around the globe, I had the opportunity to study abroad at HKUST in Hong Kong, to develop my understanding of the Asian luxury market.There’s also the invaluable alumni network. I received advice from alumni in the luxury industry ― including Jun Ji-hyun, the country general manager of Balenciaga Korea at Kering Group and Jean-Paul Agon, CEO of L’Oreal ― regarding job searching, interviews and networking skills. Thanks to them, I was hired as a consultant for L’Oreal Paris to work on their digital innovation project during the summer. Living in Paris also helped me expand my horizons and understand different cultures. The language barrier was quite challenging at times, but there was still a real sense of community. I benefited from learning the language, which helped me understand the culture of the country. Having an open and tolerant mindset helps to be a part of a multicultural family here.Through studying abroad, I met amazing classmates. Though everyone had different dreams, we worked together to help each other accomplish them. I will always remember the many late nights spent working together on team projects or sharing a glass of wine. Learning to collaborate with more than seven different nationalities has definitely helped me to become a strong team player and, more importantly, to become a better leader. I know these people will be a valuable network for the rest of my life.By Kwon Yu-jung Kwon is graduating from an MBA course at Hautes Etudes Commerciales de Paris this month.

The incident angered parents nationwide, pressuring officials to brainstorm quick solutions.But critics dismissed government suggestions to address the situation as populist. They said the measures did not amount to a fundamental solution. Officials had proposed toughening penalties against abuse, raising the bar for potential child care center workers, and installing more cameras. Lawmakers from both sides of the political spectrum echoed the public criticism Wednesday.“More cameras? Where’s the money? The government must look over the entire system. They cannot and must not come up with an array of small solutions and say ‘here’s what we’ve got for you,’” said Rep. Lee Myoung-su of the ruling Saenuri Party.Main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy Rep. Kim Yong-ik made similar criticism.“Punishing abusive teachers is important, but the government must ensure that (workers at) day care centers receive the right wages, that they have the resources to do their job,” Kim said.NPAD Rep. Rhee Mok-hee also expressed frustration over an earlier statement by Welfare Minister Moon, who had said that nonworking mothers should avoid using public child care centers, as the limited space should be reserved for children of working moms.“I think you should be thinking about how to make space available for children of non-working moms by finding ways to increase your ministry’s budget,” he told the minister/“You seem to be following orders from the president and simply trying to live with whatever amount of money the Finance Ministry deals out,” the lawmaker added.Welfare Minister Moon apologized.“I will travel countrywide to collect opinions from parents, child care center staff, the government and other areas,” the minister said.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","angered parents nationwide pressuring officials ,jan the incident angered parents ,criticism punishing abusive teachers ,the incident angered parents nationwide ,incident angered parents nationwide","['Welfare', 'Moon Hyung - pyo', 'Korea', 'South Korea ’s', 'Incheon', 'Lee Myoung - su', 'Saenuri Party', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Kim Yong - ik', 'Kim', 'Rhee Mok - hee', 'Welfare', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Jeong Hunny']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39742565  0.19956043

449,449,Birth mothers living in silence,"In 1976, a 17-year-old Korean girl gave birth to her first child. A few months before the delivery, she had been forced to marry the man who raped and impregnated her.“That was the norm at the time,” Noh Geum-ju told The Korea Herald.“When you get pregnant as an unmarried woman, you have to marry the father of your baby. Other options were unthinkable.”Her unhappy marriage was filled with extreme financial diffic...","In 1976, a 17-year-old Korean girl gave birth to her first child. A few months before the delivery, she had been forced to marry the man who raped and impregnated her.“That was the norm at the time,” Noh Geum-ju told The Korea Herald.“When you get pregnant as an unmarried woman, you have to marry the father of your baby. Other options were unthinkable.”Her unhappy marriage was filled with extreme financial difficulties, to the point where she was forced by her husband to sell her blood. But nothing was worse than learning that her family members secretly sent her 11-month-old son for adoption to give Noh an “easier life.”When she finally tracked down the hospital where her son was taken ― which was affiliated with adoption agents ― it had been abruptly closed. After crying for days, she descended into depression with frequent suicidal thoughts. “I didn’t know who I was anymore. I wanted to kill everyone, including myself,” she said.Noh, who currently heads Dandelions ― a group of Korean birth mothers ― still suffers from the trauma. She reunited with her son, who had been adopted to the U.S., in 2005, but the reunion did not make up for her 29 years of loss. Every March, her son’s birth month, Noh falls physically ill.On top of the language barrier and shock ― Noh had been thinking her son was adopted to a Korean family ― it was especially heartbreaking to learn that her son was struggling financially, she said. “I still feel sad and angry,” she said. “I feel guilty that I couldn’t raise him on my own, and I am sorry again that I can’t do much for him even today.”Trauma in secretsSouth Korea remains one of the largest exporters of overseas adoptees in the world, having sent about 200,000 children abroad over the past six decades. This means there are also about 200,000 Korean birth mothers -- and some 200,000 birth fathers -- who were separated from their children by international adoption, which brought millions of dollars to local adoption agencies here in the 1980s.About 90 percent of Korean adoptees are born to unwed mothers who have few resources to raise their children alone and are vulnerable to social stigmatization.There have never been government support programs for birth mothers who put their children up for adoption. There is also little research by local scholars on the impact of overseas adoption on Korean birth parents.“Our support programs are focused on mothers who choose to raise their children on their own,” said Lee Hyun-ju, head of adoption measures at the Welfare Ministry.Yet overseas studies have shown that many birth parents, like Noh, continue to mourn the loss of their children throughout their lifetime. This is an ongoing issue. Nearly 3,000 Korean babies were sent for overseas adoption from 2010 to 2013.Even 12-20 years after adoption placement, about three-quarters of birth mothers continued to experience some feelings of loss and grief, a U.S. study found. The study also found that the mothers who tended to experience more longstanding grief were those who felt pressured into placing their children for adoption against their will or lacked opportunities to express their feelings about surrendering the baby.Kim Eui-jung, a psychiatrist at Ewha Womans University Mokdong Hospital, said sorrow and depression, anger, guilt and denial are common among birth parents as they mourn their loss, and even after reuniting with their children. “Korean culture places a lot of emphasis on maternal instinct and mothers’ sacrifice, and as a result, we see many of them being too attached to their children,” Kim said. “They often see their children as their own possessions or an inseparable part of themselves, rather than as independent beings. And for one reason or another, the Korean birth mothers ended up relinquishing what many other women cherish the most. This puts them in a very isolated situation in Korean society. For this reason ― although there should be more research on this topic ― I assume Korean birth mothers may have emotional reactions that are unique and may not be experienced by birth mothers in other countries.”Secrecy surrounding pregnancy and adoption ― as most Korean birth mothers had been single parents ― can also make it challenging for the mothers to seek support, another reason behind the limited research into their experiences, Kim said.“A key component to anxiety and depression are feelings of powerlessness,” Kim said. “If a birth mother was pressured or forced into placing her child for adoption, reunions and post-reunion days can be more overwhelming and difficult for her. She may even choose not to meet with the child at all, because it can be too painful for her to confront her past.”Birth mother Noh said she often felt misunderstood throughout her life, as many people, including her close friends, viewed her loss as her choice.“What can you really expect from the government when even your close friend tells you, ‘You know, I had a very difficult life, too ― but at least I didn’t give up my own children like you did’?” she said.Loss and guiltOn Aug. 12, 2005, the day of her labor, Choi Hyeong-suk stayed in her room as long as she could, enduring contractions ― she was somehow trying to delay her delivery by not going to the hospital until it was absolutely necessary.“I was terrified of going to the hospital,” Choi, who now heads an organization for unwed single mothers, said. “Going to the hospital meant giving birth to my baby, and that meant I’d have to say goodbye to him. I had decided to send him for adoption to the U.S., but I was absolutely terrified of being separated from him.”Choi, an accomplished hairdresser at the time, had broken up with the father of her son, whom she now raises by herself.Her family did not want her to face hardships as single mother, and told her to place the baby for adoption ― for the sake of both the child and herself. While pregnant, she stayed at Ae Ran Won, a shelter for unmarried and pregnant women, until she gave birth. Just about eight hours after her delivery, she signed the final adoption papers and her son was taken away from her. “I was told to say the last words to my newborn,” Choi said. “I told him, ‘baby, you should go now.’ What I told him that day still hurts me deeply. I still avoid saying ‘go now’ to my son, even when he’s going to school.”After placing the baby for an adoption, Choi left the hospital immediately, feeling as if she did not deserve any medical care after relinquishing her own child. “At the shelter, there were mothers staying with their babies ― and all I could hear was their noises,” she said.“I thought I was losing my mind and could not stop crying. I called the adoption agency the next day and told them I wanted my son back.”After two weeks of waiting, Choi had her son back. Almost a decade has passed since then, but the two weeks of separation still affects Choi. Like Noh, Choi also gets sick every August ― her son’s birth month.“I get so ill I can’t even get up,” she said.Choi still keeps in touch with a number of women she met at the shelter, one of whom sent her son for adoption to Australia. The woman gave birth to her child about a month before Choi did. One time, the friend ― who believes her son will visit her one day ― asked Choi to ask overseas Korean adoptees a question on her behalf.“She told me to ask them, ‘would you be happy to learn that your birth mother is living a happy life when you reunite with her?’” Choi said. “She said she didn’t want her son to think she was happy separated from him for so many years when they reunite in future. But she also thinks her son wouldn’t be too comfortable to learn that she’s unhappy and miserable.”While Choi thinks keeping her child was the best decision she’s ever made, living as a single mother in Korea hasn’t been easy. Her hair salon went out of business after it became known in her neighborhood that she was an unwed mother. Her son has been bullied at school for having a single parent. Still, Choi thinks overseas adoption should be the last resort. “It is a temporary solution to a permanent problem for both adoptees and birth parents,” she said. When Choi was pregnant, American adoptive parents visited the shelter to meet with pregnant women who were considering placing their children for adoption. The couple shared their family photo album with the soon-to-be mothers, which included many photos of their daughter ― whom they adopted from Korea. In the photos, their daughter was taking swimming lessons and playing the violin in a pretty dress. “After looking at the album, I thought it would indeed be better for my son to be adopted,” said Choi, who also interacts with adoptee activists.“I was also told by many that it was the best to send my son to the U.S., because there are a lot of Korean adoptees there, and there is no racism in America. Most of us at the shelter thought what we were told were true. Many didn’t really know what racism even meant.“Many think birth mothers ‘make a choice’ when they put their children up for adoption. But when you are repeatedly told to give up your child when you lack resources and knowledge, can you really call that a choice?”‘We are victims, too’The Korean government currently offers a number of support programs for Korean overseas adoptees, including Korean language programs and support for birth family searches. The number of overseas adoptees who return and live in Korea is also increasing, according to the state-run Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs.Kim Mee-sook, a researcher at the think tank, said there should be support programs for birth mothers as well, especially foreign language courses and counseling sessions. This would eventually improve their relationship with their separated children, she said. “It’s normal for birth mothers to feel angry and guilty, and they should have an outlet to let it all out,” she said. “Sometimes things don’t go well after the reunion because of such unresolved feelings, and also simply because they don’t know anything about each other and how to continue the relationship with the language barrier. But I think these things can be helped with support of experts.”Meanwhile, Dandelions, the group of birth mothers headed by Noh, has only about 40 members. Among them, about five show up at their gatherings regularly. “It’s hard for birth mothers to unite because many keep their stories a secret, while suffering from feelings of guilt,” said Noh, who opposes transnational adoption.“There are about 200,000 birth families who have been separated from their children in this country. Among 200,000 of them, I only ask 100 ― not even 1,000 ― to come forward and speak their experiences. We need healing and solidarity. In many ways, we are victims, too.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","old korean girl gave birth ,an unwed mother her son ,born to unwed mothers who ,sick every august her son ,17 year old korean girl","['korean', 'Noh Geum - ju', 'the Korea Herald', 'korean', 'U.S.', 'Noh', 'korean', 'Korea', 'korean', 'korean', 'korean', 'Lee Hyun - ju', 'the Welfare Ministry', 'korean', 'U.S.', 'Kim Eui - jung', 'Ewha Womans University Mokdong Hospital', 'korean', 'Kim', 'korean', 'korean', 'korean', 'korean', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'loss', 'Choi Hyeong - suk', 'Choi', 'U.S.', 'Ae Ran Won', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Noh', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Australia', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'korean', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Korea', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'american', 'Korea', 'Choi', 'U.S.', 'korean', 'America', 'korean', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs', 'Kim Mee - sook', 'Noh', 'Noh', 'Claire Lee']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64557457  0.50129777

The survey also showed that a smaller number youth under the age of 13 felt stressed than their older peers ― 41.6 percent compared to 62.1 percent. Researchers said this was due to the pressure to enter college or the job market.Girls were more likely to be stressed than boys, at 63.7 percent and 53.2 percent, respectively. Despite the built-up frustration, teenagers were reluctant to seek help from their parents. The percentage of teens who said they talked to their parents for more than an hour per week was 31.8 percent and 53.1 percent, respectively.Experts say the excessive stress is likely to lead to extreme acts, particularly stress related to academic accomplishments. Earlier this month, an 18-year-old surnamed Kim left for Turkey in a suspected attempt to join the Islamic State militant group. Investigators found that Kim had been bullied during his middle school years, and the experience had led him to form a negative view of Korean society.“Kim may have sought to deal with his anxiety (about the world) by depending on a powerful organization. ... With Korean society overly hung up on academic accomplishments, it is possible he feels the country does not want him,” Kwak Keum-joo, a professor of psychology at Seoul National University, recently told local media.Kim’s case is extreme, but the government survey showed that 40.6 percent of the youth have felt the urge to run away from home, with 9.8 percent saying they had actually done so.Officials added that the urge to run away was less prevalent among youth who talked to their parents more. “The students who conversed more often with their parents were relatively free from both stress and the compulsion to run away. They were also more likely to be happy,” an official said. It also showed that students got an average of 7 hours and 27 minutes of sleep per day. According to the ministry, this was a 10 minute increase compared to 2011, but was about 30 minutes less than the figures for countries like the U.S. or the U.K. A report by Eulji University showed that students who slept less than seven hours per day were 1.48 times more likely to consider suicide than those who got adequate sleep.

However, they stressed that a crimes committed by illegal foreign residents in recent months have raised public concerns, prompting calls for strengthened measures to locate and deport them. “Law enforcement officers have had difficulty tracing them as they have no residence records,” said a ministry official.With more foreigners living in Korea than ever before, there also been an increase in crimes involving foreign nationals, both as victims and perpetrators.According to data from the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office, some 34,561 foreign nationals were charged with crimes in 2013, marking a 30 percent increase from the year before.The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency recently said that the number of sex-related crimes against foreigners in Seoul tripled to 213 in 2013 from 76 in 2009.A 2009 report by Hyundai Research Institute showed that in terms of accepting other cultures, Korea was one of the worst in the world, an indicator that the country still has long way to go before becoming a multicultural nation.Meanwhile, the number of foreign nationals in Korea has exceeded 1.5 million.According to a report by the Korea Immigration Service and the Justice Ministry, 1.76 million foreign citizens were in the country, over 10 percent more than in the same period in 2013.The total number of registered residents ― who are staying in Korea for at least 90 days ― accounted for 61.8 percent, while 22.2 percent were on short-term visas.

The city government ""should immediately withdraw the measure,"" they said.""Politicians cannot be involved in the selection of films to be screened for a festival if it is a normal one,"" the groups said.Ensuring festival programmers' freedom to choose films was ""a factor behind BIFF's growth over the 19 years as Asia's leading film festival,"" they said.The groups said they will fight against the city government if Lee eventually is forced to step down.Founded in 1996, the BIFF has developed into Asia's largest film festival. Lee became the festival's executive director in 2010 and won a second term as the director in 2013. His three-year tenure is set to expire in February next year.Also on Monday, the festival authorities expressed their regret over the move by the local government.""It is unreasonable for the Busan city government to unilaterally and overtly mention the resignation of the festival director without any process to discuss with each other what problems they have and how to correct them,"" the BIFF said in a statement.

The number of babies born in the country increased from April through October.""There is no definitive reason for the drop, but it has been observed in the past that childbirth tends to slip toward the end of the year,"" an official said. The cumulative number of births in the first 11 months of last year also edged down 0.2 percent from a year earlier to 403,500, the latest data showed. South Korea has been trying to push up the birthrate to avoid a decline in the overall working population, increased welfare expenses and damage to its growth potential. The latest report showed that about 23,600 couples tied the knot in November, a sharp 16.9 percent drop from the year before.For the January-November period, the number stood at 271,300, a decrease of 5 percent from a year earlier.The number of divorces also fell by 4.1 percent on-year, or by 400, to 9,300, while there were 22,500 deaths, a dip of 1.3 percent from a year earlier, the statistical office said.

Shortly afterward, he switched departments and became the youngest police superintendent at the age of 31. He was later promoted to chief of the provincial police agency.During his career, Lee worked overseas for seven years, including at the South Korean consulate in Los Angeles.The nominee is a three-term lawmaker of the ruling Saenuri Party.His most recent election was during the parliamentary by-elections in April 2013, in which he won nearly 80 percent of the vote after overcoming a fierce battle with cancer.For the past seven months, he has served as the party's floor leader, leading tough negotiations with the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy on a controversial bill aimed at uncovering the truth behind last April's deadly ferry sinking.If he wins parliamentary approval to become the next prime minister, media attention will likely focus on his potential as a ruling party candidate for the next presidential election slated for late 2017.

They also have vowed to scatter DVDs of the U.S. movie ""The Interview,"" which depicts a plot to assassinate the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.In a separate article, the communist country urged the South to stop its joint military exercises with the United States.""Regime confrontation and exercises for the northward invasion which have taken place in South Korea should be stopped,"" the newspaper said. ""The future path of the inter-Korean relations totally depends on how South Korea responds to our patriotic appeal.""North Korea has long denounced joint military drills between the allies as preparations for a northward invasion, a claim dismissed by Seoul and Washington that say the drills have taken place on a regular basis and are defensive in nature.Despite Pyongyang's repeated calls for a suspension, South Korea is scheduled to carry out its joint military drills with the U.S. in March as scheduled.

The Supreme Court ruled in December 2012 that communication firms are not obligated to provide such information, and Naver hasn't complied with search warrants since.

Among middle-income earners, the number dipped to 56.4 percent from 56.8 percent, while for people classified as affluent, 77.7 percent owned homes, up from 72.8 percent two years earlier.The data, provided by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport based on interviews of 20,000 households nationwide, bolsters the argument that the economic slowdown has hurt the middle- and lower-income families more than the rich.The latest report showed that the percentage of people living in jeonse homes, or rental arrangements in which tenants pay a lump-sum deposit up front, fell to 45 percent from 49.5 percent, while those paying monthly rent jumped to 55 percent from 50.5 percent.While the shift from jeonse to monthly rent may be natural when interest rates are low for deposits, such a trend erodes disposable income for households.The drop in home ownership and jeonse affected the average period that a person or family lived in the same home. In the 2012 report, the average time spent in a residence reached 8.6 years, but this fell to 7.7 years in 2014.The data showed that 79.1 percent of all people said they wanted to own a home, which is a drop of 4.6 percentage points from the 83.7 percent reported for 2010. On the other hand, the data said the number of people living in homes rated as below ""minimum living conditions"" fell. Minimum living conditions, as defined by the government, take into account the number of people living in a home and the size of the residence.In 2012, 7.2 percent, or some 1.28 million households, lived in ""below-minimum"" homes, but this declined to 5.4 percent, or 1 million households, last year.Reflecting this, the ministry's findings showed the per capita living space rising to 33.1 square meters last year from 31.7 square meters two years earlier.The report showed the home satisfaction level reaching 2.86 points out of 4, an incremental gain from 2.83 tallied in 2012. The satisfaction rate is the same as in 2006.The ministry said it will use the collected data in mapping measures to assist lower- and middle-income families and help them move to more affordable long-term rental homes.Related to the local home market, the ministry said in a separate report that it granted construction permits for 515,000 new dwellings last year, up 17.1 percent from 440,000 units tallied for 2013.Despite the on-year increase, last year's permit number is roughly 2 percent lower than the average reached in the last three years.It also said there was a 18.3 percent increase in new housing construction projects started last year, which translates into 508,000 homes being supplied to homebuyers. Of all building permits, there was a 25.3 percent spike for apartment buildings totaling 344,000 units, with non-apartment houses going up 6 percent, the report showed.

The incident has sparked public outrage, and President Park Geun-hye instructed officials Tuesday to implement a set of measures to root out child abuse. In a policy report to Park joined by the ministries of culture, health and welfare, environment, labor and gender equality, the education ministry said the government will convene a meeting of society-related ministers later this week to discuss comprehensive measures to prevent child abuse at nursery schools. Measures will likely include tightening the procedures of selecting and nurturing nursing teachers and improving their working conditions and welfare.The education ministry also plans to revise laws to toughen punishment by shutting down any nursing school if child abuse is found there and the perpetrator and the facility's director would be permanently banned from the business.The government seeks to increase the national number of kindergartens with security cameras to 90 percent from currently 80 percent.The education ministry further said it will encourage teachers' colleges nationwide to require students to take personality tests during the admission process, based on a law on the promotion of personality education that was introduced end of last year.During the report, the culture ministry said it will make aggressive efforts to increase exports of Korean content industry products this year. For this, the government will launch a civilian-government organization that would orchestrate the ongoing nationwide efforts to keep afloat the Asiawide popularity of Korean TV dramas, pop music and films possibly in March.Along with this, the ministry will set up a copyright protection agency to effectively deal with pervasive copyright infringements at home and abroad.The Ministry of Health and Welfare said it will increase the coverage of the national health insurance for patients of four most serious diseases, including cancer, cardiac disorder and cerebrovascular disease.The authorities will also continue efforts to lower people's medical expenses by reducing the percentage of doctors who are available only upon request with additional fees at large general hospitals and increasing the number of rooms for insured patients. The Ministry of Environment reported that it will put this year's policy priority to resolving four major environmental problems that directly affect people's everyday lives-- fine dust, water-bloom, toxic substances and foul odors.The government plans to enforce a national fine dust alert system this year in an effort to help protect vulnerable citizens from possible health-related issues caused by exposure to high-density air pollution, according to the ministry.Fine dust is defined as particles smaller than 10 micrometers, and if inhaled, it can cause various respiratory problems and undermine the body's immunity.The Ministry of Gender Equality and Family said it will build national facilities to provide necessary aid to working parents who have to juggle work and home commitments.

Raids, arrests across Europe -   ================================   Four men suspected of supplying one of the gunmen behind the Paris attacks with weapons and vehicles were brought before an anti-terror judge Tuesday, the first to face possible charges over the shootings that shook France to its core.The three gunmen who carried out coordinated attacks from January 7-9 were killed in dramatic police sieges, and prosecutors are now hoping to pin down those who assisted them.Prosecutors called Tuesday for the men believed to have supplied gunman Amedy Coulibaly with weapons and vehicles to remain in detention and be charged with conspiracy to commit terrorist acts.Coulibaly was behind the murder of four hostages at a Jewish supermarket and the murder of a policewoman after brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi gunned down 12 people at satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.The attacks prompted a flurry of police activity across Europe.In Germany some 200 police carried out raids on 13 apartments in Berlin and other locations to find evidence against two men arrested last week for allegedly backing jihadist violence in Syria.This followed raids in Belgium last week that foiled potential attacks against police officers, and led to arrests in several European countries.Greece on Tuesday ordered the extradition of a 33-year-old Algerian man with suspected links to the jihadist cell dismantled in Belgium.The suspected mastermind of the plot, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a 27-year-old Belgian of Moroccan descent, remains at large.And in Bulgaria, a court ruled that a Frenchman who knew two of the Paris attackers should be returned to his home country.France had issued an arrest warrant for Muslim convert Fritz-Joly Joachin, 29, who denies being an extremist but was detained after trying to cross from Bulgaria into Turkey before the attacks.In southern France, five Russians from Chechnya were arrested on Tuesday with what police described as a dangerous amount of explosives, although the case was believed to be linked to organised crime and not radical Islam.      - Boosted security measures -   =============================   Many EU states have pushed for a US-style database of air travellers' details on the grounds that it would help track Islamist suspects, but the European Parliament has so far blocked the scheme saying it would breach civil liberties.Some European nations have also been pushing for a tightening of the Schengen visa-free zone.""They will discuss subjects including passenger name records and data retention, the functioning of the Schengen area and cooperation between security services,"" Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas told a briefing on Tuesday ahead of Wednesday's meeting.The fallout from the attacks has led to massive protests in Muslim countries, furious after Charlie Hebdo magazine responded to the killing of its staff by publishing a new cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed.Banned by Islam, the depiction of the prophet was taken as a searing insult to Muslims who burned French flags, and threatened the country in protests that have taken place in Chechnya, Afghanistan, Gaza, Iran and Pakistan. In Niger protests turned deadly as 10 people died and dozens of churches were torched.The attacks have forced France to face up to its failure to integrate poorer, migrant families, with Valls admitting on Tuesday that the country was plagued by ""social and ethnic apartheid"".

""The DVDs of 'The Interview' were not included on purpose."" About 20 American activists, including some from the U.S.-based Human Rights Foundation, also joined the border campaign, according to officials. Claiming the exclusion of the DVDs as a warning to North Korea, Park said the group will spread a massive amount of ""The Interview"" DVDs if the North is not cooperative with South Korea's dialogue offer and its proposal for a reunion of separated families.The activist group often flies leaflets carrying anti-regime messages in big plastic balloons across the border in a bid to spread dissenting messages in the reclusive communist country. Park had pledged to add the DVDs to their campaigns this month.The Monday action came despite South Korea's calls on the activist group to scrap their campaigns after the North's repeated threats of retaliation. In a news interview released earlier on Tuesday, Park indicated his intention to push ahead with the DVD campaign. ""The Interview"" DVDs would not be scrapped without an official government request,"" the activist group head said. ""I have previously vowed to accept if a person in charge of government administration requests restraint in the form of an official letter, but no such request has been made,"" Park said in an interview with Washington-based Radio Free Asia. ""We are in a position in which we cannot refrain from the plan only upon a verbal request from the government,"" he said.The South Korean government has maintained that on principle it will not interfere with the campaign because it is a matter of freedom of speech, although it may take action to prevent any safety risks that might result from the activities.Last week, a high-level government official met with Park face-to-face and verbally advised him against a future campaign. On Tuesday, a unification ministry official again reiterated its stance that ""Leaflet spreading by private groups belongs to a sphere of the basic freedom of expression, therefore the government cannot force them (to stop) and the private sector should decide for themselves."" ""The government will take necessary action only in case clear risks are posed to the safety of citizens in the concerned region,"" the official said, adding that the government plans to continue to call for discretion from activists.The release of the U.S. comedy film, which revolves around an American TV producer and a show host's trip to North Korea to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, has previously drawn angry reaction from the communist country.

The previous system to determine household wealth was based on income and assets like real estate and cars, without taking into account factors such as pensions, financial assets and debts.Starting this year, the previously excluded factors will be included in the wealth evaluation, said an official from the ministry’s Scholarship and Financial Aid Division. “As a result, we will be able to prevent the benefits from going to students from wealthy families and instead concentrate the financial aid on the people in need,” he said.Potential beneficiaries will be sorted into 10 groups based on their household wealth, and all but those in the two highest wealth brackets will be eligible for the program.About 1.2 million students ― a little less than half the total number of college students in Korea ― have benefited from the program, the officials said. They said a similar number of students are expected to receive scholarships this year, but more money will be handed out.Some 1.54 trillion won ($1.43 billion) will be provided in scholarships for the first semester of this year, up from 1.37 trillion won in 2014. The maximum amount of money a student can receive is 4.8 million won, which is earmarked for those in the lowest bracket. It is also possible for students who are not granted a scholarship to challenge the decision. “Previously, we could not make inquiries about … household wealth. But the recent law revision has provided legal grounds for us to do so,” the ministry official said. The inherent problem with the new system, however, is that it may potentially penalize families who have financial assets, but do not have sufficient monthly income. In some of the cases provided by the ministry, students had moved across three or four groups. The ministry did not release information on how many households would be placed in the different wealth groups due to the changes.Applicants for the program can find out which wealth group they fall under on the Korea Student Aid Foundation’s website starting Tuesday, and will personally be notified of the results between Tuesday and Thursday. Those wishing to challenge the results will have two weeks to do so.The state scholarship program has been the backbone of President Park Geun-hye’s “half-price tuition” policy. She has claimed that through the 3.9 trillion won pumped into the program and other government subsidies, along with 3.1 trillion won in financial aid from the ministry, the burden of college tuition will be halved.

The president claimed that by expanding the state-backed scholarship programs, coupled with college scholarship programs, students’ financial burden would effectively be halved.But officials from the Korea Higher Education Research Institute said the government’s tactics to keep tuition costs low relied heavily on pressuring local colleges, rather than providing financial support.“The Park administration claims that the 3.9 trillion won ($3.6 billion) in state scholarships and 3.1 trillion won provided by colleges will result in ‘half-price tuition.’ But there is no guarantee that the colleges will continue providing the same amount of money,” the KHERI said in a report released last week. One of the major incentives to reduce tuition was the type 2 scholarships ― bigger scholarships given to students of colleges that cut their tuition fees most drastically. But the KHERI said the government had substantially cut the budget for type 2 scholarships, raising the possibility of hikes in tuition fees.As of now, most of the burden on keeping tuition fees from soaring falls on colleges, he said. This means the government has no effective means to continue restraining colleges.Most major colleges nationwide have announced, or plan to announce, a tuition freeze for this year. This appears to be a decision influenced by Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea’s constant pleas to refrain from raising fees.Last week, Hwang visited Ewha Womans University, the first major university to announce a large-scale tuition hike. On the day of Hwang’s visit, the university said it was reversing its initial stance, and would freeze its tuition fees.The abrupt reversal led those in education circles to believe Hwang’s visit was likely to have pressured the school against raising tuition fees. “The university committee is currently discussing the matter. But with the government breathing down our necks, who would dare raise tuition? I think we’ll freeze it like most other colleges,” said one official from a Seoul-based university.On the other hand, unspoken pressure from the authorities can only work for so long. According to the Education Ministry, the colleges’ average tuition fees fell 4.3 percent in 2012, but declined just 0.46 percent and 0.24 percent in 2013 and 2014, respectively.This underscores another problem for the half-price tuition plan; it has not substantially reduced tuition itself, which means the financial burden remains steep for some students, even with the scholarship programs in place.“The government must switch the current strategy and provide subsidies for colleges. That way, we can truly realize the half-price tuition,” KHERI official said.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","school against raising tuition fees ,college tuition is facing skepticism ,the school against raising tuition ,half price college tuition ,tuition fees the abrupt reversal","['Park Geun - hye', 'Park', 'the Korea Higher Education Research Institute', 'KHERI', 'KHERI', 'Hwang Woo - yea ’s', 'Hwang', 'Ewha Womans University', 'Hwang', 'Seoul', 'the Education Ministry', 'Yoon Min - sik']",0,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.37974897  0.21627429

""We're not going to excessively spread anti-North Korea leaflets for the time being.""The Campaign is one of two major civic groups that have regularly flown large amounts of anti-Pyongyang leaflets by balloons across the border. The leaflet campaign targeting North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has been a constant source of friction between the two Koreas.North Korea has openly threatened to retaliate against organizers of the leaflet campaigns who are mostly defectors from the North. But the Seoul government has refused to intervene, citing the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of expression.But the Seoul government appears to be changing its position on the issue following a court ruling last month that government authorities can intervene and stop the leaflet campaign if it threatens the safety of people living in border areas.The move by Lee's group came one day after the Unification Ministry separately met heads of the two civic groups and requested them to refrain from flying the leaflets.Lee, in response, said  his group will honor the government's suggestion but stressed that there will be no ""drastic"" cut in the frequency of the leaflet campaign, however.Park Sang-hak, also a North Korean defector who heads the other activist group that leads the campaign, said he is considering suspending his plan to send DVDs of a Hollywood film about a fictional plot to kill the North Korean leader across the border by balloon, according to sources.The head of the Fighters for a Free North Korea earlier had said he was planning to send 100,000 copies of Sony Pictures' ""The Interview,"" which the North condemned as a deal-breaker, around Tuesday.In a New Year Day address, the North Korean leader said he is willing to hold summit talks with South Korean President Park Geun-hye but said Seoul must first create a good atmosphere for dialogue by halting the leaflet campaign and joint military exercises with the United States.South and North Korea are in a state of conflict after the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an uneasy armistice, not in a peace treaty.

One person lifting the lid on expat office life is Michael Kocken, who writes “The Sawon,” a blog about his experiences as a graduate recruit at a mid-sized chaebol.He says working there was a rewarding experience, but he found some things hard to fathom. Staff were tacitly expected to work overtime, rather than leave at “knife time” ― the end of the regular work day ― and he found the induction program unnecessarily arduous.  Michael Kocken“At the start I was really excited about (the training),” he said. “I was keen to bond with the Korean staff on that kind of level. I was looking forward to for once not being the foreign guy. “In that sense it was quite good, because I didn’t get any special treatment.”He describes getting up at 6 a.m. for group exercises, followed by a full day of lectures and project work in the evening. But he said the project work was more suited to college freshmen than graduates, and thought the workload was heavy just for the sake of it.“I just felt it was unnecessary,” said Kocken. “We could bond with a weekend away and some team-building exercises. It doesn’t need to be this stressful.”Kocken said he suffered no repercussions when he complained about this, or when he later left work on time, though he might have been cut some slack because he was not Korean. He also found it odd to be asked to go to personal events, including the funeral of his manager’s father. He said he was required to help greet the guests there, but remembers feeling conflicted about being there.“It seems ruder to me to go to the funeral because I am not emotionally there. Any gesture is obviously hollow,” he said.“People (in Australia), because they feel that way, won’t go to a funeral of a coworker’s relative.”In nonprofessional jobs, the situation can be more difficult, says Bhing Diamzon, a Filipino-Korean counselor for the Seoul Global Center.“Sometimes the employer wanted their workers to work much more than the Koreans do,” Diamzon said, pointing out that many foreign workers did jobs Koreans didn’t want to do. “Most of the time these foreign workers suffer from discrimination.”But she said workers can improve their situation by learning the language and the culture.“Most foreigners (we advise) encounter problems with their employer because of misunderstandings miscommunication.”For high-ranking staff, cultural issues don’t generally become major problems, according to George Whitfield, president of Halcyon Search International, an executive recruitment firm based in Seoul. He points out a different potential language problem for foreign staff.“They need to be adaptable and just realize that when you have Korean employees, it’s just very natural for them to prefer to speak to Korean when they speak to each other,” he said.“A few people find it uncomfortable. They want to know everything that’s going on and being said.”Kocken says that despite the impression some readers get, he values his experience here. Although he has left Korea, he now works for the Australian office of a Korean company staffed mostly by Korean expats.“I really loved my time in Korea,” he said. “I can’t exchange that experience for anything.”By Paul Kerry (paulkerry@heraldcorp.com)","korean expats really loved my ,expected to work overtime rather ,miscommunication for high ranking staff ,foreign workers did jobs koreans ,korean office culture can seem","['korean', 'Michael Kocken', 'Sawon', 'Michael kocken“at', 'korean', 'Kocken', 'korean', 'Australia', 'Bhing Diamzon', 'filipino - korean', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'George Whitfield', 'Halcyon Search International', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'Korean', 'Korea', 'australian', 'korean', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Paul Kerry']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50093448  0.51178151

But recently, Korean workplaces have been experiencing some major changes, including a generational shift and an increase in female representation.“The younger generation is more outspoken and not shy about expressing their opinions to their seniors,” said a director at a media company who wished to remain anonymous. The attitude is somewhat new to him ― a 50-something baby boomer born raised under military-backed authoritarian governments in the aftermath of the Korean War. “When I was young, I obeyed my superiors, no questions asked,” he said.As the director pointed out, military culture has played a significant role in shaping the local corporate culture as more men climbed up the social ladder. In Korea, only men are required to fulfill military service. As these authoritarian leaders took up top positions in the office, the gap widened between the baby boomers and younger employees who were more influenced by democratic values. “Due to the hierarchical corporate culture, most office workers tend to refrain from speaking up or standing out,” a 26-year-old banker told The Korea Herald. The lack of such face-to-face communication has led the younger generation to flock to Blind, an anonymous gossip application launched in 2013. As the Korean version of Secret, a similar app launched in the U.S., Blind, has become a hit among young office workers seeking candid communication and sympathy at work. “Through this app, we can freely talk about our seniors, colleagues, work-related stress, salaries and even labor unions,” the young banker said. Access is offered only after the user is verified, and the posts are strictly encrypted for security, according to app developer Teamblind. “So far, most of the users are in their 20s and 30s,” noted Jung Young-joon, CEO of Teamblind. This means the app can provide a much-needed reality check for superiors, but may also perpetuate the generational gap, as seniors are less likely to join the conversation, according to critics. Gender discrimination is also gradually becoming less pronounced. Working in a society guided by Confucian values, Korean women have long been underrepresented in the business world. When Choi Kyung-hee, a 52-year-old banker, began her career at a bank 30 years ago, it was common for women quit once they got married or had a child. Furthermore, it was rare for women to land decent jobs in the first place, which explains the glaring lack of female executives today. Women make up merely 2 percent of executive positions at the 10 largest Korean corporations, according to data compiled by CEO Score in 2013. Things are slowly but steadily changing, Choi said. “In recent years, the gap between men and women has narrowed in terms of income and opportunities for promotion,” said Choi, who manages a bank branch in Seoul. The changes, however, do not appear to be equally felt among young women. “Women are still undervalued at work, and are forced to leave their jobs if they attempt to take maternity leave,” said Shim Soo-mi, 30, an office worker for an engineering company. “Realistically, the office culture will remain unchanged unless the men who are used to male-oriented ways retire.” However, some critics believe that as many women still leave voluntarily to have families, it is unfair to say that companies are not giving them a fair chance. A top-down office culture also has its merits, they say. “The military office culture is at times too rigid, but a strict chain of command can do wonders in times of crisis,” said one 40-something office worker.

477,477,[Weekender] Origins of Korean work culture,"South Koreans are known to be among the world’s worst workaholics, ranking second in the OECD in terms of working hours last year.On top of the long working hours ― the average Korean worked 2,163 hours last year, 1.3 times the OECD average ― Koreans often endure forced drinking sessions and work dinners under their uniquely hierarchy-driven work culture.Experts say this work culture was influenced by the Japanese...","South Koreans are known to be among the world’s worst workaholics, ranking second in the OECD in terms of working hours last year.On top of the long working hours ― the average Korean worked 2,163 hours last year, 1.3 times the OECD average ― Koreans often endure forced drinking sessions and work dinners under their uniquely hierarchy-driven work culture.Experts say this work culture was influenced by the Japanese work values adopted during the colonial period in the early 20th century, as well as the military-driven culture that dominated South Korea under the authoritarian governments of the ’60s and ’70s. “For example, companies in South Korea and Japan regularly hold sports competitions among their staff, and this is something that is very rare in other countries,” culture critic Lee Moon-won told The Korea Herald. “It was the Japanese who spread the concept of ‘myeolsabonggong,’ which means ‘destroy your personal life and devote yourself for the betterment of your community.’ The concept encouraged men to sacrifice their personal life for the companies they worked for, and such a life was viewed as ideal and even honorable. Today’s work culture in South Korea certainly has traits that were influenced by this concept.”This unique corporate culture is one of the factors behind South Korea’s low employment rate among women, as well as its gender pay gap ― 39 percent ― being the highest in the OECD, experts say. Only about 10 percent of all senior or executive positions were held by women here while only 53.9 percent of all Korean women were employed last year. Kim Soo-mi, a 35-year-old stay-at-home mom, used to find “hoesik,” literally “dinners with coworkers,” particularly painful while working at a sales outsourcing firm. The gatherings often involved heavy drinking as well as visits to karaoke bars ― where she and her colleagues were expected to entertain those in managerial positions. The hoesik involved multiple rounds and ended at about 2 a.m. despite the fact that she had to show up as early as 6 a.m. the next day. “Whenever I had to leave early from those dinners because of my daughter, who was 2 at the time, my female boss would tell me not to be a disgrace to women by leaving before it was over,” she said. “I thought, if I was disgracing fellow women by wanting to be with my daughter at night, I should just disgrace them once and for all by quitting.” Ahn Sang-soo, a scholar specializing in gender studies, said many Korean women are faced with the need to assimilate themselves to the country’s male-oriented work culture in order to succeed professionally. “An ideal society would be one where women would succeed without having to undergo such assimilation,” he said. “Most men learn how to behave around their superiors while doing their mandatory military service. There, they are encouraged to be obedient and not to challenge their superiors, whereas women don’t undergo this experience.“And when a woman says no to her boss, it is often considered rude or difficult even if she has a valid reason to refuse. But for working mothers who don’t have enough child care support, saying yes to every assignment and hoesik is nearly impossible.”Ahn said Korean men are also victims of this culture and system, as it destroys their relationship with their families. “After more than 15 years of working 9 a.m. to 10 p.m., you are more used to hanging out with your staff than your own family. You work and you drink. It’s a vicious cycle,” Ahn said.A series of studies have proved that long work hours don’t improve productivity. According to data from the OECD, Germans, who worked about 1,400 hours a year on average from 1990 to 2012, were 70 percent more proactive than the Greeks ― who worked more than 2,000 hours each year. So why are Koreans so overworked? “For every competition, the number of winners is limited,” said Lee, the culture critic. “This means for every company, the number of those who have the best skillsets are limited, too. For the majority of the people who are not considered exceptional, the way to earn points from your boss is to stay in the office as long as you can. “This ― not leaving the office until your boss does ― is also considered as an act of loyalty and sacrifice, which is still considered to be ideal in Korean work culture.”Kim Sook-ja, an official from the Gender Equality Ministry, said performance reviews at work should be more achievement-based, rather than based on seniority or personal connections in the office. “I think it has to do with the Korean cultural concept of ‘jeong,’ which makes people more generous to those who are close to them, even in the professional world,” she said. “But obviously this is creating all sorts of problems. We need a more transparent system that lets everyone be evaluated fairly, based mainly on their skillsets.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","world worst workaholics ranking second ,the world worst workaholics ranking ,world worst workaholics ranking ,worst workaholics ranking second in ,among the world worst workaholics","['South Koreans', 'OECD', 'Korean', 'OECD', 'Koreans', 'japanese', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Lee Moon - won', 'Japanese', 'South Korea', 'South Korea ’s', 'OECD', 'korean', 'Kim Soo - mi', 'Ahn Sang - soo', 'korean', 'korean', 'OECD', 'Germans', 'Koreans', 'Lee', 'korean', 'the Gender Equality Ministry', 'korean', 'Claire Lee']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.78977114  0.68509227

She has also said investigations found no wrongdoings by the three aides.Still, she offered an apology for causing public concerns over the leak of a presidential document that has sparked a political firestorm over allegations that one of her former aides tried to exert undue influence on state affairs.Among those who disapproved of Park's performance, 19 percent blamed Park for lack of communication and 13 percent said she had problems in handling personnel in the presidential office, according to the poll, Park has long been branded by her critics as ""uncommunicative""for allegedly refusing to listen to what critics and others have to say and insisting only on what she believes to be right.Gallup Korea said it questioned 1,002 adults between Tuesday and Thursday, with the poll having a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.

(Yonhap)Ewha Womans University said Wednesday it would freeze tuition fees for the 2015 school year, reversing its original plan to raise them by 2.4 percent. “(The university) will freeze the fees this year in accordance with the government policy to pursue half-priced tuition,” university president Choi Kyung-hwa said during her meeting with Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea at the university campus in Seoul. But the timing of Hwang’s visit and Choi’s subsequent announcement has sparked speculations that the visit was intended to pressure Ewha, the first major university to announce a tuition hike. Earlier in the month, the university said it would raise tuition fees by 2.4 percent, the maximum amount set by the government.Hwang has been publicly pressuring local universities not to raise tuition fees. He urged university presidents to refrain from raising their fees this year at a meeting held last week in Yangjae-dong, southern Seoul.Half-priced tuition is one of President Park Geun-hye’s flagship education policies. She aims to reduce students’ financial difficulties by curbing or gradually reducing tuition fees and expanding state-backed scholarship programs. Some students, however, have questioned the policy’s effectiveness, pointing out that it would not substantially lower tuition fees and that not every student receives a state scholarship.The average college tuition fees decreased slightly from 6.68 million won ($6,154) in 2013 to 6.67 million won in 2014.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","university to announce tuition hike ,in seoul on wednesday yonhap ,wednesday it would freeze tuition ,womans university said wednesday ,campus in seoul on wednesday","['Hwang Woo - yea', 'Choi Kyung - hee', 'Ewha Womans University', 'Seoul', 'yonhap)ewha Womans University', 'Choi Kyung - hwa', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'Seoul', 'Choi ’s', 'Ewha', 'Hwang', 'Yangjae - dong', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Yoon Min - sik']",5,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.58303666  0.67030704

Lim Su-kyung of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy is accused of appearing on the on-stage talk shows held in Seoul and other South Korean cities in the past several months.The shows, hosted by a Korean-American woman, Shin Eun-mi, reportedly contained comments sympathetic to the North Korean regime, in violation of the South's National Security Law.The law bans any activities meant to praise, promote or propagandize North Korean ideals in the country.The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency probing the case said Lim was called in as a defendant in the complaint filed by local conservative groups.The lawmaker is further accused of retweeting tweets posted by Urimizokkiri, a North Korean news website, according to police.Lim, however, said her show appearance was not premeditated.""I ran into the show when I was at the Jogye Temple (where the show was held in Seoul) to discuss Buddhism-related laws,"" she told reporters before the police questioning. ""I had received a request to participate, but I'd turned it down considering my other engagements at the National Assembly.""The former pro-unification activist became widely known after making an unauthorized trip to the communist nation in 1989 and meeting with then leader Kim Il-sung, the North's founder and grandfather of current leader Kim Jong-un.The police probe comes after Shin was expelled from the country last week. The prosecution had suspended her indictment.Earlier this week, the Seoul Central District Court also issued an arrest warrant for Shin's South Korean co-host, Hwang Sun, for holding shows that allegedly endorsed North Korea.

Choi said he learned of the tips from sources inside the communist country.But the defense ministry here said the authorities do not have such intelligence and no signs have been detected of the North's such military drills.""North Korea's artillery units have beefed up attack drills targeting our major facilities every year ... Though they are regular exercises, we are monitoring their activities along the border very closely,"" said a military officer here, requesting anonymity.The civic groups, with most of their members being North Korean defectors, regularly send leaflets to their communist homeland to encourage their countrymen to rise up against the totalitarian regime.Whether to regulate the campaigns has also been a hot-button issue in South Korea, as supporters claim it is a matter of freedom of expression while critics and residents in border regions say it could invite unnecessary trouble.In October, the two Koreas exchanged machine gun fire across the border after the North apparently tried to shoot down balloons carrying anti-Pyongyang leaflets.

A general’s annual salary last year was 128.34 million won ($118,602) on average, while the salaries for a lieutenant general, major general and brigadier general were 121.7 million won, 107.7 million won and 98 million won, respectively.Enlisted soldiers’ salaries have gradually increased, but still remain low. The annual salaries for a sergeant, corporal, private first class and private were 1.79 million won, 1.62 million won, 1.46 million won and 1.35 million won, respectively.The compilation also offered a brief analysis of the military strengths of neighboring countries ― China, Japan, Russia and North Korea ― as well as the U.S.For North Korea, the report said that Pyongyang has continuously been stepping up its asymmetrical military capabilities including missiles, AN-2 low-altitude aircraft and submarines. It put the number of North Korean Army troops at 1.01 million, greater than the U.S. Army’s 600,000 troops.As for the U.S. military, the report said that the U.S. has been pushing for a rebalancing policy to counter “future threats” and carrying out a “low-cost, highly efficient” defense policy while facing budgetary pressure.Touching on Japan’s military buildup, the report explained that Japan had been bolstering its naval and air forces with a defense plan to increase its numbers of key military assets such as submarines, escort ships, early warning systems and unmanned surveillance aircraft by 2023.As for China, it noted that the Chinese military had been pushing for a military transformation “with Chinese characteristics” and the emergent power had maintained a double-digit annual increase in its defense spending each year.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","private general annual salary last ,lowest ranking private general annual ,tuesday in state integrity survey ,series of corruption scandals concerning ,scored 12 points in 2013","['the Defense Ministry', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'China', 'Japan', 'Russia', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean Army', 'the U.S. Army ’s', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'China', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'Song Sang - ho']",12,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28403625  0.30265108

Supriyadi, the National Search and Rescue Agency's operational director.Intermittent underwater ping-like sounds were picked up Friday about a kilometer (half mile) from where the tail was located, but it was unclear if they were coming from the cockpit voice and flight data recorders located in the back of the Airbus A320, he said. It was possible the signals were coming from another source.He said no metal was detected at the ping location, but that the black boxes could have come loose from the plane. Nurcahyo Utomo, a National Commission for Transportation Safety investigator, said the sounds could not be confirmed.Meanwhile, Transportation Minister Ignasius Jonan cracked down on five airlines Friday, temporarily suspending 61 flights, because they were flying routes on days without permits. Earlier, all AirAsia flights from Surabaya to Singapore, the path Flight 8501 was on when it went down Dec. 28, were suspended after it was discovered that the low-cost carrier was not authorized to fly on Sundays. Transportation Minister Ignasius Jonan also sanctioned nine more officials for allowing the plane to fly without permits, bringing the total to 16.  The discovery of the plane's tail earlier this week was a major breakthrough in the slow-moving search that has been hampered by seasonal rains, choppy seas and blinding silt from river runoff. Officials were hopeful the black boxes were still inside. They are key to helping investigators understand what caused the crash.The last contact the pilots had with air traffic control, about halfway into their two-hour journey, indicated they were entering stormy weather. They asked to climb from 9,753 meters to 11,582 meters to avoid threatening clouds, but were denied permission because of heavy air traffic above them. Four minutes later, the plane dropped off the radar. Four additional bodies were recovered Friday _ two of them still strapped in their seats on the ocean floor – bringing the total to 48. Officials hope many of the remaining corpses will be found inside the fuselage, which has not yet been located by divers. Several large objects have been spotted in the area by sonar.

What do you think of Japan’s prospects for a greater security role?Sohn Yul: What we need to consider first is the shift in economic power in Northeast Asia, given that a change in economic power could lead to one in military strength. In 2010, China’s economy ― in terms of the gross domestic product ― has surpassed that of Japan. Only five years have passed since then, but Japan’s GDP is now half that of China. Many analysts also forecast that China will overtake the U.S. in GDP terms around 2020.But there is a “military-power lag,” considering that Japan’s naval power is still greater than China’s. Although China’s defense spending is double that of Japan and its economy is far bigger than Japan’s, Japan is still ahead of China in terms of its maritime defense capabilities, enabling it to cope with naval threats from China over the dispute surrounding the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands. In this vein, the U.S. military preponderance is expected to continue for some time even after China’s economy surpasses that of the U.S.Analysts estimate that the U.S.’ military and technological preeminence would continue over at least the next 15 to 20 years. This tells us that a critical shift in the balance of power between the U.S. and China in Northeast Asia may not occur in that span of time. Then, on the premise that there would not be any critical power shift, Japan may want to continue to capitalize on the U.S.’ preponderant military position and its alliance with the U.S. to ensure its security. The odds appear to be very slim that Japan’s economy would rapidly rebound, and in particular, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic stimulus drive, called “Abenomics,” seems to have almost failed or lost traction, which presages a wider economic gap between China and Japan ― a situation that would force Japan to continue to rely on its security alliance with the U.S. So, back to your question of Japan’s military buildup, we can envision a Japan pushing for heavier armament within the confines of the U.S.-Japan alliance, and there will be a strategic perimeter beyond which the U.S. does not want Japan to move, and Japan could hardly exercise its military power beyond that perimeter.Sohn Yul (Chung Hee-cho/The Korea Herald)KH: Can you elaborate on the scenarios in which Japan might go beyond that strategic perimeter?Sohn: The situations may involve Japan offensively responding to any disputes with China, intervening unilaterally in affairs on the Korean Peninsula, and even seeking military hegemony in Asia and nuclear armament, and so forth. The U.S. wants Japan to be stronger, but it wants its ally to remain a second Japan ― which is under the U.S. nuclear umbrella and does not undermine its strategic interests. From the U.S. strategic standpoint, Japan should not pursue an inordinate military power to break the peaceful mood between the U.S. and China, and it should not exercise its military power in a way that would hurt the security balance on the Korean Peninsula. But what we should carefully watch is the Sino-Japan relationship. China has started to perceive Japan as an adversary and vice versa. Japan, thus, wants to strengthen the alliance with the U.S., and be more active in defending itself. And in this process, there could be a military conflict or competition between China and Japan, although the Sino-U.S. relationship would continue to remain stable. Against this backdrop, a variable of the Abe government’s identity comes into play. The government has shown revisionist views on history on the one hand, and on the other hand, it has pursued status as a normal state. Under the U.S.-Japan alliance, there are limits to what Japan can do ― and of course, as well as much room for Japan to maneuver within the alliance ― and I believe it would be very difficult for Japan to become a militarily dangerous state. But given Tokyo’s identity, the intensity of the tension between China and Japan could increase.KH: Prime Minister Abe scored another big victory in the Dec. 14 lower-house elections, which showed that Japan’s opposition and civil society failed to keep Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party in check. Concerns here are the victory could provide momentum for Abe’s nationalist security agenda, which may further worsen Seoul-Tokyo relations. What do you think about this?Sohn: As I said, the experts’ projections are that the U.S. military preeminence will continue for at least the next 15 to 20 years. Thus, Japan will remain under the U.S. military leadership. Then, the question is whether Tokyo would continue to step up its ultranationalistic drive. For those who have closely watched Japan’s domestic situation, that scenario seems unlikely. If we analyze the election outcome, we can better understand its underlying implications. The voter turnout was tallied at 52 percent in the December election, the lowest rate in the post-war period. Does that signify the widespread voter apathy? Should a vast majority be apathetic about politics with a small class leading the entire nation, this would be a case of fascism. Thus, it may not be the case. According to a post-election survey by Japan’s Asahi Shimbun, it was the public distrust toward political circles that caused the lowest voter participation. Over 60 percent of the respondents who did not vote said that they did not believe any political parties would adequately represent their interests. As these people harbor deep discontent towards politics, they could move to reject the Liberal Democratic Party, should the ruling party perform poorly or should a capable alternative opposition party emerge. This means public backing for the LDP is quite weak. Secondly, we can examine the 72 percent of the respondents that said they supported the ruling party because the opposition parties were not attractive (not because the LDP was attractive).Thirdly, in the election, the number of lower-house seats for the Next Generation Party ― an ultranationalist party that has splintered off from the right-wing Japan Restoration Party ― had been reduced to only two from 19. This indicates voters do not want to see ideological contentions. Fourthly, we also need to check the increase in the number of seats for the Japan Communist Party to 21 from 8. Of course, Abe’s election strategies helped clinch the victory, but the underlying circumstances show that things are not necessarily propitious for Abe. After all, voters showed through the election that although the performances of both the ruling and opposition parties were far from satisfactory, they would like to give their confidence to Abenomics. Thus, voter support could disappear rapidly should Japan’s economy fail to perform well.I may sound too pessimistic. But Japan’s economy has contracted for two consecutive quarters, and should it continue negative growth, things will turn very unfavorable for Abe. Without economic improvement, Abe would face a very challenging political landscape for him to push for his ideological security agenda. that said, I think Abe may strive to strike a balance between ideology and pragmatism. Therefore, I would not be too pessimistic about the prospects of the relationship between South Korea and Japan. KH: Do you think U.S. President Barack Obama feels that Abe’s nationalist stance is excessive, although Obama may feel thankful ― to a certain degree ― for Abe being more active in sharing the U.S.’ Asian security burden?Sohn: What worries the U.S. would be Japan’s historical revisionism, given that it could also mean the denial of history concerning the Pacific War (including Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor). Basically, the chemistry between Obama and Abe doesn’t seem to be good: Obama used to be a grassroots figure leading civil activism and carries progressive characteristics, while Abe was born with a silver spoon in his mouth and rose up the political ladder on the back of his illustrious political pedigree.In terms of strategic interests, Obama may feel thankful to Abe for sharing its security burden and playing an active role in keeping China in check. But on the other hand, Obama may feel (uncomfortable) as Abe continues to cause friction with Seoul over history issues, and also trigger unnecessary tension with China when the U.S. wants to maintain a stable relationship with China. After all, Abe has pushed Korea toward China, which has caused the U.S. to step in and urge Japan to keep its apologies for its wartime wrongdoings. KH: South Korea appears to be facing an increasingly tricky diplomatic position as the strategic competition between the U.S. and China emerges. What is the way forward for Korea?Sohn: So now, we are talking about South Korea’s strategic position amid the Sino-U.S. rivalry. Basically, the U.S. and China are working to forge a new type of the great-power relationship in which they respect each other’s interests and favor a stable relationship. Thus, they are not caught in a fight or anything. But what about their relationship in this region? They are pursuing a stable, peaceful development of their relations, but things may be different in this region where there is a strategic competition over the Korean Peninsula and over the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands.During the Central Conference on Work Relating to Foreign Affairs in November, Chinese leader Xi Jinping put forward neighborhood diplomacy principles of “qin cheng hui rong” ― meaning the principles of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness in conducting its “periphery diplomacy.” In another session in December, he talked of the “big-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics,” and he put China’s relations with its neighbors first in his speech, then the diplomacy for the new major-power relationship and then for developing countries. Xi also talked of a “community of shared interests and common destiny with neighboring countries.” This indicates China is stepping up its periphery diplomacy, and South Korea appears to take a very crucial position (in Beijing’s diplomacy). While calibrating its approach toward its neighbors, China may consider which neighbor it should give more strategic weight to. And I guess South Korea’s strategic value is high (for China) as it is connected to the U.S. and Japan. Thus, China may seek to get South Korea on its side considering that Korea is in a special position while China seeks to shape a new regional order or architecture. But what’s worrisome is that this also indicates that South Korea could fall into a very embarrassing diplomatic position. If so, how should Korea deal with this?Like I said on the premise that there will not be a critical shift in the balance of power over the next 20 years, the current major-power relationship will go on, and that said, South Korea doesn’t need to take sides. There are some who say Korea should take a side, but this would only reduce the strategic space and diplomatic options for Korea. What matters is how we can contribute to the reshaping of an East Asian order. Does South Korea have any alternative about that, when China wants to construct a Sino-centric order with the U.S. striving to maintain the existing order? Korea should find that alternative. What is fortunate though is that the major powers are not yet caught in any military struggle or confrontation. The key is thus to create an order in which small and middle-power states are not forced to take any side, and all countries can peacefully coexist. To create that order, we need to come up with an idea ― not an idea to make a Korea-centric regional architecture, but an idea to forge a harmonious regional order. There has been talk of competition between the U.S.-led Trans-Pacific Partnership and the China-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, and between the China-led Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Asia Development Bank led by the West and Japan. But we need to think about a way to forge an architecture in which those competing entities can coexist rather than compelling states to choose between the major powers.KH: The Park Geun-hye government has been pushing for its Northeast Peace and Cooperation Initiative, under which it wants to build regional trust by cooperating first on non-political, soft issues such as disaster relief and nuclear safety, and then gradually moving on to tougher security and political issues. Do you think this “functionalist” approach will be viable for this region?Sohn: Not really in the short-term. This should be a long-term vision, and we never know how much time it would take to build the kind of regional trust the initiative seeks to foster. Like you said, this is aimed at nurturing a culture of multilateral dialogue and cooperation through cooperating first on soft issues and then on “high-politics” issues. This, after all, boils down to whether the “spillover effect” can occur from the soft issues to the hard issues. The concept of this spillover effect is part of the European integration theory and this occurred in the European context. For the spillover effect, European integration theorists put forward three crucial conditions: First, the soft issues should be so vital that the security and political issues not impede cooperation over those soft issues. Seoul talks of soft issues including disaster relief and climate change, but these are not life-or-death topics that would leave regional states with no other option but to cooperate on security issues. Secondly, there should be deep interdependence or interconnection among those soft issues to create the spillover effect. But this interdependence seems to be weak when it comes to the soft issues Seoul has raised. And the last condition is about the social background or environment. To foster the spillover, the regional environment should be pluralistic, civil society should be strong, and there should be transnational networks of interest groups and experts. But countries in East Asia are very state-centric, nationalistic and somewhat exclusive in their nature. Sohn Yul● Sohn, the dean of Yonsei University’s Graduate School of International Studies, is a political scientist specializing in Japanese politics and foreign policy, international political economy and East Asian regionalism.● He previously taught at the University of Tokyo’s Institute of Social Science, Yokohama National University and Chung-Ang University.● His publications include “Japanese Industrial Governance: Protectionism and the Licensing State,” “The Political Economy of Korea-Japan FTA,” “Translating Economy: Economy Concept in Modern Korea, and “Japan: Political Economy of Growth and Stagnation.”● He is a member of the Presidential Commission on Northeast Asian Cooperation Initiatives, and the chair of the Center for Japan Studies at the East Asia Institute.

On Monday, he tweeted: ""St George's flags are flying in Dresden with PEGIDA. If I could be anywhere right now it would be Dresden.""The protests have been denounced by Germany's leading parties, with Chancellor Angela Merkel decrying the ""hate"" that fuels the participants. ""What's remarkable is that the phenomenon is not caused by an (economic) crisis -- Germany is doing well. And in Dresden, there are no Muslims,"" said Cohn-Bendit.He says images of violence by Islamic jihadist groups in the Middle East have frightened people even in parts of Europe where very few Muslims have settled. ""They have scared themselves with globalised television and the internet. That's how you can live in the heart of Saxony and have the feeling that you're under attack.""- Fear of the Other -=====================The story is a familiar one of fearing that which is not understood.""When we don't have contact with others, when we don't know them, we are afraid of them,"" said a European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""We saw that with the referendum on minirets in Switzerland. Those who live in remote villages, and are therefore the least affected, they were the most hostile to minarets.""But that has done nothing to offset genuine fears in many countries over the potential impact of mass immigration.Even Sweden, proud of its liberal attitudes, has strained under the pressure of 100,000 asylum requests in a country of just 10 million. It has seen the rapid growth of the extreme right Democrat Party which has played on concerns about immigration, while a number of fires at mosques have raised fears of mounting Islamophobia. Meanwhile France, home to Europe's largest Muslim population, is convulsed by a debate over supposed Islamisation, with fears whipped up by the far-right Front National and a number of public intellectuals. It was back in the media this week with the release of a new book by writer Michel Houellebecq which imagined the country ruled by a Muslim party in 2022. Cohn-Bendit puts it down to a wider identity crisis as traditional cultures face rapid change.""It's PEGIDA in Germany, it's also gay marriage in France,"" he said.""It's the fear of losing that which no longer exists: of losing a pure Germany ... of losing a vision of the family that no longer exists.""

(Yonhap)""Such a reckless act was done at a time when all Koreans in the North and the South and abroad were eagerly hoping to see mended North-South relations,"" said the KCNA.""It is a blatant challenge to the DPRK's sincere stand and appeal for improved North-South relations and national reunification and a last-ditch effort to obstruct the improvement of north-south relations and spoil an atmosphere of dialogue."" DPRK is the acronym for the country's formal name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.It was referring to Kim's speech aired on Jan. 1, in which he emphasized the need to improve inter-Korean relations this year, which marks the 70th anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japan's 35-year colonial rule.He said Pyongyang is willing to engage in various types of dialogue with Seoul even at the highest level. It was the first time that he openly spoke about the possibility of inter-Korean summit talks, although he attached routine preconditions to the olive branch such as a halt to annual joint defense exercises between South Korea and the United States.The conservative Park Geun-hye administration of the South maintains that the military drills are a necessary defensive measure and that there are no legal grounds to formally ban the leaflet campaign because of freedom of speech.Local media have paid attention to whether there will be a change in the government's position on the leaflet issue after a related court ruling.The Uijeongbu District Court, located just north of Seoul, ruled Tuesday that the authorities can restrict the scattering of leaflets if it jeopardizes public safety amid Pyongyang's threat of military retaliation.The court added that it's true that the leaflet campaign is associated with the freedom of speech.The unification ministry said it respects the court's ruling and it will continue to seek appropriate measures to protect its people from the North's possible attack.""There is no change in our basic stance (on the matter). But we will cooperate with police, if needed, to ease concerns about dangers to the lives and property of our people,"" ministry spokesman Lim Byeong-cheol said at a press briefing.He stuck to the expression of ""safety-related measures,""avoiding a direct answer to questions about whether the government has plans to ban such leaflet launches in a pre-emptive manner.

Freedom, he says, has been worse. In the year since police emancipated the severely mentally disabled man from the remote island farm where he had worked for eight years, Kim has lived in a grim homeless shelter, where he has been preyed upon and robbed by other residents. He has no friends, no job training prospects or counseling, and feels confined and deeply bored. “I want to go back,” Kim, 41, said during a recent interview in the shelter near Mokpo, the southwestern mainland port that is the gateway to dozens of salt islands where a months-long investigation by The Associated Press found that slavery still thrives, an open secret among locals.  “I feel trapped here,” he said. Kim's plight illustrates the continuing failure of one of Asia's richest countries to help workers who have been enslaved on the farms _ often people with mental or physical disabilities. Three other disabled ex-slaves also told the AP that they wanted to return to the salt farms because of their misery and sense of aimlessness in the crowded homeless shelters that officials placed them in.  On the farms, they said, they at least had a fixed daily routine, a job they became skilled at and a sense of purpose. An official on Sinui, one of the salt-farming islands, confirms that at least one ex-slave has returned to a farm. Activists and officials suspect there are many more. While the initial reports on slavery shocked many South Koreans and led to a nationwide investigation last year, “Society continues to fail in providing basic help for our most vulnerable members even after they were pulled out of slavery on the islands,” said Choi Jung Kyu, a lawyer whose office represents 18 former slaves. “Our society is treating the victims worse than the salt farmers did.” Salt farmers often describe themselves as doing society a favor by taking in the homeless, the disabled, the uneducated and those who can't get jobs anywhere else and whom the rest of the country would like to forget. They also acknowledge a harsh economic reality.  “It would be extremely difficult to run a salt farm without disabled people,” said Park Jong-won, 69, a salt farm owner on Sinui Island who recently received a suspended sentence for exploiting a mentally disabled man for profit. “Normal people wouldn't work at salt farms even if we begged them.”  Prosecutors had sought a prison term for Park, but an appeals court showed leniency in part because it said Park provided the victim with “food and a place to stay.” Revelations of slavery involving South Korea's disabled on island salt farms have emerged five times in the last decade. Last year's government probe found more than 100 workers nationwide who'd received no, or scant, pay. A later investigation by police and activists found 63 more such workers in the islands, three quarters of whom were disabled. The investigations began after Seoul police went undercover to rescue a disabled man who had written to his mother to say he was enslaved on a salt farm. That man, Kim Seong-baek, is expected to testify Wednesday in a Seoul court as his former boss appeals a 3{-year prison sentence.  Kim Seong-baek, now living in Seoul, has no desire to go back; he says even looking at salt disgusts him. But several other recently freed slaves interviewed by AP say they feel more hopelessness and fear than relief about their lives away from the salt farms. Most of them were homeless before being lured to salt farms by illegal job brokers hired by farm owners. Kim Jong-seok, the former slave languishing in the homeless shelter near Mokpo, said that his ex-owner, who is being investigated for abuse but hasn't been arrested, recently visited and asked if he'd work for him again for about $90 a month.  Lawyers helping the victims said they are alarmed that some disabled ex-slaves are in regular contact with their former masters, but add that the law does not prohibit it. Others released from slavery also struggle to fit into society.  Han Sang-deok was freed by police last year after 20 years working without pay on a salt farm on Sinui, the same island where both Kims had been exploited. Until his release, not once did the 64-year-old mentally disabled man leave the island, Han said in an interview at a cafe in Mokpo.  Asked about his relationship with the farm owners, Han says: “I just worked. I was there on my own. I went to work, I slept. Like that.”  Han, whose relatives had thought he was dead for two decades, pauses for a long time when asked about his future plans, finally saying, “I don't know what I should do.”  Kang Seong-hwan, an official at the Sinui island ward office who is in charge of monitoring disabled workers, told AP that at least one salt farm slave had returned to his employer after being rescued last year. He said he has little actual power to check up on workers and suspects there are more cases of returned slaves because they have been essentially neglected after moving to shelters. Activists trying to keep tabs on freed slaves often track down victims only to hear them say that they have returned to the salt farms and do not want to be contacted again, said Huh Joo-hyeon, the director of an activist group in Mokpo.  Park Su-in, Huh's colleague, describes a system in which disabled workers on the islands become dependent on their owners for food and medical care, leading to exploitation. One disabled former slave she talked to didn't know the words “password” or “bank account,” yet he had a bank account, controlled by his owner, where his disability payments were sent. Amid short-lived public anger last year, regional government officials vowed to open an exclusive facility for the freed slaves and connect them with new jobs. The promises haven't been kept, and activists believe there's little chance they will be. Many of the ex-slaves are now in a bureaucratic limbo. Because they have been moved away from the islands in Sinan County, county officials say they can't help the victims and, besides, they don't have the space for them.  An official from the homeless shelter near Mokpo where Kim Jong-seok lives said freed slaves were supposed to stay there only temporarily, and wondered when Sinan County would take them back. The official, who refused to give his name because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly, said the facility barely has room for the homeless people in the area, and it's not their responsibility to provide job programs and counseling.   In some cases, guardians have been appointed to protect former slaves' interests. One ex-slave, Heo Tae-yeong, has a guardian who orchestrated his move from a Mokpo area homeless shelter to a residential facility for the mentally disabled in Gwangju.   Heo, who cannot read or count, worries that he will struggle in a new environment, but is excited about the idea of learning job skills in Gwangju. He hopes to one day work in a factory. When asked what he'll do with the money he earns, Heo takes a long drag off his cigarette.  He doesn't know. “I've never had any money.” (AP)","grim homeless shelter where he ,slavery shocked many south koreans ,three other disabled ex slaves ,farms because of their misery ,slave languishing in the homeless","['Kim Jong -', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Mokpo', 'the Associated Press', 'Kim', 'AP', 'Sinui', 'South Koreans', 'Choi Jung Kyu', 'Park Jong - won', 'Sinui Island', 'Park', ""South Korea 's"", 'Seoul', 'Kim Seong - baek', 'Seoul', 'Kim Seong - baek', 'Seoul', 'AP', 'Kim Jong - seok', 'Mokpo', 'Han', 'Sinui', 'Kims', 'Han', 'Mokpo', 'Han', 'Han', 'AP', 'Mokpo', 'Sinan County', 'Mokpo', 'Kim Jong - seok', 'Sinan County', 'Heo Tae - yeong', 'Mokpo', 'Heo', 'AP']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5282293   0.37247422

One cow at a farm in Anseong, Gyeonggi Province, had tested positive for the viral disease in the final examination, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs said. The cow was found Monday to be drooling ― a common symptom of the disease. This is the first confirmed case of a cow with foot-and-mouth disease since 2012. Only pigs had been found to have been infected since the disease broke out again last month. The quarantine authorities stressed that it was unlikely the disease would spread to other cows at the farm. “Only one poorly immunized cow showed the symptom. Further transmission will be limited as all other cows at the farm showed a 94 percent antibody formation rate,” the Agriculture Ministry said. About 50 cows are being raised on the farm. Anseong was struck severely by foot-and-mouth disease from late 2010 to 2011. More than 207,000 livestock were slaughtered, causing losses of 40 billion won ($36 million). Meanwhile, a dozen more pigs were confirmed to have the contagious disease. The animals were immediately culled while other uninfected pigs were being monitored, the quarantine authorities said.The first case was discovered in Jincheon, North Chungcheong Province, on Dec. 3 and about 27,000 animals at 35 farms across the country had been culled as of Tuesday.As part of the efforts to contain the outbreak, the Agriculture Ministry vowed to strengthen the preventive measures. In the second sterilization measure to be taken nationwide, all livestock-related trucks will be subject to disinfection measures starting Wednesday.The ministry also toughened penalties for farm owners who do not follow the vaccination and disinfection measures.

The report assessed the frequency of disasters, prevention and response systems, and the government’s overall efforts to recover from such disasters. Korea’s disaster management index was 0.467, while Ireland ranked first with 0.758. Japan, which is much more prone to natural disasters like earthquakes than Korea, showed it is far more proficient in risk management by ranking 11th with 0.580. The Sewol incident, considered one of the worst maritime disasters in the country’s history, reflects how poorly the country was prepared to cope with catastrophes. The vessel lay on its side for hours before capsizing completely and plunging into the water, yet the rescuers were unable to save more than 60 percent of the passengers.In response to a public outcry that mounted in the disaster’s aftermath, the government announced a system overhaul by disbanding the Coast Guard and creating the Ministry of Public Safety and Security. But the report said the government merely made the Coast Guard a “scapegoat,” and called its measures a “shortsighted response.”Besides risk management, the report showed Korea was also inadequate in education and welfare policies, ranking 30th in both categories. However, the country showed strong performance in sectors like the economy, ICT and R&D;, ranking No. 7, 9 and 11 respectively.The overall competence of the Korean government was ranked No. 18, down four notches from 2013.

Defectors based in the South have flocked to see the film at the center of an escalating international row thanks to its lurid depiction of the assassination of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.The United States claims that the film’s presentation of Kim ― whose family has ruled the reclusive, impoverished state for more than six decades ― prompted Pyongyang to launch a massive cyberattack on Sony Pictures, the studio that made it.“Every defector I know has seen the movie,” said Kim Sung-min, who fled the North in 1996 and now runs the anti-Pyongyang Free North Korea Radio station.“We’ve talked a lot about this flick over the past week, and we simply did not understand why it gives foreigners laughs,” he added.Internet links to the film quickly circulated amongst the South’s 20,000-strong defector community after Sony reversed its decision to axe it late last month following threats to cinema-goers from the shadowy Sony hackers.But defectors have reacted to the movie with a mixture of shock and bafflement.It’s not just that its crass humor is largely lost on a North Korean audience ― it’s that growing up immersed in a personality cult, which gives god-like status to the ruling Kim dynasty, is not an experience that can easily be forgotten.Even for defectors who have been in the South for years, it is jarring to see Kim ridiculed as a Katy Perry fan who has a complex about his dad. “For me, it wasn’t a comedy ― more of a bombshell, because of the way it made fun of Kim Jong-un,” Park Sang-hak, who defected to the South in 1999, told AFP.But that is precisely the reason that Park, who leads a group of activists that regularly attempt to airdrop anti-Kim leaflets into North Korea, is planning to launch gas-filled balloons over the border carrying some 100,000 copies of the film on DVDs and USB memory sticks.

The losses were incurred after KNOC acquired NARL for the inflated price of $1.22 billion in 2009 although the due price was only around $941 million, according to the audit agency. Kang Young-won, the then-president of the state firm, hastily made the acquisition decision in order to boost its annual oil production performance, the audit agency said.The state auditor said that Kang was well aware of the prospect of a loss, but went ahead with the acquisition to attain yearly performance goals, adding that it had referred Kang to the prosecution on negligence charges. It is also urging the trade ministry to pursue a damages suit against the former president.“(KNOC) recklessly acquired the unhealthy refining firm without a sufficient review only to make up for its stagnant M&A; performance,” the audit agency said in a statement. Amid mounting losses, KNOC sold NARL to a New York-based merchant bank for just $3.5 million last year, citing unfavorable global refining market conditions as well as the prospect of further losses.The latest finding by the audit agency is expected to fuel the opposition political parties’ call for a parliamentary probe into former President Lee Myung-bak over his so-called energy diplomacy policy.Opposition parties and civic groups have claimed that massive amounts of state funds were wasted on overseas natural resources development projects pursued under the Lee administration.
