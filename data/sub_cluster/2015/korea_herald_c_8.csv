The revised election bill to redraw electoral districts, also remained up in the air.Parliamentary Speaker Chung Ui-hwa, who had refused to push ahead with the bill on his own authority, said that he would submit his version for review to the National Election Commission at midnight.“There will be a legislative emergency situation starting from midnight, when the current constituency system loses its binding power,” Chung told reporters on Thursday morning.His plan will involve keeping the number of regional parliamentary seats at the current 246 and that of proportional representatives at 54.Chung’s bill is expected to undergo a review by the commission, which will then resubmit it to the Assembly for endorsement by Jan. 8. National Assembly on Dec. 31. YonhapIn a New Year address, President Park Geun-hye reiterated her calls for the swift passage of pending bills.“I will complete the three-year economic innovation plan and also achieve reforms in the public sector, finance, education and labor,” Park said.The president had repeatedly underlined that the pending bills were crucial to improve the nation’s economy, create jobs and promote public safety.While the government and the ruling party continued to call for the passage of what they referred to as the people’s welfare bills, the opposition camp vowed to block them, which they saw as aggravating inequality and job insecurity.“The Minjoo Party is the only party that may suggest an alternative to the working class,” Minjoo Party leader Rep. Moon Jae-in said in his New Year’s address.His Saenuri counterpart, meanwhile blasted the main opposition for holding back the economic and labor reform bills.“The opposition party will face the people’s judgment in the general election for blocking the nation’s economic improvement,” said Saenuri leader Kim Moo-sung at the Supreme Council meeting.By Bae Hyun-jung (tellme@heraldcorp.com)","last general assembly thursday ,general assembly thursday morning ,some 210 pending bills ,general assembly thursday ,assembly thursday morning to","['the National Assembly', 'Chung Ui - hwa', 'the National Election Commi']",8,"[ 1.          1.          1.         ... -0.29230407  0.42469403

Historians estimate that more than 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. Korea was under Japanese colonial rule from 1910 to 1945. The victims are euphemistically called ""comfort women.""

Five business lobbying groups, including the Federation of Korean Industries and the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said a bipartisan deal is urgent to draw up business plans and adopt reform measures in workplaces.In September, labor, management and the government reached a landmark deal to ease labor restrictions to allow companies to dismiss workers who are either negligent or underperforming.However, no follow-up measures have been taken as related bills were pending in the parliament. ""Without labor reforms, it is hard to create jobs for youth and achieve sustainable economic growth. But the parliament has not had enough discussions to put into practice of such measures,"" representatives of the groups said in a joint conference.They also urged the parliament to approve the measures to ease regulations in the service sector and other areas so they can expand investment in new business projects.""We are standing at the critical juncture of between a virtuous cycle for new jobs or getting bogged down into the low-growth economy,"" they said.They echoed the same concern raised by President Park Geun-hye, who warned that South Korea's economy could face the difficulties of reviving its economy without a much-wanted overhaul in the labor and public sectors. The high unemployment among youths has emerged as a major social problem in Asia's fourth-largest economy, prompting calls for more active measures to address the issue.The jobless rate for people between the ages of 15 and 29 reached 8.1 percent in November, up from the 7.4 percent reading a month earlier, marking the lowest level reported since May 2013, according to official data.

General Assembly on Thursday adopted a resolution denouncing North Korea’s woeful human rights situation and encouraging the U.N. Security Council to refer the case to the International Criminal Court.The resolution involving the ICC referral was endorsed for the second consecutive year, underscoring growing global concerns about what U.N. Human rights chief Zeid Ra‘ad al-Hussein recently decried as “gross” human rights violations.(Yonhap)A total of 119 countries voted for the resolution, while 19 countries voted against it with 48 countries abstaining. The resolution, which is not binding, has been passed annually at the U.N. General Assembly for 11 consecutive years.Last month, the U.N.’s Third Committee in charge of human rights matters passed the resolution overwhelmingly before sending it to the General Assembly. The European Union and Japan have been seeking such human rights resolutions every year.The adoption of the resolution Thursday came after the Security Council opened discussions on the North Korean case earlier this month for the second consecutive year.Testifying before the Security Council, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid said that it was “essential” to refer the North Korean situation to the ICC.“(North Korean) Victims are still unable to find judicial redress and there is still no accountability grounded in the work of an independent judiciary,” he said.“Once again, this year, the General Assembly has called on the Security Council to take action by referring the situation in DPRK (North Korea) to the International Criminal Court, which I believe to be essential, given the scale and extreme gravity of the allegations,” he added.The chances for the ICC referral appear to be low as China, one of the five veto-wielding powers and a traditional ally of the North, has rejected the idea. China has argued that the Security Council is not the right place to discuss human rights.Calls for the referral of the North to the ICC surged after the U.N. Commission of Inquiry released a report on the North Korean situation early last year. The report found evidence of torture, executions, arbitrary incarceration, deliberate starvation, enslavement and other appalling practices that the COI said amounted to “crimes against humanity.” In particular, it indicated that high-level Pyongyang officials responsible for the abuses could be referred to the ICC. Amid the absence of any sincere actions by Pyongyang to improve its human rights conditions, activists highlighted the need to continuously shed a light on the regime’s rights violations. “The only way to ensure that justice is done some day is to keep the spotlight on the North Korea’s government and keep collecting evidence of their crimes,” said John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","thursday adopted resolution denouncing ,general assembly on thursday ,denouncing north korea woeful ,second consecutive year underscoring ,assembly on thursday adopted","['the U.N.

Election officials said candidates cannot register for the parliamentary elections unless the electoral districts are redrawn by Tuesday. The rival parties are required to redraw electoral districts as the Constitutional Court ruled last year that the current electoral map was unconstitutional, citing unequal representation.The court said that the population differences between electoral districts should be reduced to two-to-one, noting the most populous electoral districts outweigh the least populous three seats to one.The rival parties are at odds over the number of elected parliamentary seats in rural areas and proportional representation.The Saenuri Party has proposed maintaining the 300-seat National Assembly by increasing the number of constituencies while reducing the number of lawmakers elected on proportional tickets, which currently stands at 54.The NPAD has opposed the plan, saying it will bring out more regionalism in local politics and wants to maintain the number of seats given to proportional representation members.""Contentious bills will be discussed (by lawmakers) at parliamentary committees,"" Lee Jong-kul, floor leader of the NPAD, told Yonhap News Agency.The 100-day regular session wrapped up Tuesday without the endorsement of the set of bills designed to revitalize the country's economy, after the rival parties failed to narrow their differences.

Security Council held a meeting on North Korea's human rights situation on Thursday, the second time the issue has been discussed at the top global security body after the first such meeting last year.The meeting took place after a proposal for the meeting was passed in a 9-4 vote with two abstentions.Last year, the Security Council held its first-ever meeting on the North's human rights issue after the adoption of a landmark U.N. General Assembly resolution calling for referring the communist nation to the International Criminal Court.A similar resolution has been proposed this year, passed the Third Committee last month and is expected to be formally adopted at the General Assembly later this month. This year's measure also calls for referring the issue to the ICC.The resolution and Thursday's Security Council meeting underscored the seriousness the international community attaches to the problem, and is expected to increase pressure on Pyongyang. The United States presided over Thursday's meeting as it has the presidency of the Council for December. ""Once again this year, the General Assembly may call on the Security Council to take action by referring the situation in the DPRK to the International Criminal Court, which I believe to be essential given the scale and extreme gravity of the allegations,"" Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, U.N. high commissioner for human rights, told the meeting.Zeid also said that any call for accountability must ""go hand-in-hand with an open dialogue"" with the North.China, the North's last-remaining major ally and a permanent member of the Council, had opposed convening Thursday's meeting, forcing Council President and U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power to hold a vote. Beijing claimed that it is not appropriate for the Council to discuss the human rights situation of a specific country.Despite calls for the North's referral to the ICC, however, it is unlikely that the Security Council will actually be able to refer the matter to the ICC because China and Russia, which have friendlier ties with North Korea than any other countries, are expected to veto such a move.North Korea has long been labeled as one of the worst human rights violators. The communist regime does not tolerate dissent, holds hundreds of thousands of people in political prison camps and keeps tight control over outside information.But the North has bristled at such criticism, calling it a U.S.-led attempt to topple its regime.In June, the State Department said in its annual human rights report that the North's human rights record ""remained among the worst in the world"" last year with public executions, political prison camps, torture and other abuses.

Vincent Brooks made the remark during a meeting with defense reporters Tuesday, saying the Army is pushing to have the THAAD unit deployed on the Pacific island of Guam remain there on a permanent basis, instead of the current rotational deployment.A permanent station on Guam ""will make it possible for us to have more options for commitment of THAAD in other places if asked,"" Brooks said, according to the defense news outlet Military.com. One of those other possible places was South Korea, though ""we haven't been asked to do that,"" he was quoted as saying.The website also reported that political sensitivities have thus far limited negotiations between Washington and Seoul on putting a THAAD system on the peninsula out of concern that China would see the placement in South Korea as a threat to its own security interests and the interests of its North Korean ally.The U.S. Army deployed the THAAD battery to Guam in 2013 to cope with war threats from North Korea.It is no secret that the U.S. also wants to deploy a THAAD unit to South Korea, where some 28,500 American troops are stationed, to better defend against ever-growing threats from North Korea's ballistic missile and nuclear programs.But the issue has become one of the most sensitive for South Korea because China sees a potential THAAD deployment as a threat to their security interests and have increased pressure on Seoul to reject such a deployment.Seoul and Washington have maintained they have never held any formal consultations on the issue.""No decisions have been made on upcoming deployments of THAAD,"" Cmdr. Bill Urban, a U.S. Defense Department spokesman, told Yonhap News Agency.Last week, Japan's defense minister reportedly said during a visit to Hawaii that the country is considering deploying a THAAD unit to defend against North Korea's missile threats.The Pentagon spokesman declined comment on the possible impact of a THAAD deployment to Japan.""We won't speculate on the impact of future decisions,"" he said.

The deal is expected to take effect by year-end if the government completes necessary administrative steps that will take at least 20 days. Upon the implementation, the two nations will enjoy tariffs cuts starting from the first round in December. According to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Commerce, the FTA will immediately eliminate tariffs on Korean exports to China worth around $8.7 billion annually.Before passing the motion, the rival parties had agreed to implement measures to compensate sectors expected to take a hit from the FTA. They vowed to build funds of some 1 trillion won ($870 million) over the next 10 years to provide financial assistance to agriculture and fishery businesses.They also agreed to increase the amount of direct subsidies to the affected industries such as by having the farmers receive about 600,000 won per hectare of land by 2020, up from 350,000 won in 2015. The fishermen would be awarded with 700,000 won by 2020.South Korea's lawmakers gather on Monday to agree on the ratification of Korea-China Free Trade Agreeemnt. YonhapThe deal came after the partisan standoff persisted close to the legislative deadline for the agreement. The Saenuri Party had asserted that the Nov. 30 would be the last opportunity to approve the FTA, a scheme that it said would allow Korean companies to maximize benefit from the FTA’s tariff cuts.The New Politics Alliance for Democracy refused to budge unless the government prepared steps to make up for the anticipated economic loss among the hard-hit sectors. The rival parties eventually reached a compromise Monday after overnight meetings.  Despite the bipartisan breakthrough, some lawmakers voiced their concerns over the deal, saying that the partisan agreement fell short of their expectations because the lawmakers were pressed for time to pass the deal in the 19th Assembly, which ends Dec. 9. “(The agreement) has room for improvement,” said NPAD whip Rep. Lee Jong-kul. “I think we have failed to fully address China’s yellow dust and food safety. We apologize to the people for leaving those issues unresolved.” Rep. Kim Jong-hoon, the Saenuri Party lawmaker who served as the Korean government’s chief negotiator of the Korea-U.S. FTA agreement during the Lee Myung-bak administration, opposed the agreement. He denounced the government’s attempt to raise funds as a plan to “extort” money from private companies.Separately, lawmakers also agreed to ratify the FTAs with Vietnam and New Zealand that were signed in March and May, respectively, and the agreement to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a Chinese-led financial institution of which South Korea’s is one of the 57 prospective founding members. The FTA with Vietnam is expected to foster Korean companies’ investment in Korea’s third-largest export market and investment venue. The pact includes stronger measures to protect investors’ rights and to tear down trade barriers that prevent Korean companies from entering the market. The FTA with New Zealand is expected to bring complimentary benefits to both nations as South Korea has comparative advantage in industrial products and New Zealand has the advantage in agricultural and dairy products.Meanwhile, the parliamentary approval for the AIIB allows Korea to become an official founding member of the international institution. Korea holds a 3.81 percent share in the fund, its largest share in any international financial institution.

(Yonhap)The agreement was made as the plenary session Friday was postponed, with the floor leaders of the two parties meeting for breakfast along with Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan. With the NPAD set on opposing the pact unless the government implements stronger measures to compensate the agriculture and fisheries sectors, the Saenuri Party has said it would still go ahead with the vote using its majority status.The pact must pass through the foreign affairs and trade committee before being put to a plenary vote. With the ruling party lawmakers accounting for 60 percent of the 23-member committee, they can unilaterally pass the bill. The FTA with China was signed on June 1.The Saenuri Party also said along with the trade pact with China, they will move to complete the legislative process for other pending FTA-related bills involving Vietnam, New Zealand and Turkey. Cheong Wa Dae urged lawmakers to keep to the schedule. “It is regretful that the plenary session slated to open today was canceled. Although it is already late, we earnestly urge the National Assembly to ratify the FTA on Nov. 30 that would greatly contribute to the public livelihood and economy,” presidential spokesman Jeong Yeon-guk said.The Saenuri Party has been asserting that the Friday session would be the last opportunity to have the agreement take effect within this year, as officials from Seoul and Beijing need time to prepare the administrative steps for implementation. The party has so far pledged to provide subsidies worth 1 trillion won ($870 million) to sectors such as the agriculture industry. The government has also highlighted that early implementation of the pact would allow Korean companies to enjoy the full benefits of the pact’s tariff cut scheme.The NPAD has urged the government to increase subsidies and prepare measures to protect the suffering agricultural, fishing and dairy industries likely to suffer further setbacks from the trade pact.

""It speaks of dialogue and cooperation, but from behind, plots with outside forces to do harm to its kindred.""It cited this year's Integrated Firepower Exercise between South Korean and U.S. forces as well as the South's efforts for closer coordination with the international community on the North's nuclear weapons program and human rights situation, among others.Inter-Korean relations have showed signs of improvement as both sides eked out the deal following heightened tension over a land-mine blast blamed on the North in early August.

On Monday, the Sewol Special Investigation Committee said it would look into how Cheong Wa Dae reacted to the emergency and what Park was doing for seven hours after the doomed ferry began to sink off the nation’s southwestern coast on April 16, 2014. The president will be subject to the investigation if it is relevant to the case, the committee said.The decision brings a heated political debate back on the president who has been countering allegations that she had been away from the presidential compound when the tragedy occurred.Cheong Wa Dae has said that Park was in her office on April 16 last year while she received multiple reports on the accident.In one of the worst maritime disasters in South Korean history, the sinking of the ferry left 304 people dead or missing. Most of its victims were high students headed toward the resort island of Jejudo. The Sewol Special Investigation Committee holds a meeting on Monday, after members picked by the ruling Saenuri Party walked out in boycott of the panel`s decision to probe President Park`s whereabouts on the day the ferry Sewol sank off last year. (Yonhap)Calling it an “unconstitutional idea,” the presidential office blasted the committee for having the president on the investigation list. The Constitution stipulates that the incumbent president is exempt from being accused of criminal activities, unless he or she instigates a rebellion or external disturbances.“The special investigative committee should be faithful to its duty, and stop politicizing the issue away from its unconstitutional viewpoint,” said Park’s spokesman Jeong Yeon-kuk.The ruling Saenuri Party demanded all members of the special investigative committee to step down, accusing them of crossing the line. “The committee, showing no interest in investigating the cause of the accident and instead focusing on Cheong Wa Dae, appears to have an ulterior motive aimed at politicizing the Sewol issue, rather than working on ways to improve institutional measures to build a safer society,” said Saenuri floor leader Won Yoo-chul.Other ruling party lawmakers refused to attend a parliamentary committee meeting on agriculture and maritime affairs where the special panel was to brief on the developments, and threatened that they would consider dissolving the Sewol committee. The 17-member committee consists of 10 members picked by the ruling and the main opposition party, three family members of the victims and four legal experts recommended by the Supreme Court and the Korean Bar Association. The decision on Monday came after the members close to the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy pressed to include probe into Park’s whereabouts on that day. Of the 13 members attending, nine members approved, including five members recommended by the NPAD, while four members close to the ruling party boycotted the meeting. The members recommended by the opposition said the plan of tracing Park’s whereabouts does not infringe upon the Constitution because it is not aimed at filing a criminal charge against the president.The ruling party members, meanwhile, vehemently opposed the idea, saying it would eventually lead to a criminal investigation against her.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","controversy escalated tuesday over ,controversy controversy escalated tuesday ,controversy escalated tuesday ,probe president sparks controversy ,president sparks controversy controversy","['Park Geun', 'the Sewol Special Investigation Committee']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.12022352  0.7858147

General Assembly on Thursday passed a resolution on North Korea's human rights situation that calls for referring the communist regime to the International Criminal Court.The resolution passed in a 112-19 vote, with 50 abstentions.The overwhelming passage almost guarantees its formal adoption at the General Assembly expected for mid-December as the General Assembly process is seen largely as a formality.The resolution, which was introduced by the European Union and Japan on Oct. 30, is largely similar to a landmark resolution that was adopted at last year's General Assembly with a call for referring the North's human rights situation to the ICC for the first time. ""The General Assembly ... encourages the Security Council to continue its consideration of the relevant conclusions and recommendations of the commission of inquiry and take appropriate action to ensure accountability, including through consideration of the referral of the situation in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the International Criminal Court,"" the resolution said.The resolution also calls for ""effective targeted sanctions against those who appear to be most responsible for acts that the commission has said may constitute crimes against humanity"" and encourages the Security Council to continue discussions and active engagement on the issue.The resolution reflects the seriousness the international community attaches to the problem, and is expected to increase pressure on Pyongyang. After the adoption of last year's resolution, the Security Council held its first meeting on the North's human rights issue. The council could do the same once the new resolution is adopted.""For now, it's hard to say whether (the Security Council) will convene a meeting in December just as it did last year or take more time"" before convening a meeting, South Korea's U.N. Ambassador Oh Joon told Yonhap News Agency.But many observers believe there is a high chance for the council to take up the issue in December as the United States will be holding the council's rotating presidency for the month.During Thursday's committe meeting, the North's deputy chief of its mission to the U.N., Choe Myong-nam, denounced the resolution as a U.S.-led plot to topple the regime. China, Russia, Syria, Cuba and other countries with friendly ties with Pyongyang also opposed the resolution, calling it politically motivated.Despite calls for the North's referral to the ICC, chances are not high for the Security Council to actually refer the issue to the ICC because China and Russia, which have friendlier ties with North Korea than any other countries, are expected to veto such a move. Still, such resolutions play a great role in drawing international attention to the issue.North Korea has long been labeled one of the worst human rights violators. The communist regime does not tolerate dissent, holds hundreds of thousands of people in political prison camps and keeps tight control over outside information.But the North has bristled at such criticism, calling it a U.S.-led attempt to topple its regime.In June, the State Department said in its annual human rights report that the North's human rights record ""remained among the worst in the world"" last year, with public executions, political prison camps, torture and other abuses taking place in the country.

As the oldest of some 630,000 students who took the annual college entrance exam Thursday morning, Jo stood outside the gates of Hongik University Girls’ High School, recounting her journey as youngsters chanted cheers and parents hugged their children in the background.“I want to go to college. As long as there’s still time, I will do as much as I can,” the elderly student of Ilsung Women’s High School told local media. After she was forced to drop out of middle school in 1950 as the war broke out, she said she is finally ready to see her dream come true.Jo’s determination was echoed at some 1,212 venues across the country that hosted the state-commissioned exam, called the Suneung, which is considered the most crucial step for students seeking to enter college. Students get a last-minute read before the college entrance exam at a school in Seoul on Thursday. ( Park Hyun-koo/The Korea Herald)The key subjects for the exam are math, Korean language ― of which students can choose between the easier A type and more difficult B type ― and English. Students also choose two subjects related to social studies, history and philosophy while choosing another subject related to a foreign language that is not English. Test-takers are graded on a nine-level curved scale.As the test is held only once a year, authorities usually take extensive measures to make sure that students do not miss the exams, including extra police officers, special traffic control and grounding planes during the English listening section.For Hyun, an 18-year-old student from Seoul, not even a bone fracture from a truck accident was enough to thwart her will to take the crucial exam. On her insistence to take the Suneung, Severance Hospital offered her a VIP room to take the test in while the Seoul education office sent four officials to oversee her exam.She was not the only test taker who overcame obstacles. Seventy-five surviving students from last year’s ferry sinking ― which left 304 dead or missing and the country’s spirit shattered ― also took the Suneung.“You have endured a period which no other high school senior can possibly comprehend. Good luck with the exam. You have worked hard for it,” wrote Yoo Kyung-keun, who lost his daughter in the fatal accident, on his Facebook page. The focal point of this year’s exam was its difficulty. The government’s guidelines of an “easy Suneung,” which was established over concern for rising private education costs, have come under criticism for failing to distinguish each student’s academic competence.In the government-commissioned mock test in September, the last one held nationwide before this year’s exam, students had to get a perfect score to receive the top grade for Korean language A, math B and English. “This year’s Suneung questions were similar in difficulty to the last two mock tests,” said Lee Jun-shik, the head of the Suneung question committee at the Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation, fueling concerns that authorities have failed yet again managing the difficulty levels. The KICE is in charge of making the Suneung questions.Lee stressed that the KICE placed extra effort to prevent errors by adding more members to the committee. Last year, the state-run organization was forced to admit faults in two Suneung questions, in the aftermath of which its former head was pressured to resign. The Education Ministry also launched a reform committee for Suneung.Seoul’s education superintendent Cho Hee-yeon said the Suneung, and the competition-based education it represents, needs to be overhauled. “Suneung is a system that classifies (students) into ratings. The exam should instead offer a way (for students) to prove what he or she has learned in various methods,” he said while visiting Yongsan High School in central Seoul to cheer on the test-takers.The KICE will take complaints on Suneung questions until 6:00 p.m. Monday on its website, and the results will be reflected on the final answers for the Suneung that will be posted on Nov. 23. The applicants will be notified of their scores on Dec. 2.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","annual college entrance exam ,girls high school recounting ,college entrance exam thursday ,annual college entrance ,the annual college entrance","['Jo Myeong - ja', 'Jo', 'Hongik University']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34434325  0.19462347

27,27,"630,000 students take college entrance exam","More than 630,000 high school seniors and graduates in South Korea took the state-administered annual college entrance exam Thursday, as the government implemented various traffic control and anti-noise measures near nationwide testing sites.A total of 631,187 students, down about 10,000 from last year, registered to take the standardized College Scholastic Ability Test that was administrated at 1,212 testing sites, ...","More than 630,000 high school seniors and graduates in South Korea took the state-administered annual college entrance exam Thursday, as the government implemented various traffic control and anti-noise measures near nationwide testing sites.A total of 631,187 students, down about 10,000 from last year, registered to take the standardized College Scholastic Ability Test that was administrated at 1,212 testing sites, according to Ministry of Education.The exam, which is similar to the American Scholastic Aptitude Test, is considered the most crucial test of students' academic careers and seen as the deciding factor in their choice of college and future professions.The exam, which consists mostly of multiple-choice questions, is divided into five sections -- Korean language, mathematics, English, social and natural sciences, and a second foreign language. The test started at 8:40 a.m. and was to run through 5 p.m., including lunch and breaks, the ministry said.As in previous years, the government imposed various traffic control and anti-noise measures as part of efforts to ensure that the significant test was executed without any glitches.Buses and subway trains extended their rush hour services by two hours to help all exam-takers arrive at the test sites on time, the ministry said. The stock markets opened for trade one hour late, while government offices and enterprises in nearby areas also opened an hour later than usual to keep the roads clear for students on their way to the test centers, it said. Police operated a temporary call center for students in need of a ride offering to transport them to the test centers by patrol car or on the back of a motorcycle.Test applicants were banned from having electronic devices, including mobile phones, digital cameras, MP3 players, electronic calculators and smart watches, at their desks on concerns they might be used to cheat, the ministry said. Second-year high school students gathered in front of testing sites in the pre-dawn hours to lend support to seniors taking the tests, waving placards reading ""Jackpot!"" and ""Strength for You!""""I arrived here at around 11 p.m. yesterday to get a good spot for cheering,"" said 17-year-old high school student Lee Seng-geun, singing a song for seniors with dozens of his friends.Parents were seen waiting outside test centers or praying in Buddhist temples. ""I packed my daughter's favorite lunch,"" a 48-year-old mother of a test taker in Seoul said, adding that she will visit a temple later in the day to pray for her daughter. Right after the beginning of the test, the government said it made the questions easier or similar to the previous year.""This year's exam was similar to last year's,"" said Lee Jun-sik, head of the test development committee and a Chinese language and literature professor at Seoul's Sungkyunkwan University.The education ministry will announce the answers to the questions on Nov. 23, and the applicants will be individually notified of their test results by Dec. 2.

(KIC), Ahn Hong-chul's resignation was accepted by President Park Geun-hye.""He unexpectedly tendered his resignation in the morning, citing personal reasons for his decision to step down,"" the ministry said, without elaborating.Ahn is reigning despite still having a year remaining in his three-year term that ends on December 2016.Ahn has been a contentious appointment from the outset, as he has been a vocal critic of the opposition party when he was an aide to the incumbent president in the runup to the 2012 election. Even after his appointment, the KIC chairman drew flak for making controversial deals. Ahn, in particular, drew criticism for his decision to invest more than 400 billion won (US$351.6 million) of the KIC's money into the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team that some critics argued may lead to considerable losses down the line. Besides the opposition party, which called on the Board of Audit and Inspection (BAI) to start an investigation in the first place, some members of the ruling Saenuri Party have been asking for his dismissal.Related to the resignation, the finance ministry said that since he has stepped down, the BAI will halt its three-monthlong probe.The ministry said a steering committee of eight people will be set up to pick an eligible person to manage the sovereign fund. A candidate will be selected among those that have submitted applications. The final appointment will be made by the president following the endorsement of the finance minister.

Some will be personally invited by the NIKH and others will submit their applications at the HIKH homepage from Wednesday to Monday. “The focal point of the textbook dispute was related to modern and contemporary history. ... We will invite legal and military experts as well to provide a multidimensional view of history,” Kim said. According to the provisional plans, there will be 36 authors led by six main authors who will head each part of Korean history; prehistoric times, ancient history, unified Korean kingdoms of the Goryeo Dynasty (918-1392), Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910), modern Korea and contemporary Korea. Accompanying Kim at the briefing was Shin Hyong-sik, a professor emeritus of Ewha Womans University and an expert in Korea’s ancient history, who will lead the ancient history section. “I felt that the current textbooks have many problems. I took the job because I felt fact-based and clear content (in the new textbook) would allow people to approach history more easily,” Shin said. The other confirmed main author was Choi Mong-lyong, an anthropologist and professor emeritus at Seoul National University. Choi was slated to attend the briefing, but was not present because his students were concerned about his “safety” due to unspecified reasons. The remaining details will be set by the end of the month. The writing and screening process will continue from December to November 2016, and the books will be tested by educators in the field in December 2016. They will be printed and distributed in 2017.Despite Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea’s pledge that everything related to textbook publication would be transparent and fully disclosed at Wednesday’s briefing, many aspects were left unanswered.The NIKH was vague on whether or not it would reveal the names of all the authors.“We should let the authors feel relaxed (while working), at least until the copies are finished,” said Kim, indicating it was possible that the authors’ names would not be revealed at all until the publication was nearly complete.“It is possible that disclosing their identities will hinder their work,” said Jin Jae-gwan, the head of the NIKH’s division of history compilation. Hwang had also vowed to place more emphasis on ancient history, but Jin said that it was “not appropriate to discuss the content beforehand,” and said that sensitive topics would be discussed with the authors. The state-run body was also unclear on how it would address the parts that government leaders had pinpointed as “biased,” such as descriptions of North Korea and the communist state’s 2010 torpedo attack on the South Korean warship Cheonan. Jin said the concerns raised by the government “will be reflected” and it will invite “the best experts” and conduct a screening process via several committees within the organization. While NIKH head Kim vowed to exclude the far-right or far-left individuals as authors, the organization did not elaborate on how to distinguish which scholars fell into those categories.“This is a difficult question. ... It is something we have to consider after the authors are confirmed,” said Jin. By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","government on wednesday revealed ,state issued history textbooks ,authors for state textbooks ,the government on wednesday ,history textbooks for middle","['National Institute of korean History', 'Educati']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3665407   0.86197078

But he must go through a National Assembly hearing before he can take over the post. “Kim has gained insight and experience in the prosecution by leading probes into large-scale corruption cases,” Cheong Wae Dae spokesperson Jeong Yeon-guk said of the reason for Kim’s appointment in a news briefing. “As Kim has a firm belief in the rule of law and constitutionalism, we believe he is the right person to correct our society’s unproductive, deeply-rooted evils,” he added.  Kim Soo-nam (Yonhap)Kim, a graduate of Seoul National University’s law school, has held various positions in the prosecution and the Justice Ministry after he passed the bar exam in 1984 and began his career as a judge in 1987. He moved to Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office in 1990.He is known for leading the investigation into former left-wing lawmaker Lee Seok-ki in 2013, when prosecutors arrested him for plotting an armed revolt to overthrow the Seoul government in case of the outbreak of the inter-Korean war. The politically-sensitive probe, however, created a stir, with pro-democracy activists accusing the prosecution of leaning towards the conservative Park administration.Some civic organizations expressed their objection to the appointment, citing his background. They argued that Kim had “abused” the prosecutorial authority to silence the criticism of the government.“The top prosecutor’s position should go to someone who is willing to be independent from the politics, so Kim is not the right person for the post,” the lawyers’ group Lawyers for a Democratic Society said in a press release. Kim was born in the so-called “TK” region, referring to Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province, a stronghold of President Park. He went to the same high school in Daegu as Kang Shin-myeong, the head of the National Police Agency.“I feel a great responsibility to be nominated as prosecutor general at a time when the public has great interest in and expectations of the prosecution. I will calmly and humbly prepare for the confirmation hearing,” Kim said after his appointment. The confirmation hearing is scheduled sometime in the middle of next month, government officials said. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","new top prosecutor president ,next prosecutor general friday ,friday the presidential office ,names new top prosecutor ,the next prosecutor general","['Park Geun', 'Kim Soo - nam', 'the Supreme Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Kim', 'Kim Jin - tae', 'National Assembly', 'Kim']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.96477878  0.61853296

General Assembly adopted a landmark resolution that calls for the U.N. Security Council to refer North's human rights abuses to the ICC. The resolution led to the Security Council adopting the issue as an official agenda item for the first time.The new proposed resolution, which has been drafted jointly by South Korea, the United States, the European Union and Japan since early this month, was submitted to the Third Committee of the U.N. General Assembly on the eve of the deadline for new resolutions, the source said.The draft was not made public but includes the ICC referral part just like last year's resolution, sources said.The new resolution is also expected to include calls for punishing those responsible for human rights violations and resolving abductions and kidnappings, while voicing concerns about torture, public executions and other types of human rights abuses in the North, according to the sources.It is also expected to include a sentence welcoming the Security Council's adoption of the issue as an official agenda item while calling for the council to hold discussions on it.The move to adopt a new resolution is expected to anger North Korea.But chances are not high for the Security Council to actually refer the issue to the ICC because China and Russia, which have friendlier ties with North Korea than any other countries, are expected to veto such a move. Still the resolution played a great role in drawing international attention to the issue.North Korea has long been labeled one of the worst human rights violators. The communist regime does not tolerate dissent, holds hundreds of thousands of people in political prison camps and keeps tight control over outside information.But the North has bristled at such criticism, calling it a U.S.-led attempt to topple its regime.In June, the State Department said in its annual human rights report that the North's human rights record ""remained among the worst in the world"" last year, with public executions, political prison camps, torture and other abuses taking place in the country.

Directly under the wing of DAPA Minister Chang Myoung-jin, the inspector will be in charge of looking into whether DAPA's transactions present any legal problems, according to the statement.  The size of the current auditing body under DAPA will be doubled as part of the scrutiny enhancement efforts. The interim plan also includes toughened punishments on corrupt contractors, with those involved in corruption to be banned from government-led biddings for up to two years, which is longer than the current six-month ban.""The plan announced this time will start to be implemented next year in the initial stage of countermeasures,"" a government official said of the Thursday announcement. Further measures will be taken after the government probe team comes up with its final results, the official said. Earlier this year, former Navy Chief of Staff Jung Ok-keun was sentenced to 10 years in prison for taking 770 million won ($673,000) from the shipbuilding STX Group in return for helping the group's affiliate win deals to build the Navy's guided missile patrol gun boat and convoy vessel. Another former naval chief, Hwang Ki-chul, was also charged in a similar corruption case, but a local court cleared him of the charge earlier in the month. Amid a host of corrupt defense acquisition cases, President Park Geun-hye has declared a no-tolerance policy on such misdeeds.

In order to put the bill to a vote at a plenary session, the bill has to be approved by related subparliamentary committees.The bill, however, is expected to face a tough road ahead with the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy vowing an all-out war against Park’s plan to issue textbooks written by state-designated writers, including a plan to boycott a proposed talk with the ruling Saenuri Party to resolve pending issues. The NPAD also plans to hold outdoor rallies against Park’s state-authored textbook drive.The plan itself does not require the legislature’s approval. But the government must seek parliamentary endorsement to spend taxpayers’ money to implement the plan. The government has already allocated 4.4 billion won of reserve funds toward the estimated cost of 10 billion won to publish the controversial textbooks. The NPAD, however, has already pledged to disapprove the plan and also plans to request the government to cut the annual budget of the National History Compilation Committee, in an apparent tit for tat.Rival parties are also expected to lock horns over the special allowance allocated to the spy agency, with the NPAD threatening to cut the budget on the National Intelligence Service and instead increase the welfare budget. The NPAD has been demanding imposing stricter monitoring on the government’s spending on special activities, including the money spent by the NIS. The ruling Saenuri Party has been rejecting the demand, citing confidentiality concerns of the spy agency’s activities.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","monday foreshadowing fierce battle ,budget kicked off monday ,next year budget parliamentary ,year government budget kicked ,off monday foreshadowing fierce","['Seoul', 'Washington', 'the National Assembly ’s']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41797975  0.16426037

Defense Minister Han Min-koo speaks during a parliamentary session on Monday. (Yonhap)As the reform measures under the act include a plan to decrease the active-duty troop level to 522,000 from the current 633,000 by 2022, the revision has given more time for the Defense Ministry to complete the troop reduction.But the ministry claims that its original plan for the troop drawdown remains unchanged, as criticism surged that the ministry has changed its long-term reform plans too frequently because it has set “unrealistic” goals.A ministry official said that the revision was made as other reform measures are unlikely to be completed by the previous target year of 2020. “The revision came as it would be difficult to complete all the other reform measures by 2020 as stipulated in the act,” the official told The Korea Herald on condition of anonymity. “But the troop reduction plan will remain intact. In fact, given the demographic changes, maintaining even 522,000 troops by 2022 will be difficult.”The South’s troop reduction plan, which is being pushed due to the country’s demographic challenges and technological advancements, has triggered concerns that it could weaken readiness to cope with North Korea’s evolving military threats. The U.S.’ ongoing moves to scale down its ground force have also added to the concerns, as they raised the possibility that Washington might not be able to send sufficient ground troops to the peninsula in case of a contingency.After the end of ground warfare in Afghanistan and Iraq, the U.S. Army has been reducing its forces. It plans to reduce the number to 450,000 from 490,000 by 2017. It is also reportedly considering reducing the figure to 420,000 by 2019. “Currently, the U.S.’ way of conducting military operations overseas is that it minimizes the use of ground forces while bolstering the roles of the air force and navy,” said Park Won-gon, security expert at Handong Global University.“That means the role of South Korea’s ground forces will increase in the event of a conflict.”Maintaining the adequate level of ground forces are crucial not only for combat missions, but also to cope with the possible collapse of the regime in Pyongyang and postwar stabilization operations, experts said, noting Washington might want Seoul to strengthen its group troops.According to a report by the U.S.-based think tank RAND Corp., the U.S. might need at least 150,000 American troops from outside the Asia-Pacific region, in addition to 38,000 troops already in the region including Korea and Japan, to eliminate weapons of mass destruction in the North in case of a contingency.For other military operations, there should be more ground forces, analysts said.“The (RAND) report is trying to explain minimum U.S. ground force requirements. It recognizes that some U.S. security experts feel that Korea ought to do more to provide for Korea’s own defense and objectives (for example unification),” Bruce Bennett, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corp., told The Korea Herald.“But U.S. interests in Korea must look at the elimination of the North Korean WMD threat because WMD that gets to third parties will likely be targeted at the U.S., and because within a few years North Korea may have an ICBM that could be fired at the United States.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","meeting tuesday defense minister ,at cabinet meeting tuesday ,cabinet meeting tuesday defense ,cabinet meeting tuesday ,meeting tuesday defense","['South Korea ’s', 'Cabinet', 'Han Min - koo', 'Yonhap)As']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.19918352  0.23401643

I feel very gloomy,” said NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in after returning from the talks. President Park Geun-hye greets Saenuri Party leader Kim Moo-sung (left) and New Politics Alliance for Democracy leader Moon Jae-in at Cheong Wa Dae on Thursday. YonhapMoon said that the president remained steadfast to the notion that most of the textbook authors and historians were leftists and that they were denying the legitimacy of South Korea and should be ashamed of it.“All in all, I really don’t know why she even called for this meeting,” Moon added.Also attending were Saenuri Party leader Kim Moo-sung, floor leader Won Yoo-chul and NPAD floor leader Lee Jong-kul.Floor leaders of the two parties separately explained later that the participants, mainly Kim and Moon, had heated arguments over the textbook issue, and that Park offered her view from time to time.They said Park mostly agreed to what Kim had to say and said, “We should not be teaching (our children) defeatism. (The plan) is to get this right.” Park reportedly said the plan was aimed at ensuring the “correct” recognition of Korean history for future generations. She also expressed regret over the opposition leader’s allegations that her efforts had become increasingly politicized.“For national unity, we need a correct and proud history textbook,” Park was quoted as saying by her senior press secretary Kim Sung-woo. The opposition party has been adamantly opposing her drive to issue the state-designated history textbooks that could be used to whitewash pro-Japan activities during the colonial era and the military dictatorships decades ago.The Park administration, meanwhile, has been pushing for the plan, stressing the need to provide a balanced view of history through a single set of history books authored by government-designated writers.Ruling party chairman Kim, for his part, supported Park, asserting that the claims of the planned textbooks’ bias were “nonsense.” He also said that the history textbook issue had to be handled by historians and experts and urged the opposition leadership to focus on the swift passage of bills aimed at reviving the economy.Although there was little hope that the rival camps would reach a political breakthrough, the five-way talks ending with no agreement and is likely to further aggravate the political and ideological standoff as the country heads toward the general elections next year.At the meeting, Park relayed the diplomatic achievements made during her trip to Washington last week and called for bipartisan support on her labor reforms and economic-related bills, saying they were crucial for revitalizing the nation’s sluggish economy. The president also requested the party leaders to ratify Korea’s free trade agreements with China, Vietnam and New Zealand as soon as possible, and focus on creating jobs for the youth.Moon, meanwhile, asked Park to push ahead with an inter-Korean summit and a dialogue between Pyongyang and Washington. He expressed concerns over a failed transfer of U.S. fighter technology, saying that a parliamentary probe should be launched. Lee, at his side, said that an audit was needed along with a reprimand of those responsible.Moon also urged Park to clarify her position on recent remarks by Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn that South Korea could permit the entry of Japan’s self-defense forces to the Korean Peninsula. “The prime minister’s remarks are highly inappropriate and also trample on our people’s pride,” he said. “I want the president to make it clear that it is impossible to have Japanese troops in our country under any circumstances.”In response, Park reportedly said that what Hwang believed was irrelevant to what she was thinking, according to Rep. Lee.Prospects of progress was bleak even before they met in the afternoon as Cheong Wa Dae and NPAD locked horns over the format and the scope of the meeting. The opposition party insisted on having its spokesman attend the meeting to record the entire conversation between the leaders, while the presidential office wanted to keep the gathering confidential, stressing the president wanted to have in-depth, heart-to-heart talks.The NPAD pushed Cheong Wa Dae to accept its request by threatening to call off the meeting, but later yielded, blasting the office for being stingy with its request.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","clash over history textbooks ,controversial state authored textbooks ,park moon clash over ,frustration after the meeting ,thursday expressing frustration after",['the New Politics Alliance for Democracy'],8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33872333  0.32484841

(Yonhap)But critics have raised suspicion over the effectiveness of centralized history education. Former Vice Minister of Education Kim Jae-choon ― who was one of the henchmen for Park’s contentious policy ― had claimed in a research paper six years ago that state history textbooks are “a system only used in underdeveloped or dictatorial states.” He was sacked earlier this week, after opponents of the state textbook launched a myriad of attacks over his apparent flip-flop.Reports suggest state-prepared textbooks have been subject to negative perceptions in countries like Turkey. According to a 2011 article by Hurriyet Daily News, an English daily in Turkey, Turkish textbooks have been frequently been subject to criticism over “Sexism, discriminatory attitudes and a lack of objectivity.”Citing local scholars including Kenan Cayir, a sociology professor at Istanbul Bilgi University, the article pointed out that nationalistic attitudes and stereotypical descriptions had been common in the textbooks, although their appearance had been less frequent over the years. Some of the cited examples were “fearless Turk,” “enemy Greek” and “housewife mother.”The daily mentioned an excerpt from a 2007 literature textbook, which said: “Although the Turkish nation established great civilizations and served humanity in many ways, in the last centuries it fell behind the West due to some social and political reasons, which were not its fault.”Similar to criticism that Korean education is often subject to, the daily also said that Turkish education has been under fire for focusing on rote memorization.Citing Athens historian Anna Frangoudaki, Hurriyet Daily News also pointed out that most of the history topics in the Greek textbook ― another of Hwang’s examples of countries using state textbook ― are “ethnocentric.”South Korea’s push to centralize education by emphasizing a “unified version of history that can end social conflicts,” has also been likened to Russia’s move following its leader Vladimir Putin’s instructions to historians to produce a “unified history” that is free from internal contradictions and ambiguities. Reports from various news sources, including Reuters, said the government guidelines contained no criticism of the president, any reference of movements against him in 2011 and 2012 or mention of his political foes.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","local university chiefs tuesday ,secondary education history textbooks ,textbook feud debates global ,history textbooks from local ,education history textbooks from","['Hwang Woo - yea', 'Turkey', 'Greece', 'Park Geun - hye']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45625901  0.87580985

The meeting also included floor leaders from the rival parties.The presidential office said before the meeting that Park plans to ask for cooperation from the opposition party on next year's budget and a set of bills to improve people's livelihoods.Park also plans to ask the parliament to quickly ratify a free trade deal inked between South Korea and China in June. The deal has also yet to be ratified by the Chinese legislature.It remains unclear how Moon reacted to Park's planned request for cooperation due to the dispute over history textbooks.The opposition party has voiced its opposition to the government's plan to reintroduce state history textbooks for secondary school students to address what it calls the predominantly left-leaning contents in current books.Park has called for a ""correct"" recognition of history, noting history education should never divide the people and students over political strife or ideological confrontation.The Ministry of Education said earlier this month history textbooks for middle and high school students will be authored by the government starting in the 2017 school year.Currently, history textbooks are published by eight private publishing companies after being approved by an independent textbook review committee of experts. Schools choose from any of the eight textbooks, while primary schools have a single set of state-authored history textbooks.

Park and leaderships from the ruling Saenuri Party and the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy will hold a meeting Thursday to discuss pending issues, including the controversial adoption of the state textbooks that the NPAD had criticized as biased. Attending the meeting will be Saenuri Party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung and NPAD chairman Moon Jae-in along with both parties’ whips, Rep. Won Yoo-chul of the Saenuri Party and Rep. Lee Jong-kul of the NPAD. The meeting will also cover the government’s policy to overhaul the labor market and business sectors, and inter-Korean relations. “Chairman Moon and floor leader Lee will meet with President Park and the Saenuri Party leadership to have a broad discussion over the issues that are related to the government management. Particularly, the meeting will be an in-depth discussion over textbooks, the economy, inter-Korea relations and labor reform,” said the NPAD spokesperson Kim Sung-soo. South Korea`s President Park Geun-hye. YonhapThe agreement came after Cheong Wa Dae and the NPAD disagreed over the size and nature of the meeting — reportedly proposed Monday by Hyun Ki-hwan, senior presidential secretary, during his meeting with leaders of the rival parties. The NPAD agreed to the presidential office’s proposal to include both parties’ leaders and their whips to focus on labor reforms and the passage of economic-related bills, an issue that Park had urged lawmakers to take on and sign into law. The NPAD had demanded a more concise setup — of Park, the ruling Saenuri Party Rep. Kim Moo-sung and Rep. NPAD leader Moon Jae-in — to address the president about her attempt to adopt state-authored textbooks. In response to the NPAD’s request, Cheong Wa Dae reiterated its version of the meeting.Meeting with the chairmen of major parties has been customary protocol for the president upon returning from overseas trips. Park returned from her U.S. visit on Sunday.Park has often used the occasions to navigate through political impasses. In 2013, Park held her first meeting with the major party leaders as president when she was embroiled in an election scandal following allegations that the former National Intelligence Service chief ordered his staff to smear Moon, then her liberal opponent, as a North Korean sympathizer during her campaign.Most recently, she invited Kim and Moon to the presidential office this March after Moon took over as NPAD chairman. Then, there were allegation that her close aide illegally interfered with the presidential office’s decision-making process. The ruling Saenuri Party, for its part, criticized the NPAD’s demand for a three-way meeting, saying that the NPAD might divert the people’s attentions away from important economic issues and use the forum for political bickering. “Currently, the controversy over the textbooks is so intense. I am afraid the (trilateral) meeting would be more about partisan standoff, not improving the people’s livelihoods,” said Saenuri Party whip Rep. Won Yoo-chul. Meanwhile, rival parties on Tuesday also agreed to hold a meeting between their leaders after the Saenuri Party’s request earlier in the day that the two sides find ways to resolve the political deadlock that it claimed was preventing the lawmakers from dealing with pressing issues such as the passage of pending bills. The Saenuri Party has been skeptical of the meeting out of concern that the NPAD, consumed with textbook issues, would use the forum for their political attacks. NPAD whip Rep. Lee Jong-kul had requested a similar bilateral meeting the day before. “Regardless of the agenda and format, we are more than willing to accept any proposal to bring the National Assembly back on track and improve the people’s livelihood,” said Rep. Lee Choon-Suak, the NPAD vice floor leader.  By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","thursday to discuss controversial ,discuss controversial history textbooks ,meet thursday to discuss ,controversial history textbooks president ,leaders to meet thursday","['Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4013128   0.69450682

The meeting will take place between Han Min-koo and his Japanese counterpart Gen Nakatani on the sidelines of the Seoul International Aerospace and Defense Exhibition, which is scheduled to kick off that day at Seoul Airport in Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province. Nakatani is expected to attend a welcome dinner for the six-day fair later in the day and return home Thursday. They are predicted to assess North Korea’s evolving nuclear and missile threats and other regional and bilateral issues, including Tokyo’s envisioned exercise of its right to collective self-defense in the wake of its recent upturn of the pacifist constitution. “During the talks, the ministers will discuss the regional security situation, each country’s defense policy and bilateral exchanges and cooperation and other issues of mutual interest, while holding a briefing and consultations over Japan’s security law that passed its parliament last month,” the ministry said in a statement.Nakatani’s three-day trip came as Seoul unstiffens its line against the Shinzo Abe administration despite its revisionist drive and move to reinforce three-way security cooperation involving the U.S. President Park Geun-hye, who is visiting Washington this week, also signaled her willingness for a one-on-one meeting with the Japanese prime minister when they gather here next month for a trilateral summit with China.Early this month, Tokyo’s Parliamentary Vice Defense Minister Kenji Harada came to Seoul chiefly for the Military World Games in Mungyeong, North Gyeongsang Province, and conferred on his minister’s visit with officials here.

Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea (left) speaks during a parliamentary audit of his ministry on Thursday. (Yonhap)But the ruling Saenuri Party countered that the state textbook was essential to ensure unity of the people.NPAD Rep. Bae Jae-jung accused President Park of conducting a “historical coup” just as her father rose to power through a military coup.The comment sparked an exchange of incendiary remarks among lawmakers during the audit. Rep. Rhee Chong-hoon demanded that the parliament’s education committee chair Park Joo-sun ban comments unrelated to the audit. Saenuri Rep. Han Sun-kyo argued that the NPAD’s attacks were politically motivated.“Some say state textbooks destroy variety and force a monolithic point of view on history. But a closer look at our education shows that variety and creativity face bigger threats under the current system,” he said during a party meeting before the audit.Saenuri Party leader Kim had said that the textbooks were self-depreciative about Korean history and that the private publication system could not work because “90 percent of historians are leftists.”Both the Education Ministry and Saenuri Party have criticized current history textbooks for excessive errors and ideological bias, even saying some parts “looked like a North Korean textbook.” Minister Hwang Woo-yea remained mum on his stance over the state history textbooks and reiterated that the ministry would announce its plans “soon after” the parliamentary audit wraps up. Prior to the audit, the ministry submitted two possible options for history textbook publication. Option one is having the state-run National Institute of Korean History author the textbooks under commission run by the ministry. The second option is to retain the current private-authoring of textbooks but reinforcing the authorization process.If the ministry decides on the former, the changes will be applied in 2017. If the government goes with option No. 2, it will be applied in 2018.The ministry is expected to unveil its decision next week. By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","history textbook rival parties ,state history textbook rival ,state published history textbooks ,history textbook rival ,education ministry on thursday","['the Education Ministry', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.75988603  0.45016178

The ministry has mulled whether or not to bestow itself with exclusive rights to publish history textbooks, which has caused rifts in the National Assembly and in education circles. Korea currently allows local publishers to author the textbooks for secondary education, which are certified by the government for public use.A ministry official said the announcement will be made after the parliamentary audit on government organizations wraps up this week, but claimed the ministry is still undecided on the matter.But sources say the government and ruling Saenuri Party are set on bringing back state textbooks ― first implemented in 1974 and then revoked in 2002.Cheong Wa Dae supported such speculation by saying earlier Wednesday: “There is no change in position that the history textbook with a balanced view should be developed,” reminding the press of President Park Geun-hye’s past comments. Park said last year that textbooks in use contained factual errors and ideological bias, and that they should be fixed.The opposition claims that reinstating the system will result in the textbooks being influenced by whoever is in power. Professors from universities across the country ― most recently Hanyang University and Kyung Hee University ― have released statements opposing the state history textbooks.Those who oppose the state textbooks raise concerns that the government may whitewash flaws of controversial figures including Park’s father, former President Park Chung-hee, who is criticized for his dictatorial rule that spanned over two decades.But the proponents of the state history textbooks claim that many of the authors for privately published textbooks are biased in favor of the leftists. Although the ministry has not commented while rival parties exchanged blows, it said in a briefing last week that the textbooks should not be used to express one’s ideological views.“Many citizens are expressing concerns that textbooks, which should unify the people and foster a balanced view of history, are being used as tools for ideological disputes,” a ministry official said, adding that the appeal was “incomprehensible.” The message came as the ministry criticized the authors of high school textbooks for appealing a court order to revise sections of books that were deemed biased and incorrect. The ministry even said that some parts looked like a “North Korean textbook” ― attacking the rival party ― reiterating its claims that the current textbooks are filled with lopsided views and errors. The unusually strong words were widely perceived as a signal of the government’s determination to change the publication system.The ministry’s fierce criticism of the privately published history textbooks was echoed by the Saenuri Party in the National Assembly on Thursday, which labeled them as “antistate” and “leftist.”“It appears that (the textbooks) are biased with leftist viewpoints. ... Even if North Korea is a dictatorial, failed state, the textbooks depict it like it is a normally operated country,” said Saenuri leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung at his party’s Supreme Council meeting.But Rep. Moon Jae-in, leader of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, said that reviving state history textbooks would “turn back the clock to the era of dictatorship.”“Both the government and Saenuri Party should drop their attempts to tame and control the historical views of the people. Hiding and glorifying will not alter the facts,” he said at an NPAD Supreme Council meeting.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","textbooks due next week ,history textbooks due next ,education ministry said wednesday ,next week the education ,next week its decision",['the Education Ministry'],8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3497031   0.68471056

They are threatening the state universities by saying they will not provide financial subsidies,” student bodies of 15 universities said in their statement.There has been dispute among the education circles over how a college head should be elected. The now-nearly extinct direct voting system lets professors select the president, while the ministry-encouraged indirect system runs through an election committee ― a randomly-selected committee of students, teaching assistants, faculty and other employees of the university. Graffiti that says, “Abolish the direct election system (of university president)” is scribbled on a placard supporting the direct voting system at the Pusan National University campus Thursday. (Yonhap)Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea said in last month’s parliamentary audit that he would review the pros and cons of both systems, although he stopped short of giving a definitive answer.The focal point of the controversy is whether or not the ministry’s pressure to abolish the direct system intrudes upon universities’ autonomy, and which of the two systems is more effective.It was former President Lee Myung-bak who set the wheels in motion in 2010 with his plan to “advance the operations of state universities,” which included abolishing the direct election system. The Lee administration pointed out that direct election sparked numerous side effects, such as overheated campaigning that leads to excessive pledges and factions on the campus. The Park administration subsequently announced that national universities that do not adopt the indirect system would be penalized in the “University for Creative Korea” government funding, or the CK program.Too much government intervention?South Korea grants partial autonomy for higher education institutes. While the general operations of respective universities ― including personnel decisions ― are left to respective institutes, the government sets the overall agenda for the admission process while stepping in for cases like banning sex offenders from teaching at universities.While the school boards of private universities choose the method to use for the election of the president, state-run universities are more vulnerable to the ministry’s influence as the appointment has to be confirmed by President Park Geun-hye. Even private universities are not free from governmental influence, as refusing to follow government decisions can deprive them of state subsidies, which account for a significant portion of the schools’ budgets.Proponents of the direct election system says “coercing” national universities to follow the ministry’s measure by threatening to cut support violates their autonomy.Rep. Bae Jae-jeung of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy accused the ministry of “taming the universities” with threats of subsidy cuts. She also bashed the ministry for saying that it could pull some of the Creative Korea funds paid to Pusan National University, which recently decided to switch back to the direct election system after one of its professors committed suicide in protest of the opposing system.The incident, which occurred in August amid a mass protest by PNU faculty members, uprooted the university’s original decision to abolish direct voting.A survey by Rep. Cho Jeong-sik of the NPAD showed that many of state-run universities’ chiefs opposed linking the voting system to government subsidies.“Penalizing the universities in government programs unless they follow the ministry’s guidelines is inadvisable. If there are problems during the university-selected election process, then the government should penalize them,” said PNU chief Kim.Choi Sung-eul, head of Incheon National University, also said it is ideal to let universities choose the voting system based on their respective circumstances. Pros and cons of the two systemProponents of the indirect election system point out that direct voting has many flaws. “Excessive campaigning led to the candidates making all kinds of pledges, which had side effects such as tuition hikes, factionalism and hindering the colleges’ long-term plans. The nepotism that resulted has also led to inefficient personnel decisions,” said an official from the Education Ministry.In addition, there has been criticism that the “direct” election only applies to professors and not regular employees or students. Despite its flaws, however, opponents of the indirect system say that it is not an appropriate alternative. Jeong, Yong-gil, a professor of Chungnam National University, took issue with the random selection process of the committee. In his recent column, he pointed out that the lottery-type selection process is completely based on chance, meaning a newly appointed faculty member who knows very little about the school can be a member.“In order for an election to work, the voter has to have sufficient information about the candidates. The indirect system eliminates the possibility of an informed choice because it is based on luck,” he said. Jeong claimed that the ministry’s insistence on the indirect system is just an excuse to tighten the grasp around the universities, pointing out that the ministry has refused to approve the elected presidents for Kyungpook National University, Kongju National University and Korea National Open University, who were selected via an indirect voting system.These universities are currently locked in legal battles with the ministry, which have shown mixed results. Seoul High Court ruled in favor of the ministry for the KNOU case, while the appellate court for the KNU case ruled against it. Seoul Administrative Court in August ruled in favor of the university, leaving the burden on the Supreme Court.Jeong’s CNU is expected to hold a vote on its presidential election system later this week. Regardless of whether or not the Education Ministry is guilty of attempting to become a “Big Brother,” the university president’s selection process is likely to continue to rattle education circles.Rep. Shin Sung-bum of the ruling Saenuri Pary said while there have been many side effects of the direct election system, he is unsure which is better. Cheonnam National University president Jee Byung-moon said although the ministry is pushing to abolish the direct voting system, he is “skeptical” that indirect elections are an ideal appropriate alternative. “We need to work on creating a system that can assure both the universities’ autonomy and a fair selection process,” he said.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","protests erupt over college ,president ballots last friday ,over college president ballots ,college president ballots last ,erupt over college president","['South Korea', 'the Education Ministry ’s']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53327167  0.17950878

Now comes the tough part: Drumming up support and money to achieve the goals and transform the world.Pope Francis gave his backing to the new development agenda in an address to the U.N. General Assembly before the summit to adopt the 17-point plan opened, calling it ""an important sign of hope"" at a very troubled time in the Middle East and Africa. When General Assembly President Mogens Lykketoft struck his gavel to approve the development road map, leaders and diplomats from the 193 U.N. member states stood and applauded loudly.Then, the summit immediately turned to the real business of the three-day meeting -- implementation of the goals, which is expected to cost $3.5 trillion to $5 trillion every year until 2030.U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon set the stage, saying the agenda ""embodies the aspirations of people everywhere for lives of peace, security and dignity on a healthy planet."" The goals ""are a to-do list for people and planet, and a blueprint for success,"" Ban said.  The document, titled ""Transforming our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,"" not only outlines 17 broad goals but sets 169 specific targets. The non-binding goals succeed the eight Millennium Development Goals adopted by world leaders 15 years ago. Only one of those has been achieved: halving the number of people living in extreme poverty, due primarily to economic growth in China. At least one other is close -- cutting in half the proportion of people without access to clean water -- and there are still three months until the goals expire.The new goals include ensuring ""healthy lives"" and quality education for all, clean water, sanitation and reliable modern energy, as well as making cities safe, reducing inequality within and among countries, and promoting economic growth and good governance. Critics say they are too broad, lack accountability and will lead to disenchantment among those most in need of hope.Supporters say there is no choice but to go big in a world of expanding population, growing inequality, dwindling resources and the existential threat from global warming. They note that while the millennium goals were developed by then secretary-general Kofi Annan and his staff, the new goals are the result of years of negotiations by all 193 member states, which means they should all have a stake in their achievement.Sweden announced that a group of nine leaders from different regions will work to ensure implementation of the goals. It includes German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the presidents of Brazil, Colombia, Liberia, South Africa, Tanzania and Tunisia and the prime ministers of Sweden and East Timor.  Speaker after speaker pointed to the spread of extremist groups as barriers to development, perhaps none more eloquently than Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousefzai, who was shot in the head by the Taliban in Pakistan in 2012 for campaigning for girls' education.Standing in the assembly chamber's balcony surrounded by 193 young people representing every country, Malala told the leaders: ""The future generation is raising their voice."" Each teen held a lantern, which she said symbolized their hope that the new global goals will be achieved.Millions of children are suffering from ""terrorism, displacement and denial of education,"" Malala said, noting the heartbreaking photo of 3-year-old Syrian refugee Aylan Kurdi lying drowned on a Turkish sea shore and the tearful parents of girls abducted from their school in northern Nigeria by Boko Haram.""Promise peace to all children in Pakistan, in India, in Syria and in every corner of the world,"" Malala implored the leaders.""Promise that every child will have the right to safe, free and quality primary and secondary education,"" she said. ""Education is hope. Education is peace.""Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi said the international community has to deal with global challenges that hinder development --""especially terrorism"" which isn't confined to Arab nations but has spread worldwide.In pursuing development, he said, the Egyptian people are facing ""the most dangerous extremist terrorist ideology.""  Egypt has been fighting an insurgency by Sinai militants allied to the Islamic State group. At the same time, security forces have cracked down on Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamists since the military _ then led by el-Sissi _ ousted President Mohammed Morsi, a senior Brotherhood figure, in 2013 after massive protests against Morsi's rule. Hundreds of Islamists have been killed and thousands arrested.El-Sissi also expressed concern that ""the tools"" to achieve the goals are insufficient, and stressed that richer nations have a responsibility to help poorer ones.Afghan leader Abdullah Abdullah, whose country is one of the world's poorest, urged ""political commitment and revitalized partnership"" to achieve the goals.The head of Amnesty International used his speech to make an impassioned critique of mass surveillance, the arms trade, income inequality and human rights abuses.""You cannot launch these goals and in parallel deny a safe and legal route to refugees, a life with dignity,"" Amnesty's Salil Shetty added.Merkel told fellow leaders there is no quick solution to the migrant crisis that has seen hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war, poverty and persecution flood into Europe and safe havens closer to home.India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi said eliminating poverty is the top priority in his country, which has the world's largest number of people living in extreme poverty.Modi confirmed plans for a fivefold boost in renewable energy but added two years to the time frame, saying it will take seven years instead of five.As for finding the trillions needed to implement the goals, Kenya's U.N. Ambassador Macharia Kamau has insisted it can be done. But Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates said Thursday ""we'd be doing very well to have anywhere near that amount of money available by 2030.""

The passage of the highly contested resolution was a remarkable feat, and living proof that San Francisco has heart. Lee Yong-soo (in hanbok) sits in the San Francisco Board of Supervisors chamber, where a memorial to the “comfort women” was approved unanimously Tuesday.The happiest person in the chamber was Lee Yong-soo, who first broke her silence about her enslavement almost 50 years after the ungodly tortures she experienced at the hands of the imperial Japanese army during WWII. She has been speaking out for the voiceless women ever since, demanding an apology from the Japanese government. She came all the way from Korea to support the San Francisco memorial.Supervisor Eric Mar put it succinctly in a public hearing on Sept. 17: “We are here to honor those who break the silence.” There were those who opposed the memorial, arguing that the memorial would split the Asian community in San Francisco, as well as expose Japanese-Americans to racial harassment. The biggest problem I had was with the deniers, who came to the chambers to discredit Lee, virtually calling her a liar with her sitting right there. They argued that she and all the “comfort women” were prostitutes who were conducting business with the soldiers, not conscripted and kidnapped. Their arguments were pathetic and crass. I can’t imagine what went through Lee’s mind when she heard these speakers one after another. She remained poised throughout until, at one point, she shouted back at one of the deniers, “You were not there!” Supervisor Jane Kim, in seconding Eric Mar’s motion, said that she had grown up hearing about these horrible stories from her parents and that these women were raped 20, 30 times a day. Notwithstanding the inhumane behavior on the part of the deniers, I feel sympathy for those Japanese-Americans who endured the horrors of the internment and concentration camps during WWII. They are victims of racial profiling and their struggle is symptomatic of the racism that is rooted in the American consciousness. They see that the fight against sex slavery would somehow harm them. I totally understand that sentiment. All my life, when Korea did something stupid ― and there were many incidences ― people looked at me as if there was something wrong with me.The San Francisco Board of Supervisors is correct in passing the resolution and to use the memorial for healing and educational purposes. At the same time, they are being sensitive to the victims of racial profiling in America. In voting for the resolution, Supervisor David Campos thanked Lee for bringing her “gift of truth” to San Francisco.At bottom, what moved the people of San Francisco was summed up by a number of leaders from women’s groups, who chorused, “If we let this go without calling it out, we are complicit to the crimes that happened 70 years ago,” noting that violence against women and girls still persists. “This memorial helps break the cycle,” they said. For Lee, 88 years old, her favorite song for her remaining days would be “I Left My Heart in San Francisco.” I look forward to seeing her again in a year, when I hope she will participate in dedicating the memorial. By John H.

Scheduled to return to the Assembly on Oct. 1 after a recess during the Chuseok holiday, lawmakers have faced mounting criticism for engaging more in political bickering than in professional debates over policies.Observers said the lawmakers also failed to address the dysfunctional nature of the audit, despite their initial commitment to overhaul the system.“Despite the fact that the lawmakers have summoned 708 government agencies and 4,175 witnesses, they only indulged in embarrassing those being summoned and yelling at them. Some lawmakers didn’t even ask questions. We gave a D-grade to this year’s superficial audit session,” a nongovernmental organization monitoring the parliamentary audit said in a statement. Lawmakers storm out of a meeting room after they clashed over the witness list for parliamentary probe. YonhapFor example, the chiefs of staff from the Army, Navy and Air Force were summoned Monday to the judiciary committee’s inspection into the military tribunal. These top military commanders received one question each during the four-hour session.  Similar scenes took place during the Trade Industry and Energy Committee. Among the eight governmental agencies that were brought to the stand Monday, only three of the agencies’ chiefs managed to receive questions from lawmakers.  Some lawmakers became targets of public mockery for their questions. Rep. You Dae-woon of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy demanded the nation’s police chief “demonstrate” how to shoot a gun before lawmakers in his questioning about gun accidents. During an audit for the Fair Trade Commission, the nation’s antitrust watchdog, Rep. Park Dae-dong of the Saenuri Party asked Lotte Chairman Shin Dong-bin whether he would root for the Korean team at a soccer match between Korea and Japan. Critics attributed the debacle to lawmakers’ lack of expertise. “I don’t think the lawmakers are as knowledgeable about the state affairs as those working in the government. It is no secret that government officials laugh at the lawmakers’ questions behind the scenes,” said Lee Jung-hee, a political professor at Hankuk University of Foreign StudiesMeanwhile, rival parties were mired in partisanship and blamed each other for the “botched” audit session. The Saenuri Party criticized the NPAD for derailing the session by summoning too many witnesses, while the NPAD accused the Saenuri Party of hampering their efforts to secure witnesses that needed to take the stand.  By Yeo Jun-suk  (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","annual inspection into government ,assembly finished on wednesday ,oct after recess during ,on oct after recess ,holiday lawmakers have faced","['the National Assembly', 'Assembly', 'Chuseok']",8,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.27766219  0.52432531

In a luncheon with representatives of a trilateral panel of the government, labor union and the business representatives, the president thanked them for reaching a landmark deal on labor reform last week, vowing that the government would reflect “the spirit of the grand compromise” demonstrated during the marathon talks. Calling it a difficult task, however, the president raised concerns over the prospect of the labor reform as it faces a bumpy road ahead with the opposition parties remaining reluctant on legislative negotiations with the governing Saenuri Party and a trade union threatening to stage a nationwide walkout.  President Park Geun-hye and representatives of the tripartite panel on labor reform attend a launcheon at Cheong Wa Dae. (Yonhap)“We have reached the beginning of the labor reform after much difficulties, but I believe that the reform process planned ahead will also be very difficult, but important, too,” said Park. “Every reform is a hard task to achieve, but it will be completed only when we all share the pain and the burden we may face in the course of the (reform) process.” Responding to Park’s remarks, Kim Dae-hwan, the chairman of the trilateral committee, said the panel will start a follow-up discussion in early October and launch a separate team to check whether the agreements are fully reflected in the legislation process. The chairman also said he would report the process to the president, citing her “profound interests” in the labor reform. President Park has set labor market reform as the top priority on her policy agenda in the second half of the year, viewing increased market flexibility as key to generating jobs for the young and reviving the slowing economy.In a separate meeting last week, the government, the ruling party and the presidential office agreed to unilaterally devise details of measures including the ways of easing restriction on layoffs ― the matter of which was left open for further discussion between labor and business.Kim had been expressing concerns over the ruling party and the government speeding up the legislation process without workers’ approval when the tripartite committee’s negotiations were being bogged down.After an intense scuffle, the Federation of Korean Trade Unions’ executives approved the deal on Sept. 14, despite persistent opposition from some of its members. The Korea Confederation of Trade Unions, the second-largest and more radical trade union in the country that had been left out of the negotiation, meanwhile, vowed all-out protests against the compromise. The South Korean business circle, for their part, said it doesn’t hold a negative view of the recent agreement on labor reform.“The tripartite agreement is meaningful because government, business and labor leaders reached a broad consensus. It is a great leap forward,” said Park Yong-man, chairman of the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Major businesses had been saying the deal fell far short of expectations and called on lawmakers to adopt more sweeping labor reforms.In the landmark deal, the panel agreed on highly contentious issues, including easing restriction on layoffs and extending the maximum employment period for temporary workers. Opposition parties and the KCTU blasted the panel’s agreement, calling it an outcome of collusion among the tripartite members. They have been claiming that the measures were biased in favor of businesses for easier employment conditions.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","open to debate president ,the bills in luncheon ,to debate president park ,in luncheon with representatives ,bills open to debate",['Park Geun'],8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46628597  0.30827546

APThe upper house’s approval makes the legislation into law, reinterpreting Japan’s constitution and fundamentally changing the way it uses its military. Opponents say it violates Japan‘s constitution and puts the country at risk of becoming embroiled in U.S.-led wars.The legislation has sparked sizeable protests and debate about whether Japan should shift away from its pacifist ways to face growing security challenges. Rallies have spread across the nation especially after the ruling parties approved the bills in July in the more powerful lower house.Japan’s military can now defend its allies even when the country isn’t under attack — for the first time since the end of the World War II — and work more closely with the U.S. and other nations. Japan will also be able to participate more fully in international peacekeeping, compared to its previous, mostly humanitarian, missions.“The legislation is necessary in order to protect the people’s lives and their peaceful livelihood, and it is to prevent a war,” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters after the passage of a total of 11 bills — one related to international peacekeeping and a package of 10 others designed to allow Japan‘s military to defend its allies in an action called “collective self-defense.”Dozens of constitutional scholars, lawyers and other legal experts have joined protests, saying the legislation allowing Japan to use force to settle international disputes violates its U.S.-drafted postwar constitution that renounces a right to wage war.China said it and other Asian neighbors are closely watching the vote because of Japan’s wartime aggression.“We demand that Japan genuinely listen to just appeals from both at home and abroad, learning from historical lessons and adhering to the path of peaceful development,” said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei.Previous postwar governments had all made the notion of collective self-defense unconstitutional. But Abe’s Cabinet last year decided to allow it by unilaterally adopting a new interpretation of the constitution, instead of formally revising the charter, saying it must be adapted to today’s increasingly challenging security environment. The constitutional reinterpretation triggered public criticism that Abe‘s government undermined democracy. Opponents also say the change would cause Japan to do more in the bilateral alliance with the U.S.In Washington, leaders of Senate committees overseeing U.S. defense and foreign policy welcomed the legislation’s passage, saying it would contribute to international peace and security and strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance.“We welcome a larger role for Japan in regional and global security affairs and look forward to our country working with Japan to implement these new measures,” the Republican and Democratic committee leaders said in a joint statement Friday.

Choi Yoon-hee, whose two-year stint ends in October.If he wins presidential approval on Tuesday and the ensuing parliamentary hearing, Lee will become the first Army Academy alumnus to take up South Korea’s highest-ranking officer post on active duty, which has traditionally been occupied by those from the elite Military Academy. Since the JCS’ 1954 inception, only Army generals have assumed the chairmanship except in two cases ― the incumbent Choi and former Air Force Chief of Staff Lee Yang-ho who served from 1993-94. A native of Daegu, Lee Sun-jin entered the academy in 1977. He also undertook key Army positions including head of the Aviation Operations Command, Capital Corps and the 2nd Infantry Division. He gained fame for a pacific disposition and strong communication skills with not only colleagues but also rank-and-file servicemen, while helping advance joint rear area operational capabilities with U.S. forces here, officials said. “The selection was based on whether the nominees embraced the commander-in-chief’s administrative philosophy and embody a reforming mind, expertise and leadership, as well as a comprehensive assessment of their ability, personality and command capability that are essential to overseeing our national security and the military,” said Lee Hwang-gyu, director-general for personnel planning at the Defense Ministry. As part of the shake-up, the ministry also nominated 1st Army commander Gen. Jang Jun-gyu as the new Army Chief of Staff, the JCS' chief of strategic planning Lt. Gen. Jeong Kyeong-doo as the Air Force Chief of Staff, and 3rd Army commander Gen. Kim Hyun-jip as the deputy commander of the Combined Forces Command. Jeong was also promoted to general.With Jeong’s appointment, the incumbent Choi Cha-kyu will step down more than six months before the end of his term, which was marred by a series of corruption scandals.

Organized by the Chinese Institute of International Studies, the two-day seminar, starting Friday, will mark the 10th anniversary of a deal in which North Korea agreed to abandon its nuclear program in exchange for aid and security assurances. The agreement was announced on Sept. 19, 2005 after the six-party talks involving South Korea, North Korea, the United States, China, Russia and Japan. However, follow-up negotiations on implementing the deal stalled because of North Korea's boycott of the talks.The six-party talks have not been held since late 2008 and North Korea has conducted three nuclear tests so far.An official at the Chinese institute confirmed that the seminar will be held on Friday, but declined to give details. North Korea is unlikely to send its chief nuclear envoy, Ri Yong-ho, to this week's seminar, the diplomatic source in Beijing said on the condition of anonymity. South Korea has no plans to dispatch a government delegation to the event, officials in Seoul said.It is a ""civilian seminar"" hosted by a Chinese think tank and South Korean scholars and experts will largely attend it, a Foreign Ministry official said.""On the government's part, Kim Gunn, director general for North Korean nuclear affairs at the Foreign Ministry, plans to participate in the forum in his personal capacity,"" he added.Kim is Seoul's deputy chief delegate to the six-party talks on the North's nuclear program.It remains unclear whether the U.S., Russia and Japan will send their government officials to the seminar, according to the source. The International Atomic Energy Agency said earlier this month that North Korea has continued to expand its nuclear capabilities, citing satellite images of the North's main nuclear complex.

""Under such circumstances, the government cannot wait forever, so it will take charge and push for changes that can create more job opportunities for young people and fuel economic growth,"" he said in a statement.The government will work with the ruling Saenuri Party starting next week to iron out the bill, so it can be passed in parliament within the year, he said.""Headway made so far at the tripartite negotiations will be reflected in the bill, and outdated and inflexible rules in the labor market needs to be overhauled,"" he said. ""At the same time, every effort will be made to give greater stability to workers and more attention paid to helping those that are laid off.""Choi, who doubles as deputy prime minister in charge of economic affairs, said the government-Saenuri bill will include creating a fair screening system that will make it easier to dismiss under-performing workers, allow companies to change rules of employment and make it possible to introduce the wage peak system.Existing labor laws make it very difficult to dismiss workers and any changes to the employment rules need to be approved by employees.The wage peak system advocated by the government calls for people nearing retirement age to receive less pay, with the money saved to be used to hire new employees. This work sharing arrangement is critical because South Korea's retirement age will be pushed back to 60 starting in 2016, raising employment-related costs for companies. As of August, the unemployment rate of young people stood at 8 percent, much higher than the 3.4 percent for the entire country. He also said that there is a need for greater cooperation between management and labor, and unions must put an end to engaging in disruptive walkouts for wage hikes.Choi cited moves by labor unions at Hyundai Motor Co. and leading shipyards to engage in strikes as prime examples of unreasonable labor practices that need to be changed.The minister said that while the government engages in talks with Saenuri, it will accept any future agreements made at the tripartite talks set to resume on Saturday.The government, meanwhile, said that companies too have been asked to make compromises such as pledging to hire a large number of new employees in the coming years as well as revising the way they deal with smaller business partners and small and medium enterprises.""Such measures are costly, yet they can promote mutual growth between big companies and smaller companies that can help the economy,"" said Labor Minister Lee Ki-kweon.He also said that besides these issues, the government will take steps to raise unemployment wages and reform the way fixed-term employment workers and temporary agency workers are treated to help resolve inequality and discrimination issues between the two.

At the audit session on Sept. 17, lawmakers are expected to question Lotte‘s governance structure. Lotte has been embroiled in an infamous family feud between Shin and his brother over the control of South Korea’s retail giant. In a statement on Thursday, Lotte confirmed Shin’s attendance to the audit, saying he would fully cooperate with the audit and prepare for the session with “due diligence.”“Lotte, which has vowed to implement the reform to the governance structure, should take (the audit) as an opportunity to dispel the public’s anger and distrust over the company,” said Rep. Kang Gi-jung of the NPAD. Lotte Group chairman Shin Dong-bin responds to reporters' questionBoth parties also agreed to summon the chiefs of Naver and Daum, South Korea’s major Internet portals, to question whether they have violated the rule of political neutrality in political affairs by arbitrarily changing headlines or arranging news to sway voters in favor of opposition parties.Meanwhile, lawmakers clashed over the witness list for an upcoming parliamentary inquiry into the government’s response to the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak that claimed dozens of lives and caused public fear over the nation’s disease quarantine system.The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy demanded that the list include those high-profile government officials who were tasked with handling the MERS outbreak, while the ruling Saenuri Party rejected the offer and claimed the officials already explained themselves during the previous hearings. NPAD lawmakers urged former Health and Welfare Minister Moon Hyung-pyo and senior presidential advisers to attend the special probe and testify before lawmakers about the government’s poor response in the early stages of the outbreak. The probe will take place on Sept. 22.“Considering the magnitude of the MERS outbreak that has fueled public fears, Cheong Wa Dae should come forward and tell (the lawmakers) exactly what measures they took during the outbreak,” said NPAD lawmaker Rep. Rhee Mok-hee. But the ruling Saenuri Party dismissed the call as an unnecessary attempt to grill government officials.“The previous parliamentary committee has already got to the bottom of (the MERS outbreak). Moon also left the post after giving us full explanations,” said Rep. Moon Jeong-lim of the ruling party.

The NIKH is slated to hold a public hearing Friday.There has been a debate in South Korea over whether the government should be given exclusive right to publish history textbooks for middle and high schools. Rival parties have been wrangling over the issue for months while high-ranking education officials and progressives across the country have raised objections to the prospect. The country currently allows publishers to write their own secondary education textbooks, but some of these books are accused of being substandard. Elementary school-level history textbooks are already published by the state.“The issue of state history textbooks can be confirmed after a series of procedure following the public hearing (by the NIKH). It is not right for me to preemptively tell you the conclusions,” Hwang said at the audit held in Sejong Government Complex.Hwang did reiterate his stance that having a single version of history taught in schools can help students avoid confusion, and that he “did not rule out” state-published history textbooks. But opposition members said that it was very unlikely that the ministry was oblivious to the prospect of a new textbook publishing system, given that Hwang vowed to announce the ministry’s position in late September and the procedure to develop the new textbook would begin around October.“Your schedule implies that the administrative notification for the new textbooks should start soon. The ministry should at the very least announce which direction it is headed in,” said Rep. Youn Kwan-suk of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy.Earlier in the day, Rep. Do Jong-hwan of the NPAD revealed an official document created by the Education Ministry which showed that “improvement of the history textbook system” was a presidential directive. The document was dated February 2014, which was around the time that a textbook by Kyohak Publishing Co. was accused of conservative bias and a general lack of quality.NPAD’s Rep. Kim Tae-nyeon accused the ministry of sabotaging the audit, and urged the ministry to provide all related data on the suspicion that Park had directly ordered the reinstatement of state history textbooks, which were initially introduced by her father, former President Park Chung-hee before being abolished in the 2000s.While Hwang claimed that opinions of “various experts related to history” were taken into account in the ministry’s decision, he did not elaborate on exactly who participated in the procedure. Rep. Jeong Jin-hoo of the minor opposition party pointed out that the latest survey results stated by the ministry -- which showed that 48.6 percent of the people were for state textbooks opposed to 48.1 percent against -- was dated October 2014. He asked Hwang to provide results of more recent surveys and a list of those who participated in the public hearing and research. Members of the ruling Saenuri Party, on the other hand, said that textbooks published under the current system have many errors.Rep. Kang Eun-hee of Saenuri pointed out that eight high school history textbooks that currently exist are inconsistent on facts. When describing the dawn of the Stone Age on the Korean peninsula for example, the textbooks range from B.C. 300,000 to B.C. 1 million. She also pointed out that the textbooks have different interpretations about the Vietnam War, Korea’s modern history and the country’s first president, Rhee Syng-man.“Because the standards for (the ministry’s) certification are low, publishers are basically left to freely author textbooks,” she said.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","history textbook opposition lawmakers ,textbook opposition lawmakers thursday ,state history textbook opposition ,textbook opposition lawmakers ,opposition lawmakers thursday blasted",['Hwang Woo - yea'],8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.78178132  0.41677436

Moon Jae-in (left), the leader of the opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, and ruling Saenuri Party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung sit next to each other in Jangchoong Stadium in Seoul on Wednesday. (Yonhap)The standoff over the potential reinstatement of state-published textbooks for secondary education history is expected to headline Thursday’s parliamentary audit of the Education Ministry, as the government’s self-imposed deadline to reach a decision will expire by the end of September.The debate as to whether only the government should author history textbooks ― which came up when Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea brought it up last year ― has expanded over the past few months to encompass a bipartisan feud, ideological debate and the basic question about government monopoly over educational content.In a recent interview, Hwang reiterated that students “should learn from one version of history,” which was widely interpreted as meaning state-authored textbooks. “When you look at the textbooks, some versions use different phrases for the Eulsa Treaty (between Korea and Japan), while others don’t teach it at all. How are students supposed to take a college entrance exam based on such textbooks?” he said. The Eulsa Treaty in 1905 deprived Korea of its sovereignty. Since taking office last year, the former leader of the ruling Saenuri Party has been toying with the prospect of the state exclusively authoring history textbooks for middle and high schools. Currently Korea allows eight private publishing companies to print the textbooks and certifies them if their products are up to standard, from which local schools can choose.Questions were raised over the certification system, however, in light of last year’s debacle with a textbook from Kyohak Publishing ― which was bashed for being of low quality and biased in favor of the conservatives ― coupled with the ministry’s accusation that the current textbooks omitted key facts on topics such as the 1950-53 Korean War.The debate escalated into ideological warfare, as both conservative and liberal educators accused the textbooks of depicting history in favor of the opposing side.Proponents of the state history textbooks have claimed that having just one book that is unbiased can eliminate ideological feuds stemming from different interpretations of facts.“We need a state-authored history textbook rooted in the facts that have a neutral view (of history), so that students would not be confused by an education based on lopsided historical viewpoints,” Saenuri Chairman Kim Moo-sung said last week at the National Assembly. He said that “self-depreciative” interpretation of Korea’s modern history “must be eradicated,” and the country needs a positive view.But those opposing the state history textbooks said the system will give the government the power to enforce its own views on students.Rep. Moon Jae-in, leader of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, said that attempts to reinstate the state textbooks is against the very idea of democracy. He said that Kim’s argument about “self-depreciative historical view” is reminiscent of an argument made by the far-right in Japan, who were accused of whitewashing Japan’s crimes during World War II.“Historians oppose state textbooks, because a monolithic point of view cannot induce creative thought. ... Instead of trying to control the people, (the government) should bring them together,” he said. Rep. Youn Kwan-suk of the NPAD likened the process to a dictatorship. “Former President Park Chung-hee’s regime switched the history textbook publishing system from certification to state-authorship to justify his dictatorship,” he said. “We must retain the current system, as state textbooks are highly likely to cater to the demands of those in power.”On Friday, 13 commemorative bodies of Korea’s independence movement from Japan held a joint news conference to oppose the state history textbooks. Descendants of Korean freedom fighters ― including the son of Chang Chun-ha and grandson of Ji Cheong-cheon ― were also present.“The government must cease all efforts to reinstate a state textbook system, unless it seeks to use history education as a tool for its benefit,” they said. Educators across the country released their thoughts as well, although the opposing side is far more vocal on the controversial issue as of now. On Wednesday, the 2,255 members of the Association of Korean History Teachers jointly released a statement against state history textbooks. The AKHT and six other local societies related to history and history education held a joint news conference Monday to denounce the government’s attempt to bring back state-published textbooks. The groups said that they analyzed the history textbook for fifth graders ― elementary school history textbooks are authored by the government ― and found 150 errors, claiming that their discovery demonstrates the problem with the state-published textbooks.“Champions of the state textbooks say that teaching a single version of history is important. Even if we say that is true, who will take responsibility if that single version is proven to be wrong?” said Lee Jun-shik of the Institute for Research in Collaborationist Activities who participated in the analysis. ”The ministry sure won’t, nor will the writing staff. And the harm (from the textbook) is inflicted on the students.”Cho Han-kyung, the leader of the AHKT, said it is hard to motivate the writing staff for the state-authored textbooks to improve the quality of their book when they face no competition from other publishers. “A private publisher whose product has this many errors (as the state textbook) would be forced out of the market,” he said.Last week, 34 professors of history-related departments at Seoul National University visited the Education Ministry decrying the government’s move.“The fundamental problem is that the government will be able to monopolize the contents of history textbooks. ... If the ministry has issues with different terminology in textbooks, they can just mend the guidelines and standards for the certified textbooks,” they said in the statement. The Korea Federation of Teachers’ Association, the nation’s largest right-leaning teachers’ body, has yet to formally comment on the issue, but said it will release a statement later in the month.KFTA spokesman Kim Dong-seok said that the group fundamentally agrees with the ministry’s statement that students need to learn a single version of history, and added that various side effects from having different publishing systems should also be taken into account. “While we cannot say for now whether or not we agree with the state history textbooks, we agree that the ministry should take a bigger role. Whether it is to implement the new publishing system or to provide much more detailed guidelines on the content,” he said.The dispute over state history textbooks is likely to rage on. The NPAD has already threatened to boycott the parliamentary audit if the ministry insists on pushing ahead with the idea.Local education offices are also expected to chime in. Education offices of Seoul, Incheon and Gangwon and Gyeonggi provinces were to have a joint news conference at the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education on Monday as to the prospect of state-authored textbooks, although it was canceled Saturday.The education superintendents from the capital region have been among the most outspoken opponents of the state history textbooks.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","headline thursday parliamentary audit ,to headline thursday parliamentary ,thursday parliamentary audit ,thursday parliamentary audit of ,headline thursday parliamentary","['Moon Jae - in', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Jangchoong Stadium', 'Seoul', 'the Education Ministry']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68743134  0.45976481

""If the union expresses its will to stop the strike, we will reopen the office.""Negotiations between the two sides have failed to produce a breakthrough due to differences over the lump-sum amount the company will pay the workers in compensation for the adoption of the wage peak system.Losses incurred to the company have been estimated at 89 billion won ($75 million), while the average loss for each worker is expected to exceed 2.5 million won.During the first quarter, Kumho Tire saw its sales drop 12 percent on-year to 754.4 billion won, with operating profit plunging 49 percent to 44 billion won.

The OPLAN 5015 was formulated last June to replace OPLAN 5027 by the chairmen of the two countries’ Joint Chiefs of Staff. The allies have, since 1974, been assessing their joint defense plan every year, primarily to devise better responses to North Korea’s military threats. “It is the first time that the OPLAN has dealt with the concept of a preemptive strike,” a military source said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.The updated scheme, which has already come into force, will allow the allies to consider a preemptive strike aimed at terminating WMDs such as atomic bombs, missiles and biological and chemical weapons when signs of their imminent use are detected from the North. They are believed to have been carrying out the joint Ulchi Guardian Freedom exercise under the scenario, focusing on minimizing damage in case of Pyongyang’s use of a biochemical weapon. “The plan was revised as part of the two countries’ annual efforts to reflect the threats we face, and they usually examine if there is any need to adjust their strategies after the UFG ends every year,” another official told The Korea Herald on condition of anonymity.Seoul’s Defense Ministry declined to confirm the report, citing classified operational strategies. “Any revelation of our military’s operational plan does not contribute to not only our security, but also national interest,” it said in a statement. The discovery came after cross-border tensions flared to the verge of an armed conflict, with the two Koreas trading fire and the North declaring a “quasi-state of war” and putting frontline forces in full combat readiness. But Defense Minister Han Min-koo sought to decouple the latest crisis and the OPLAN update, noting that any change in the war plan could reflect the U.S.’ overall military cutbacks in the face of its budget woes and resulting the sequestration. “The two countries update their joint defense plan every year and maintain close coordination at all times,” he said during parliamentary questioning Tuesday. “There have been calls for an OPLAN review given the changing situation on the U.S. part including the Army scale back and the sequester, but the North’s semi-war state declaration and any immediate OPLAN amendment are separate issues.”By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","new war plan to ,june to replace oplan ,new war plan ,last june to replace ,was formulated last june","['South Korea', 'U.S.', '’ Joint Chiefs of Staff']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.92314291  0.25525782

The broadcasts and wartime declaration came to an end at noon, hours after the two sides clinched a six-point agreement in which Pyongyang displayed regret over a recent land mine blasts in the Demilitarized Zone and ensuing wounds on two South Korean soldiers in return for Seoul’s conditional cessation of loudspeaker operations. A soldier turns off the power switch for the loudspeakers installed along the border Tuesday at 12 noon. (Joint Chiefs of Staff)They also agreed to hold formal talks in Seoul or Pyongyang “at an early date” to explore ways to mend their ties and have a working-level meeting in early September to arrange a fresh round of reunions of separated families in time for the Chuseok holidays at the end of the month. The announcement followed 43 hours of negotiations that kicked off Saturday. Kim Kwan-jin, chief of Cheong Wa Dae’s National Security Office, and Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo sat face-to-face with Hwang Pyong-so, vice chairman of the North’s National Defense Commission and director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People’s Army, and Kim Yang-gon, director of the North’s United Front Department and a secretary of the ruling Workers’ Party’s Central Committee, in the border village of Panmunjeom until early Tuesday. “We focused on extracting an apology for the land mine provocation and other recent incidents by North Korea as the subject (of the talks), and a promise to prevent a recurrence, which in fact resulted in protracted negotiations,” Kim Kwan-jin said at a news conference at Cheong Wa Dae. “But the reason why we ceaselessly called for preventive steps was that otherwise, there would be one provocation threatening public safety after another -- we would not have been able to break the vicious circle.” But criticism lingers over Seoul’s failure to include in the accord a clear articulation of apology and preventive measures, as well as who is to blame for the mine explosions. Seoul officials defended themselves by saying that the word “regret” had never been stipulated in any past inter-Korean statements, while the caveat attached -- “unless any abnormal situation takes place” -- ensured that the propaganda broadcasts could be resumed at any time if the communist country staged a provocation in the future. In an apparent attempt to play down the show of regret, the North’s Hwang Pyong-so later in the day repeated Pyongyang’s denial of responsibility for the recent series of its provocations, saying that Seoul fabricated “groundless incidents” and only escalated tensions that could induce an armed clash.“Through the urgent talks, the South Korean authorities should have realized that its fabrication of groundless incidents and unilateral judgment and behavior would only heighten tensions and could give rise to a military confrontation,” he said in an interview with the North’s Korean Central TV as he assessed the outcome of the talks.“But we think that it is a relief that our joint efforts set the mood for the improvement of inter-Korean relations,” he was quoted as adding.The delegates of the two Koreas pose after their marathon talks at the border village of Panmunjeom on Tuesday. From left are Seoul's Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo; Kim Kwan-jin, chief of Cheong Wa Dae’s National Security Office; Hwang Pyong-so, vice chairman of the North’s National Defense Commission and director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People’s Army; and Kim Yang-gon, director of the North’s United Front Department and a secretary of the ruling Workers’ Party’s Central Committee. (Unification Ministry)Following an 11-year break, the broadcasts were restarted on Aug. 11 along the Military Demarcation Line in retaliation for the Aug. 4 explosion of three mines suspected to have been buried by North Korean soldiers who illegally crossed the border. The blast inflicted serious injuries on the legs of two South Korean Army staff sergeants. After North Korean leader Kim Jong-un declared a “quasi-state of war” last Thursday, his military put frontline troops in full combat readiness, sharply beefed up artillery forces and forward-deployed a majority of its submarines and other offensive assets. Signs of de-escalation showed soon after the deal, as some of the submarines that had left their bases appeared to have returned, Defense Ministry spokesperson Kim Min-seok said. Seoul’s military officials had expressed concerns on Sunday that they were unable to locate about 50 undersea vehicles, or 70 percent of the North’s submarine fleet. While welcoming the breakthrough, the South Korean military remained cautious, saying it was maintaining maximum readiness, which it would adjust according to the North’s movements. U.S. Forces Korea are likely to take similar steps before lowering their Watch Condition level. Defense Minister Han Min-koo convened two separate meetings Tuesday to discuss follow-up measures with top military commanders and ministry and Joint Chiefs of Staff executives. “Even if the North does rescind the semi-war state, it will take a considerable amount of time and effort to bring the already deployed frontline artillery and other military forces back to normal,” Kim said at a news briefing. “Our military will flexibly downgrade its readiness, taking into account the level of threat from North Korea.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","steps tuesday to defuse ,tuesday to defuse tension ,tuesday to defuse ,began taking steps tuesday ,halted anti pyongyang broadcasts","['Koreas', 'anti - pyongyang']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28919476  0.37922257

(Yonhap)Labeling the package as a step to reviving the nation’s sluggish economy, the ruling Saenuri Party has been pushing for the swift passage of the bills, arguing that the legislation would create job opportunities for the youth whose unemployment rate has worsened.“No matter how hard it is, we will push for the passage. Our party will play a leading role in realizing the president’s initiative to jump-start economy,” said Saenuri chairman Kim Moo-sung, echoing President Park Geun-hye’s speech last Friday urging lawmakers to promptly sign the bills into legislation.But the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy called the bills a “false” promise and dismissed them as favors to those who already have vested interests in medical and tourism industry. The NPAD argued that the move would widen disparity between the haves and have-nots. “(The Saenuri Party) seems to be telling us that passing the bills would revive the economy. It is not the case. We believe it would worsen disparity in the medical industry and run the risk of leading to the privatization of public health care,” NPAD floor spokesman Rep. Park Soo-hyun said. Meanwhile, other conventional issues will continue to dominate already jam-packed August extraordinary parliamentary session agenda. Lawmakers will hold parliamentary committees this Monday and Wednesday to continue their debate over the spy agency’s hacking scandal.Having failed to hold a meeting at the National Intelligence Service last Thursday, rival parties will question the government officials about the allegation that the NIS had used hacking program to wiretap the public and engage in civil surveillance. While the Saenuri Party urges the opponent to stop inflating ungrounded allegation that might compromise national security, the NPAD accuses the NIS of denying access to “critical” information that they believe sheds lights on escalating scandal. On other political fronts, rival parties are expected to butt heads over the rules on the upcoming 2016 general election. With the NPAD proposing to change the current parliamentary representation, the ruling Saenuri Party rejected the plan, citing it would inevitably increase the number of lawmakers. With the deadline for the rule set for Thursday, rival parties agreed to discuss the issue in the relevant committee. But considering that the issue would impact the next election, it is widely expected that rival parties will fail to reach a compromise unless both parties’ leaders agree.

""We welcome Prime Minister Abe's positive comments this past year on history issues ...

At the time, Abe expressed deep remorse over the war and said he upholds the views expressed by his predecessors, but he snubbed calls for a clear apology for the country's wartime sexual enslavement of women.  ""We took note of his remarks in Washington about upholding the views expressed by previous prime ministers in regard to the past.

But of course, (Japan) will never renounce its claim to Dokdo. Thus, it will likely maintain the same expression it has used to refer to Dokdo, rather than adopting more provocative terms.”According to the Japanese media, the focal point of this year’s defense white paper will be the security challenges from China that has been increasingly aggressive in its territorial disputes involving the South China Sea.China has been turning numerous rocks and reefs in the Spratly Islands into artificial islands to construct military bases equipped with naval harbors, airstrips, radar facilities and other equipment, and this is regarded by the U.S. and Japan as a move to ultimately alter the regional status quo.Kyodo News reported earlier this month that Tokyo’s defense white paper would mention that China has been continuing with “coercive measures” in the South China Sea. China has asserted its claim to the South China Sea with “the nine-dashed-line” ― a maritime demarcation line that takes in more than 80 percent of the 3.5 million-square-kilometer sea. Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei have engaged in intense maritime territorial squabbles with China.The Japanese media also said the 2015 white paper would touch on North Korea’s push to develop a nuclear-tipped submarine-launched ballistic missile, describing it as a “seriously destabilizing factor” to escalate tensions on the peninsula.Observers say that the content regarding Dokdo in the white paper may not seriously damage Korea-Japan relations given that the claim is expected as it has appeared in the paper for the last decade.Japan incorporated Dokdo as part of its territory in 1905 before colonizing the entire peninsula. Korea has been in effective control of the islets with a small coast guard unit posted there since its liberation in 1945.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","cabinet on tuesday drawing ,paper tokyo 2015 defense ,its cabinet on tuesday ,annual defense policy paper ,cabinet on tuesday","['Tokyo', 'Cabinet', 'South Korea ’s', 'japanese', 'South Korea']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47920391  0.37757999

Is grading one’s character in the admissions process even feasible?Private education institutions, meanwhile, did not shy away from an opportunity to cash in on the plan. On the coattails of the announcement, local institutes started offering classes on how to prepare for character examinations.With the plan seeming to have more negative effects than positive ones, the ministry said in Tuesday’s media briefing that applying the character evaluations in college admissions had officially been shelved.“The character evaluation should not be calibrated for evaluation in college admissions. Although we maintain that character assessment should be an important factor in the admissions process, we are leaving it to the discretion of respective colleges and universities,” said a ministry official.While the ministry continues to stress the importance of character building, it “might as well give up” on including it in the college admissions to avoid problems, he said.The decision sparked criticism toward the ministry’s half-baked plan, and the fallacy of attempting to universally apply such abstract and individual virtues into mass education. The education circle pointed to the lack, or impossibility, of indexing “characters” into education to be applied at all schools, and that stipulating it in the law would only prompt cookie-cutter education.Plans like fostering character-building experts raised questions as well, as it lacked clear criteria. A ministry official explained that virtually anyone could apply to become one, save convicted felons, a standard that hardly appeared sufficient.“Having a law on (character building) makes it easier to enforce it on all schools. But there is also a risk of all schools just copying a system that seems to work,” Yang Jung-ho, a professor of education at Sungkyunkwan University. He explained that the character education process was likely to become standardized and ineffective, becoming just another subject students are forced to study.“It’s not a custom-fit education for each student, but a one-for-all model enforced by the law,” he said. “The best thing right now is to ensure that students receive character-building education through various experiences, not just via books.”By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","education ministry on tuesday ,building education every five ,ministry on tuesday rolled ,ministry on tuesday ,education every five years",['the Education Ministry'],8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57753497  0.47684175

Kim Jung-hoon, who were selected to the post also on Tuesday.Park’s meeting with new party leaders will be the first since February.The meeting comes after tensions rose between Park and her ruling party over a bill that would have given greater administrative power to the National Assembly.Park denounced former floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min for what she called the “politics of betrayal” and blamed him for giving into opposition pressure to approve the bill. Park later vetoed the bill, and Yoo quit his position by accepting the party’s resolution recommending his resignation.","meet saenuri leaders thursday ,leaders thursday from news ,saenuri leaders thursday ,saenuri party this week ,thursday from news reportspresident","['Park Geun - hye', 'Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.06022942  0.83486402

The reduction of 40,000 will be completed by the end of fiscal year 2018, it said.The troop reduction is driven by automatic spending cuts requirements known as “sequestration.”The Army further warned that unless the budget constraints are addressed, the next round of troop cuts will leave the Army with only 420,000 soldiers by the end of fiscal year 2019.“Troop levels in Korea remain the same for now. However, the next round of cuts (down to 420,000) may impact South Korea,” Lt. Col. Joe Buccino, an Army spokesman, told Yonhap News Agency.Currently, about 28,500 American troops are stationed in South Korea to help deter threats from North Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War that ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, which left the divided peninsula still technically at war.Cdr. Bill Urban, a Pentagon spokesman, said the first round of cuts in the next two years “will not affect troop strength levels in the Republic of Korea.” He said the Army force structure cuts were first announced in February when President Barack Obama submitted the defense budget to Congress.Should the Army troop levels drop to 420,000 by 2019, it would mean “a cumulative loss of 150,000 soldiers from the regular Army, a 26 percent cut over a seven-year period,” the Army warned in the announcement.“The resulting force would be incapable of simultaneously meeting current deployment requirements and responding to the overseas contingency requirements of the combatant commands,” it said.","army official said thursday ,official says troop cut ,the army troop reduction ,army troop reduction driven ,army troop reduction","['WASHINGTON', 'the U.S. Army ’s', 'South Korea', 'american', 'asian', 'Army', 'Army', 'Army']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52205265  0.49482948

In both 2004 and 2011, the court ruled the law constitutional. A member of a civic group supporting conscientious objectors holds a protest outside the Constitutional Court in Jongno-gu, Seoul, Thursday. (Yonhap)Korean law stipulates that anyone who refuses military duty without justifiable cause is subjectable to imprisonment of up to three years. “As of now, 43 prisons across the country are holding 706 young men who rejected military service based on their beliefs,” said Oh Du-jin, a legal representative of the conscientious objectors who filed a petition against the law. “The freedom of conscientious objection is a basic right that should be respected in all situations, and we believe it is the court’s duty to protect their rights.”Lawyers for the objectors stressed that their clients did not seek to dodge military duties, but simply wanted to substitute them with nonviolent duties. Mandating a more demanding task than military duty for the objectors could be an option, they said. They also emphasized that Article 18 of the International Covenants on Human Rights recognizes the conscientious objection of military duties, while claiming that recognizing that conscientious objection is a global trend. Countries such as Austria, Greece and Switzerland provide options of performing civilian services instead of joining the military. In some countries like Greece, the civilian service period is longer than the corresponding military service.Legal representatives of the Defense Ministry, however, refuted by saying that the unique situation on the Korean Peninsula makes it hard to compare to any other country.“As the world’s only divided country, it is crucial for (Korea) to carry out conscription as fairly as possible to procure sufficient manpower for the military. To do so, we must ensure that military duty is imposed on everyone equally,” said Seo Gyu-yeong, a lawyer for the Defense Ministry.He added that while individuals’ freedom is important, the national security is the indispensable precursor to protect the freedom and rights of all people.As 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, South and North Koreas are still technically at war with each other. South Korean law stipulates that all able-bodied men must serve in the military for at least 21 months between ages 18 and 35. The service period varies according to branches: 21 months for the Army and the Marine Corp., 23 for the Navy and 24 for the Air Force.According to the Military Manpower Administration, 6,090 people from 2004 to 2013 have rejected the mandatary military service due to their religion and various other reasons. Most notable among conscientious objectors in South Korea are Jehovah’s Witnesses, who refuse to use weapons or partake in combat training.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","public court hearing thursday ,conscription law after three ,objectors challenge conscription law ,court hearing thursday ,court hearing thursday on",['the Constitutional Court'],8,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.17971271 0.14894946 0.48819789],윤민식,Social affairs,7,2015,"held public court hearing thursday ,conscription law after three conscientious ,thursday on the conscription law ,public court hearing thursday ,public court hearing thursday on","['the Constitutional Court', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Jongno - gu', 'Seoul', 'Du - jin', 'Austria', 'Greece', 'Switzerland', 'Greece', 'the Defense Ministry', 'Korea', 'Seo Gyu - yeong', 'the Defense Ministry', 'North Koreas', 'south korean', 'Army', 'the Marine Corp.', 'Navy', 'the Air Force', 'the Military Manpower Administration', 'South Korea', 'Jehovah ’s', 'Yoon Min - sik']",5,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.17971271 0.14894946 0.48819789]

YonhapJapan’s denial of forced labor has dampened the emergent mood for a thaw in the bilateral relationship that was forged as the two countries marked the 50th anniversary last month of the normalization of diplomatic relations.The popup message on the South Korean Foreign Ministry’s website carried the full statements that South Korea’s Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and Japan‘s Ambassador to UNESCO Kuni Sato made at Sunday’s WHC session.In his statement, Cho said the WHC’s decision to note the forced Korean labor marked another important step toward healing historical wounds and reaffirming that the historical truth of the unfortunate past should also be reflected in an objective manner.The message also carried a press release detailing Tokyo’s pledges to take measures to commemorate Korean victims of forced labor during the colonial era including establishing an information center about the victims.Based on Sato’s English statement, the Seoul government believes that Tokyo, for the first time, acknowledged its wartime recruitment of forced laborers from the Korean Peninsula.But Tokyo argues that the expression “forced to work” in its WHC statement is different from the expression “forced labor or compulsory labor,” which is banned by the 1932 Forced Labor Convention to which Japan is also party.It also maintains that bilateral colonial-era issues, including the issue of forced labor and wartime sexual slavery, were settled under a 1965 bilateral treaty that normalized diplomatic relations between the two sides.Media reports in Korea and Japan said that by refusing to accept the facts about forced labor, Tokyo appears to be trying to circumvent public criticism, particularly from conservatives, that it succumbed to Korean pressure to recognize the use of forced labor at some of the sites.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com )","ministry on tuesday installed ,foreign ministry on tuesday ,ministry on tuesday ,tuesday installed popup window ,on tuesday installed popup","['South Korea ’s', 'Foreign Ministry', 'Japan', 'korean', 'UNESCO', 'World Heritage', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'the World Heritage Committee', 'Bonn', 'Germany', 'Sun']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23237032  0.34509766

Yoo Seong-min, who was pegged by President Park Geun-hye last month as the culprit behind government policy delays.The decision was made at an emergency meeting of Supreme Council members Tuesday, a day after the party boycotted a revote of, and thereby discarded, the controversial National Assembly Act revision vetoed by Park.Yoo Seung-min. YonhapSaenuri Party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung told the press that member lawmakers will discuss an item initially titled “A resolution to recommend the resignation of the floor leader for the sake of the Saenuri Party’s future and the Park Geun-hye administration’s success.”Party members continued to scuffle over the name of the discussion item, with the non-Park members saying the title restricts the scope of discussion by assuming Yoo’s resignation. Kim said they decided on the format of officially opening debate to avoid a situation of having to cast a confidence vote of Yoo as demanded by pro-Park members of the party. Yoo, who left the Supreme Council meeting mid-way, told reporters that he will not be attending the assembly but that he will abide by whatever decision is made.Yoo, elected as the party’s floor leader in February by beating out a pro-Park competitor, has refused to step down from the post despite repeated prodding from staunch members of his party over the past week.Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min walks past reporters at the National Assembly on Tuesday. YonhapYoo’s former running mate and chief policymaker Rep. Won Yoo-chul said it was his idea to have the party deliberate on the situation instead of pushing for a vote to allow an opportunity for Yoo to resign voluntarily.Despite the party leadership’s decision, conflict within the party persisted with non-Park members harshly criticizing the pro-Park members having bowed to Cheong Wa Dae pressure.“The decision reached at the Supreme Council meeting is a shameful one that should be discarded immediately,” said senior member Rep. Lee Jae-oh. Lee had vied against Park for the party’s presidential candidacy in 2012.“Since my entry to the party in 1996, there has never been a case more tragic ... It is despicable on political moral standards for the council to have made all decisions to later blame it all on the floor leader as their scapegoat upon a simple remark by Cheong Wa Dae,” he said through his Facebook account.The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, meanwhile, lambasted the ruling rival for sitting out of the National Assembly Act revision, which the majority of the Saenuri Party had also endorsed in the first round of votes on May 29.The NPAD leadership also stepped up their offensive by suspending all standing committee meetings related to the revised supplementary budget.“Today is the day to mourn the National Assembly ... They are nothing more than a mob of rioters,” said NPAD floor leader Lee Jong-kul, referring to the Saenuri Party’s unilateral passage of 61 bills the night before without the attendance of NPAD lawmakers.The Saenuri Party holds a majority 160 seats in the 298-member Assembly. A total of 151 Saenuri lawmakers flocked to the Assembly building late Monday night upon the leadership’s request, just fulfilling the minimum voting quorum of 150.“The ruling party members’ oath of allegiance to the president is an act of betrayal to the people and a self-destructive action forgoing their (right) as legislators,” said NPAD Rep.

A final meeting of the Minimum Wage Council ended in deadlock, with the business representatives absent to signify opposition to labor experts’ suggestion to stipulate monthly wages in the employment contract.  (Yonhap)Currently, only hourly wages are written in the contract, which labor experts and laborers in the council view as giving leeway for employers to dodge legal obligations to grant workers paid time off.If monthly wages are stated by contract, employees would be entitled be paid for 48 hours’ worth of labor when working 40 hours a week, they said.Upon the proposal being presented Thursday last week, the business circle walked out of the talks in protest. The business leaders argued that the stipulation of monthly wages in the contract would cause “confusion,” as it fails to represent the unique circumstances of various industries. The council has failed to initiate talks on how much to increase the minimum wage next year as the standoff over the details continued.The labor unions have demanded a 79 percent rise from the current minimum hourly wage at 5,580 won ($4.99) to 10,000 won, while employers have campaigned for a freeze.The Korea Employers Federation has claimed that the minimum wage has risen too rapidly and it needs to be stabilized, voicing concerns over possible job losses and soaring production costs. The nation’s largest trade unions -- the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions and Federation of Korean Trade Unions -- have maintained that the hike would tackle the nation’s income inequality and spur consumer spending.Since the government adopted the minimum wage in 1989, the Minimum Wage Council, a trilateral committee of employers, employees and labor specialists, has set the minimum wage through discussion. This year, the discussion began in early June with an aim to reach a conclusion by June 29. But as the committee failed to reach a consensus within the legal deadline, it will hold extra meetings on July 6 and 7, with plans to put some agenda items to vote Friday. The government will make public the agreed rate for next year’s minimum wage on August 5.

The number dropped slightly from 2,682 on the previous day.  Since the first case, nearly 16,000 people have been subject to isolation for possible infection. So far, 13,354 of them have been released after they showed no symptoms of MERS that included fever, cough and shortness of breath, for more than the known incubation period of 14 days for the disease.  MERS is a viral respiratory disease that is still new to humans with the world's first case reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012.

101,101,Seoul to decide on aerial tanker bid Tuesday,"South Korea is expected to pick the winner of its 1.4 trillion won ($1.25 billion) project to procure four in-flight refueling tankers at a session of the National Defense Acquisition Program Committee on Tuesday, a procurement official said Sunday.“Included in the agenda for Tuesday’s session is the issue of determining the winner for the project,” an official at Seoul’s Defense Acquisition Program Administratio...","South Korea is expected to pick the winner of its 1.4 trillion won ($1.25 billion) project to procure four in-flight refueling tankers at a session of the National Defense Acquisition Program Committee on Tuesday, a procurement official said Sunday.“Included in the agenda for Tuesday’s session is the issue of determining the winner for the project,” an official at Seoul’s Defense Acquisition Program Administration said on condition of anonymity. “Unless anything else comes in at the last minute, a final decision will be made on that day.”Three competitors -- Boeing’s KC-46, Airbus’ A330 MRTT and Israel Aerospace Industries’ B767 MMTT -- have been vying to win the project to deliver to South Korea two tankers in 2018 and another two the next year.The competition is thought to have boiled down to a two-horse race between Boeing and Airbus, as the two took better positions in the contest than their Israeli competitor, which seeks to sell a tanker based on the secondhand 767 platform originally produced by Boeing.The competition has been neck and neck.  Airbus’ A330 MRTT boasts the ability to conduct a variety of missions including air-to-air refueling, the transport of passengers and military personnel and aerial medical evacuations. It can also carry larger amounts of fuel than its rivals.The A330 MRTT is also an already developed tanker while the development of Boeing’s KC-46 is to be completed in 2017. Britain, Australia, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and France have decided to purchase Airbus’ model.Promoting its KC-46 tanker, a military derivative of the 767 aircraft, Boeing has stressed the importance of interoperability with the U.S. Air Force. Considering the U.S. Air Force is to procure 179 KC-46s by 2027, the KC-46 is the most desirable candidate for South Korea to ensure interoperability with its long-standing security ally, the U.S., Boeing argues.The military has been eyeing a purchase of refueling aircraft since the mid-1990s, as its fighters can operate over vulnerable areas such as South Korea’s easternmost islets of Dokdo for only half an hour. With refueling, combat aircraft could operate for another hour, defense officials said.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","aerial tanker bid tuesday ,bid tuesday south korea ,tanker bid tuesday south ,tanker bid tuesday ,committee on tuesday procurement","['South Korea', 'the National Defense Acquisition Program Committee', 'Seoul ’s Defense Acquisition Program Administratio']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.07912003  0.31356862

Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn speaks at the National Assembly on Wednesday. YonhapThe revised bill on health care law will obligate general hospitals with more than 200 beds to install infection control facilities, including negative pressure isolation chambers for patients with contagious diseases and have medical staff trained in administering the patients with infectious diseases. The package also stipulates the government strengthen countermeasures against contagious diseases and to toughen quarantine measures at immigration offices to prevent MERS from spreading to neighboring countries.The bills are also expected to go through the legislation and judiciary committee before being delivered to the plenary session for a final vote Thursday.Rival parties are also reportedly working on a separate bill, namely the special MERS bill, to create legal grounds for securing a supplementary budget for people and businesses affected by the MERS outbreak, according to officials.By Cho Chung-un(christory@heraldcorp.com)","vote thursday the bills ,syndrome to vote thursday ,to vote thursday ,thursday the bills also ,to vote thursday the",['the National Assembly'],8,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.35645843  0.1723455

Moon Jae-in’s selection of Rep. Choi Jae-sung as secretary general sparked renewed protest from party whip Rep. Lee Jong-kul and the non-Roh faction. The non-Rohs think the dominant pro-Rohs are monopolizing key party posts. Choi and Moon belong to the pro-Roh group.  Moon Jae-in (Yonhap)“I have repeatedly urged the chairman to open doors to the (non-Rohs),” Lee had said late Tuesday, minutes after Moon had finalized his choice of Choi as the next secretary-general. “But the chairman has closed those doors through this selection.”As the next secretary-general, Choi will hold much clout over the selection of NPAD candidates for the 2016 parliamentary elections. The party will seek to overturn the majority held by the Saenuri Party, which has 160 of the 298 parliamentary seats.But the non-Rohs claim that Moon’s nomination of Choi only reinforces the notion that Moon and the pro-Rohs want to dominate the party. If that alleged trend continues, the non-Rohs may exit the party and create a rival opposition party, party insiders said, asking not to be named. Choi Jae-sung (Yonhap) The latest fight comes after mutual suspicion worsened between the non-Rohs and the pro-Rohs in the wake of the NPAD’s defeats to the ruling Saenuri Party in the April parliamentary by-elections. The non-Rohs had demanded Moon to resign his chairmanship after the losses. The party had failed to win any of the four contested seats, stoking discussion that an alternative opposition political force may be needed.Moon refused, triggering the resignation of Rep. Joo Seung-yong from the party’s Supreme Council. Joo was the sole non-Roh official on the party’s top decision-making panel. That fight was followed by acrimonious tweets by pro-Roh Rep. Kim Kyung-hyub, who called the non-Rohs “unworthy of party membership.”By Jeong Hunny(hj257@heraldcorp.com)","factions escalated wednesday when ,protest the chairman controversial ,biggest factions escalated wednesday ,meeting to protest the ,factions escalated wednesday",['the New Politics Alliance for Democracy'],8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.95133072  0.41759479

Hwang will attend as the government representative if the National Assembly approves his nomination Thursday. But hard-liners in the main opposition party could boycott the vote on Hwang’s appointment, to underline their disapproval of Hwang, even though the Saenuri Party’s parliamentary majority likely assures Hwang’s nomination.The NPAD says Hwang is unfit to serve as prime minister, due to his suspected military draft-dodging in 1980 and the millions he made as a lawyer in allegedly illicit profits by taking on cases that his friends served on as judges and prosecutors. Prime Minister-designate Hwang Kyo-ahn (left) leaves his temporary office in Seoul on Wednesday. (Yonhap)The NPAD had initially opposed holding a vote on Hwang at all, citing allegations against him as well as his reluctance to submit his military and income records during his confirmation hearing earlier this month.The NPAD only agreed to hold the vote when the ruling party agreed to create a special parliamentary panel in the House Steering Committee that would work to create stricter penalties against future nominees who refused to submit their military and income records.In his first speech as prime minister, Hwang is also expected to express regret to appease the NPAD hard-liners, ruling party officials said. But key NPAD lawmakers said they would vote against Hwang at Thursday’s full session, hinting that an all-out boycott by the main opposition party could be avoided.“I will try to convince our party’s lawmakers to attend the vote and express their opposition by casting votes against (Hwang),” said NPAD Rep. Lee Choon-suak, the NPAD’s senior deputy floor leader.On top of Hwang’s nomination, the main parties are divided on multiple issues including recent revisions to the National Assembly Act. The changes propose allowing lawmakers to “request” changes to government edicts that appear to violate existing laws.But President Park Geun-hye has threatened to veto the amendments, saying they violated the principle of checks and balances in the government.Pro-Park legislators in the Saenuri Party back the president, saying the president has the authority to veto possibly unconstitutional bills. Some Saenuri and NPAD lawmakers strongly oppose the president’s veto, saying the parliament should be ultimately in charge of the legislation process.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","interpellation session next wednesday ,thursday plenary session ending ,office at thursday plenary ,at thursday plenary session ,minister office at thursday","['Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Saenuri Party', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Hwang']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57003301  0.43112639

The outbreak has resulted in some hospitals being closed temporarily, which is causing problems for people seeking medical treatment.The government said of the total, 17.4 billion won will go directly to support patients and those being quarantined.

They had a phone conversation two days after Park decided to delay her visit, which Cheong Wa Dae said was aimed at focusing on coping with the Middle East respiratory syndrome epidemic here. As the outbreak continued to spiral, controversy erupted over whether she should scrap the trip. Some ranking officials, including top diplomats, opposed a cancellation. But public sentiment appears to have held more sway, prompting senior members of the ruling Saenuri Party to chip in and support calls from opposition lawmakers. During the phone conversation, Obama displayed support for her “decision, judgment and leadership,” relaying his condolences to the MERS victims and their bereaved families, the presidential office said. “President Obama said he has instructed aides to hold consultations at the most convenient and quickest time possible so that her visit to the U.S. can be rearranged,” it said in a press statement. “He also referred to the South Korea-U.S. alliance as Washington’s ‘top priority,’ stressing that reinforcing the partnership on new fronts such as North Korea’s threats, climate change and cybersecurity will greatly help not only the two countries, but also around the world.” Park, for her part, expressed gratitude for his understanding and hopes for an early formal ratification of their bilateral civilian nuclear energy pact that was forecast to be signed by the two leaders during her visit. The allies initialed an amendment to their 1974 accord in April, paving the way for Seoul to pursue reprocessing spent fuel rods through nascent technology called pyroprocessing and enriching uranium to low levels on a limited, consensus-required basis. Obama endorsed the deal Thursday, which he said will promote “common defense and security.” “I have determined that the performance of the proposed agreement will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to, the common defense and security,” Obama said in a memorandum for the secretary of state and the secretary of energy.“I hereby approve the proposed agreement and authorize the secretary of state to arrange for its execution.” After an official signing, the agreement will be sent to the U.S. Congress for a 90-day review, which means it may take up to six months. It will then take effect if it is not opposed.Park has already granted her approval and, unlike in the U.S., no parliamentary authorization is needed here for the pact to come into force.

President Park Geun-hye's office announced earlier Wednesday that Park had postponed her planned U.S. visit to focus on dealing with the outbreak.The outbreak has killed nine people and infected more than 100 in South Korea, but has occurred only at hospitals. MERS spreads through close contact with sick people, not through the air Even so, there have been widespread fears and rumors, and more than 2,700 schools remain closed and about 3,440 people were isolated Wednesday because they have had contact with infected people.``Strong consideration should be given to reopening schools, as schools have not been linked to transmission of'' the MERS virus in South Korea, said a release from the joint WHO-South Korea mission tasked with reviewing the outbreak.Other South Korean doctors have already described the massive school closures as nonsensical because there has been no evidence of the virus' transmission in the community.   It was not immediately known how many schools would follow the recommendation. But South Korean officials hope the outbreak will come under control around Friday, the last day of the virus' maximum two-week incubation period for those infected by a patient considered as the main source of the second round of the MERS outbreak. Officials say the first wave of the outbreak has ended. But critics say the outbreak will continue if infected people evade government quarantine measures and spread the virus.  MERS has mostly been centered in Saudi Arabia. It belongs to the family of coronaviruses that includes the common cold and SARS, and can cause fever, breathing problems, pneumonia and kidney failure.The South Korean outbreak originated from a 68-year-old man who had traveled to the Middle East before being diagnosed as the country's first MERS patient last month.

""Increased caution among citizens kept the disease from spreading far and wide and it was dealt with well.""   Saudi Arabia has also appealed for international help, including from the World Health Organization as well as the United States, in the country's successfully overcoming of its MERS spread, Sheikh said.   The Consultative Assembly of Saudi Arabia, also known as Shura Council, is the formal advisory body of the Saudi Arabian monarch, with the limited power of proposing laws to the king and Cabinet.   Also touching on economic cooperation between South Korea and the Arab country, the assembly speaker expressed hopes for more South Korean firms' participation in the country's mega-size construction projects to be launched.   ""Although there are many competing countries in the projects, I hope South Korea can participate because it's a long-time close country and contributed so much to Saudi Arabia's infrastructure building in the past,"" he noted.

111,111,Korea to push ahead with peak wage system,The government and the ruling Saenuri party agreed Tuesday to push to expand the controversial “peak wage system” into the private sector by mapping out guidelines that enable companies to change employment regulations without unions’ approval. The decision came as part of President Park Geun-hye administration’s drive for labor market reform during a meeting between the ruling Saenuri Party members of the parlia...,"The government and the ruling Saenuri party agreed Tuesday to push to expand the controversial “peak wage system” into the private sector by mapping out guidelines that enable companies to change employment regulations without unions’ approval. The decision came as part of President Park Geun-hye administration’s drive for labor market reform during a meeting between the ruling Saenuri Party members of the parliamentary environment and labor committee and Minister of Employment and Labor Lee Ki-kwon.The government’s plan, however, is expected to add fuel to outrage among the nation’s two largest labor organizations ― the Federation of Korean Trade Unions and the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions ― that view the peak wage system as disadvantageous for workers. They believe the scheme only benefits employers by making it easier for them to lay off workers. Under the peak wage system, companies would pay senior employees reduced salaries after the workers peak at a certain age, generally between 55 and 60, in return for extending their retirement age by a few years. “Amid growing concerns over youth unemployment and job insecurity for the older generation, the peak wage program is needed to create an employment-friendly structure that encourages companies to hire more young people,” Labor Minister Lee said at the meeting. “The focal points in reforming the wage system are ordinary wages and reduced working hours,” Lee said, calling on the environment and labor committee to swiftly legalize the issues in the upcoming parliamentary session this month. With the official retirement age set to rise by two years to 60 next year, the government has pushed ahead with plans to overhaul what it saw as “rigid” labor market to make it flexible for companies to hire and fire people. The government believes that the peak wage program is a key to tackling the youth unemployment problem here. It argues that without such a measure, companies will be even more reluctant to hire new employees, thus reducing room for young job seekers to enter the labor force.“The peak wage system helps senior employees hold on to their jobs until they reach retirement age,” said a research fellow Ahn Joo-yeop from government-run Korea Labor Institute. “When workers in the top 10 percent of the income bracket give up their pay raises, the resources can be used to create 150,000 to 218,000 jobs for the young,” he added. According to the government data, the jobless rate among people between 15 and 29 stood at 10.2 percent as of April, significantly higher than the country’s overall 3.9 percent.But the government’s decision to push for reform plans led to fierce opposition from the labor unions.When the government held a public hearing in Seoul last week to discuss guidelines that will allow companies to change employment rules without unions’ approval, some 200 trade union members blockaded the conference room with desks and chairs to prevent the labor minister from entering. He had to leave the scene about 10 minutes after arrival. Enraged by what the unions claimed was the government’s unilateral decision, the unionized workers chanted at the scene, holding up the placards that read “Stop the peak wage system that forces workers to accept reduced pay” and “The change in employment regulations (without unions’ approval) is illegal and against the Labor Standards Act.” “The government is trying to use the public hearing to show that it is listening to laborers, but (given the history) we know that it is nothing more than a gesture to force us to accept their policies,” the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions said in a statement released shortly before the incident. “Without guaranteeing that employees won’t be laid off and retirement age will be extended in every company, the government is only trying to slash our wages first, taking sides with companies in the name of boosting the economy,” the organization added. Earlier in April, the trilateral negotiations to discuss employment conditions among laborers, employers and lawmakers failed, highlighting a tough road ahead for the government to seek support from the labor circles. The government has already decided to implement the peak wage system for 316 state-run organizations starting next year, with its plans to draw up guidelines to expand the scheme into private sector by the end of June. Meanwhile, the two main labor unions vowed all-out war against the government’s push for labor market reforms. The Federation of Korean Trade Unions will vote in mid-June on whether it will go on an all-out strike to protest the government’s proposal.

None disapproved, while 13 abstained. The Assembly also approved about 60 bills that had been stalled since April due to the partisan stalemate. Various surveys have showed that the changes to the civil service pension will save the government 333 trillion won ($303 billion) over the next 70 years. Saenuri Party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung (right) claps as the plenary session wrapped up after some 60 bills, including the contentious civil pension reform, were endorsed early Friday at the National Assembly. (Yonhap)The reform will raise the contribution rate of public service pensions from 7 percent to 9 percent in the next five years, while reducing entitlements from 1.9 percent to 1.7 percent in stages over 20 years. It would also delay the first payment of public pensions by pushing back the retirement age from the 60 to 65.While most of the details had been agreed upon via special committees and negotiations, the parties have been at loggerheads over the opposition’s demand that the civil service pension reforms be linked to revisions that would increase annuities from the national pension. In connection with the civil servants’ pension reform endorsement, the parties voted to establish a special parliamentary committee and an organization encompassing the social sector to discuss ways to give a face-lift to the national pension fund.Both bodies will be active until the end of October and the special committee could be extended for 25 more days if necessary.The bills’ approval came after drawn-out talks Thursday between the ruling Saenuri Party and the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy over a government enforcement decree of the special Sewol bill. The bill obliges the government to conduct investigations into the government’s failure to rescue over 300 passengers when the Sewol ferry sank in April 2014.The NPAD had charged that the decree allows the government to meddle in the probes by placing public officials in the probe’s executive positions.After hours of a tug-of-war, the parties agreed to a compromise deal allowing amendments to parliamentary rules to enable lawmakers to revise such decrees. Their decision, however, was met with angry response from Cheong Wa Dae and some of the Saenuri Party members, who claimed revising the decree violates the Constitution, signaling yet another round of heavy political wrangling ahead.The Saenuri Party had earlier in the day criticized the NPAD for holding scores of draft bills hostage to its demands.“You cannot hold bills hostage for partisan interests,” Saenuri Rep. Cho Hae-jin had said. The NPAD has unnecessarily delayed reforms to the civil service pension and an array of economy-boosting legislations, Cho added.The NPAD, despite its legislative minority, can stall bills from going to a plenary vote, as it holds the chairmanship of the Legislation and Judiciary Committee. The panel’s chairman is authorized to keep bills from plenary voting indefinitely.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","friday after seven months ,60 other bills pass ,months of boisterous debate ,government to reduce subsidies ,national assembly early friday","['the National Assembly', 'amendment']",8,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.58383536  0.47414738

The New Politics Alliance for Democracy’s ethics committee said it would suspend Rep. Jung Chung-rae from his post in the party for a year. Jung’s remark, criticizing a fellow party member, was brought to the committee after NPAD members filed a protest against him. “Six out of nine members of the ethics committee approved the suspension of Jung’s post for a year,” said Rep. Kang Chang-hee, chairman of the NPAD ethics committee. “We have come to a conclusion after collecting relevant information such as a petition by party members,” said Kang.The move, to be implemented in seven days, will oust Jung from his seat on the NPAD Supreme Council. He will, however, be able to run for next year’s general election as he managed to retain his party membership. Jung, known for being outspoken against lawmakers, came under intense criticism from within the party for his vulgar comments against fellow NPAD Supreme Council member Rep. Joo Seung-yong during a council meeting earlier this month. On May 8, Jung accused Joo of “blackmailing” the party by threatening to resign and blamed him for “sabotaging” the party’s unity. Joo had said he would resign from his post, urging the party to overhaul the leadership after crushing defeats in the April by-elections.Joo then resigned, and NPAD members, mostly nonmainstream party lawmakers, urged Jung to apologize. He visited Joo’s home to mend fences with him. Joo accepted Jung’s apology, but refused to return to the post. Mindful of escalating fractional tensions surrounding the issue, NPAD leader Rep. Moon Jae-in asked Jung on May 13 not to attend meetings of the party’s top decision-making body until the committee reached a decision. Jung complied and vowed to remain quiet until the decision.

Cho Won-jin of the governing Saenuri Party and Kang Gi-jung of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy also agreed to refrain from issuing “provocative public statements” on the reform, so as to minimize partisan fights until a final deal is reached.But they remained divided on whether to link the reforms to revisions strengthening the national pension, a plan backed by the main opposition. The national pension is a social welfare scheme designed to pay annuities to almost all retired South Korean taxpayers. Reps. Cho Won-jin (left) of the ruling Saenuri Party and Kang Gi-jung of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy discuss civil service pension reforms at the National Assembly on Wednesday. (Yonhap)The agreements are also not binding, leaving room for the parties to ditch the reforms this month, observers said.Cho and Kang agreed to pass the draft bill that would vastly downsize monthly pensions paid out to ex-government officials by May 28, the last day of this parliamentary session.The reforms are backed by the Saenuri Party and President Park Geun-hye. They say the civil service pension is liable for over 524 trillion won ($480 billion) in public debt. They add the pension would cause an extra 10 billion won in debt per day, if left unchanged.The NPAD has opposed the reforms unless they are linked to increases in the national pension’s income replacement rate to 50 percent from its current rate of 40. The replacement rate is a coefficient multiplied to the lifetime average monthly incomes of pensioners.The NPAD has demanded that the number be included in any binding agreement on the civil service pension. The Saenuri Party has opposed such measures, saying any binding number on the national pension should be agreed upon in separate negotiations from the civil service pension.But the chief negotiators expressed confidence they would finalize a deal in the coming weeks, before the May 28 deadline.“We’ve made much progress on the 50 percent issue,” Cho said. “The key issue here is whether we will be able to write a bill that the leaders of each party can approve,” he said.“But we’ve made meaningful progress on that.”Kang repeated Cho, saying, there had been “much progress,” and that Tuesday’s deal would be discussed further at another meeting this Friday.A final deal is likely to include the passage of reforms to the civil service pension and a parliamentary resolution authorizing the creation of a panel to discuss how to strengthen the national pension, observers said.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","wednesday to pass reforms ,pass reforms before june ,main parties agreed wednesday ,toward pension reforms representatives ,reforms before june","['Cho Won - jin', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kang Gi - jung', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26784113  0.32260972

Duncan Hunter (R-CA), the section was almost identical to the Hostage Recovery Improvement Act (H.R. 1498) that the lawmaker introduced to the House in late March with support from 11 co-sponsors.It calls for the president to designate ""an existing federal officer to coordinate efforts to secure the release of U.S. citizens who are hostages of hostile groups or state sponsors of terrorism."" The ""Interagency Hostage Recovery Coordinator"" should be named within 60 days after the bill's enactment.While defining the term ""state sponsors of terrorism,"" the bill singled out North Korea as a country that should be considered a terrorism sponsor nation under the legislation, even though Pyongyang is no longer on the State Department's list of states sponsoring terrorism.North Korea was put on the U.S. terrorism sponsor list for the 1987 midair bombing of a Korean Air flight that killed all 115 people aboard. But the U.S. administration of former President George W. Bush removed Pyongyang from the list in 2008 in exchange for progress in denuclearization talks.Calls grew for redesignating Pyongyang as a state terrorism sponsor after the FBI determined the North was responsible for the cyber-attack on Sony Pictures last November, but the State Department was negative about its effectiveness.According to the legislation, the coordinator is tasked with coordinating and directing ""all activities of the federal government ... to ensure efforts to secure the release of all hostages ... are properly resourced and correct lines of authority are established and maintained.""The officer should also establish a task force consisting of appropriate personnel of the federal government with respect to each hostage situation and submit to Congress a quarterly report on each hostage situation and efforts to secure their release, the bill said.

Lee Seok-hyun said. “I hope that the bills we pass today will give some hope to the citizens struggling to make ends meet.” National Assembly Deputy Speaker Rep. Lee Seok-hyun. (Yonhap)Lawmakers passed a bill allowing tax refunds of over 450 billion won ($411 million) for over 6 million taxpayers. The bill aimed to address the public uproar sparked in January over tax revisions made last year that left taxpayers with lower refunds and extra taxes for some. Taxpayers on average will receive a refund of about 71,000 won through their paycheck this month. Two more bills were also passed, with one aiming to strengthen protection for tenants from deposit theft and the other authorizing the issuance of over 1 trillion won in local government bonds to fund public education programs for toddlers aged 3-5.Lawmakers also unanimously passed a resolution criticizing Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for omitting a clear apology, in his visit to the U.S. last month, to sex slaves for the Japanese military in World War II, euphemistically called comfort women. Many were Korean and Chinese.“The National Assembly of the Republic of Korea strongly condemns Japanese Prime Minister (Shinzo) Abe for avoiding an apology on the comfort women issue by making sly statements attempting to downplay the war and Imperial Japan’s anti-human rights stance.” Lawmakers unanimously passed a resolution condemning Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for his lack of atonement for Japan's World War II atrocities. (Yonhap)Another resolution that passed on Tuesday criticized Japan’s efforts to register 23 industrial sites dating to the mid-19th century, as some of the complexes employed forced Korean laborers during World War II. Japanese officials have accused Seoul of “politicizing” the issue.But parties left close to 60 draft bills pending due to ongoing partisan disagreements over proposed reforms to the civil service pension, a state-funded retirement program for ex-government officials.  Opposition lawmakers exit the parliament's main chamber on Tuesday. (Yonhap)President Park Geun-hye and the ruling Saenuri Party support reforms aiming to put a cap on the pension, which has been charged with increasing the national debt. Reform backers say it is responsible for 524 trillion won of the public debt, measured at more than 1 quadrillion won.“The pension reform leaves me with sighs,” Park said at a Cabinet meeting later in the day, in thinly veiled criticism against the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy’s objection to her proposal.The NPAD agrees the pension is in need of change. But the main opposition party demands that the reforms coincide with reforms increasing annuities from the national pension, a government-funded retirement benefit system for most taxpayers nationwide.The NPAD has vowed to keep an array of bills from final voting, unless the Saenuri Party agrees to its demands.NPAD Rep. Lee Sang-min is the chair of the Legislation and Judiciary Committee, the last parliamentary panel that reviews bills before a plenary vote. Lee holds the right to keep bills from going to a plenary session.The NPAD demanded that the Saenuri Party agree to increase the national pension’s income replacement rate to 50 percent from the current 40. The replacement rate is a coefficient multiplied to a pensioner’s average lifetime monthly income.The Saenuri Party opposes fixing the pension to a specific number.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","bills at tuesday plenary ,approves tax refund bill ,assembly approves tax refund ,other bills at tuesday ,session in seoul legislature","['the National Assembly', 'Japan', 'Seoul']",8,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.13981594  0.14918941

Therefore, we could not find any particular reason to withdraw or change our decision,” said an SMOE official. The Seoul office will seek Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea’s consent tomorrow, he added.Under Korean law, the minister of education must either consent or decline the request for designation or cancellation of a special purpose school within 50 days of receiving the said request.Last month, the SMOE announced that two special purpose schools ― Seoul Foreign Language High School and Younghoon International Middle School ― failed to meet the requirements necessary for redesignation as de facto elite schools.Younghoon, however, will not be facing the ax, as it was granted a two-year grace period to comply with SOME’s measures. The school presented specific plans for improvements, SMOE officials said, and will be reevaluated after two years to see if it has followed the plans. Initial expectations in the education circles was that Younghoon may be stripped of its status due to its recent admission fraud in 2013. According to Korean law, any school that is involved in admission fraud can be revoked of their privileges as an elite school regardless of the evaluation results.But an SMOE official pointed out that the clause mandating the automatic status downgrade was added in February 2014. Since the admission fraud occurred in 2013, it is not subject to punishment, he said.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","seoul school stripped of ,seoul school stripped ,school stripped of elite ,school stripped of ,of education confirmed thursday","['Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education', 'SMOE', 'Seoul Foreign Language High School']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38698444  0.56555104

According to government data, Seoul’s ODA increased by 5.4 percent last year to total $1.85 billion. The growth rate was the highest among the member nations of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development.Despite Seoul’s growing ODA contribution, it has yet to implement a systematic program to carry out its ODA projects ― a reason why it has inefficiently distributed ODA to multiple international organizations in small amounts instead of strategically supporting specific countries, the auditors noted.“The concerned ministry had the fund managed by several divisions in charge of international organizations, without rules or guidelines on an ODA strategy or plan,” the BAI statement reads, urging the Foreign Ministry to establish clear guidelines for the ODA implementation. During the inspection, the BAI also found the Foreign Ministry ignored a related law when using the ODA funds. In May 2013, the Foreign Ministry pledged to offer $10 million to the World Bank without necessary consultations with the Ministry of Strategy and Finance, which is in charge of overseas financial contributions.The auditors also said the Foreign Ministry spent $500,000 to launch the South Korea-Mekong cooperation fund in 2013 without complying with proper accounting protocols. Other irregularities, which were found during the inspection, included the ministry’s failure to check overseas missions’ irregular accounting. The auditors also found that 13 professors at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy under the Foreign Ministry earned nearly 300 million won ($275,500) combined at other schools between January 2011 and October 2014 without the needed approval from the foreign minister.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","state auditors on thursday ,thursday called on seoul ,auditors on thursday called ,auditors on thursday ,flawed overseas aid program","['Seoul ’s Foreign Ministry', 'the Board of Audit and Inspection']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.58081585  0.56591493

(Yonhap)Finance ministers from the two countries had met every year since 2006 to discuss outstanding issues, but the meeting was halted after senior Japanese politicians paid homage at the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo that honors Japan's war dead. Seoul countered this provocation with then President Lee Myung-bak's visit to its easternmost islets of Dokdo.  The shrine is viewed in South Korea as a symbol of Japan's militarism and the country's unwillingness to acknowledge it past mistakes. Japan has persistently claimed that South Korea is illegally occupying Dokdo. However, Seoul maintains that territorial claims made by Tokyo are groundless and another sign that the neighboring country has not repented for its past aggression.  The finance ministry, however, said that any significant agreement is unlikely to be reached at the upcoming talks since there has been little improvement in diplomatic relations in the past few months.  In addition, bilateral trade fell 13.9 percent on-year to $18.44 billion in the first quarter of this year.  ""There are no specific agendas to put on the table, with the finance ministers likely to agree in principle to expanding economic and financial cooperation,"" a ministry official said.  Before the planned bilateral meeting, Choi and Aso will meet with China's finance minister in Azerbaijan at the ASEAN-plus-three meeting on Sunday, where they will likely discuss strengthening economic cooperation and the need to be prepared for sudden emergency situations, he added.

This week's meeting is aimed at finalizing the articles before holding the final round of preparatory meetings in Singapore next month, the source said on the condition of anonymity. South Korea sent a deputy finance minister as a chief negotiator to the meeting, the fourth of its kind, which was under way at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, the source said. Details of the AIIB are still sketchy, but the source who has the knowledge of this week's meeting said, ""A broad outline of each member's stake in the AIIB could be visible after the fourth round of meetings in Beijing."" Fifty-seven countries, including South Korea, became founding members of the AIIB, which is seen as a potential counterbalance to U.S.-led multilateral lenders such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank. The U.S. and Japan did not join the AIIB. They are expected to sign the charter of the AIIB by the end of June and start the bank's operations by the end of this year. Last week, Chen Fengying, director of the state-run China Institute of Contemporary International Relations, told reporters that Beijing expects to hold a 44-percent stake in the AIIB. Chen also raised skepticism over the use of the U.S. dollar as a settlement currency for the AIIB.

The money saved can be used to hire more young people.The decision calls for establishing guidelines by May that will affect 316 state-controlled corporations and institutions, according to the ministry.""The move is designed to have the public sector play a leading role on this issue so the private sector can follow suit and forge their own job-sharing programs,"" the ministry said.All employees of public companies will be subject to the new arrangement, with corporations that have already switched to the wage peak system required to make revisions so their rules will conform to the latest guidelines.In exchange for extending the retirement age by a couple of years, those that have been with corporations or institutions for the longest will be required to accept reductions in pay. The ministry said the number of new people to be hired must be at least equal to those employees who get to stay on a few more years because of the extended retirement age.""This can lead to an increase in employee numbers that will be permitted by the government, although the total wages given to workers must remain unchanged,"" an official stressed. ""Each public corporation will be required to come up with ways to best meet these rules.""He said some public companies will likely introduce a wage peak system within this year, while others will have to work out details with workers and be ready to follow guidelines in the first half of 2016.The finance ministry said that the goal is to get the public sector to hire more than 17,000 employees in 2015.

The military will hold a public hearing Tuesday with food companies and nutritional experts before finalizing the plan to update the menu, the officials said.The military is also considering reducing the number of types of MREs to two from the current four. The types are based on how they are prepared ― eaten as is or warmed by immersion in hot water, adding hot water directly or using a self-heating object.The military plans to remove the two types that involve hot water.“The scheme is still in the making. The scheme, which is designed to better meet the tastes of our troops, will be finalized after due process of soliciting public opinion,” an Army official said, declining to be identified.The menu is expected to include Chinese noodles in black bean sauce, fried rice with vegetables and rice with curry sauce.Along with the diversification of the menu, the military also seeks to make the MREs smaller and lighter to make them better suited for combat situations. It will push to decrease the cost of the meals to 3,500 won ($3.24) per unit. Currently, each unit costs between 5,000 won and 10,000 won. The shelf life of the MREs is also expected to be reduced to 1 1/2 years from the current three years, officials said.The military also plans to purchase civilian-made “outdoor” food for some peacetime operations.By Song Sang-ho sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","tuesday with food companies ,hearing tuesday with food ,hold public hearing tuesday ,army officials said wednesday ,nutritional experts before finalizing","['south korean', 'Army']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.11253743  0.46417037

The money saved can then be used to hire more young people.Parties at the tripartite talks exchanged views on freezing the wages of top wage earners, which can lay the foundation for creating some 800,000 new jobs for young people.On growth, the policymaker said South Korea has entered a period where mid-3 percent growth should be viewed as being good.""People should accept the fact that the rapid growth witnessed in the past will never happen in the future,"" he argued.The finance ministry has set the country's growth rate for 2015 at 3.8 percent, which is viewed by many as being too optimistic.On the other hand, he stressed that only by trying to push for reform can growth be nudged up, even just a little bit.In regards to speculations that South Korea will have to mark up interest rates if the United States takes steps to prevent the outflow of capital, Choi stressed that the two countries were facing different conditions.He said the U.S. is leading global economic growth at present, while South Korea's economy is not doing as well, so any action taken should take into account this difference. He said South Korea could move to raise rates, but it does not necessarily have to. Speaking on Seoul's membership into the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the official said a deputy minister level official has been set to represent the country's interests at the upcoming negotiations set to take place early next week in Beijing.He pointed out that China has vowed to ensure that the writing of the AIIB's Articles of Agreement will be undertaken in a transparent manner in line with global standards.

With North Korea’s nuclear program topping the agenda, they discussed ways to shore up peace and stability in the region, as well as Seoul’s initiative to promote peace and cooperation in Northeast Asia. The consultations were arranged after Blinken’s proposal during his visit to Seoul in February. Cho is also scheduled for separate talks each with the two other diplomats. The series of meetings came as Washington steps up efforts ― or pressure ― to bring about a reconciliation between its two top regional allies whose relations have plunged to their lowest ebb amid the Shinzo Abe government’s ongoing attempts to whitewash its wartime history. While acknowledging the need to address past atrocities, a rising number of U.S. officials have been calling for South Korea and Japan to move forward for the future and work together to better counter North Korean threats and tackle other pressing regional and global issues. With the protracted strain threatening to dent practical gains and adding to the diplomatic burden, Seoul has also turned to a two-track approach under which it would strictly respond to Tokyo’s historical and territorial provocations while keeping up collaboration on mutually beneficial areas.Cho has said he would raise history issues and why they must be addressed for greater tripartite collaboration with both of his counterparts. “I’m planning to speak clearly and sternly on historical issues of Japan. Through this, we are making diplomatic efforts so that Japan will act based on the correct understanding of history,” he told reporters upon arrival at Washington airport.“At the same time, we are seeking to promote cooperation with Japan on issues where we can increase our national interests such as the North Korean nuclear issue, the economy and other exchanges.”By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","ministerial talks on thursday ,on thursday in washington ,thursday in washington ,talks on thursday ,thursday in washington as","['South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'South Korea ’s', 'Cho Tae - yong', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Secre']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35243613  0.70202368

South Korea was represented by Deputy Defense Minister Yoo Jeh-seung, while his counterpart was Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense David Helvey.The talks, set to run through Wednesday, are expected to focus on ways to bolster joint deterrence capabilities against missile and nuclear threats from North Korea and measures to follow up on last year's agreement to postpone the transfer of wartime operational control over South Korean forces from Washington to Seoul.South Korea also plans to seek U.S. help over its plan to launch an association of former members of U.S. Forces Korea in an effort to honor them for their service and help enhance ties between the allies. Currently, some 28,500 soldiers are stationed in South Korea to help deter the North.The two sides are unlikely to discuss the U.S. wish to deploy a THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) missile interceptor battery, which has been the hottest defense issue between the two countries in recent months due to China's outspoken opposition.Considering its sensitivity, Seoul and Washington have said that there have been no formal consultations or decision on the issue. U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter also said in Seoul last week that the U.S. is not ready to begin discussions on the issue.Other topics that could be discussed in this week's KIDD meeting include the envisioned revision to the U.S.-Japan defense cooperation guidelines, which is expected to include Japan's decision to exercise its perceived right to collective self-defense. Japan's post-war constitution specifies that its forces are purely defensive.South Korea has concerns about the possibility of Japan sending forces to the Korean Peninsula in the name of aiding the U.S. under collective self-defense in the event of a conflict with North Korea.Seoul has demanded Japan win explicit consent from Seoul if it wants to respond to contingencies on the peninsula. Japanese boots on the peninsula are one of the last things South Koreans want to see due to painful memories of Japan's colonial rule of Korea from 1910 to 1945.The defense guidelines revision is also expected to be a topic for defense talks between South Korea, the U.S. and Japan.

139,139,Gov't to offset any tax gains for low income earners,"The government will move to offset any gains in the tax burden for people making less then 55 million won ($50,750) per annum, following the uproar surrounding last year's tax refund controversy, a senior official said Tuesday.  Moon Chang-yong, the head of the finance ministry's tax office, said supplementary measures ironed out by policymakers are focused on resolving problems found in last year's tax settlement ...","The government will move to offset any gains in the tax burden for people making less then 55 million won ($50,750) per annum, following the uproar surrounding last year's tax refund controversy, a senior official said Tuesday.  Moon Chang-yong, the head of the finance ministry's tax office, said supplementary measures ironed out by policymakers are focused on resolving problems found in last year's tax settlement that inadvertently affected some people who did not expect to pay more taxes.  Under the 2013 tax code revision bill that was first applied to last year's tax refund, the government predicted that the tax burden for high income earners will go up, but those making less than 55 million will stay pat or fall. There were some 13.61 million people that made less than the key amount last year. The government added that on average these people paid 30,000 won less as a result of the tax code change.  Despite such claims, civic groups and the media reports argued there were many people slapped with more taxes.  The official said that the follow-up changes, which will be applied retroactively once lawmakers pass the related bill, will cut the tax burden for 5.41 million people by 422.7 billion won, or roughly 80,000 won per person. The ruling Saenuri Party said it plans to pass the bill this month, which will allow refund payments to be made in May.  ""The move will put to right any unplanned gains in taxes,"" he said.  Moon said 2.02 million people, or 98.5 percent of those whose tax burden did rise despite earning less than 55 million won, will be given refunds that will nullify any gains, while the remaining 27,000 will pay only marginally more.  Despite early condemnation, a detailed analysis of all 16.19 million people who were subject to tax refunds, showed the government's initial assessment was mostly on the mark, according to the ministry.  Related to the findings, Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan told lawmakers earlier in the day that of those making less than 55 million won, 85 percent were not subject to any tax increases, with most of the gains only happening among people making more.  ""Most people who paid more taxes were those living alone, families with three or more kids or households that had newborns last year,"" Choi said.  The finance ministry said some people paid more because the tax refunds given to one-person households and families with many children were cut. It said this oversight occurred because when the tax code was being written, officials based their assessment on average households and did not check special cases closely.

The three parties have reportedly reached an agreement on issues including “ordinary wages,” plans to reduce working hours and extension of the retirement age.However, the dialogue ended in a rupture Tuesday, as labor strongly resisted a government proposal to grant employers more discretion in firing underperforming regular workers. Management, for their part, opposed the labor groups’ suggestion to force them to give nonregular workers regular status if their work is similar to that of regular workers.The committee resumed talks on Wednesday afternoon.The panel, titled the Economic and Social Development Commission, is a consultative body formed of representatives of labor, management and the government.The three-way dialogue was resumed last year as the Federation of Korean Trade Unions, one of the two major union umbrella groups, returned to the panel.The presidential office, meanwhile, pressed the panel to find common ground stressing it is necessary for nation’s economic growth and future generations.“Cheong Wa Dae would keep an eye on the negotiation process,” said Min Kyung-wook, spokesman for President Park Geun-hye. “The office hopes for a meaningful compromise as the people have high expectations of that,” he said.Senior presidential secretary An Chong-bum also urged the members of the panel to make concessions for the greater good.The overhaul of the labor market is one of the reform measures Park is pushing as part of her three-year economic revitalization plan. The president has argued that labor reform is key to job creation, particularly for young people struggling to find suitable jobs at a time when businesses are hesitant to hire new workers.The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said last month that South Korea needed to resolve the differences between regular and nonregular workers in terms of pay and job security to boost productivity and encourage more female employment.The three parties have been locking horns as they differ on how to tackle a divide between regular workers and nonregular workers.The government and the management believe that Korea’s labor market is rigid because regular workers are being overprotected. This, in turn, makes businesses reluctant to hire more regular workers and rely on nonregular workers instead, because they can fire the latter more easily, and employing them costs less.To increase labor market flexibility, the government and the management have urged labor groups to accept the idea of lifting some labor regulations for employers so that they can replace underperforming workers. But labor groups oppose the idea, saying that it would eventually allow businesses seek massive lay-offs and pressure poorly performing workers to accept salary reductions. The idea is intended to force regular workers out and replace them with nonregular workers, which would lower the overall quality of jobs, the labor groups claimed.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","committee had set tuesday ,presidential office on wednesday ,on wednesday urged representatives ,tuesday as the deadline ,labor market day after",[],8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.14661343  0.80121708

They rebuked that only 22 of the party’s 137 lawmakers had been exempted from service while 29 of the NPAD’s 105 male legislators had never served.The party’s spokesperson Rep. Kwon Eun-hee prepared commentary accusing Moon of defaming President Park Geun-hye, who was reportedly not among Moon’s targets of criticism, only to rescind it later and apologize to the rival party leader.Observers said the latest tit-for-tat reflects the overheating competition ahead of the April 29 by-elections. Four constituencies will pick new representatives to the National Assembly.“But I don’t think it’s childish to be having this debate,” Yoon Pyung-joong, professor at Hanshin University, said. “I think it’s good for the public that both parties expose each other’s military records. Both parties know it’s embarrassing to have that many lawmakers who were exempt from military service, often for unclear reasons,” he said.Military service is one of the touchiest subjects in South Korea, which is still technically at war. The country obligates all physically and mentally fit men to join the armed forces for close to two years.Both parties have worked to strengthen their image as a party that prioritizes national security. The Saenuri Party hopes to consolidate its traditional conservative voter base, while the NPAD seeks to rid its pro-North Korea image.Observers called the latest partisan fighting an unproductive one that would have minimal to no influence on the upcoming election.“The debate (over military service) might allow parties to consolidate their traditional support bases, but generally, I don’t think the wrangling is going to meaningfully affect the elections,” said Yang Seung-ham, professor of politics at Yonsei University in Seoul.On Sunday, Moon had added that the 2010 sinking of the Navy’s Cheonan by a North Korean submarine had occurred under the watch of leaders with no military experience.Key members of President Lee Myung-bak’s Cabinet at the time include National Intelligence Service chief Won Sei-hoon, Prime Minister Kim Hwang-sik and Cheong Wa Dae Chief of Staff Chung Chung-kil.

He was 91.The state funeral procession of Singapore’s founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in Singapore on Sunday. (EPA-Yonhap)Lee’s dark brown wooden casket, draped in the red-and-white Singaporean flag, left parliament in a glass case atop a gun carriage, and passed by landmarks associated with the British-trained lawyer’s 60-year political career. The motorcade ended at the National University of Singapore for a funeral service attended by Asia-Pacific leaders and other dignitaries. Howitzers gave Lee a 21-gun salute normally reserved for sitting heads of state, even though he was just a member of parliament when he died. Four F-16 fighter jets from the Air Force’s aerial display team, the Black Knights, displayed a formation known as “The Missing Man,” with one of the planes peeling away to signify Lee’s passing. During the funeral service, his son and the current prime minister of Singapore, Lee Hsien Loong, said that the wealthy Southeast Asian city state he helped build would be his monument.“To those who seek Mr. Lee Kuan Yew’s monument, Singaporeans can reply proudly: Look around you,” Lee said. After the ceremony, his body was cremated.World leaders including South Korean President Park Geun-hye, also gathered in the city-state to bid adieu to Lee, whom they recalled as a visionary and legendary leader.President Park, in her condolence message, wrote that Lee was “a monumental leader of our time” and that his name would “remain forever engraved in the pages of world history.” Park was the first South Korean president in 15 years to attend a funeral held in foreign countries, her office said.President Park had shared a close relationship with the former leader of Singapore and his family since the 1970s when her father, the late President Park Chung-hee, was in power.In 1979, Park, who served as Korea’s first lady after her mother’s death, joined a state banquet held between her father and Lee as a translator.She said in her autography in 2007 that Lee and her wife were like parents who showed affection to her during their brief meetings in the past.Her attendance to Lee’s funeral also drew keen attention from local media over her encounter with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe who invited fresh criticism over his remark on Japan’s sexual enslavement of women during World War II. In an interview with the Washington Post, the Japanese premier called the issue “human trafficking” without specifying the perpetrator, keeping his vague position over Japan’s responsibility for the atrocity.At the funeral ceremony, Park proposed to Abe that South Korea, China and Japan take necessary steps to carry out agreements reached by the three nations' top diplomats earlier this month.Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, Malaysian King Sultan Abdul Halim Mu’adzam Shah and Brunei’s Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah were also among the leaders attending the funeral. Former U.S. president Bill Clinton led the American delegation that also includes former secretary of state Henry Kissinger, a close friend of Lee.Lee was Singapore’s prime minister for more than three decades, ruling with an iron grip until 1990. He is regarded by Singaporeans as the architect of their nation’s prosperity and harmonious race relations, but his authoritarian rule was criticized for restricting free speech, taming media and stunting democracy.Singapore has one of the highest GDP per capita incomes in the world, at $56,284 in 2014, up from a mere $516 when it gained independence. Ninety percent of Singaporeans own their homes, thanks to a public housing scheme launched by Lee, and the country enjoys one of the lowest crime rates in the world.By Cho Chung-un, news reports(christory@heraldcorp.com)","elaborate state funeral sunday ,state funeral sunday thousands ,an elaborate state funeral ,rain many openly weeping ,elaborate state funeral","['singaporean', 'Lee Kuan Yew', 'british', 'southeast asian', 'Lee']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55423629 -0.16869558

The official, not the spouse, would be subject to the relevant punishment. Following Park's approval, the law will be announced to the public on Friday and go into force on Sept. 28, 2016. The bill was drawn up to tighten loopholes in existing anti-corruption rules under which public officials cannot be punished for accepting expensive gifts and services unless there is evidence of reciprocity.(Yonhap)","controversial antigraft bill president ,thursday sanctioned an anti ,park sanctions controversial antigraft ,the legislation in june ,sanctions controversial antigraft bill","['Park Geun - hye', 'Kim Young - ran Law']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42096829  0.3549706

The ministries were launched late last year as part of President Park Geun-hye’s government reorganization plan. The plan was part of follow-up measures devised to address public criticism over the government’s response to the Sewol crisis.The two ministries were excluded from the government’s relocation plan completed last year. Observers say the government could speed up the relocation process of the two ministries because the work requires no additional legislation.The authorities, however, did not conclude on the matters of relocating other executive offices in and near Seoul, such as the ministries of future strategy, maritime affairs and public administration to Sejong City, which observers worry could invite fresh criticism from other officials already stationed in Sejong City.The idea of creating Sejong City was first proposed by late President Roh Moo-hyun in 2002 as part of the efforts to relieve the overcrowding of Seoul by moving the country’s capital to the central provinces of Chungcheong. Former President Lee Myung-bak had opposed the plan and tried to scale down the original project in 2010. It was considered one of President Park’s notable political feats at the time when she, as leader of the ruling party, opposed Lee’s revision, eventually maintaining most of Sejong’s role.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","more ministries to relocate ,said tuesday the decision ,sejong the new ministries ,the government said tuesday ,meeting held on monday","['Seoul', 'the Saenuri Party']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43367857  0.31772923

The foreign ministers from Seoul, Tokyo and Beijing agreed Saturday to improve trilateral cooperation in their rare meeting in Seoul, which was held after a near three-year hiatus due to conflict over their shared history.""(Seoul) has yet to discuss specifics with Japan, but I think there's a need to hold the meeting sometime during next month,"" the source noted. The bilateral director-level security consultation, first launched in 1997, has been stalled for the last five years amid soured South Korea-Japan relations.The two countries attempted to resume the meeting of diplomatic and defense officials in late 2013, but all was in vain due to rising tension over territorial and historical issues under the Shinzo Abe administration. Japan's move to refurbish its defense forces has also fueled regional tension along with Prime Minister Abe's much-denounced visit to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine that year. A resumption of the security policy consultation meeting is widely expected to help Seoul and Tokyo recover their soured relations although they have yet to restore a summit meeting that has been stalled for nearly three years. It is also timed to make Seoul's voice heard ahead of Japan's quickening moves to re-strengthen its military forces.Japan and the U.S. are expected to revise their defense guidelines late next month as part of a legal process needed for the military build-up. The Japanese parliament is likely to start the related legislative efforts around May. The source said South Korea may try to repeat its concern over Japan's military rearmament at the envisioned April meeting as Seoul remains opposed to any military action by Tokyo on the Korean Peninsula without advance approval.

Curtis Scaparrotti made the remark in a written testimony submitted Wednesday to the House appropriations subcommittee on defense amid intensifying debates in South Korea about whether to accept a U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery.  Scaparrotti is the one who brought up the need for a THAAD battery in South Korea for the first time in June last year. The issue has since become one of the most sensitive defense and political issues in Seoul as China and Russia have expressed strong opposition to such a deployment.  ""Due to the nature of the evolving threat, particularly ballistic missiles, it is critical for the alliance to build a layered and interoperable BMD (ballistic missile defense) capability,"" Scaparrotti said in the statement.  ""Each nation has unique contributions to make to missile defense. While the U.S. has an existing layered BMD capability, the ROK is moving forward in the development of its KAMD and 'Kill Chain.' It is essential that we work together to ensure interoperability of alliance BMD capabilities,"" he said.  Intense debates have been going on in South Korea about the THAAD system.   Supporters say the advanced missile defense unit is necessary to meet ever-growing missile and nuclear threats from North Korea, while opponents claim mid- and lower-altitude missile interceptors are enough for the South as the North is unlikely to attack the country with such high-altitude missiles.  Opponents also claim a THAAD deployment would cause unnecessary tension with China.  China has increased pressure on Seoul to reject the THAAD. Earlier this week, Chinese Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Jianchao said in Seoul that the South should take China's ""concerns and worries"" into consideration when making a decision on the issue.  Adm. Samuel Locklear, chief of the U.S. Pacific Command, also said in a written testimony to the subcommittee that the command will continue ""its efforts in maintaining a credible, sustainable ballistic missile defense"" to cope with the North's efforts to advance its ballistic missile capabilities.  ""The recent deployment of long range second TPY-2 radar to Japan (December 2014) along with THAAD on Guam achieving full Fully Operational Capability further enhanced U.S. homeland defense capabilities which are required to protect key regional nodes from aggressive action,"" he said.

Presidential office Cheong Wa Dae on Wednesday officially said no decision has been reached in regard to the AIIB.Because it can compete with the World Bank and ADB, the United States, which controls these institutions, has been critical of the creation of another development bank. Washington has pressed that the new infrastructure bank needs to resolve what kind of labor and environmental standards it will adopt, and how it will deal with corruption.Japan, which is a prominent member of the ADB, has also expressed reservations about the new entity.South Korean trade experts and economists argue that joining the AIIB from the outset can allow the country's companies win orders for projects that receive financing from the AIIB.""Because South Korea enjoys considerable competitiveness among Asian countries in construction and engineering as well as have extensive experience in large scale projects, AIIB membership can open new opportunities for its companies,"" a source at a state-run think tank, who declined to be identified, said.Because the AIIB will likely be more open to funding mega energy projects like nuclear and thermal power plants, South Korean companies could be in a good position to secure lucrative deals, he said.

Kim Moo-sung and main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy chair Rep. Moon Jae-in is expected to kick new life into the debate.“The president and Reps. Kim and Moon also agreed on the need to reform the public service pension,” senior NPAD spokesperson Rep. Kim Yung-rok said of the three-way meeting at Cheong Wa Dae.The Saenuri Party and the NPAD have been at loggerheads over reforming the public service pension for months.The public service pension has been cited as one of the main causes of the snowballing public debt. Some calculations estimate that the pension could absorb up to 18 trillion won ($15.9 billion) from public coffers annually from 2030 if left unreformed.The Government Employee Pension Service asserted that the funds could require more than 8.8 trillion won per year in government subsidies for it to be maintained by 2023, from current levels of 3.29 trillion won.Experts, pension benefactors and lawmakers from both the NPAD and the Saenuri Party have agreed that the pension must be revised, but they have disagreed as to how the funds should be restructured.The Saenuri Party supports a plan that would force senior officials with higher salaries to pay more to the public service pension and receive less after retirement while lower-level public officials would pay less to the pension and receive more after retirement. Government workers, though, have supported a plan that would require them to pay amounts proportionate to their salaries.The NPAD has yet to propose a plan of its own but Moon is expected to present his version in the near future. Moon has proposed they continue the debate regardless of the slated closure of the special committee on May 2.

Unionized government employees have vehemently opposed any changes to their exclusive pension program.  The Saenuri Party has demanded that the government-proposed pension reform bill pass the main floor session scheduled for May 6, which the NPAD reportedly resisted, saying that politicians should have more time to collect public opinions on the bill.  During the upcoming session, lawmakers are also expected to discuss the NPAD's recent proposal to create a special parliamentary committee on constitutional reform.  The session will include floor leaders' speeches on April 8-9, interpellation sessions from April 13 to 16 and three main sessions on April 23, April 30 and May 6, according to the floor leaders.

Yoo Il-ho, named to lead the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, on Monday. Yoo faces allegations of evading 7.64 million won ($6,900) in taxes when he sold an apartment in 2005, according to the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy.A person who has evaded land taxes is not fit to lead a ministry that directs policies on real estate and land, NPAD Rep. Kim Sang-hee charged.Yoo also faces suspicion that he illegally changed the home addresses of his family so that his son could attend schools in wealthier parts of Seoul. Yoo apologized in recent media interviews regarding the accusation.Third-term Saenuri Rep. Yoo Ki-june, picked to head the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, also faces charges that he illegally changed the residential address of his daughter so she could attend a school in a better-off district.

Yim is accused of underreporting a property purchase to pay less taxes in 2004. Unification minister nominee Hong Yong-pyo will attend his hearing on Wednesday. He faces charges of plagiarism and property taxes.On Thursday, lawmakers will examine Jo Yong-gu, nominated to the board of delegates on the National Election commission, the local electoral watchdog.The opposition can delay final approval for the nominees for up to 20 days from the date the presidential office requested the hearings. President Park reserves the right to override any opposition from the legislature, although she risks stiffer Assembly resistance to her policies if she pushes through the nominations over the opposition.Cheong Wa Dae officials sent applications to the Assembly for hearings on four officials on Feb. 25.

155,155,Tough antigraft bill passes Assembly,"The National Assembly on Tuesday passed a landmark anticorruption bill ― ending years of partisan fighting over the details ― that aims to bar all public servants and their spouses as well as journalists and teachers from receiving kickbacks.

The National Assembly voted 226 to four, with 17 abstaining, passing the Kim Young-ran bill, named after the former Supreme Court Justice and ex-chief of the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission who initially proposed it.According to the new law, it will be illegal for officials or their spouses to take more than 1 million won ($908), or an equal amount of gifts, in kickbacks. Those who take less than 1 million won will be fined. Journalists, teachers and civil servants will also be subject to the restrictions. Officials will be obligated to report kickbacks suspected to have been taken by their husbands or wives.Monetary kickbacks will encompass all financial benefits including money, marketable securities, real estate, goods, accommodation vouchers, memberships or coupons.  Public servants leave the government complex in central Seoul on Tuesday. (Yonhap)Providing entertainment including eating out, drinking or playing golf will be restricted up to an amount to be set by a follow-up presidential decree. Honorariums for public servants delivering speeches at seminars or writing contributory articles will also be restricted to a certain amount.The court will be in charge of imposing punishments.The law will take effect 18 months after it is approved by the Cabinet, which is likely to take place this month.Tuesday’s vote came after a compromise between the floor leaders of the governing Saenuri Party and the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy late Monday, wrapping up years of wrangling among legislators on the bill’s details.The first draft, proposed in June 2011, suggested making it illegal for officials or their family members to take a material gift, however small. The bill enjoyed widespread public support, but lawmakers were slow to legislate it, saying the first draft was overly inclusive and harsh.Christmas presents such as game consoles or chocolates could be considered kickbacks according to the draft, critical lawmakers said. The bill could apply to up to 20 million citizens, in a country of 50 million, they added, as the bill included officials’ extended families.But public pressure to pass the bill has been mounting since a ferry disaster last April killed over 300, mostly high school students. Known as the Sewol disaster, the accident was mainly caused by relaxed safety oversight over the sunken ferry’s equipment by maritime officials who took kickbacks from the ship’s owners, initial probes showed. Some lawmakers had taken similar bribes, prosecutors alleged.In January, the Assembly’s National Policy Committee came up with a bipartisan revision to the bill similar to the final version.But parties had disagreed over details until the last minute, such as whether officials and their families would be obligated to report on each other, the scope of family members that would be affected by the bill and the amount of kickbacks that would be considered illegal.Debate is likely to continue over the scope of the bill, mainly over the possibility of excessive control by the authorities. Watchers also criticized the bill for omitting clauses directly relevant to incumbent lawmakers.Saenuri Rep. Kweon Seong-dong claimed the bill would cause distrust within families of public servants. He also alleged authorities could abuse the bill to conduct one-sided investigations into political opponents of an incumbent administration.Other bills were passed in Tuesday’s plenary session, including one aiming to facilitate crowdfunding for start-ups and another extending the central government’s subsidy for the Hub City of Asian Culture project in Gwangju, among others. The HCAC is a 5.3 trillion won plan to build new libraries, theaters and research centers for the fine arts in South Korea’s sixth most populous city.Parties also agreed to set up a special committee to remap voting districts before next year’s parliamentary elections. The Constitutional Court last October had ruled current electoral maps were unconstitutional, as some populous regions were underrepresented in the Assembly.The antigraft bill’s supporters hope it will raise the public’s trust in government here. South Korea’s public trust levels in officialdom fell from 45 percent in 2013 to 33 percent last year, according to the Edelman Trust Barometer, an annual tally reported by Edelman, the world’s largest independently owned public relations firm.South Korea’s fall was one of the largest of the 27 measured countries, as the nation ranked 21st overall. The average trust level was 48 percent.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","tuesday passed landmark anticorruption ,tough antigraft bill passes ,assembly on tuesday passed ,teachers from receiving kickbacks ,national assembly on tuesday","['the National Assembly', 'the National Assembly', 'Kim Young - ran', 'Supreme Court', 'the Anti - Corruption']",8,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.3154079   0.07842141

Ed Royce, chairman of the committee, and Rep. Eliot Engel, the committee's ranking member, introduced the legislation (H.R. 757) earlier this month. A similar bill in the House last year but was later scrapped after the Senate did not act on it before the previous Congress session ended.   The bill, which received a boost from the North's alleged cyber-attack on Sony Pictures, targets the North's access to the ""hard currency and other goods that bolster the Kim Jong-un regime in power,"" the committee said in a statement.    The legislation also calls for the U.S. government to use all available tools to impose sanctions not only on the North but also on countries and companies that assist the North ""in bolstering its nuclear weapons program."" It also has an important human rights focus, as a United Nations report found that the regime's abuses have no ""parallel in the contemporary world,"" the statement said.   ""Last November, with its cyber-attack on Sony Pictures, North Korea once again reminded the world that behind its belligerent rhetoric is a country that poses a very real and serious threat to our security. The legislation we passed today is a direct response to North Korea's continued aggression,"" Royce said.   ""At a time when North Korea is closer than ever to miniaturizing a nuclear warhead, this legislation applies tough sanctions against the regime and its enablers. The legislation also shines a light on the gross human rights abuses Kim Jong-un and his top officials inflict on North Koreans,"" he said.   Specifically, the bill denies sanctioned North Koreans and those facilitating their weapons programs access to the U.S.financial system; targets banks that facilitate North Korean proliferation, smuggling, money laundering, and human rights abuses and targets individuals who facilitated the cyber-attacks against the U.S.   It also authorizes the U.S. president to sanction banks and foreign governments that facilitate the violation of the financial restrictions of U.N. Security Council Resolution 2094, adopted in the wake of the North's last nuclear test in 2013, and requires enhanced inspection requirements of North Korean shipments arriving from ports and airports.

Hikes in the tobacco tax and income tax for low and middle-income earners this year went against Park’s pledge to keep taxes steady, they said.NPAD lawmakers also demanded that the government raise corporate taxes and the minimum wage to close the income gap between the rich and poor. South Korea’s gini coefficient ― statistical measure of income disparity ― is 0.302 as of 2013, according to the Bank of Korea.“Government reforms seem to have helped only the rich,” said NPAD Rep. Chang Byoung-wan. “President Park’s tax policies are also full of incongruities. Do you still think there were no tax hikes, as President Park has been claiming?”“The (tax) rises did not come about from any kind of foul play by the government,” Prime Minster Lee said in response. “We are aware there have been some difficulties due to the raised levies on tobacco.”Finance Minister Choi told lawmakers more taxes would be a “last resort.”South Korea’s public debt is estimated at around 900 trillion won ($820 billion) according to finance ministry figures announced in December. Lower-than-expected government tax revenues for the third consecutive year also add to debt concerns.Outstanding household loans of 1,030 trillion won at the end of December 2014, as estimated by BOK, also worries policymakers. They say more debt could spark a stagnation similar to Japan’s in the 1990s and 2000s. Household credit ― loans and credit purchases ― reached 1,090 trillion won, central bank officials said Thursday.Experts have said South Korea’s deflationary fears could be exaggerated, although others including economists at Goldman Sachs, Societe Generale, and BOK Governor Lee Ju-yeol, have warned private debt levels deserved closer attention.Politicians are likewise divided.The governing party is torn between a faction backing decreased welfare payments by the government and another faction backing President Park’s view that the economy cannot afford additional taxes. They say readjusting tax regulations could bring in up to 135 trillion won in untapped money.The main opposition demands higher corporate taxes and a reversal in Finance Minister Choi’s policies on the real estate market. Choi’s policy of easing lending rules to induce home buying only increases private debt, and is a long-term risk, the NPAD says.The NPAD supports stimulating growth by raising disposable income levels among middle and low-income earners. The main opposition party has failed to come up with a specific economic agenda of its own, however -- a task newly elected NPAD leader Rep. Moon Jae-in has vowed to tackle.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","lawmakers on thursday grilled ,lawmakers question president ,thursday grilled cabinet officials ,policies lawmakers on thursday ,lawmakers on thursday","['Cabinet', 'Park Geun - hye', 'the National Assembly', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Finance', 'Choi Kyung - hwan', 'New Politics Alliance']",8,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.80775833  0.2546902

(Yonhap)The Act on the Prevention of Illegal Solicitation proposes criminal punishment for public officials who receive money, products or services that reach or exceed 1 million won ($910) in value. It is currently pending at the Legislation and Judiciary Committee of the National Assembly. The antigraft act has been in limbo since Kim suggested it in 2012, but resurfaced last year following a ferry accident in April that left over 300 dead or missing. The accident revealed a network of corruption involving both public and private sector officials. Under the growing public outcry against corruption among civil servants, the act was finally passed by a parliamentary subcommittee in January, 17 months after it had first been presented to the lawmakers.But the act ― which originally targeted civil servants ― has become a hot issue since lawmakers expanded the scope of the bill to include the media and private school teachers. Rep. Lee Sang-min of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, who chairs the parliamentary legislation committee, said the lawmakers should accept the original version of the bill. He said that the current version of the act has parts that could be seen as unconstitutional.“It is not appropriate to label (the act itself) as unconstitutional, just because it applies to a wider range of people,” ACRC chief Lee recently said in a meeting with reporters. But he acknowledged that there needed to be sufficient discussion on whether or not to apply the anticorruption act to nonpublic officials as well.In addition, Lee said the ACRC was promoting the enactment of a bill to prevent false claims on public finances that will help the government prevent wasteful budget items. The ACRC is also set to revise an act on protecting whistleblowers, which will encourage more anonymous reporting of corruption in various sectors, he added.The ACRC has been hosting an annual policy briefing for foreign business leaders here, offering them a chance to raise suggestions and complaints about difficulties they have encountered while acquiring information on policy changes. Participants at this year’s event included James Kim, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Korea; Toni Schreibweiss, European Chamber of Commerce in Korea vice chairman; and Hiroe Tadashi, Seoul Japan Club vice chairman.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","thursday held policy briefing ,policies to fight corruption ,watchdog briefs foreign firms ,public officials the korean ,foreign businesses in korea","['Korea', 'korean']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40898144  0.88258439

By law, South Korean presidents serve a single five-year term and cannot seek reelection. From left: Government Policy Coordination Minister Choo Kyung-ho, Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan, Saenuri floor leader Rep. Yoo Seung-min, Presidential Senior Secretary for Policy Coordination Hyun Jung-taik, Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea, Saenuri Policy Committee Chairman Won Yoo-chul and deputy floor leader Cho Hae-jin hold hands for a photo at a meeting of the newly launched trilateral committee on policy coordination on Wednesday. (Yonhap)“We have reached common ground to have the party take the lead in policy drives,” said Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea, who also serves as vice prime minister for social affairs.“Since the National Assembly is important (for the legislation of related bills) and the party is close to the people, it is better for the party to take a center role for smooth communication with the people,” he said after the meeting.At the meeting, officials also agreed to speed up efforts to pass bills aimed at improving people’s livelihoods and revamping the public servants’ pension system, as well as salvaging the ferry in which more than 300 died when it sank last year.The trilateral committee, representing the government, Cheong Wa Dae and the ruling Saenuri Party, was launched last month as part of Park’s efforts to regain momentum for her reform drive and for smooth communication with the party.Since early last year, she has been calling for massive restructuring of the private and public sectors, including the reform of the public servants’ pension system, education, labor and financial markets. Hit hard by a series of political scandals and nomination debacles as well as escalating discord with her party, Park has been seeking a way to bring her reform drive back on track.Experts say that the launch of the trilateral committee for policy coordination may have come from Park’s “accurate assessment” of the current political situation that she will not be able to push ahead with reform plans without support from the party. “So far, Park’s office reigned over the government and the party, and isolated its partners over policy coordination, which in return resulted in public concerns over inconsistent policies such as tax settlements and the health insurance system,” said Yoon Pyung-joong, a professor at Hanshin University.Observers also noted that Saenuri Party’s taking the lead in the committee signifies a shift from Cheong Wa Dae exercising exclusive power in policymaking to sharing power and responsibility with the party. “The president may have decided to lend more power to the party, as she has realized it won’t work without the party’s support,” Yoon said.Rep. Yoo Seung-min, the Saenuri Party floor leader, urged the president, who celebrated her third year in office on Wednesday, to drastically revise her policy directions.Yoo, a nonmainstream lawmaker who defeated former Maritime Minister Rep. Lee Joo-young in the party’s primary vote last month, has been taking a critical approach to the president’s policies, particularly “welfare expansion without a tax hike.”Yoo’s victory was also seen as consolidating Saenuri chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung’s control of the party. Kim is known to be a longtime rival of Park.Meanwhile, Park kicked off her third year in office by holding a meeting with presidential staff.She called for more efforts to initiate economic reform and prepare for inter-Korean unification.The two-year anniversary comes as Park has suffered from deepening public distrust in recent weeks. Her approval ratings dipped below 30 percent last month.

Hwang left for Russia on Monday for a three-day visit.  Hwang said that five countries -- South Korea, the United States, China, Japan and Russia -- have narrowed gaps over conditions for the resumption of the denuclearization talks that also involve North Korea through a series of recent bilateral and trilateral meetings among the five nations' top nuke negotiators.  ""The five countries have built consensus about the need to have 'exploratory talks' to gauge whether North Korea is serious about denuclearization before reopening the six-party forum,"" Hwang told Korean correspondents in Moscow. ""Six-way exploratory dialogue involving the North can be also taken into account.""  Hwang said that the consensus will be delivered to Pyongyang in an appropriate manner, expressing hope that North Korea could respond to such a request with sincerity.  The six-party talks have been dormant since December 2008 when the North abruptly left the bargaining table.  North Korea has demanded the resumption of the six-party talks without preconditions, but Seoul and Washington have said that the North should first demonstrate its seriousness about denuclearization. China, the host of the six-party talks, has claimed that Seoul and Washington should lower the bar for the resumption of such talks.  Exploratory dialogue can be held without strings attached to test North Korea's willingness to abandon its nuke program before the six-party talks formally resume.  The format of such talks can be seen as a compromise as Seoul and Washington stressed Pyongyang show sincerity toward denuclearization, while the North, China and Russia put more focus on the reopening of the six-party talks without preconditions.  But it is not clear whether North Korea will accept the offer by the five nations, given Pyongyang's deteriorated relations with Washington or whether having exploratory talks could lead to the resumption of the six-party talks.  South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se told a cable TV news channel that excluding the North, the other four nations have considerably appreciated the so-called Korean Formula, Seoul's initiative to resume the six-party talks in a ""multifaceted and creative"" manner.  ""We believe that the level to which North Korea can show its sincerity toward denuclearization is neither too high nor too low.

Most of the reforms were implemented from late 2013 or early 2014.  The FTC claimed there was a 25 percent drop in the so-called four major unfair trading practices, with 22.1 percent decline in the number of unfair commercial agreements.  Subcontractors who sign on with major conglomerates have long complained of being forced to accept unfavorable demands, risking losing franchise agreement and other partnerships if they refuse. Many have reported having to endure contractor-determined payments, rebates, supply agreements, product returns and even unauthorized use of technology.  The poll said 80 percent of the small and medium enterprises that make up the bulk of subcontractors responded there was an improvement in business practices last year compared to 2013.  Despite improvements, the corporate watchdog said that contractors have still been found to have engaged in unfair price cutting and coerced signing of contracts disadvantageous to subcontractors.  ""There have been instances where contractors halted asking for sale rebates but demanded other forms of payment,"" an official said.  He said the FTC will increase probes against unfair trading practices and make further changes that will make it easier for subcontractors to report abuse without fear of reprisal.

Peter J. Roskam (R-IL), submitted the bill (H.R.1019) on Friday, according to the records. The legislation is titled, ""To provide high-skilled visas for nationals of the Republic of Korea, and for other purposes.""  Details of the legislation were not immediately available.  But it is believed to be similar to previous bills that had called for issuing up to 15,000 H-1B visas each year to South Koreans with professional skills in such areas as information technology, engineering, mathematics, physical sciences, social sciences, biotechnology and medicine and health.  Currently, such visas are granted to only about 3,500 South Koreans a year. South Korea's government has sought to increase the number, saying the current amount falls far short of the need in consideration of a growing number of South Koreans studying and seeking jobs in the U.S.   In 2013, Roskam introduced a similar bill (H.R.1812), also known as ""Partner with Korea Act,"" and an identical bill (S.2663) was also introduced in the Senate last year. But those bills were later scrapped as the previous Congress expired.  The U.S. allows companies to temporarily hire foreign workers in specialty occupations by issuing the H-1B visa.

Park's replacement of the country's No. 2 leader is seen as her attempt to try and refresh her team as she enters her third year in power.The interpellation sessions will cover political affairs, foreign policy, unification policy and national security, as well as policies related to the economy, education, social affairs and cultural affairs.Topping the agenda are the government's policies on the economy, especially tax and welfare policies, according to parliamentary sources.The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy is widely expected to call for the government to raise the corporate tax rate amid controversy over the government's dwindling welfare budget.Since taking office in February 2013, the Park administration has been dogged by questions about whether it will be able to implement all of the expensive welfare projects she promised without raising taxes.South Korea's corporate tax rate on taxable income exceeding 20 billion won (US$18.1 million) was lowered from 25 percent to 22 percent during the preceding Lee Myung-bak administration.The government has also come under flak in recent months for jacking up tobacco prices, pushing to reform civil service pensions and introducing a revised tax settlement scheme, all of which critics argue are designed to squeeze more money out of ordinary wage earners.The upcoming interpellation is part of the current extra parliamentary session that started on Feb. 2 and is scheduled to run till March 3.

Lawmakers agreed to launch the parliamentary probe amid escalating criticism that many of its investment decisions resulted in huge losses. Meanwhile, Lee’s supporters have claimed that the investigation is part of a “political witch hunt” and that it is too early to declare the initiative a failure.Suh Moon-kyu, president of the Korea National Oil Corp., reads reports to parliamentary committee members on overseas energy investments by state-controlled firms at the National Assembly in Seoul, Thursday. (Lee Gil-dong/The Korea Herald)Rep. Choi Min-hee of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, raised speculations that the state-run oil developer Korea National Oil Corp. acquired part of a Canadian oil refinery by paying more than 1 trillion won ($900 million). The Lee government was aware of the deal but turned a blind eye, he said.In a feasibility report conducted by the Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources, the value of the upstream oil sector of the oil refinery was estimated at $1.61 billion. But the KNOC purchased the sector for $2.77 billion based on its own calculations, he claimed. The opposition lawmaker also accused the then-Energy Minister Choi Kyung-hwan of ignoring the feasibility report by the mineral resource institution and held him responsible for wasting billions of won of state funds. Choi now serves as finance minister. “Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan, who was then the energy minister, didn’t take any action even though he had this report that stated negative views (of the acquisition),” said Rep. Choi. “He should be held responsible.”Rep. Jeon Jeong-hee also claimed that the state oil firm purchased Harvest Operations Corp. knowing that its affiliate NARL, which operates the downstream sector of the refinery, was not profitable. “The then-KNOC president Kang Young-won was asked by Harvest Operations Corp. to acquire NARL and requested GS Caltex to conduct an asset valuation,” the lawmaker said.GS Caltex suggested to Kang that the deal would not be profitable, but he purchased the firm the next day, she claimed.The ruling Saenuri Party, however, defended the project, urging opposition lawmakers not to criticize the previous government’s overall overseas resource initiative by highlighting the parts of deals that suffered losses.Rep. Kim Tae-heum of the Saenuri Party said that the opposition party was attempting to shift the responsibility onto the minister, stressing that the final decision on the deals was in the hands of KNOC executives.Incumbent KNOC president Suh Moon-kyu, denied the opposition lawmakers’ claim that the deal was not a success, saying that South Korea had secured 60 million barrels of oil by purchasing the Canadian oil refinery.“We think that the acquisition of NARL is the only failure,” he said. “Harvest is a company with potential, and we believe that we could absorb the losses in the long term.”By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","run energy companies thursday ,resource diplomacy probe lawmakers ,energy companies thursday ,foreign energy projects lawmakers ,diplomacy probe lawmakers","['Lee Myung - bak', 'Lee', 'Park Geun', 'South Korea ’s', 'middle eastern']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44370419  0.58090997

The initiative was launched with the Korean Federation of Teachers’ Association, Korea’s largest conservative teachers’ group. “I hope this plan will be a turning point for protecting teachers’ rights, allowing them to concentrate on teaching. This will also help establish a foundation of mutual trust and respect among teachers, students and parents,” said Seoul Education Chief Cho Hi-yeon at a press conference held at the SMOE office.The new plan centers on operating the Teachers Rights Protection Support Center, which previously only existed within SMOE, at district-level education offices to make help more accessible for teachers. The center will provide counseling services and support for possible litigation processes.Education authorities will also commission 38 lawyers to provide legal consultation to teachers. The phone consulting service ― introduced in September of last year ― will be free, while fees for face-to-face consulting will be charged to the SMOE.The ideal option, however, would be to prevent legal disputes, noted KFTA chief Ahn Yang-ok. To help work out amicable solutions to teacher-parent discord, SMOE is planning to create a consulting team of retired education workers with leadership or counseling experience, such as former principals and school counselors.“Legal support will be provided to teachers in the case of lawsuits, but the most important thing is to reach an agreement before going to court. For this, the consulting team (of retired teachers) will help with their experience and wisdom before engaging in a legal battle,” Ahn said.But some argued that the 220 million won budget ― which is a tiny fraction of the 7.6 trillion won allocated to the SMOE in 2015 ― would not be enough to provide support to all the city’s teachers. There are more than 70,000 teachers in Seoul, meaning the funding provides a meager 3,000 won per teacher.Further, the budget for legal consultation service is only 2.75 million won, and the SMOE does not yet have a backup plan when the funding runs out.“We acknowledge that the money we’ve set aside is not sufficient to address the issue of teachers’ rights protection. The budget (for teacher protection) will have to gradually increase,” said an SMOE official. A recent report by Sungkyunkwan University professor Yang Jung-ho showed that 20 percent of Korean teachers regretted their choice of job, the highest figure among all members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. According to the KFTA, on average 1,500 cases of teacher rights violations occurred annually from 2011 to 2013, and 643 cases were reported in first semester of 2014.The KFTA report showed that teachers were being subject to physical, verbal violence and even sexual harassment.

Ed Royce (R-CA) and Rep.

The negotiations aimed at persuading Pyongyang to give up its nuclear ambition have failed to gain traction as North Korea conducted nuclear and missile tests.

Ed Royce (R-CA), chairman of the committee, and Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY), the committee's ranking member, introduced the North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act (H.R. 757), Royce's office said in a statement.  The bipartisan legislation is largely similar to a now-defunct bill, which passed the House last year but was later scrapped after the Senate did not act on it before the previous Congress session ended.  The bill targets North Korea's access to hard currency and other goods that help keep the regime in power, the office said. It also calls for the U.S. government to use all available tools to impose sanctions on the North and countries and companies that assist North Korea in bolstering its nuclear weapons program, it said.  ""North Korea continues to threaten the United States and our close allies with its nuclear, missile, and now cyber capabilities,"" Royce said, adding that the legislation targets ""those financial institutions in Asia and beyond that are supporting this brutal and dangerous regime.""   Engel said the legislation would ""strengthen U.S. sanctions and close loopholes"" used by Pyongyang to profit from illicit activities. The lawmaker called for other countries to work together with the U.S. to effectively enforce sanctions against the North.  Efforts to tighten sanctions on North Korea have gained traction in the new Congress as the U.S. vowed to punish Pyongyang after the FBI determined that the communist nation was behind last month's cyber-attack on Sony Pictures.  Early last month, the U.S. government also imposed fresh sanctions on the North, blacklisting three North Korean entities and 10 officials, including the Reconnaissance General Bureau, Pyongyang's top spy agency.

Woo Yoon-keun, floor leader of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, made the call during a speech marking the start of this month's extra parliamentary session, saying the National Assembly should launch a special committee to begin discussions on the issue this month.  ""We should leave open all possibilities, including decentralization and a parliamentary system, draw up a proposal over a year for a constitutional amendment that goes beyond partisan politics, based on the discussions so far, and put it to a referendum during the April parliamentary elections next year,"" he said in his address to the National Assembly.  Woo's proposal comes amid a renewed debate over whether the current Constitution drawn up in 1987 should be amended to change the president's single, five-year term to a four-year term with the possibility of re-election, among other issues.  South Korea introduced the single-term presidency in 1987 after decades of autocratic rule by military-backed presidents. The system was primarily aimed at keeping the president from attempting to hold on to power through illicit means.  ""A constitutional revision is not just a matter of interest for politicians, but a demand of the people, and the people are calling for political stability through a constitutional amendment,"" Woo said.  President Park Geun-hye has expressed strong opposition to the idea of a constitutional debate, saying it would become a ""black hole"" for other pending issues, including the task of reviving the slumping economy.  Citing Park's 2012 campaign pledge to push for a constitutional revision, Woo demanded she publicly acknowledge if she is unable to keep her promise.  The ruling Saenuri Party expressed reservations about the proposal, saying it is premature to consider a referendum on a constitutional amendment.  ""Now is the time to concentrate the country's resources on reviving the economy, not on revising the Constitution,"" ruling party spokesman Park Dae-chul said in a press briefing.

As Moon’s remark sparked a heated controversy, Cheong Wa Dae again reversed its decision the next day, stressing that the minister was expressing his own view and that the government would stick to the original plan. Amid growing disputes over the government’s unclear policies, a high-ranking Health Ministry official told reporters that the government would soon propose a plan to reform the system and consult with the ruling Saenuri Party, noting that the new party leadership has promised to fully support the plan. “With the new floor leader elected, the government and the party are likely to resume talks soon over the revamp of the national insurance fee,” the official said. The ministry’s abrupt decision came a day after Rep. Yoo Seong-min won the primary vote for Saenuri Party leader on Monday, defeating former Maritime Minister Rep. Lee Joo-young, who is considered a pro-Park lawmaker. Yoo’s victory was seen as a power shift in the party’s leadership, as the nonmainstream lawmaker was expected to make critical approaches to the president’s policies. Critics say Yoo’s victory will consolidate Saenuri chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung’s control of the party. Rep. Kim is known as President Park’s longtime political rival.Saenuri leader Kim went head-to-head against Park’s welfare policies earlier in the day, claiming it was impossible to implement welfare expansion without a tax boost.“Welfare without a tax increase is impossible and it is inappropriate for a politician to deceive the public with such words,” Rep. Kim said in speech delivered at an extra parliamentary session that kicked off Tuesday.Welfare expansion was the centerpiece of Park’s presidential campaign.Park promised to provide free child care services and a higher monthly allowance for elderly citizens and to revise the current health insurance program to fairly impose fees based on subscribers’ income level. Park pledged to expand these welfare programs without increasing tax rates. The president appeared confident in her first and second years in the office, as she vowed to create new income sources from the underground economy and curtail unnecessary and costly state-led projects. The Park government, however, came recently under fire as it raised tobacco prices, pushed to reform public servants’ pension system and introduced a revised tax settlement scheme, which were seen as attempts to collect more money from ordinary wage earners to operate the costly welfare policies.“Many voted for welfare pledges when the politicians introduced free child care, free meals and halved tuition fees,” said Rep. Kim. “Everyone applauded the campaign pledge making the state responsible for children’s education and (elderly) care, but nobody cared about paying the bills,” he said.

It is proposed to develop 20 pilot lectures within this year and gradually increase the number to 500 by 2018, according to the plan unveiled in Tuesday’s weekly Cabinet meeting. The ministry will also use existing lectures provided by Korea Open Course Ware, an e-learning service that provides video lectures and reference materials for higher education that was launched in 2007.As of December, 9,628 classes are provided by 183 colleges and universities across the country.The government will be in charge of creating the platform, but individual colleges will maintain the respective courses they provide. People who complete the courses can receive certification.A majority of Korea’s top-tier colleges have shown interest in the 2.2 billion won ($2 million) project, according to a ministry official. The government has yet to finalize a plan to actually grant degrees or college credits for K-MOOC lectures.“The credibility of online learning still needs public approval, so accreditation of courses acquired (via K-MOOC) is something we have to review in the long term,” the official said. But students can still receive credits if a college running online courses incorporates suitable measures, for example by also letting them take offline courses or tests.The ministry hopes that the K-MOOC system will impact the overall tertiary education system in Korea and ultimately enhance its global competence. The concept of MOOCs, which aim at unlimited participation and open access to online courses, was introduced in 2008 and gained worldwide popularity in 2012. Many world-renowned higher education institutes including Harvard University and Massachusetts Institution of Technology provide the open online courses.Compared with traditional modes of education, MOOC has a distinct advantage of being highly accessible for people of virtually all age groups and professions. Simon Nelson, the chief executive officer of U.K.-based MOOC platform FutureLearn, believes learning will no longer be perceived just for post-graduates and occasional training courses at work. “I think we all have to face a world where we need to retrain several times in our lives, and move into new areas,” he said.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","develop 20 pilot lectures ,plan unveiled in tuesday ,tuesday weekly cabinet meeting ,launch new online platform ,unveiled in tuesday weekly","['the Education Ministry', 'korean', 'Cabinet', 'Korea']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53366792  0.45856723

Last week, Park's approval rating dropped to an all-time low of 29 percent in the Gallup poll.  Park also called on officials to make thorough preparations before implementing policies and to make sure that even small side effects won't occur.  ""I hope that the presidential office and the Cabinet will strengthen prior consultations and coordination"" Park said in a Cabinet meeting.  The comments came two days after the government announced a plan to launch a joint consultative body meant to better coordinate policies between the Cabinet and the presidential office.  She also called on officials to ensure that legislations meant to root out child abuse at daycare centers pass through parliament this month.  A series of child abuse incidents took place at some daycare centers, including one in which a female teacher was seen in footage from security cameras punching a 4-year-old girl on the side of her head. The girl fell on the floor with her two legs up in the air.  The incident has caused a national uproar, prompting the government and the ruling Saenuri Party to unveil a set of measures to toughen punishment for child abuse at daycare centers.  Also Tuesday, Park expressed gratitude for the first wave of health care workers who have returned home after treating patients in Ebola-hit Sierra Leone for about one month.

The new measure was announced Tuesday after public outrage escalated over several child abuse cases in preschool facilities. Currently, anyone who completes over 65 credits of courses at a college-affiliated academy can work as a day care teacher. As of this month, more than 86,000 people have been certified, with some 22,000 working in day care. In order to toughen the qualifications, the government will require a set curriculum and a personality test for those who seek to take the national day care exam, the Welfare Ministry said. Childcare workers swear an oath at an anti-abuse training program held in Seoul on Jan. 22. (Yonhap)In the long term, the ministry will push to restrict the exam applications to those who major in child-related studies, officials said. Earlier this month, three female workers were arrested for allegedly hitting children under 5 for not finishing meals or following the class. One of them had even put wet tissues in the mouth of a 22-month-old, police said.In addition to introducing the new state exam, the government will require all child care facilities to install surveillance cameras, the ministry said. Those without cameras will be barred from operations.The surveillance camera requirement had been pushed at the National Assembly in 2010 but failed to pass the welfare committee after some lawmakers expressed concerns over privacy of day care employees.The government will also double the reward for child abuse whistle-blowers to 20 million won ($18,500) to increase detection, officials said. The ministry will also raise the number of assistant teachers at facilities to reduce the workload of day care workers while improving care quality. “About 6,500 assistants will be provided nationwide and all costs will be borne by the state. While it is under discussion, around 200 to 300 billion won is expected to be earmarked for the move,” a ministry official told media. Along with more workers, the ministry will open 450 additional public day care centers by 2017 in order to handle the high need from parents, officials said. All these new regulations will be submitted to the parliament next month, officials added. Meanwhile, the police authorities vowed to strengthen penalties against those who interfered in child abuse investigations. Dispatched investigators have complained over difficulties in conducting inquiries into child abuse cases. There have been no legal punishments against people who refuse to help investigations. A one-year jail term or a fine of up to 5 million won will be levied for obstructing a police investigation into child abuse allegations, authorities said.

Lee Wan-koo as the new prime minister on Friday in a surprising decision seen as an attempt to lift her falling public support.(Yonhap)Cheong Wa Dae also announced lists of three new senior presidential secretaries and four new special advisors as part of Park’s reorganization plan. The president, however, decided to retain Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon for the time being, despite persistent demands from political parties to sack him for allegedly exercising too much power in state affairs and personnel choices.Rep. Lee will replace Chung Hong-won after parliamentary approval is granted. South Korea’s prime minister is the nation’s second-highest post, but serves a ceremonial role as power is heavily concentrated in the president. Chung, the first prime minister of the Park administration, retained his post after two of Park’s choices to replace him withdrew their nominations over ethical breaches.“President Park Geun-hye accepted Chung’s resignation as he offered to resign several times and nominated Rep. Lee as the new prime minister,” said Yoon Doo-hyun, senior presidential secretary for the press.“The nominee has a deep understanding of the president’s philosophy in running state affairs and has contributed to normalizing the operation of the National Assembly by (leading) smooth cooperation with the opposition party,” Yoon said.In an acceptance speech, Rep. Lee vowed to devote himself to the people and steer the government’s drive to bring about economic reform, and to enhance communication with the main opposition parties.“If I become prime minister after obtaining parliamentary approval, I will devote myself to reviving the economy,” Rep. Lee said.The politician, who served as governor of South Chungcheong province, said he was offered the post late Thursday evening and accepted the nomination in the morning.“After much thought, I accepted to the nomination to support President Park, and also for the country and the people,” he said, adding that he would become a prime minister who could speak frankly to the president about state affairs.Park also named Woo Byung-woo as new senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, and Cho Shin, a Yonsei University professor, as new senior presidential secretary for future strategies. Hyun Jung-taik, the former head of the state-run Korea Development Institute, was tapped as new senior presidential secretary for policy coordination.The president also named four experts as special advisors assigned to give her direct advice on state affairs.Shin Sung-ho, former deputy managing editor at the JoongAng Ilbo, was appointed as new presidential advisor for public relations; Lee Myung-jae, former prosecutor-general, as new advisor for civil affairs; Kim Sung-woo, a director at Seoul Broadcasting System, as new advisor for social and cultural affairs; and Lim Jong-in, a Korea University professor considered one of the leading experts on cyberterror, as her special security advisor.Cheong Wa Dae said that the office would announce more special advisors later including one for political affairs, and the nominee for the Maritime Minister post, which has been vacant since last year.The president decided to retain Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon though he has been pressured to step down since last year by the opposition parties, who held him responsible for a series of incidents including a Blue House document leak and the so-called “Chung Yoon-hoi scandal.” Park also kept three secretaries, known as “doorknobs to the president,” who have been accused of holding secret meetings with Chung Yoon-hoi, an aide to Park years ago, and exchanging confidential information with him. The prosecution earlier this month concluded that media reports about the scandal were groundless and the document suggesting Chung’s involvement was fabricated.Earlier this week, Park said she would carry out a “small-scale” Cabinet reshuffle and partially reorganize the presidential office as she seeks to regain public confidence to push ahead with her economic reform drive. According to a local pollster, her job rating plunged to 30 percent this week, the lowest level since she entered office in early 2013.Earlier, many expected that Park would retain Prime Minister Chung and replace Kim Ki-choon instead. But Park’s surprising decision appears to have been made due to a fierce public backlash over the government’s new tax settlement scheme.The Park government has come under fire as some people with an annual income of less than 55 million won ($50,700) will have to pay additional taxes this year due to a new tax scheme.In an emergency meeting, the government and the ruling party have agreed to expand tax credits to appease the angry public.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","new senior presidential secretaries ,new president park geun ,three new senior presidential ,reorganization plan the president ,prime minister on friday","['Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party ’s', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Dae', 'Park ’s']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.94258928  0.78259426

During its New Year’s policy briefing to President Park Geun-hye, Defense Minister Han Min-koo said the ministry would push to incorporate into military operations innovative technologies such as ICT, big data solutions and the Internet of Things, under the “Creative Defense” vision.Capitalizing on the country’s technological savviness, the ministry will step up efforts to develop future weapons systems such as combat equipment using laser beams and electromagnetic waves, and unmanned platforms, he said.“In consideration of the limited defense resources and various security threats, we will push to come up with more creative, innovative ways to manage our military, going beyond the old approach that was mainly about catching up with others rather than moving ahead of them,” Han told reporters after the policy briefing at Cheong Wa Dae.“Creative defense means creating new defense values through a significant change that will be brought about by infusing humans’ creative thinking and cutting-edge technologies into all aspects of defense-related tasks.”Touching on the criticism that the initiative seems to be something carved out of a sci-fi novel, Han noted that the vision, devised to support President Park’s “creative economy” vision, was a mid- or long-term one that would require much time and effort. “We can’t say, for now, by when we can fulfill that vision in terms of developing the type of future weapons employing state-of-the-art technologies. But this is the policy direction we are pushing for,” he said.The ministry plans to focus on developing what it terms “reverse asymmetric weapon systems” ― which North Korea cannot develop due to its technological limitations ― to neutralize Pyongyang’s nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction.Among the weapons under development are high-power microwave (HPM) weapons and electromagnetic pulse (EMP) bombs, which are expected to be developed by the early 2020s. The ministry is also considering the development of laser-based weapons.HPM, known as an “E-bomb,” can spew out massive electromagnetic power to damage all electronic devices within around 300 meters, experts say. EMP also unleashes a high-intensity burst of electromagnetic energy that causes severe current and voltage surges to damage adjacent electronic devices. South Korea’s state-run Agency for Defense Development has been researching and developing the EMP weapons systems. These weapons that are designed to disrupt operations of electronic devices and paralyze social infrastructures are called “soft-kill” weapons, compared with “hard-kill” weapons such as missiles that directly strike enemy targets. The ministry said it would build the soft-kill capabilities through close technological cooperation with the civilian sector.Under the creative defense drive, the ministry also envisions a future “smart soldier system” equipped with a host of digital devices such as a high-tech communications tool, a night-vision combat-control helmet and an Internet-linked battle suit.It is also considering paying more attention to developing unmanned battle systems including robots for combat deployment, surveillance tools and unmanned boats that would ensure fewer human losses and greater operational efficiency.Despite the combat advantages that the ministry anticipates from the new vision, critics argue that there should be plans to finance it, and that the vision lacks details on how to realize its objectives.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","monday unveiled new defense ,ministry on monday unveiled ,unveiled new defense vision ,defense ministry on monday ,new year policy briefing","['South Korea ’s', 'Defense Ministry', 'north korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Defense', 'Han Min - koo']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.16986652  0.44171634

(Yonhap)Following a controversial child abuse case involving a day care worker in Incheon, the ruling Saenuri Party and the government announced a joint plan to protect children’s rights on Friday.The 33-year-old worker, surnamed Yang, was taken into police custody on Thursday after surveillance video footage was revealed of her harshly beating a 4-year-old for not finishing her food.“This case is the most shocking incident since the Sewol disaster,” said ruling party leader Kim Moo-sung. “We have to protect children’s safety in order to tackle the country’s low fertility rate as well.”Together with the Saenuri Party, the Welfare Ministry plans to implement measures to combat child abuse at day care centers, such as making surveillance camera installation mandatory for all children’s institutions, as well as strengthening qualifications for staff. Any day care center would be immediately shut down should it be caught engaging in abuse, the ministry said. Care providers who have been reported or punished for child abuse will be suspended from their profession for 10 years. “We will try to implement these measures as soon as possible,” an official from the ministry said. The police on Friday requested an arrest warrant for Yang on charges of child abuse. Investigators said they would also summon the day care center’s president for questioning. Parents of four other children also reported Yang’s abuses. The Welfare Ministry on Thursday revoked the licenses of the institution, Yang and its head. While Yang admitted she had hit the child, as shown in the video, she denied the rest of the charges. She reportedly told the police that she “loves children very much,” and this was the only time she had struck a child.Under the current child welfare act, Yang could be sentenced to a maximum of five years in jail or fined up to 30 million won ($27,800). “The head of the center can also be punished if it is found that she was aware of Yang’s abusive behavior and did not take any actions,” said an official from the Welfare Ministry.The government plans to turn the center into a public day care institution, although most of the parents have already decided to send their children elsewhere.The Welfare Ministry has also been publicly criticized over the case as the center in Incheon earned 95.3 out of 100 points when assessed by the government.“I understand this specific case has escalated anxiety among working parents, and as someone who is responsible for the country’s welfare programs I am sorry that this happened,” said Welfare Minister Moon Hyung-pyo on Friday. “The government will do its best to make sure something like this never happens again.”In the video footage, Yang tells the child to finish the kimchi she left on her food tray. When the girl spits it out, Yang slaps her in the face, causing her to fall on her back. Other children are seen to be kneeling fearfully on the floor together.According to government data, a total of 6,796 child abuse cases were reported last year. Among them, about 10 percent of all abusers turned out to be day care workers and staff at children’s institutions, while 80 percent were parents.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","thursday after surveillance video ,police custody on thursday ,friday following controversial child ,police agency on friday ,children rights on friday","['Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency', 'Incheon', 'Saenuri Party', 'Yang']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36765996  0.17696987

The move was seen as Cheong Wa Dae’s attempt to settle the dust first, as it came without conducting an internal inquiry into the case. Saenuri Party leader Kim Moo-sung. (Yonhap)The presidential office is also likely to speed up the reshuffle of secretaries to clear the air for Park’s reform drive, tighten discipline in the office and mend ties with the party.Lee Jun-seok, a party member, claimed that he heard Eum accusing the Saenuri chief of being behind the scandal, at a dinner the two attended last month. Lee said he relayed the remark to the party chief last week. The case, however, brewed a political storm after a photograph showed Rep. Kim’s written memo, which read “K and Y are behind the ‘document gate.’” “K” is said to stand for the ruling party leader and “Y” for Saenuri Rep. Yoo Seong-min.The ruling party, for its part, also avoided commenting on the issue during a supreme council meeting in the morning, in contrast to their fierce arguments that surprised the public the day before. On Wednesday, Lee Jae-oh, a well-known Park opponent, clashed with Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, former senior press secretary, raising speculations that it was a reflection of the party’s overarching factional feud. Pro-Park lawmakers including Lee Jung-hyun were absent from the meeting, claiming they had other important matters to attend to. The Saenuri chief also refused to respond to reporters’ questions, a contrast to his gruff reaction to the allegation, calling it “nonsense,” the day before.Despite the efforts, the scandal is widely expected to further damage the strained ties between the party and Cheong Wa Dae, namely Kim and Park. According to sources, the party sees the case as an attempt by presidential staff to bring down the Saenuri chairman, who has had a love-hate relationship, with Park for years. Park and Kim reportedly have been at odds, although they tried to sweep their strained relations under the carpet.Kim’s comment on constitutional revision late last year, in particular, roiled Park as it came only some days after she urged politicians not to discuss it, stressing that the issue would swallow urgent economic issues. Some observers also raised concerns that the Cheong Wa Dae-Saenuri relationship would further deteriorate as Eum and Lee Jun-seok started to engage in a fierce battle, returning the public focus to the scandal.The scandal began to surface last November after presidential papers that investigated Chung Yoon-hoi, Park’s former secretary, were leaked to a local daily. The papers alleged that Chung had meddled in government affairs and personnel decisions using his close ties to incumbent Cheong Wa Dae officials. Eum is one of the presidential officials embroiled in the scandal. Eum claimed that Lee fabricated his remarks, and said he is carefully considering disclosing KakaoTalk messages that he exchanged with Lee.Lee said in a radio interview that he relayed Eum’s remark to Kim Moo-sung in an effort to make things right. He said he was worried that Eum’s remark could slander the reputation of the party chief. However, questions remain on how Lee would stick to his claim as others who attended the dinner at that time said they never heard Eum accusing Rep. Kim of being behind the scandal.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","off recent political scandal ,recent political scandal ,recent political scandal involving ,ice over scandal tension ,saenuri party on thursday","['Cheong', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Eum Jong - hwan']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68036115  0.45461071

The agriculture and oceans ministries and the Fair Trade Commission also joined the briefing.“Although public enterprises have reduced debt and employee benefit packages, the people are still not satisfied with their productivity and efficiency,” Park told the ministries.President Park Geun-hye“I urge the Finance Ministry to lead other ministries to actively push forward reforms in the public sector without retreating and causing a ‘yo-yo syndrome.’”The Finance Ministry said that it would further push state-owned enterprises to reduce debt and completely root out reckless management, and either merge or shut down overlapping businesses by 2016, a year ahead of its initial schedule.Park also called for ensuring flexibility in the labor market, saying reform in the sector was the most important task for building a strong economy under the three-year economic reform plan aimed at boosting the annual growth rate to 4 percent and achieving more than $40,000 per capita income.The Labor Ministry said it would have state-run enterprises adopt a wage peak system and expand a performance-based bonus and pay system so that the private sector could follow suit. The ministry said that the performance-based measure would apply to those who had worked more than seven years at state-owned enterprises.“We will closely evaluate the functions and businesses of public enterprises on whether they are appropriately aligned with the world’s trends, and seek to convert them to focus on core assets as a means of raising productivity and efficiency,” Vice Finance Minister Joo Hyung-hwan told the press.He added that the government would move to allow irregular workers to easily gain regular status based on their performance and skills in the public sector as part of the efforts to boost labor market flexibility.Also, the government will encourage private construction companies to run home-rental businesses by offering tax incentives in line with efforts to increase housing supply and stabilize apartment prices.The Land Ministry said measures would include guaranteeing profit margins of above 5 percent for private home-rental companies, and raising tax cuts from 25 percent to up to 50 percent for acquisition taxes for private companies that buy houses and rent them out to middle-class families. The government will help convert mid-income earners’ mortgages worth some 40 trillion won into long-term loans with fixed interest rates, while providing financing of more than 20 trillion won to tech startups and midsize companies.The Finance Ministry noted that the government might need to readjust its state budget in line with its economic reform plan as there would be changes at state-run organizations.

Choi served in Lee's Cabinet when he was in office.Amid opposition from the ruling party, the two sides agreed last week to postpone a decision on the issue until after the field inspections.Also during the plenary session, the parties passed a bill calling for government compensation for the families of victims and survivors of April's ferry sinking that left more than 300 people dead or missing. Most of the victims were high school students on a field trip to the southern resort island of Jeju.The bill also calls for government scholarships for students who survived the disaster.Meanwhile, a controversial anti-corruption bill that passed through a parliamentary subcommittee last week will be prioritized during February's extraordinary session, officials from both parties said.The so-called Kim Young-ran Law calls for punishing public officials who are caught taking money or valuables worth more than 1 million won ($912) even if they were not in exchange for favors.Kim, who first proposed the legislation in August 2012, is a former Supreme Court justice and a former head of the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission.The bill is intended to tighten loopholes in existing anti-corruption rules that punish public officials only when they receive bribes in connection with their work.The bill has stirred up a heated debate about whether the law makes civil servants reluctant about performing their duties because of the fear of punishment.

The so-called Kim Young-ran bill was passed by a parliamentary subcommittee last week and is expected to be put to a final vote at a plenary session next month. Under the new law, which will take effect in January 2016, public servants and their families will be punished when they receive 1 million won ($910) or more in cash or equivalent gifts, even as birthday or Christmas presents.The bill was named after the former Supreme Court justice and chairwoman of the Anti-corruption and Civil Rights Commission who first proposed it in June 2011.Kim’s initial bill failed to pass the Assembly. The incumbent Park Geun-hye administration submitted a revised package in August 2013 under the same name. The National Assembly convenes a plenary session on Dec. 29. (Yonhap)Public support for the bill has been high, especially in the weeks following the Sewol ferry accident in April last year that killed more than 300, most of them high school students.Investigation found that maritime regulators had chronically condoned safety violations of private industry officials in return for kickbacks, or “special treatment.”But lawmakers have dragged their feet over legislating the bill, wrangling over details such as whether nonpublic servants would be included, or what sum could be considered a bribe.The bill, as passed by the National Policy Subcommittee last week, will include nongovernment public interest groups such as members of the media and teachers at private schools as those subject to bribery penalties.Officials caught receiving bribes of less than 1 million won will be fined.The bill defines monetary gifts as “all deposits, products or services that can be considered monetary in nature.” It also gives special exceptions to those giving financial gifts to public institutions in the form of donations that will be used for public purposes.Due to the comprehensive nature of the bill, up to 20 million people or about 40 percent of the nation could be affected.The bill also intends to make it easier for courts to punish bureaucrats suspected of receiving illicit money. According to current laws, prosecutors must prove that a suspected official received monetary gifts for a specific purpose. The bill will allow courts to incriminate officials if they receive money from interest groups, even if the money was not taken for any specific objective.The original version of the bill had proposed stricter measures, suggesting that all public officials receiving money, regardless of the amount, should be punished. The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy initially supported the original version but agreed to set the bar at 1 million won, after the governing Saenuri Party asserted the bill would have unwanted side effects, such as the punishment of those giving innocent low-cost gifts.In the Corruption Perceptions Index released by Transparency International last year, Korea ranked No. 43 among 175 countries surveyed and No. 27 among the 34 members of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","parliamentary subcommittee last week ,toughest ever law against ,nation toughest ever law ,toughest ever law ,plenary session next month","['the National Assembly', 'Kim Young - ran']",8,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.50795168  0.06964567

Between 2006 and April last year, the arms procurement agency designated more than 90 percent of 449 defense articles without demand analysis and due deliberation by letting its officials in charge of promoting the industry give permission arbitrarily.The authorities also failed to develop indigenous technologies to produce key parts, causing concerns over its possible negative impact on maintaining the country's combat power.""The DAPA and the commerce ministry failed to play its role of supervising and managing defense companies, while unjustifiably providing subsidies mostly to large companies,"" the auditor said.Apart from the audit, the government launched a massive probe into alleged corruption in the defense industry in November, after President Park Geun-hye denounced corrupt dealings in defense acquisition programs as ""actions serving the interests of the enemy"" and vowed to impose ""exemplary punishment"" to root them out.

The fine for smoking indoors at public restaurants or coffee shops is now 100,000 won, while shop owners who allow indoor smoking can now be fined up to 5 million won.But cigarette displays at local retail stores were already empty on the first day of the year, as smokers hoarded cigarettes before the price hike took effect. Local store owners saw it as a bad omen.“It’s not good for business,” a store owner in downtown Seoul said when asked about her empty cigarette stalls. “I wish I had some packs to sell, but they’re all out, and I won’t get any new deliveries until Saturday.”Other store owners reported only a few sales, or none at all, on Thursday.Tobacco industry officials were rumored to be warning local retailers to prepare for a cold winter, as the price hike was expected to depress sales and revenue and persuade more smokers to try to quit. But revenue could rebound later this year, as smokers who initially try to quit resume their habits, analysts said.Small retail shops across Korea generally depend on cigarettes for up to 60 percent of their revenue. But with the increase in prices, some local stores could shut down, or suffer hits in their sales.“Every time we sell a pack, we take about 3 to 5 percent of the entire cost,” one local 7-Eleven owner said. “But with the price rise, the increase in revenue will not make up for the loss in total sales.”There were also some price discrepancies. Products from British American Tobacco Korea and Japan Tobacco International Korea maintained their old prices.The two companies are taking longer to finalize new price arrangements, as their headquarters are outside Korea.A JTI Korea official said the company will need time to decide how much to raise their prices, as the recent tax hike was a ""crucial matter."" BAT Korea officials were not available for comment.Critics reportedly accused BAT Korea and JTI Korea of unfairly dodging the new regulations by delaying their price hikes.But officials from the two companies reportedly said they were actually playing a losing game, as they were subject to higher taxes while their revenues remained the same.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","thursday raising cigarette prices ,related taxes last month ,smoking related fines nationwide ,taxes last month ,effect thursday raising cigarette",[],8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.05638992  0.09779987
