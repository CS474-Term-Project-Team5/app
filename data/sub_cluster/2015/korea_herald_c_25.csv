Currently, the Air Force Operations Command has geographically arranged units such as the Southern and Northern Combat Commands.The Air Combat Command, which is expected to be stationed in Daegu, will be in charge of running fighter jets, officials said. The Air Mobility and Reconnaissance Command, which is likely to be located in Osan, Gyeonggi Province, will be in charge of operating transport, reconnaissance and trainer aircraft.The need for an overhaul of the command structure has been raised for some time with officials and experts arguing that in the small operational zone of the Korean Peninsula, dividing the command structure according to region was not suitable for optimal aerial operations. In an emergency, F-15K fighters, based in Daegu, and KF-16s, based in Seosan, South Chungcheong Province, are to be mobilized for the same mission, which means the function-based command structure would better cope with aerial threats than specific commands for different regions. The change in the command structure has been caused mainly by Seoul’s recent and future procurement of a series of advanced Air Force assets, including airborne command and control aircraft, which have increased operational mobility and flexibility, and decreased the need to divide operational areas according to region. The South Korean military plans to introduce refueling tankers, high-altitude and low-altitude unmanned reconnaissance aircraft and stealth fighter jets, which will increase the need for a function-based command structure.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","officials said tuesday the plan ,the air force will reorganize ,aerial operations officials said tuesday ,military plans to introduce refueling ,endorsed at the cabinet meeting","['the Air Force', 'Cabinet', 'Park Geun', 'the Air Force Operations Command', 'the Air Combat Command', 'the Air Mobility & Reconnaissance Command', 'the Air Force Operations Command', 'southern', 'the Air Combat Command', 'Daegu', 'the Air Mobility and Reconnaissance Command', 'Osan', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Daegu', 'KF-16s', 'Seosan', 'South Chungcheong Province', 'Seoul', 'Air Force', 'south korean', 'Song Sang - ho']",0,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.44550198  0.6035136

The device turned on the exhaust gas recirculation system in the indoor test to fake the emissions levels and turned off the system in actual outdoor driving conditions, meaning excessive emissions were not detected, it said. This is the first time that Volkwagen’s emissions rigging has been officially confirmed outside the U.S. (AP-Yonhap)The ministry launched its own test last month to check whether six types of the diesel-engine Volkswagen vehicles sold here -- two Euro 5 cars and four Euro 6 vehicles -- met the emission standards in outdoor and indoor driving tests. “(The ministry) has not found the defeat device in the EA288 engine-equipped vehicles -- four Euro 6 cars and Golf Euro 5 -- for now, but further probe will be conducted for a final check,” a ministry official said. The ministry suspended the sales of unsold Volkswagen cars equipped with the same engine as the Tiguan Euro 5 and ordered a recall of 125,522 cars. It also imposed a penalty of 14.1 billion won ($12.3 million). The models subject to the recall order include the Tiguan and Beetle of Volkswagen and the Q6, Q3 and A4 of Audi. The German carmaker has also been told to submit its recall plan and antiemission measures to the government by Jan. 6. To encourage customers to return their cars, the ministry said it would distribute stickers to be attached to vehicles that have completed the recall procedure to remind those who have yet to bring their cars in. Specific plans on how to fix the vehicles have yet to be decided.The environmental authorities said the global carmaker appears to have rigged the emissions to reduce the car production cost amid toughened emissions regulations. Controlling emissions requires more advanced technology that raises costs, they said. The ministry vowed to expand the probe to 16 other carmakers that sell diesel vehicles. They include Hyundai Motor, Kia Motors, GM Korea, Renault Samsung Motors Co., Ssangyong Motor, BMW, Mercedes-Benz Korea, Porsche, Jaguar Land Rover Korea, Volvo, Peugeot, FCA Korea, Ford, FMK and Nissan.The upcoming probe will also cover models of 3,000 cubic centimeters, it said. The ministry also announced that it would introduce an outdoor emissions test for all vehicles starting next year as part of its efforts to prevent emissions rigging. Vehicles weighing over 3.5 tons will be covered by the test starting from January and those under 3.5 tons from September 2017. Vehicles that fail to pass the outdoor emissions test will be taken off the market. Based on the Environment Ministry’s test results, the Transport Ministry will carry out three rounds of tests to look into whether the emissions rigging affected the fuel efficiency and safety of passengers, officials said. The Environment Ministry’s probe results will likely lead to more lawsuits against Volkswagen. The Korean brand of the German carmaker is currently facing a class-action lawsuit filed by over 2,000 customers who are seeking to nullify the purchase contracts and receive refunds. Law firm Barun, which is leading the collective lawsuit, has officially requested the carmaker provide vouchers worth $1,000 for each Korean customer just as it promised American customers. Volkswagen, however, has not yet responded, the law firm said. Last week, a Korean civic group also sued Volkswagen Korea CEO Thomas Kuehl for allegedly taking financial advantage by violating rules, causing environment problems and harming public health.

Both Waldheim and Boutros-Ghali met with North Korea's founding leader, Kim Il-sung, during their visits to Pyongyang.Ban, a former South Korean foreign minister, has repeatedly said that he will do everything possible to promote inter-Korean reconciliation and a resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue.In May, Ban planned to visit the North Korean border city of Gaeseong, where South Korea runs an industrial complex, but the trip was called off at the last minute because Pyongyang abruptly withdrew its invitation for no clear reason.

The Environment Ministry said Thursday it would accept requests for a health probe by the end of next month from those who had used the humidifier disinfectant in question. Since July 2013, the government has carried out two investigations into the causality between personal health problems and humidifier disinfectant use upon the users’ requests. In 2011, the health authorities discovered a “significant association” between lung damage and the humidifier disinfectant after four pregnant women consecutively died of a mysterious lung-related disease.Most of the victims were found to have used Oxy Ssak Ssak, a liquid humidifier disinfectant produced by British company Reckitt Benckiser. The product, which sold in Korea starting 2002, occupied a market share of about 80 percent among 20 other similar brands. It was withdrawn from the local market in 2011 after the health concerns were raised. Of 530 users who reported health problems to the government, 221 were confirmed to have suffered lung damage, the ministry said. If the health impact is confirmed, the state will cover all related medical and funeral costs. The third health investigation is underway following a request from 111 humidifier disinfectant users, officials said.Civic groups, however, raised concerns over the government’s decision to close the probe application period, claiming that there may be further potential victims. “We started to hold a campaign to encourage potential victims to request the probe since last month and about 140 already reported their symptoms to the ministry. There has been a lack of awareness that the state is receiving the health damage reports,” Asian Citizen’s Center for Environment and Health director Lim Heung-kyu told The Korea Herald.According to the government’s report in 2011, nearly 9 million Koreans were estimated to have been exposed to humidifier disinfectants from 1994. “As it’s been more than a decade since the humidifier disinfectant tragedy took place, many still do not clearly know how it might have affected them or whether it will affect them somehow soon. The government should not stop accepting the reports,” Lim added. “The government counts the damage cases only upon the reports from the victims, which is probably why there is a huge difference between the estimated number and the actual number of cases. The state needs to proactively find out the potential victims.”Currently, one can apply for the investigation via mail or visit with a paper application that is downloadable from the website. For now, the state does not have any plans to launch a probe into people who were exposed, the ministry said.Meanwhile, eight confirmed victims are seeking compensation against the state and the product maker. The government has reiterated that the humidifier disinfectant company is accountable for the health damage, not the state, and is responsible for any compensation beyond the government’s offer of health and funeral costs.

In September, Choe also visited Beijing for China's massive military parade.Choe's whereabouts have been under the intense spotlight among officials and analysts in South Korea and other regional powers as he was not named as a member of a funeral committee of a senior military official who died last Saturday.Choe also did not show up for the state funeral ceremony of Ri Ul-sol, marshal of North Korea's military, who died of lung cancer at the age of 94.Choe's conspicuous absence sparked speculation among some analysts that he might have been ousted from the party's key post.Still, the South Korean intelligence officials believe that Choe was not purged, though he is undergoing education at the Kim Il Sung Higher Party School for unspecified reasons.The officials, who spoke on conditions of anonymity, did not give any details on how Choe ended up in re-education at Kim Il Sung Higher Party School.A source familiar to North Korean affairs, meanwhile, said that the party secretary in charge of labor groups is on a farm in a rural area as part of his re-education apparently aimed to punish him for his poor performance in youth-related affairs.There is media speculation that it may be related to problems in building a dam near Mount Paektu, which Pyongyang claims is the sacred birthplace of Kim Jong-il, North Korea's late leader and the father of the current leader Kim.The South Korean officials said that re-education at Kim Il Sung Higher Party School is the most lenient punishment, compared with writing a letter of self-criticism at home or serving time in rural areas or coal mines.On Wednesday, North Korean state television aired footage of Choe when it aired a competition of ""ssirum"" -- a traditional Korean form of wrestling -- at a stadium in Pyongyang, the officials said.The intelligence officials said they believe that the ssirum competition was held Tuesday. The North Korean state television usually reports events a day after they take place.In 2014, the North's main newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, mentioned Choe's late father's case as an example of protecting the country's founder Kim Il-sung.Choe Hyon, who served as a vice defense minister, pulled a pistol during a key party meeting in 1956 on the opposition in a factional strife against Kim Il-sung. The senior Choe's move dampened the spirits of those who opposed Kim, who later purged his political opponents.

It would mark the first party congress in 36 years after the last such meeting was held in 1980, when Kim's grandfather and national founder Kim Il-sung was in power.The announcement spurred speculation as to why Kim decided to convene such a rare meeting.Ruediger Frank, a North Korea expert at the University of Vienna, said Kim could use the meeting for a ""declaration of his victory in the domestic struggle for power"" after massive purges in the past years or to announce a major policy change marking the departure down a path of true reform.Frank also noted that since Kim took power, the formal role of the Workers' Party has been restored, step by step, and such leading party organs as the central committee, the politburo and its presidium have been resuscitated.""We should also remember that all major reforms of state socialism -- be it in China under Deng Xiaoping, the Soviet Union under Gorbachev or Vietnam under the slogan of doi moi -- have been announced at such regular party congresses or related events,"" he said in an article contributed to 38 North.Unlike his father and late leader Kim Jong-il who pursued ""songun,"" or military-first, policy, the current leader pursues the ""byeongjin"" policy of seeking both economic and nuclear development simultaneously, the expert said.""Kim Jong-un has from day one of his leadership declared that he wants to improve the material living conditions of his people.He has tried to do that within the constraints of the existing system,"" Frank said. ""I had estimated that he would need about five years to find out that this does not work, that the system itself is the problem. The time is almost up.""As Kim has consolidated his leadership and the economic situation in the North is relatively stable, the emerging middle class and the growing inflow of information from the outside, in particular via China, have put the regime under high pressure for reform, the expert said.However, Kim could use next year's meeting only to signal a ""return to a new normal,"" he said.""Kim Jong-un might ... play it safe and, after having spent the last years cleaning the ranks of the party, military and government, will use the 7th Party Congress for a triumphant declaration of his victory in the domestic struggle for power. The country would return to a new normal and continue to muddle through,"" Frank said.In that case, the congress could only issue statements on internal cohesion and monolithic unity, celebrate the status of the country as a nuclear and space power, reshuffle a few posts, glorify the three Kims and emphasize the need for Korean unification, he said.

The agency is also pushing to put in place legislation to facilitate its future overseas dispatch of forces and participation in non-U.N. peacekeeping operations. Currently, some 320 soldiers of the Cheonghae Unit have been taking part in an international antipiracy campaign in the Gulf of Aden off the Somali coast since March 2009, operating a 4,000-ton class destroyer. In Abu Dhabi, the 150-strong Akh Unit -- meaning “brothers” in Arabic -- was dispatched in January 2011 following the UAE’s request to help train its special warfare troops. The terms of both contingents were due to end at the end of this year. “The role of the Cheonghae Unit is vital as the combined naval forces continue to face threats from pirates within their operational area, which calls for maintaining the current levels of antipiracy activities as a deterrent,” a ministry official said. “As for the Akh Unit, it needs to remain there, given our own need to secure a solid footing in the growing arms markets in the UAE and the overall Middle East. It also makes it easier to protect the 25,000 plus people residing throughout the region should a contingency break out.” The envisioned law on overseas military operations was proposed in June 2013 but has for almost a year been pending at a legislation and judiciary subcommittee of the National Assembly. If enacted, it will help lay a legislative groundwork for the country’s future multinational peacekeeping activities and defense exchanges with other countries as the current law is only confined to U.N.-led operations.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","wednesday citing persistent pirate threats ,operating 000 ton class destroyer ,the somali coast since march ,said wednesday citing persistent pirate ,wednesday citing persistent pirate","['the Defense Ministry', 'Somalia', 'the United Arab Emirates', 'middle eastern', 'somali', 'Abu Dhabi', 'UAE', 'the Cheonghae Unit', 'the Akh Unit', 'UAE', 'the National Assembly', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",12,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44512478  0.3908633

The 4.95-square-kilometer airport, to be bigger than Jeju International Airport, will have a runway 3,200 meters long and 60 meters wide. Opened in 1968, Jeju International Airport has served as the only aerial gateway to the island, but studies showed that its runways will be completely saturated by 2018 with the explosive growth rate in flights. The ministry’s research forecast that the number of Jeju International Airport users will stand at 28 million in 2018 and rise to 40 million by 2025. “After carrying out preliminary feasibility studies, we decided that Sinsan was a suitable location for the new airport by taking into account the cost, impact on the environment and public opinion,” the official said. Previously, the government had mulled three options to expand capacities of airport infrastructure on Jejudo Island: expanding the existing airport, closing down Jeju International and building a completely new airport with two runways, or building a second airport at a separate location.“Expanding the existing airport would incur excessive construction costs as high as 9.4 trillion won and pose bigger environmental risks as it needs to reclaim land from the sea, while closing it down entirely is opposed by residents,” the ministry said. Construction work is expected to begin in 2018 after further feasibility studies by the ministry and detailed plans, such as for the terminal size and land compensation.

A captain-led unit is scheduled to be launched on Dec. 1 to defend the base together with the Navy’s 7th Task Flotilla and part of the Submarine Force Command, which will move to the island from their current headquarters in Busan and Jinhae, South Gyeongsang Province, respectively, a Navy official said. When their relocation ends, the base located in the southern town of Gangjeong is expected to house more than 3,000 seamen and their families. With more than 91 percent of construction having been completed, a launch ceremony will take place in mid-December to early January, the official noted. “The stationed forces are tasked with guarding the port and nearby waters and maintaining facilities there,” the official said.  Priests hold Mass in front of the construction site on Jejudo Island on Oct. 12 in protest against the anticipated launch of a naval base. (Yonhap)Initiated in 2007, the project has repeatedly been postponed by vehement protests of activists and villagers who filed a lawsuit to foil the construction work on concerns over potential environmental degradation and militarization of the site famous for tourist attractions. The focal point was the proposed destruction of the “Gureombi” volcanic rock, which measures 1.2 kilometers in length and 150 meters in width and provides a habitat for endangered species such as striped shore crabs and narrow-mouthed toads.It kicked into high gear following the Supreme Court’s reversal of a lower court’s ruling that the job should be invalidated due to the absence of a prior environmental assessment. The top court, however, determined that the construction was legitimate because the Defense Ministry carried out the approval process again in 2010 after controversy broke out. The initiative is designed to set up a “military-civilian” compound on the island, 90 kilometers off the peninsula’s south coast, with piers and other facilities to dock a mobile fleet of up to 20 naval vessels and a number of 150,000-ton cruisers.The military has claimed that the installation is key to properly coping with contingencies in the southern sea area, securing the country’s maritime transportation routes and helping boost the regional economy.Military and local government officials have since stepped up efforts to soothe opponents’ jitters, holding various rounds of consultations and vowing to devise measures to minimize potential environmental damage. “The people consistently raise environmental concerns and we’re striving to take steps to appease them in cooperation with supervisory authorities,” the official noted, adding that the ongoing protest will not pose a major hurdle for the base’s takeoff. Though much of the public furor has died down, a mass organized by the Catholic Solidarity for the Realization of the Jeju, Peace Island, continues to take place every day at 11 a.m. in front of the entrance of the site in protest against the work. The association, established four years ago with more than 3,700 priests and ascetics from 15 Catholic groups, marked their anniversary on Oct. 12. Kang Eun-joo, an activist at the union, said the organization plans to carry on with their crusade even after the base opens, in partnership with other campaigners on the scene and those from St. Francis Peace Center in the village. “It may not be as fierce as our previous activities at the site and take different forms, but we will continue our work,” she told The Korea Herald. “Our desperation is no match for that of the residents. Rather than the base’s creation itself, we will focus on recovering the community as led by the center.”By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","defense officials said monday captain ,anticipated launch of naval base ,on oct 12 in protest ,maritime defense officials said monday ,after years of public protests","['Navy', 'Navy', 'the Submarine Force Command', 'Busan', 'Navy', 'Gangjeong', 'the Supreme Court ’s', 'the Defense Ministry', 'the Catholic Solidarity', 'catholic', 'Kang Eun - joo', 'the Korea Herald', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",12,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.19617848  0.5553425

Security Council to take up the North's human rights issue as an agenda item, he said in the Sept. 25-dated report that was posted on the U.N. website on Wednesday.Ban also made a series of recommendations urging the North to take concrete steps to improve the situation, invite the U.N. special rapporteur to visit the country, engage meaningfully with all U.N. member states and provide unimpeded access to U.N. and humanitarian agencies.Last year, the U.N. General Assembly adopted a landmark resolution calling for referring the North to the International Criminal Court for human rights violations. The resolution led to the Security Council adopting the issue as an official agenda item for the first time.Sources at the U.N. said that South Korea, the United States and like-minded partners have begun drafting a new resolution that would also call for referring those responsible for the North's abuses of its hunger-stricken people to the ICC.Chances are not high for the Security Council to actually refer the issue to the ICC because China and Russia, which have friendlier ties with North Korea than any other countries, are expected to veto such a move. Still, such resolutions play a great role in drawing international attention to the issue.North Korea has long been labeled as one of the worst human rights violators. The communist regime does not tolerate dissent, holds hundreds of thousands of people in political prison camps and keeps tight control over outside information.But the North has bristled at such criticism, calling it a U.S.-led attempt to topple its regime.In June, the State Department said in its annual human rights report that the North's human rights record ""remained among the worst in the world"" last year with public executions, political prison camps, torture and other abuses.

William Gortney, commander of U.S. Northern Command, said earlier this month he agrees with the intelligence community's assessment the North has the ability and technology to put nuclear weapons on rockets that can reach the continental United States.Lee, however, said North Korea has not mastered the miniaturization technology, citing South Korea's spy agency.

The basement will be used as an archive and for management purposes, the foundation said.The foundation said it hopes the building will serve as a bridge of friendship between the two nations.In 1891, King Gojong, the 26th king of the Joseon Dynasty and the first emperor of the Korea Empire, bought the building, currently located in the Logan Circle Historic District, some 10 minutes' drive from the White House, for US$25,000, a huge sum at that time.The Korean Empire was the name of the Joseon Dynasty during its final 13 years.The Victorian-style building was used as home for the Korean legation in the U.S. until 1910, when Japan took over the ownership of the building for just $5 as soon as Korea went under its colonial rule, and sold it to an American for $10.It is the only former overseas establishment of the Korean Empire that still has its original shape.The building has great historical value as a symbol of the Joseon Dynasty's pursuit of an independent diplomacy to escape from rising pressure from China, Russia and Japan to open up after the Treaty of Amity and Commerce was signed with the U.S. in 1882.""This is a scene of our historical independent diplomacy and the cradle of Korea-U.S. friendship,"" said O Soo-dong, head of the foundation, during a press briefing. ""This is a symbol of us overcoming the shameful history and realizing a proud Republic of Korea.""O said the foundation plans to formally open the facility to the public in early 2017.

(123RF)Korea is not the first country in Asia to offer government-sponsored matchmaking services as part of the national measure to boost its fertility rate. In Singapore, the government’s Social Development Unit has been offering matchmaking services for its citizens, including dating games and an online speed dating service, as part of its population policies. “Dating is one of the most personal activities in anyone’s life,” said researcher Cho Sung-ho from the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs. “It’s questionable if it is appropriate for the government to get involved in the dating lives of its citizens. When the state is encouraging the young population to get married, what is it saying about those who opt not to get married?”As single parenthood, especially of unwed women, is often socially stigmatized here, Korea has one of the lowest out-of-wedlock birthrates in the world, marking 2.1 percent as of 2010. This was dramatically lower than the rates of other countries like Ireland (64.1 percent) and Norway (55 percent).  Paik Young-gyung, an anthropology professor at Korea National Open University said the government’s demographic policies -- encouraging people to get married -- do not guarantee one’s rights to become a parent regardless of his or her marital status. “It does not recognize it as a right, but rather something that is given out of benevolence,” she said. “It also applies to one’s rights as a citizen and his or her right to housing. (While the government wants to boost its fertility rate), not all pregnancies in Korea end up in childbirths.”Factors behind the increasing number of delayed marriages in Korea include the growing number of young Koreans who prioritize education or career over forming a family and the expensive cost of weddings, housing and child care. On top of encouraging young Koreans to get married, the government has come up with a number of population policies targeting citizens in their 20s and 30s, such as housing benefits and discounts on wedding venues.However, critics of the government’s population policies said the current measures are not conscious of the changing cultural and social situations faced by the younger generation. For example, not all Koreans who choose not to have children do it because they can’t afford to get married, said Paik Young-gyung, an anthropology professor at Korea National Open University. “We are living in a world where people have different values, such as individual happiness. When an individual wants to not get married or not have children, for whatever reasons he or she may have, that decision must be respected,” she told The Korea Herald. “If the government is giving housing benefits to those who get married only, we are faced with this question: ‘Do young people who wish to stay single not deserve that benefit as much as young married couples do?’”Korea first implemented demographic policies to boost its fertility rate in 2006. Yet the nations’ birthrate last year was exactly the same as that in 2006, indicating the policies have failed.If the current birthrate remains steady, almost 15 percent of the population will be 65 or older by 2018, and the figure will rise to 50 percent by 2100, according to government data. The number of Korean schoolchildren is expected to drop to 5.61 million by 2030 from the current 10 million. Such government predictions have deepened concerns over the country’s fiscal stability and productivity.  “The government needs to work on the issues that need to be solved now, rather than preparing for what’s going to happen in the future,” said professor Paik, who stressed that the demographic policies probably wouldn’t be effective if the government does not try to tackle some of the biggest social problems faced by Koreans today, including unemployment and social inequality. “What the fertility rates show us is that life is difficult for the majority of Koreans right now. Getting married and having children shouldn’t be such big deals as they are in Korea today. The ideal society is where an individual feels that getting married and having children are something natural, rather than something that requires a lot of work and sacrifice.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","young koreans to get married ,delayed marriages in korea include ,koreans right now getting married ,young married couples do korea ,priority seats for pregnant women","['south korean', 'Koreans', 'Singapore', 'Social Development Unit', 'Cho Sung - ho', 'the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs', 'Korea', 'Ireland', 'Norway', 'Korea National Open University', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'Korea National Open University', 'the Korea Herald', 'korean', 'Paik', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'Korea', 'Claire Lee']",14,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.83273804  0.71951288

To date, over 11 million cars worldwide are believed to have been installed with hidden software that can switch on pollution controls when it detects the car is being tested. Volkswagen`s logo. (Yonhap)Audi Korea, which is presumed to have sold some 29,000 of the rigged cars as part of the Volkswagen Group, issued a similar apology.The rigged cars sold by the two companies in the country is tentatively tallied at over 120,000.“I would like to take this opportunity to offer my sincere apology on behalf of Volkswagen Korea for breaking the trust of our Korean customers,” the company CEO Thomas Kuehl said in a parliamentary audit, after he issued the first official apology in Korea via newspaper advertisements. “I also want to apologize for the late response. Due to complexity of the issue and different emission standards in Korea, it took a long time to investigate how many cars were affected. Be assured we will do everything to clarity and solve this issue as soon as possible,” he said.He added that Volkswagen is fully cooperating with government officials worldwide including in Seoul to determine the exact cause of this issue. He emphasized, however, that none of the cars currently being sold across the country have the device in question, and that the rigged cars do not show any safety-related defects when driven.The companies were to send separate letters of apology to each of its customers. They did not mention the details about how to compensate the customers.Kuehl told the lawmakers that details of the follow-up measures would be revealed after the government investigation is complete. Seoul’s Environment Ministry last week launched an investigation into the suspected models over the emission rigging.Lawmakers also questioned him about the possibility of the product recall worsening the fuel efficiency of the cars, and if Volkswagen planned to compensate for it. Kuehl reiterated that he could not give a definitive answer yet, but vowed to address the issue after the probe is complete.Volkswagen Korea has launched a website that helps customers determine if their car has been rigged, and Audi plans to launch a website for the same purpose.The public apology was widely perceived as an attempt to address public discontent amid an ongoing investigation by the government. Some 40 Volkswagen owners entered a joint lawsuit against the company in less than a week, with hundreds more expected to follow suit.Volkswagen on Wednesday announced that it would launch a massive recall in January for vehicles affected by the emission tests scandal. Michael Horn, the U.S. head of Volkswagen, offered a “sincere” apology Thursday for the company’s use of rigging software ahead of his hearing with the House energy committee.He also admitted that he came to be aware of the emissions-related problem with the cars last year.

Ma was blamed for the terminal's failure to boost national character.He has re-appeared in the public eye for the first time since November last year when Kim instructed his officials to modify the terminal's interior to highlight North Korea's national identity.Under Kim's regime, Ma has been leading major construction projects such as the Masikryong Ski Resort on the North's east coast.An analysis of Ma's photos showed that he appeared to have been demoted to a major general from a lieutenant general following the purported purge.Meanwhile, Kim visited Rason, which was seriously hit by Typhoon Goni in late August, ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers' Party which falls on Saturday.The date of his visit was not specified, but it marked the second time that Kim toured the city to spur efforts for recovery.In September, the North's leader visited the city bordering China and Russia, about a month after he ordered the completion of flood recovery work there before the key anniversary.

The three-day trip from Thursday by Parliamentary Vice Defense Minister Kenji Harada came after Tokyo shelved its initial plan to send Minister Gen. Nakatani. The visit was chiefly designed for the Military World Games in Mungyeong, North Gyeongsang Province, but had boosted anticipation that he would hold talks with his counterpart, South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-koo. The two top defense policymakers met for the first time in about four years in May on the sidelines of an international security conference in Singapore. “(Nakatani) had apparently sought to come himself, but changed his plan due to internal matters, such as a possible cabinet reshuffle, and for our part, there is a parliamentary audit underway here,” a military official said on customary condition of anonymity. The decision appears to have also reflected the sensitivity surrounding Japan’s recent overturn of the pacifist constitution to allow its military to fight overseas that has triggered concerns over the Shinzo Abe administration’s ongoing revisionist push. Japan is a member of the International Military Sports Council, the organizer of the quadrennial multisports event, but did not dispatch any players given the unique, noncombat status of its Self-Defense Forces.

General Assembly.The two Koreas have agreed to stage the reunions for 100 separated family members from each side on Oct. 20-26 at Mount Kumgang, a scenic mountain resort on the North's east coast. The reunions are a key part of a recent deal that defused military tensions on the Korean Peninsula.North Korea said Tuesday that the upcoming reunions have been ""put at serious peril,"" due to what it claims is Park's ""reckless confrontation row.""In an address to the U.N. on Monday, Park called on North Korea to embrace reform and openness rather than carrying out a long-range rocket.She also said a rocket launch would harm the hard-won mood for inter-Korean dialogue and undermine the efforts to resume the long-stalled talks on ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program.There is speculation that North Korea could launch a long-range rocket in October to put a satellite into orbit as part of its celebrations of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Workers' Party. Park also urged North Korea to improve its dismal human rights record by heeding to international concerns.The North's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea denounced Park's speech as ""an unpardonable provocation"" and called on South Korea to apologize over slandering North Korea.""If the South Korean authorities let loose a string of confrontational invectives as now, the event may prove completely abortive,"" according to the committee, which handles inter-Korean affairs.Family reunions have long been affected by political situations on the Korean Peninsula.

Security Council has begun studying stronger sanctions that could be imposed on North Korea in case the communist nation goes ahead with provocations, South Korea's top diplomat said Tuesday.Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se made the remark to reporters in New York after three-way talks with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida amid growing concern Pyongyang could conduct a long-range rocket launch or a nuclear test.""The Security Council has begun working-level studies into measures that would be stronger than before and sure to be painful to North Korea,"" Yun told reporters. ""We have to wait and see when and in what form (the measures) will be taken, but North Korea will be further isolated not only economically, but also diplomatically as well.""Yun did not elaborate, but the remark is believed to be the most specific warning yet against North Korea not to forge ahead with provocations. Pyongyang strongly suggested earlier this month it could conduct a long-range rocket launch or its fourth nuclear test, possibly around the Oct. 10 anniversary of its ruling Workers Party.North Korea was also a top topic for Tuesday's trilateral session.""North Korea presents an ongoing security challenge to everybody. We will talk about that here this morning,"" Kerry said at the start of the talks held on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly.Yun said the ""eyes of the world"" are set on major challenges in Northeast Asia, ""especially the publicized address from North Korea on possible strategic provocations in the coming weeks."" He said it is important for the three countries to send a clear message to Pyongyang ""so that there will not be any misjudgment and misbehavior.""Seoul's Foreign Ministry said the three ministers issued a strong warning to the North.""With regard to North Korea suggesting a long-range rocket launch, the three foreign ministers expressed serious concern and strongly urged North Korea to refrain from provocations that threaten peace and stability in the region and the international community,"" Seoul's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.""The three ministers also made clear that North Korea would face further significant measures from the international community if it goes ahead with provocations despite repeated calls for restraint from the international community, including China and Russia,"" it said.The ministers also urged North Korea to return to meaningful denuclearization negotiations, it said.Yun told reporters that the three ministers discussed deterring North Korean provocations and shared a common position that the international community will take ""swift and stern"" action if Pyongyang forges ahead with provocations.""We have sent clear messages to North Korea through a series of summit meetings, including the U.S.-China summit, that North Korean provocations are unacceptable,"" Yun told reporters, referring to last week's summit between U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping. After Friday's summit, Xi issued an unusually strong warning to Pyongyang, saying China opposes any actions that might ""cause tension in the Korean Peninsula or violate U.S. Security Council resolutions."" Obama also said North Korea won't be accepted as a nuclear weapons state.Officials say North Korea is more likely to conduct a long-range rocket than a nuclear test. That's a typical pattern of Pyongyang's provocation cycle: Conducting a rocket launch and using international condemnations and sanctions for it as an excuse for a nuclear test. North Korea says its rocket launches are aimed at putting satellites into orbit, claiming it has the right to peaceful use of space. But Pyongyang is banned from such launches under U.N. Security Council resolutions as it has been accused of using them as a cover for testing intercontinental ballistic missiles. Experts say long-range rockets and ICBMs are basically the same with differences only in payloads.Meanwhile, Yun said that the three ministers also reconfirmed that Japan's exercise of its collective self-defense right should be carried out in a way that is transparent and respects South Korea's sovereignty.The recent passage of security legislation in Japan has empowered the country's Self-Defense Forces to fight overseas in the name of aiding allies. The move sparked concern that Japanese forces could enter the Korean Peninsula in the name of helping the U.S. in the event of war with North Korea.Japanese boots on the peninsula are one of the last things South Koreans want to see due to painful memories of Japan's colonial rule of Korea from 1910 to 1945. South Korea has said Japanese forces cannot enter the peninsula unless there is explicit consent from Seoul.

""The amount of money given will depend on the extent of reforms with those that make sweeping changes to get more.""  The remarks reflect a widespread view that the country's higher educational institutions are unable to train students for their future jobs, contributing to high unemployment among young people.  The jobless rate for people between the ages of 15 through 29 stood at 8 percent in August, much higher than the 3.4 percent for the country as a whole.  The government set aside 236.2 billion won ($198.5 million) in next year's budget aimed at facilitating restructuring and consolidating departments and even schools. This program envisions providing 5-20 billion won worth of support to each school that carries out reforms.Choi also said that while state debt will surpass 40 percent of the nation's gross domestic product in 2016, there is no need to be overly worried. He pointed out that in the first seven months of the year, the government collected 135 trillion won in taxes, up 11 trillion won compared to the year before.  To maintain the overall fiscal health of the country, Choi stressed the government is committed to moving forward reforms that restrict excessive spending and cut back on tax breaks.  The fiscal strategy coordination committee, meanwhile, said measures will be taken to improve the way state funds reach cash-strapped small and medium enterprises.  There has been growing criticism that support is not distributed evenly among qualified companies, causing many to go bankrupt.  Key among the changes to be made will be to allocate 30 percent of all state funds available to companies that have been in operation for 3-7 years, which are usually at a crossroads of making the next leap forward or forced to close for lack of appropriate funding.  The committee said at present 22.9 percent of such funds go to the companies.

A railway has been laid from the station to the launching site.  North Korea has reiterated its resolve to launch a satellite, calling it a sovereign right, in a show of defiance against growing international calls against the provocation.  South Korea, the U.S. and China have warned that North Korea's missile launch would be a grave violation of the U.N.

Jeong Kyeong-doo said in response to Rep. Kim Kwang-jin of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy during a parliamentary audit at the Air Force’s headquarters in the Gyeryongdae military compound in South Chungcheong Province, referring to the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense. THAAD is designed to shoot down short-, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles in the final stage of their flight.But he did not provide details on the estimate, saying the figure is an approximate one and was also mentioned in news reports.Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Jeong Kyeong-doo speaks during a parliamentary audit on Tuesday at the Air Force’s headquarters in the Gyeryongdae military compound in South Chungcheong Province. (Yonhap)Jeong’s remarks represented a rare assessment by a South Korean military executive because the government has shied away from giving numbers, saying it will not have to shoulder any costs even if Washington eventually decides to bring in the asset, as it will do so on its own. A THAAD battery, which consists of six truck-mounted launchers, 48 interceptors, an air-transportable radar system and a fire and communications element, had widely been valued at 1 trillion won to 2 trillion won, and no more than two units would likely be put in place here. For its part, Seoul is seeking to develop the L-SAM, a long-range surface-to-air missile with similar interception capabilities as part of its initiative to establish an independent missile defense system, called the Korea Air and Missile Defense.Jeong also remained cautious about THAAD, saying the Air Force is pursuing the KAMD program and adopting the U.S. system may entail other problems such as bringing in necessary intelligence surveillance reconnaissance assets to operate alongside it. “There are various conditions in order to operate THAAD,” he said. “The Defense Ministry will carefully review its stationing taking into account various security factors. ... On the military aspect, a THAAD deployment has pros and cons. It has merits and limits.” The former vice Air Force chief of staff and Joint Chiefs of Staff head of strategic planning took office last week. Controversy has repeatedly brewed over the issue in recent months after top Washington officials including Secretary of State John Kerry and U.S. Forces Korea commander Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti raised the need for future discussions between the allies on a THAAD deployment. The U.S. has activated four THAAD batteries in the mainland and Guam and plans to complete the deployment of the other three by as early as 2019 including on overseas locations that may include South Korea, Japan and the United Arab Emirates.During the session, the issue also precipitated spats between senior ruling and opposition lawmakers. Rep. Yoo Seong-min of the Saenuri Party lambasted as “deceiving” Jeong’s plan to defend from North Korean missile attacks with the KAMD system and homegrown mid- and long-range ground-to-air missiles. In contrast, New Politics Alliance for Democracy chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in opposed a THAAD stationing, saying it is not cost-effective and Seoul will ultimately have to share a greater burden in other ways.

Aronda Nyakairima, Uganda's interior minister and former army chief of staff, died Sept. 12 on a plane from South Korea to Dubai en route to Uganda. He was 56.  The minister visited South Korea from Sept. 8-11 at the invitation of the Korea Foundation. Following a postmortem examination, the Ugandan government announced that the cause of death was heart failure, according to news reports.  However, during a memorial service for the late minister last week, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni reportedly blamed South Korea for denying Aronda proper medical care due to his lack of health insurance even though he had complained of a stomachache and dizziness.  A South Korean government official refuted the claim.  ""We are in the process of determining the relevant details,"" he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""According to the foundation, the claim that the minister wished to receive hospital care during his stay but could not get proper medical attention without health insurance is different from the truth.""   All those who were invited by the foundation, including Aronda, were covered by traveler's insurance, which includes health insurance, the official added.  Citing a separate probe by the foundation, the South Korean Embassy in Uganda said Aronda took digestive medicine during his stay in South Korea but turned down an offer to visit a hospital. The embassy has delivered its position to the Ugandan government and requested it to refrain from making any misleading remarks. ""We are in talks with the Ugandan government over this case,"" said an embassy official.

Pyongyang also said its bomb-making nuclear facilities have returned to normal operation and could conduct a nuclear test if necessary.  North Korea has conducted three underground nuclear tests so far, in 2006, 2009 and 2013. The country has also conducted a series of long-range missile or rocket launches since 1998. In its most recent launch in late 2012, the North succeeded in putting a satellite into orbit.  Analysts have warned that it is only a matter of time until the North develops nuclear-tipped missiles. Some experts have recently warned that the communist nation's nuclear arsenal could expand to as many as 100 bombs by 2020.  Other agenda items for this week's summit are expected to include thorny issues, such as territorial disputes over the South China Sea, cyber-hacking, China's foreign exchange policy, climate change and human rights.  ""We are steadily and methodically expanding the breadth and depth of our cooperation with China. Our story is, overwhelmingly, one of progress. Still, the reality is we face difficult challenges. And, we never shy away from pressing our concerns,""Rice said.  She said the U.S. has urged China to carry out market reforms that level the playing field for foreign firms and refrain from competitive currency devaluation. She also noted that Obama has made clear to Xi that ""state-sponsored, cyber-enabled economic espionage must stop.""  ""This isn't a mild irritation. It is an economic and national security concern to the United States,"" she said of cyber-hacking.""It puts enormous strain on our bilateral relationship, and it is a critical factor in determining the future trajectory of U.S.-China ties.""  Speaking of martime territorial disputes, Rice also said that the U.S. takes no position on competing territorial claims, but will continue to stress the importance of preserving ""freedom of navigation and commerce through some of the world's busiest sea lanes.""  ""The United States of America will sail, fly and operate anywhere that international law permits,"" she said.

It marks the first time the Korean government has ever rolled out a comprehensive measure for modification of the official English names.Officials have been discussing the potential new English names and working on the guidelines since March, in response to criticism about the accuracy of the names. A special advisory committee ― which included native speakers ― reviewed all administrative organizations’ English names and came up with 231 suggestions for new names, 141 of which have been accepted by the respective agencies. The guidelines suggest changing English names that sound strange to native speakers, having consistency when depicting functions of the organizations, refraining from using “Korean,” “National” or “the” in the official name, making sure the abbreviated names include organizations’ main functions and distinguishing the names of offices based on the size of their jurisdiction.The sweeping changes starts with the Home Affairs Ministry itself, which will be shortened to Ministry of the Interior. Multifunctional Administrative City Construction Agency, whose main function is to oversee the construction plans for Korea‘s administrative city of Sejong, will be switched to National Agency for Administrative City Construction. The main purpose of the new names is to help foreigners understand the functions of organizations at first glance, officials said. The Welfare Ministry-affiliated “National Mang-Hyang Cemetery” is a resting place for overseas Koreans who were forced to flee the country during Japan’s 1910-1945 colonial rule, but it is virtually impossible for a anyone who is not a Korean-speaker to realize that as the word “mang-hyang” is merely a Romanization of a Korean word meaning “to miss one’s home.” To avoid the confusion, the institute will be called “Office of National Cemetery for Overseas Koreans.”The guideline also presented standardized English translations for various government positions such as “policy advisor to the minister” and “inspector general.”By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","south korean government said thursday ,new english names and working ,korean government said thursday ,thursday it will amend english ,korean government said thursday it","['south korean', 'the Ministry of Government Administration', 'Home Affairs', 'korean', 'korean', 'the Home Affairs Ministry', 'Ministry of the Interior', 'Multifunctional Administrative City Construction Agency', 'Korea‘s', 'Sejong', 'National Agency for Administrative City Construction', 'the Welfare Ministry', 'Koreans', 'Japan', 'korean', 'korean']",14,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.32656622  0.84170681

Noting that the size of the vent of an explosion facility in the North was found to have been reduced, a Seoul official said that this could mean the need for additional tests has decreased.“Given the change in the size of the vent and the absence of additional tests, the North might have concluded that it does not need to conduct explosion tests often, as it has already reached a considerable level of the miniaturization technology,” the official said, requesting anonymity.During the audit, the ministry made it official that it would adopt offensive operations for border defense in the wake of a set of North Korean provocations last month including the Aug. 4 land mine detonation.“We will carry out offensive operations in the Demilitarized Zone and establish specific operational postures based on various scenarios of possible (North Korean) provocations,” Seoul’s Defense Ministry said in its written policy report submitted during a parliamentary audit.The statement marked a shift from the hitherto defensive operational tactics that were designed to fend off North Korean forces’ infiltrations across the border. The shift came amid growing calls for the South Korean military to respond more proactively to North Korea’s limited attacks. The mine detonation inflicted serious injuries to the legs of two South Korean troops, followed by an artillery attack on Aug. 20. “We will focus on formulating specific plans to prepare for various types of provocations and making them applicable through specific combat procedures,” the ministry report said. “After the North Korean provocations (last month), we also keep a cooperative mechanism with the U.S.”As for the possibility of North Korea’s additional provocations, the ministry did not rule it out, noting that Pyongyang could launch a missile around Oct. 10, when the communist state is to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the foundation of its ruling Workers’ Party.But there has not been any clear sign yet that the North is going to launch a rocket on Oct. 10, Seoul’s Defense Minister Han Min-koo said.On the same issue, Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, in a separate parliamentary audit, said that the North could launch a “strategic” provocation around the anniversary.“Despite the Aug. 25 bilateral agreement, (we) cannot rule out the possibility that the North would launch a strategic provocation such as a long-range rocket launch, disguised as a satellite launch, around the time when they mark the anniversary of the party’s foundation,” Yun said.“We are closely watching the situation. We will strive to forge the international opinion that would prevent the North from setting off additional provocations.”The Foreign Ministry said in its parliamentary report that should the North launch a strategic provocation, it would “sternly and promptly” deal with it through bilateral and multilateral mechanisms including the U.N. Security Council.Meanwhile, the Defense Ministry said that since 2010, Pyongyang had launched provocations on 64 occasions, including 13 land-based provocations and 47 cases at sea. During the period, Pyongyang violated the Military Demarcation Line eight times and fired artillery shots across the border five times. The MDL violations, which did not occur between 2010 and 2013, began last year, the ministry noted.North Korean patrol ships’ violations of the Northern Limit Line, a de facto maritime border, took place twice in 2010, five times in 2011, twice in 2012, nine times in 2013, 13 times last year and 10 times so far this year.By Song Sang-ho(sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","three nuclear tests in 2006 ,miniaturize nuclear warhead this year ,nuclear warhead this year seoul ,nuclear tests in 2006 2009 ,north korean provocations last month","['North Korea', 'Seoul ’s Defense Ministry', 'Pyongyang', 'Cho Bo - geun', 'the Defense Intelligence Agency', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'the Demilitarized Zone', 'north korean', 'Seoul ’s Defense Ministry', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'North Korea ’s', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'North Korea ’s', 'Pyongyang', 'Workers ’ Party', 'Seoul', 'Defense', 'Han Min - koo', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Yun', 'Foreign Ministry', 'the U.N.

President Park Geun-hye speaks at a reopening of a historic building, used by Korea`s provisional government during Japan`s 1910-45 colonial rule, in Shanghai on Friday.(Yonhap)Wrapping up her trip to China, Park also attended a reopening ceremony of the headquarters of the Korean Provisional Government, a building that had served as an overseas base against Japan‘s aggression.Park called the historic building a symbol of friendship between South Korea and China, and a living proof that the two share the same values and history of struggle.“This showed that South Korea and China share the historic meaning and value of sites of our independence struggle,” she said. The provisional government was formed on April 13, 1919, as the Korean government-in-exile, a month after Korea launched an independence movement against Japan.The Korean Peninsula was later divided into the capitalist South and the communist North after its independence from Japan in 1945.Park expressed her gratitude to the Chinese government as it has helped preserve the building and other sites related to Korea’s independence movement against Japan.“Our people remember well that the Chinese people provided support” to Korea’s independence movement, Park said in an interview with the People’s Daily, a state-run Chinese newspaper. “We are thankful to our old friends,” she said.Before Shanghai, she held a summit in Beijing with her Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in which the two reaffirmed the strengthening ties between the two. The South Korean leader also attended a rare military parade seen as China’s show of military strength. In the summit with Park, Xi stressed that Koreans and Chinese fought against Japan’s aggressions when expressing his gratitude for her visit to China for the celebration. They also agreed to hold a trilateral meeting with Japan in late autumn for peace in the region.South Korea, Japan and China are trading partners but tensions still persist over territorial and other history-related issues. Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony and controlled much of China in the early part of the 20th century.Park said that only correct recognition of history can heal sufferings of the past.“The countries in the region need to make joint efforts to move toward a new future based on a correct recognition of history,” Park told the People’s Daily. “On that premise, sufferings of past history can be healed and overcome.”Before returning home, Park also called for an early ratification of a free trade deal between two countries at a business forum. On her trip, Park was accompanied by the largest number of South Korean business representatives this time to expand business ties with China, Cheong Wa Dae said. China is the nation’s largest trading partner.By Cho Chung-un and news reports (christory@heraldcorp.com)","china park also attended reopening ,shanghai on friday yonhap wrapping ,park also attended reopening ceremony ,last month park also vowed ,friday urged china to play","['south korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'China', 'korean', 'Shanghai', 'China', 'Pyongyang', 'Koreas', 'Park', 'Pyongyang', 'inter - korean', 'Park Geun', 'Shanghai', 'China', 'Park', 'the Korean Provisional Government', 'Japan‘s', 'South Korea', 'China', 'South Korea', 'China', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'chinese', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'chinese', 'Korea', 'Park', 'the People ’s Daily', 'chinese', 'Shanghai', 'Beijing', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'south korean', 'China', 'Park', 'Xi', 'Koreans', 'Chinese', 'Japan', 'China', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'China', 'Japan', 'China', 'Park', 'the People ’s Daily', 'Park', 'Park', 'south korean', 'China', 'China', 'Cho Chung - un']",16,"[ 4.          3.          0.         ... -0.26779452  0.8053968

The appeal was made Monday to the Defense Ministry by about 100 people living on Gyodong Island in Ganghwa County, Incheon, located just south of the Northern Limit Line, the skirmish-prone maritime border with North Korea. “They have apparently been feeling anxious because the North Korean military threatens to shoot down the equipment,” a ministry official said, adding that the agency will come up with a solution taking public safety and the military’s psychological warfare strategy comprehensively into account. After being pulled out in 2004 as a result of inter-Korean military dialogue, the loudspeakers were reinstalled at 11 places along the Military Demarcation Line following the North’s 2010 fatal attack on the Cheonan corvette, but had remained idle until the South Korean military restarted the broadcasts last month.The broadcasts, which came in retaliation for the North’s Aug. 4 land mine attack that inflicted serious wounds on two soldiers, prompted the communist regime to launch artillery shells across the border, but again ended after 15 days following high-level inter-Korean dialogue.

Its operations had been stopped for some time due to cross-border tensions. (Yonhap)On Saturday, a day after Seoul proposed the Red Cross talks, Pyongyang agreed to hold them to determine the time, venue and the scale of reunions at South Korea’s Peace House in the truce village of Panmunjeom, according to Seoul’s Unification Ministry.The talks were arranged four days after the two Koreas agreed to hold the working-level talks early next month. After the four-day marathon talks last Tuesday, the two agreed to seek the reunions on the occasion of Chuseok, a major Korean holiday that falls on Sept. 27.The family reunions are expected to be held in early October given preparatory procedures including a survey of the surviving members of the separated families. The reunions have not been held since February 2014 amid high cross-border tensions.Pyongyang’s relatively easy acceptance of the proposal for the Red Cross talks signaled its will to mend fences with Seoul, observers said. In the past, Pyongyang often made counterproposals to reject Seoul’s offers of dialogue or unilaterally canceled the talks.Last Friday, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un indicated his desire to improve ties with the South, evaluating the agreement of the latest high-level talks as a “significant turning point” to bring cross-border relations on a path toward reconciliation and trust.Amid the emergent mood for dialogue, the two Koreas were seen downgrading their vigilance posture to a peacetime level.As agreed upon during last week’s high-level talks, Pyongyang has lifted its “quasi-state of war” and reportedly withdrawn its special vigilance directives. Seoul has also revised downward its military readiness posture, according to reports.Despite these positive developments, Seoul officials cautioned against excessive optimism over the prospects of inter-Korean ties, noting that a series of pending issues could derail the two neighbors’ reconciliatory and trust-building efforts.“We never know what would happen during the future talks with the North. We are not yet at the stage to predict (a positive development of inter-Korean relations), and we thus maintain a calm position,” a senior Seoul official told media.Indeed, a number of tough issues including Pyongyang’s unceasing pursuit of nuclear arms are expected to fuel cross-border tensions. In particular, the issue of the lifting of Seoul’s so-called May 24 sanctions against Pyongyang remains a daunting challenge with both sides refusing to budge.Seoul is adamant in its position that should it want the sanctions to be lifted, Pyongyang should apologize for its 2010 torpedo attack on the corvette Cheonan that killed 46 sailors, while Pyongyang continues to deny its responsibility.Apart from the pending issues, the North’s possible additional provocations could bring the two Koreas back on a collision course. Analysts presume that the reclusive state could set off provocations such as a long-range rocket launch around Oct. 10, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party, to strengthen its internal unity and show off its military presence to the outside world.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","day marathon talks last tuesday ,canceled the talks last friday ,four day marathon talks last ,marathon talks last tuesday ,border tensions yonhap on saturday","['North Korea', 'Red Cross', 'DMZ', 'Daemari Station in Cheolwon', 'Gangwon Province', 'Seoul', 'the Red Cross', 'Pyongyang', 'South Korea ’s', 'Panmunjeom', 'Seoul ’s Unification Ministry', 'Koreas', 'korean', 'Pyongyang', 'the Red Cross', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Koreas', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'inter - korean', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'North ’s', 'Koreas', 'North ’s', 'Workers ’ Party', 'Song Sang - ho']",3,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.31082898  0.46921247

It did not say when the meeting was held, but the communist nation is known to often report events a day after they take place.The meeting ""dismissed some members of the WPK Central Military Commission and appointed new ones and dealt with an organizational matter,"" the KCNA said in an English dispatch, monitored in Seoul. Kim Jong-un (Yonhap)It did not elaborate on the reasons for the dismissals, but the report has prompted speculation here that it may be related to the Aug. 4 land mine explosion inside the Demilitarized Zone that maimed two South Korean soldiers.North Korea initially insisted that it did not place the land mines but later expressed ""regret"" over the incident in a landmark deal sealed between the Koreas on Tuesday.South Korean military officials said they are closely monitoring the situation.""The fact that the North expressed regret over the land mine attack can be seen from Kim Jong-un's perspective as a terrible defeat,"" said one official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.""Kim Jong-un has an impulsive and aggressive character, so he won't overlook it.""The official said he believes someone will have to take responsibility for the land mine attack.""Once we know who was dismissed, it will be possible to make a fair assumption, so we are closely following the situation,"" he said.Kim spoke in detail about the agreement, saying ""under the touch-and-go situation the WPK displayed correct leadership art by steering the whole country, all the people and the service personnel, and made resolute decisions and set forth strategic policies for putting the difficult situation under control.""The deal averted a military clash between the Koreas as tensions flared up over the land mine attack and South Korea's resumption of anti-Pyongyang loudspeaker broadcasts along the border.On Aug. 20, North Korea fired artillery shells across the border in apparent anger over the broadcasts, leading to a rare exchange of fire between the sides.That day, Kim ordered the military to move into a war footing as he presided over the same enlarged session of the party's central military commission.""Kim Jong-un analyzed and reviewed the preparations for military operations made by the frontline units which had been in the state of war, and the work done in various fields in the areas where the semi-war state had been declared and how the north-south high-level urgent contact was made and appreciated them,"" the KCNA said.Kim credited his nation with defending peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in the region by proposing the inter-Korean talks first.Peace was restored because of the North's ""tremendous military muscle with the nuclear deterrent for self-defense,"" he noted, ""underscoring once again the need to channel top priority efforts into bolstering up the military capability for national defense.""Kim ""specified strategic tasks and ways for doing so,"" but the KCNA did not elaborate.The North Korean leader also ordered recovery work in the aftermath of a flood that killed more than 40 people and destroyed many houses in the northeastern border town of Rason.The recovery should be completed before the 70th founding anniversary of the party, which falls on Oct. 10, he said.On Kim's remarks, South Korea's Unification Ministry said it ""assesses"" the fact that the North called the agreement a turning point toward inter-Korean reconciliation and trust.""We expect North Korea will abide by the agreement and urge it to faithfully implement it,"" spokesman Jeong Joon-hee said during a press briefing.Asked whether South Korea plans to provide flood relief to the North, Jeong said the government will review the issue from a humanitarian stance if the North requests help.

(Unification Ministry)However, the two sides reached an agreement through their determination to defuse tensions, which sharply rose after the North forward-deployed a majority of its submarines and artillery assets and the South vowed stern retaliation.“The North Korean side repeatedly said that they came all the way there to resolve pending issues. They showed their determination to do so,” the official at Seoul’s Unification Ministry, who was informed of the negotiation process, said on the customary condition of anonymity.“The fact that Hwang Pyong-so, one of the top military officers, traveled all the way to the Peace House on the South Korean side of the border village of Panmunjeom also showed their seriousness to resolve the issues. It is rare for the top military official to come here in times of heightened military tensions.”Hwang, the director of the North Korean military’s General Political Bureau, and Kim Yang-gon, a secretary of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party, represented the North Korean side during the talks. Their South Korean counterparts were Kim Kwan-jin, chief of Cheong Wa Dae’s National Security Office, and Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo.At one point during the negotiation, the air turned especially serious when Pyongyang tried to shift the focus to the future in its apparent attempt to avoid discussing its past provocations. This, in turn, struck the nerve of Kim, the former defense minister, the official said.“Kim blurted out that our young soldiers with a bright future got injured in the detonation of land mines in the Demilitarized Zone. But the North reiterated that the two sides needed to look toward the future,” he said.To counter the North’s denial of its responsibility for the Aug. 4 land mine attack, the South Korean side also reportedly presented evidence.The toughest part of the negotiation was ensuring that the North would not stage future provocations, the official said, noting that getting the North to express “regret” over the land mine incident was less difficult.Meanwhile, over the course of the lengthy talks, the two sides kept their distance, including by having meals separately. The North Korean officials traveled back to their building a few minutes away while the South Korean officials dined at the Peace House.By Song Sang-ho  (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","senior seoul official said tuesday ,koreas engage in intense talks ,intense talks in south korea ,four day cross border talks ,stern retaliation the north korean","['South Korea', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'Koreas', 'South Korea ’s', 'inter - korean', 'Panmunjeom', 'north korean', 'Seoul ’s Unification Ministry', 'Hwang Pyong - so', 'the Peace House', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'General Political Bureau', 'Kim Yang - gon', 'North ’s', 'Workers ’ Party', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'Kim Kwan - jin', 'Cheong', 'National Security Office', 'Unification', 'Hong Yong - pyo', 'Pyongyang', 'Kim', 'North ’s', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'Song Sang - ho']",18,"[ 0.          4.          0.         ... -0.56242377  0.79408604

The two sides began the talks on Saturday evening.Kim said South Korea made a persistent demand for the prevention of recurrence of provocations to break a vicious cycle of North Korea's provocations.For decades, North Korea has a track record of carrying out provocations against South Korea, including the sinking of a South Korean warship and the shelling of a South Korean border island, both in 2010 that killed 50 South Koreans.In return for the North's expression of regret, South Korea agreed to stop anti-Pyongyang broadcasts along the heavily fortified border as of 12 p.m. Tuesday unless an abnormal situation occurs, Kim said.South Korea resumed the propaganda broadcasts earlier this month for the first time in 11 years in retaliation against North Korea for the landmine attack.North Korea has repeatedly called for the end of the broadcasts critical of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, viewing them as an insult to its dignity. The isolated country is also concerned that an influx of outside information could pose a threat to its young leader.In a sign of defusing tensions, North Korea said it will lift the semi-war state it had imposed on its military during the latest standoff.The United States also hailed the breakthrough deal.""We support President Park's tireless efforts to improve inter-Korean relations, which support peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula,"" State Department spokesman John Kirby said at a regular briefing.South and North Korea also agreed to hold talks in either Seoul or Pyongyang at an early date to improve inter-Korean relations, said Kim, Seoul's top negotiator, noting the sides came up with a basic framework for development of inter-Korean ties.""We expect the two sides will implement the agreement in good faith and create trust through dialogue and cooperation,"" said Kim.Still, Kim declined to comment on whether he discussed with his North Korean counterpart on an inter-Korean summit.In January, Park held out the prospect of a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, days after Kim said he is willing to hold summit talks with Park, if proper conditions are met.Park's two liberal predecessors held summit talks with then North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, the late father of the current leader Kim, in Pyongyang in 2000 and 2007, respectively.The two Koreas also agreed to hold Red Cross talks early next month to arrange for reunions of families separated since the 1950-53 Korean War.The two sides hope to stage the reunions around Chuseok, the Korean equivalent of Thanksgiving Day, which is celebrated in both Koreas and falls on Sept. 27.Park said the two Koreas should ""heal the pain of separated families.""U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon welcomed the agreement.""I highly appreciate the agreement to hold regular inter-Korean dialogue, and hope that this will serve as a mechanism to effectively manage any problems that may arise on the Korean Peninsula,"" Ban, a former South Korean foreign minister, said in a statement.Millions of Koreans remain separated since the Korean War, which ended in a cease-fire, not a peace treaty.Family reunions are a pressing humanitarian issue on the divided peninsula, as most of the separated family members are in their 70s and 80s, and wish to see their long-lost relatives before they die.There are no direct means of contact between ordinary civilians of the two countries that remain divided by a heavily fortified border.In 2014, the two sides held a series of temporary family reunions for the first time in more than three years.

Uncertainties were growing across the border as the North Korean military was seen sharply building up frontline artillery and sending out an unprecedented number of submarines for unidentified operations since leader Kim Jong-un declared a “quasi-state of war” on Friday. The North has forward-deployed hovercraft and 76.2-milimeter artillery guns, Seoul officials said, with frontline troops adopting full combat readiness. “While constantly monitoring the crisis situation on the peninsula, South Korea and the U.S. are flexibly looking into the deployment timing of U.S. strategic assets,” Defense Ministry spokesperson Kim Min-seok said at a news briefing. “The first is to deter a possible provocation by North Korea through the alliance’s robust readiness posture, and then we respond rigorously, to the degree where (the North) would regret it, if it indeed commits a provocation,” he said.  Military transport vehicles carrying Army troops move past the Unification Bridge, close to the Demilitarized Zone, in Paju, Gyeonggi Province, Monday. (Yonhap)Kim did not elaborate on details of the possible incoming weapons, but a nuclear-capable B-52 Stratofortress appears to be the most likely option given its military clout, the allies’ past practices and its relatively short flight time of about four hours to reach the peninsula.  During joint military exercises early last year, the U.S. sent B-52 and B-2 bombers and an F-22 stealth fighter over the peninsula and brought in a nuclear submarine, drawing Pyongyang’s repeated threats of nuclear war. The allies have also deployed powerful warships, bombers and fighters including the formidable nuclear USS George Washington aircraft carrier and the F/A-18 Hornet fighter jet in a display of force against North Korea’s major provocations. Kim’s remarks came one day after the ministry unveiled that front-line North Korean units have placed in ready position twice as many gunners as detected Friday, and that it was being unable to locate about 50 undersea vehicles, or 70 percent of the North’s submarine fleet, which have apparently left their bases.The move is likely to be aimed at securing the upper hand in the inter-Korean negotiations which have been taking place at the border village of Panmunjeom since Saturday, while gearing up for an additional provocation in case of a breakdown of the talks, military sources said. To better counter North Korea’s maritime threats, Washington has strengthened antisubmarine and other maritime warfare exercises with South Korea, a U.S. Defense Department report said.“In Northeast Asia, the department conducts several regular maritime exercises with Japan and South Korea focusing on enhancing our combined capabilities to counter provocations and manage the changing Northeast Asian security environment,” the Asia-Pacific Maritime Strategy report said. “Though its original purpose was to counter special operations forces, the annual bilateral Key Resolve/Foal Eagle exercise with the ROK now includes amphibious operations and antisubmarine warfare in recognition of the importance of the maritime domain in defending South Korea.”By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","nuclear submarine drawing pyongyang repeated ,to mobilize 52 strategic bomber ,state of war on friday ,pyongyang repeated threats of nuclear ,repeated threats of nuclear war","['South Korea', 'U.S.', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Defense Ministry', 'Kim Min -', 'North Korea', 'Army', 'the Demilitarized Zone', 'Paju', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'yonhap)kim', 'U.S.', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea ’s', 'Kim', 'north korean', 'North ’s', 'inter - korean', 'North Korea ’s', 'Washington', 'South Korea', 'U.S. Defense Department', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'northeast asian', 'Key Resolve / Foal Eagle', 'ROK', 'South Korea', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",15,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.5513351   0.26203555

And she also seems to agree that the Abe statement contains enough to warrant further open doors, not slam and shut,"" Evans Revere, senior Director at Albright Stonebridge Group, said at a Heritage Foundation discussion.Revere was referring to Park's Liberation Day address in which she positively assessed Abe's statement despite criticism that the nationalist Japanese leader failed again to offer a clear apology for the country's sexual enslavement of Korean women for its troops during World War II.In the address, Park said Abe's statement falls short of expectations, but said it's still worth noting that Abe promised that positions of previous cabinets will remain unshakable. The remarks were seen as an expression of her willingness to improve relations with Japan.""Prime Minister Abe's statement appears to have given Koreans just enough to work with as the two sides explore ways to try to improve ties and settle various pending issues between them.Without question, the Abe statement could have been better and certainly more could have been said to assuage Korean sensitivities,"" Revere said.The expert said that Abe should have made ""a stand-alone reference"" to the suffering of the Korean people, instead of merely including them in a list of the many in the region. The Japanese leader should have also made a specific reference to the sexual slavery issue, he said.Revere said he believes it was also a mistake by Abe to talk about the apology burden of future generations.""For Japan to be relieved of the need for future apologies, it's important that today's expressions of remorse and regret are seen as genuine, credible and sincere. To do so, Tokyo is going to have to make further efforts to reconcile with its Korean neighbor,"" he said.Revere said it is too early to tell whether Seoul and Tokyo will be able to make progress on thorny issues.""But what seems clear at this point is that in the aftermath of the Abe statement and thanks to what I believe is President Park's very wise and very prudent and very statesman-like reaction to it, the two sides seem prepared to try,"" he said.Sheila Smith, senior fellow for Japan studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, also praised Park's address as ""measured and thoughtful,"" saying it left room to work with Abe if the two governments decide that is what they want to do, just as the Abe statement left room to work.The two leaders at least ""did not present an additional hurdle,"" she said.Smith also expressed hope for the realization of a trilateral summit between Park, Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of China's war anniversary event set for next month.""I hope that this fall will be an occasion for the three leaders to meet and I hope that Seoul and Tokyo will find a way to make that meeting a positive opportunity for the relationship,"" she said.U.S. experts also expressed opposition to either Park or Abe attending China's military parade.""Speaking very frankly, how appropriate would it be for a Korean president to be at a military parade, if that's an option, that is hosted by the last country to have invaded Korea?"" Revere said, referring to China fighting alongside North Korea during the Korean War.He said the military parade should be separated from visits to Beijing.Michael Green, the Japan chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that Park and Abe should visit Beijing only after the Chinese parade.""I think it's better to go after than before because then you know what happened in the parade and you can put it in context.

We will work through dialogue to come up with a reasonable wage system in a way that helps enhance productivity.” The row broke out in February as the North declared a 5.18 percent wage hike as part of a sweeping regulation amendment, unilaterally rescinding the existing 5 percent annual ceiling that has ruled for years. The negotiations kicked off in July with the joint panel and Pyongyang’s General Bureau of the Special Zone Development Guidance but had made little progress in the face of the North’s unwavering demands. With other compensation taken into account, the total salaries for the some 55,000 workers will likely rise more than 5 percent, according to an official at an association of the 124 South Korean firms operating factories in Gaeseong. Nestling just north of the heavily fortified border, the complex was launched in 2004 and has since been the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean rapprochement.  In 2013, the complex saw an unprecedented four-month freeze after Pyongyang suddenly barred South Koreans’ entry to the district and withdrew its workers in apparent protest against U.N. sanctions and Seoul-Washington military exercises.(heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","korean rapprochement in 2013 ,unprecedented four month freeze after ,korean border city on monday ,unification ministry said tuesday following ,inter korean rapprochement in 2013","['Shin Hyon - heeThe', 'Koreas', 'north korean', 'the Unification Ministry', 'Gaeseong', 'north korean', 'inter - korean', 'Pyongyang ’s General Bureau of the Special Zone Development Guidance', 'south korean', 'Gaeseong', 'inter - korean', 'Pyongyang', 'South Koreans', 'U.N.', 'Seoul']",18,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.32260686  0.78495795

Kim Yong-chol, who has been leading the North's reconnaissance bureau, is found to have been recently re-promoted to a four-star general after serving as a lieutenant general for about four months, according to the sources.  His promotion largely coincides with the explosion of three North Korean wooden-box landmines on Aug. 4, which were buried in the southern side of the heavily fortified demilitarized zone that bisects the two Koreas.  South Korea blamed North Korea for the blast, vowing to make it pay the price for its provocation. Two South Korean staff sergeants were severely injured in the incident.  The sources said that the South's military is closely checking Kim's movement in a bid to find possible clues to link his promotion to the recent landmine blast.  Kim, known as a hard-liner, is believed to have orchestrated Pyongyang's two deadly attacks on the South in 2010 -- the sinking of the Cheonan warship and the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island. The two attacks killed a total of 50 South Koreans, including two civilians.  Since 2009, Kim has led the North's Reconnaissance General Bureau tasked with intelligence operations in foreign countries and cyber warfare. He was first promoted to a general in 2012 but later underwent repeated changes in his title.

The explosion nearly severed the right ankle of 23-year-old Kim and a larger part of both legs of 21-year-old Ha.In retaliation, the South Korean military restarted loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts in more than 11 years, on an irregular basis in two frontline regions as of 5 p.m. Related equipment was pulled out in 2004 in line with an inter-Korean agreement and then reinstalled at 11 spots after the North’s 2010 sinking of the South’s corvette Cheonan, but had since remained idle. “The enemy’s act this time was clearly a deliberate provocation that directly defies the truce and inter-Korean nonaggression pacts,” Defense Minister Han Min-koo told the troops during a visit to a guard post 750 meters away from the blast site. “I will have the enemy pay a severe price of its provocations. … In case of its provocation, you must not hesitate and resolutely and firmly respond with confidence, under the command of the GP chief.”  In this image dated June 16, 2004, South Korean troops remove a loudspeaker from the Odusan Unification Observatory in Paju, Gyeonggi Province, in line with an agreement between the two Koreas’ militaries. (Yonhap)Following a two-day joint probe through Aug. 7 with the United Nations Command, the JCS has concluded that steel springs, firing pins and other perceived debris of the detonated devices retrieved from the scene corroborate with the wooden-box mines used by the North Korean military.The JCS ruled out the possibility that the equipment had drifted south with the soil, such as by torrential rains, citing the lack of dirt around the mines, their buried position until the detonation and the “strong odor” of pine resin that exuded from the wreckage. “The incident has been found to be a clear provocation in which North Korean soldiers illegally breached the Military Demarcation Line and intentionally emplaced wooden-box mines,” said Koo Hong-mo, a two-star general in charge of operations at the JCS, issuing condemnation over what he called a “nasty act that any normal military cannot even think of.” The UNC issued a separate statement lambasting Pyongyang’s violation of the armistice agreement, calling for general-level talks with its military.“The investigation determined that the devices were recently emplaced, and ruled out the possibility that these were legacy land mines which had drifted from their original placements due to rain or shifting soil,” the UNC said. In a video clip of the second detonation filmed through a thermal observation device and unveiled by the JCS, a cloud of dust suddenly soared into the air, sending several soldiers flying. They were rushing to rescue Ha who was injured in the first explosion about five minutes before. Despite the series of accidents and their colleagues’ wounds, the servicemen managed to retreat and evacuate in a calm manner. The probe’s results mark a fresh setback in already strained cross-border ties days before the two Koreas celebrate the 70th anniversary of the peninsula’s liberation from Japanese colonial rule. The latest border intrusion appears to be aimed at interfering in the Ulchi Freedom Guardian, an annual South Korea-U.S. military exercise expected to kick off later this month for a two-week run, another JCS official said. “It apparently sought to interrupt the forthcoming UFG by obscuring the instigator of the provocation and creating discord inside the South,” the official told reporters on customary condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. Given Pyongyang’s longstanding disapproval of the loudspeaker program, tension is set to only escalate and concerns over another provocation ahead of the anniversary of the founding of its ruling Workers’ Party in October.The blast also triggered concerns over the seemingly porous defense posture around the highly tense area given that the mines were embedded just underneath a gate to the DMZ, which is watched by the South Korean Army, 440 meters south of the demarcation line. The North Koreans are likely to have come down between July 23 and Aug. 2, said Army Brig. Gen. Ahn Young-ho, who lead the investigation. The Kim Jong-un regime is believed to have tightened border controls to curb a constant defector outflow since he took power in December 2011. Its military has also been staging more drills for surprise attacks and ambush infiltrations into the DMZ areas, while nearly 1,300 wood or concrete markers have been set up every 200 to 300 meters along the border.Yet the Army has been closely tracking the North’s recent mine-planting activities and thus strengthened surveillance, Ahn said, though noting that weather and other factors posed hurdles for their efforts.“The area is easily eclipsed by the iron fence and surrounded by trees, making it difficult for us to monitor if the enemy enters north of the fence, which I believe the enemy took advantage of,” he said at a news conference.“And as the gate area is where we always come and go by, we might have somewhat neglected detection activities, assuming that there would not be any mines there.” More than 1 million M-14 and M-16 antipersonnel and antitank mines are expected to be scattered throughout the DMZ area. A 2008 U.N. report said land mines kill 15,000 to 20,000 people every year.Global efforts to stem the fatalities resulted in the 1999 Ottawa Convention, which prohibits the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of antipersonnel land mines. But the treaty has yet to be endorsed by the two Koreas, the U.S. and other countries including Russia, China and India. According to an August 2014 report by the Human Rights Watch, only 11 countries around the world still produce the weapons or sustain the right to do so, four of them are thought to be actively churning them out ― South Korea, India, Pakistan and Myanmar. The U.S. has not produced antipersonnel mines since the late 1990s and pledged last year to destroy its stockpiles not required for the defense of the southern part of the peninsula.

""A situation like that would never happen.""  China has invited world leaders to attend the huge military parade in September that is expected to highlight Japan's surrender in the war, but many Western leaders are likely to shun the event because it could trumpet China's rivalry with Japan.   South Korea also feels awkward about accepting China's invitation for the same reason. Additionally, Beijing has been increasingly assertive in territorial disputes with its neighbors.   Another embarrassing point is that the military parade will be staged at Tiananmen Square, where the Chinese Communist Party crushed pro-democracy demonstrations in a bloody crackdown in 1989.   South Korea and China are former battlefield foes as China fought alongside North Korea in the 1950-53 Korean War, while the United States and 20 other allied countries fought on South Korea's side under the U.N. flag.   But Seoul and Beijing have steadily improved ties since establishing diplomatic relations in 1992.

But President Park Geun-hye did not accept the resignation.Talks among labor, management and government failed in April after the Federation of Korean Trade Unions, one of two major labor umbrella groups, walked out of the negotiations in protest of the businesses‘ demand to ease criteria for firing underperforming workers.The three parties have also locked horns over major issues including the “peak wage“ system. With the official retirement age set to rise by two years to 60 next year, the government has pushed for adopting the peak wage system under which companies will extend workers‘ retirement age in return for gradually slashing their wages after a certain age.But labor unions opposed the scheme, saying it would only give leeway to companies to reduce salaries without extending their retirement age. The return of the panel head came a day after President Park persuaded him to take the job again Thursday. Park delivered a rare public address, vowing that she would press ahead with labor reform to create new jobs for struggling youths.Setting the labor reform as the nation‘s top priority in the second half of this year, Park said the reform measures will help boost the nation’s faltering economy. ”The trilateral talks will continue in line with what has been discussed until April,“ Kim said, pledging to serve as a mediator to draw a conclusion that can satisfy all the relevant parties for a ”grand social compromise.“ Kim, however, is likely to face the daunting task of persuading the labor circle to return to the dialogue, with laborers refusing to discuss a few contentious agenda items at the negotiating table. The trade unions have voiced concerns over the government‘s plan to curb regulations to hire and fire workers, saying that such a plan cannot be on the bargaining table in the first place. The FTKU said earlier this month that it would boycott the talks unless the committee scraps the proposal. Rival parties also remained at odds over Park’s labor reform initiatives.The ruling Saenuri Party leader Kim Moo-sung hailed Park, asking the labor bloc to make a “great” decision to return to the dialogue to achieve “harmony” between the young and old generations. However, main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy chairman Moon Jae-in lashed out at Park for unfairly demanding labor to make sacrifices for reform agendas.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","job again thursday park delivered ,in seoul will meet representatives ,resume stalled talks on labor ,government complex in seoul friday ,tendered his resignation in april","['Kim Dae - hwan', 'Seoul', 'Dae - hwan', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'the Federation of Korean Trade Unions', 'Park', 'Park', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'FTKU', 'Park ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Park', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39956394  0.4072575

(Yonhap)The decision was made as the joint fact-finding committee, established July 11, held its first plenary meeting at South Korea’s Defense Ministry building in central Seoul.Maj. Gen. Jang Kyung-soo, director general of the policy planning bureau at Seoul’s Defense Ministry, represented the South Korean side, while Maj. Gen. Robert F. Hedelund, U.S. Forces Korea assistant chief of staff for policy and plans, led the U.S. side.Consisting of the on-site technical assessment team and bio-defense cooperation procedure team, the committee will investigate how the anthrax sample made it to the biological research lab at the base and how the sample was dealt with after its entry into the base.During the planned on-site probe, officials from both sides plan to demonstrate exactly what happened with the sample, Seoul officials explained. “We believe the on-site investigation will help address our citizens’ concerns about the anthrax sample, as we will see all processes from the sample’s entry into the military installation to the handling of the sample and its disposal, and check whether all these took place in accordance with the international and domestic safety rules,” a Seoul official told reporters, declining to be named.After the joint probe, the committee is to report its investigation results to the Seoul-Washington Status of Forces Agreement Joint Committee, which will convene in December.The committee was established after the controversial revelation in late May that a U.S. lab in Utah mistakenly sent a live sample of anthrax bacteria to a lab in Korea, which had been using dead anthrax spores for its military research.The U.S. authorities confirmed that live anthrax samples had been mistakenly delivered to 86 military labs in 20 U.S. states, Washington and seven foreign nations -- South Korea, Australia, Canada, Britain, Japan, Italy and Germany.Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Frank Kendall has admitted that the shipment was a “serious and inexcusable mistake.”By Song Sang-ho(sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","base seoul officials said wednesday ,base in seoul on wednesday ,pyeongtaek gyeonggi province next thursday ,bacteria to lab in korea ,in seoul on wednesday yonhap","['South Korea', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Pyeongtaek', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Seoul', 'Jang Kyung - soo', 'Seoul ’s Defense Ministry', 'Robert F.

""The main reason North Korea is taking part in the ARF meeting is for its economic interests as it seeks to secure more imports of natural resources from Southeast Asian nations.""North Korea has bristled at any mention of its human rights situation despite reports of gross abuses, including public executions, torture and holding hundreds of thousands of political prisoners in concentration camps.Last month, the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights opened a field office in Seoul to monitor and document human rights violations in the North, to which Pyongyang responded with threats of war. In protest, it boycotted the Summer Universiade held in South Korea earlier this month.North Korea claims the human rights allegations are part of a U.S.-led campaign to topple its regime.The two Koreas held foreign ministerial talks at ARF meetings in 2000, 2004, 2005 and 2007, after which there were only brief encounters between the ministers in 2008 and 2011.Aside from a possible meeting between the Koreas, the ARF gathering will also be watched closely for other bilateral meetings, such as between North Korea and China.Relations between Pyongyang and Beijing have soured over North Korea's nuclear weapons program, which Pyongyang has continued to develop despite opposition from its biggest ally and benefactor.South Korea and the U.S. have repeatedly called on China to play a bigger role in reining in North Korea's nuclear program.Those calls have grown since the U.S. and other world powers struck a deal with Iran earlier this month to curb its uranium enrichment program in exchange for extensive sanctions relief.Hwang Joon-kook, special representative for Korean Peninsula peace and security affairs, told reporters Tuesday after meeting with officials in China last week that now is an ""important time where North Korea stands at a crossroads between completing its development of nuclear weapons and coming to the negotiating table to discuss its denuclearization.""

Then, the scammers would transfer the victim to another group member pretending to be the original lender and steal the money sent to pay off the original loan. Victims would sometimes borrow money from people around them to pay off the original loans.  The scammers even disguised themselves as a wine sellers and an electronics store.Some 2.14 billion won ($1.84 million) in total from 423 victims was siphoned off by the swindlers between October 2012 and June 2015.The rare cooperation between South Korean and Chinese police came after a senior South Korean police officer visited China in May to seek a joint probe on telephone-based financial scams.South Korean and Chinese police arrested five suspects by raiding their call center in China's eastern city of Qingdao on June 19, according to the South Korean police.The arrest came about three months after obtaining details on the call center and its members from six others, who were detained for allegedly withdrawing money or providing bank accounts for the scammers.Police said they later arrested 30 other scammers when they came to South Korea.""Local authorities' support is crucial to arrest the leaders of the phone-based scam groups as they often stay abroad,"" said a spokesman for the SMPA, adding they are expecting further collaboration.

""The country has one of the lowest birthrates in the world, and is the fastest-aging society among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development member states.""   Such changes can have an enormous impact on the economy by reducing the country's workforce down the road, he said.  ""The government plans to unveil the new plan around the end of this year to tackle the problems of the low birthrate and aging population,"" Joo said.  The country announced two sets of measures in the past, including giving cash support to families that have many children, helping to provide more comprehensive child care services and expanding welfare for senior citizens.  South Korea's total fertility rate, or the average number of children that would be born to a woman over her lifetime, stood at 1.21 last year, down from 1.47 in 2000.   The country is already an ""aging society"" with 7 percent of the population over 65 and will become an ""aged society"" with 14 percent of all people over 65 in 2018. It is expected to become a ""super-aged society"" in 2026, when one-fifth of the population will be over 65.  ""A drop in labor quality and consumption is all going to influence the country and its industries,"" Joo said.  The official, in particular, said that with the country's population aging at a much faster rate than others, there is a need to carefully check what fallout such developments can have.  The vice minister said that the government will also announce a mid- to long-term economic development plan late this year that can compensate for demographic changes down the line.

The number of people diagnosed with MERS in the country remained unchanged at 186, and the MERS death toll also stayed flat at 36.Kwon Deok-cheol, head of the central MERS task force, told reporters in Sejong that while the government accepts recommendations made by the World Health Organization, it is in the process of outlining its own assessment of the situation to the U.N. agency.""We plan to adhere to WHO's position, but at the same time, policymakers are contemplating a move to independently lower the MERS alert status from the current 'caution' to the lowest level of 'attention,'"" the official said. ""Such a move will be the same as announcing the end to the respiratory disease.""He did not give dates but hinted that the downgrading of the alert status may be carried out on or around Aug. 2. The date will mark the 28th day after the last confirmed MERS cases was diagnosed in the country on July 4.The government's criteria for taking this step is slightly different from those set by the United Nations health organization that is expected to announce the end of MERS four weeks after the last infected person has tested negative for the illness-inducing coronavirus.Under this system, South Korea can only be declared a MERS-free country after the middle of next month.The Ministry of Health and Welfare said earlier in the day there are 258 people in isolation as suspected cases following possible exposure to the MERS virus, down 64 people from the day before.  Out of the nearly 16,700 people who have been subject to isolation since May 20 when the first MERS case was confirmed, 16,432 have been released after showing no symptoms for more than the known maximum incubation period of 14 days for the disease.Out of those diagnosed with MERS, 133 have been discharged from hospitals following complete recoveries.Of the remaining 17 receiving treatment in hospitals, four are in unstable condition, while 12 have already tested negative for the MERS virus, a sign they have overcome the disease, according to health authorities. They added that the government will pay for the medical bills of people suffering from the side effects of MERS.MERS is a viral respiratory disease that is still fairly new to humans. The disease has claimed over 530 lives globally, posting a fatality rate of over 36 percent.In South Korea, the fatality rate stands at 19.4 percent, with most of the people succumbing to the illness having had underlying medical conditions. The ministry said 91.7 percent of the people who died were being treated for cancer or had serious heart, lung or kidney conditions.There currently is no vaccine or treatment for the disease that was first reported only in 2012 in Saudi Arabia.

The remark was also surprising as Park has rarely used her right to give clemency ahead of the national holidays like Liberation’s Day, Chuseok and Lunar Holiday. Despite repeated calls from politics and business, the president said she would administer the law strictly and treat all criminal offenders equally. Cheong Wa Dae also has expressed concerns over public criticism as the president granting pardons on high-profile businessmen is still widely viewed as government favoritism to conglomerates. In May, Park also lashed out at the special pardons granted by her two predecessors to deceased businessman Sung Woan-jong, saying such decisions undermined the rule of law. She even said the system of granting special paroles should be fixed to break the chain of corruption.However, Park’s planned use of presidential pardons next month suggests that she may seek a change in her leadership as well as her image of an “obstinate and uncommunicative” president. Park enters a halfway point in her five-year term in August, in which many fear that she would start losing momentum in her drive on state affairs as public attention shifts to the general election in April next year, and also to the presidential election in 2017.By issuing special pardons, Park is seen trying to become more sympathetic toward the public at a critical time when the nation suffers from sluggish economy.Park has granted special paroles once so far, and only for minor crimes committed by those living in poverty on Lunar New Year’s Day last year. She has not granted presidential pardons for any politicians or businessmen in prison since taking office in early 2013.If exercised, Park will be issuing special pardon for the second time. Under the law, South Korean presidents are not required to seek parliamentary endorsement for their exercise of special pardons.The ruling Saenuri Party and the business community welcomed Park’s plan.The Federation of Korean Industries said the president’s decision was “very encouraging” for businesses struggling with unfavorable economic conditions.Some business insiders have been calling for the release of key members of families that run conglomerates, saying keeping them in jail could delay the companies’ key operations. Politicians have also argued that the government should release businessmen to revive business investments and prop up the nation’s slowing economy.SK Group chairman Chey Tae-won has been in jail for more than two years on charges of embezzlement. CJ chairman Lee Jae-hyun was also sentenced to three years in jail on charges of tax evasion and accounting fraud last year, but was granted a stay of execution due to health problems.

The specifics for the government plan will be finalized by September. The Korean government will also provide ways for students already in Korea for language courses to be able to transfer to degree programs. In addition, Korean schools outside of the country will now admit foreign students -- up to 30 percent of their quota -- so that the foreign students can become more interested in pursuing higher education in Korea, the ministry said.More state-run foreign student service centers will be set up to support foreign students’ stays, while “integrated dormitories,” where students of various colleges and universities in a certain region can stay and form a community, will be built.Via these measures, the ministry is planning to increase the percentage of foreigners among students in higher education to 5 percent by 2023, up from 2 percent in 2014.According to the ministry, the number of students around the globe studying abroad reached 4.5 million in 2012, jumping more than fivefold from 800,000 in 1975.But the figure of students coming to Korea has slowly declined since 2011, when it peaked at 89,537.

Last year, Pyongyang imposed an entry ban on foreign tourists for about five months due to Ebola concerns.  ""In particular, hospitals and medical clinics in Pyongyang have notified residents of how to prevent the outbreak of the disease,"" the KCNA said.  The report added that other provinces, such as North Pyongan Province bordering China, are closely examining those who have recently been in the Middle East and shown cold symptoms, such as coughing and sneezing.  North Korea has dispatched many laborers to the Middle East in a bid to earn hard currency as it has been under heavy U.N. sanctions due to its nuclear and missile tests and strained relations with South Korea.  At the request of the North, South Korea has installed three thermal scanners at the North's checkpoints entering a joint industrial park in the North's border city of Kaesong, where about 53,000 North Koreans work for South Korean companies.

Human Rights Council in January 2014, the North claimed that capital punishments are given in extremely limited cases. But death penalties have still been given for a wide range of crimes,” the whitepaper said.“Especially in several recent years, death penalties have been given for watching and distributing (South) Korean films and trading or smuggling drugs.” Some defectors, who were interviewed for the whitepaper, said that those who were caught receiving money from South Korea’s National Intelligence Service, carrying bibles or helping North Koreans defect to the South were also executed for “antistate activities and treason.”According to a survey of North Korean defectors that was conducted between 2008 and 2014, the total number of North Koreans reported by the defectors to have been publicly executed was 1,382, the whitepaper said. The annual report also pointed out that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s directives or instructions appear to be “supralegal” as at some public court hearings, death-row inmates are set free under Kim’s “generosity.”“In some cases, death sentences were canceled, according to witness accounts. It appears that Kim Jong-un intends to highlight his image as a leader caring for his people, and this shows that his directives go beyond the law,” the whitepaper said.The paper also underscored that no improvement has been made regarding North Korean’s rights to food and health, due to Pyongyang’s discriminatory way of distributing food that has limited ordinary citizens’ access to food. The continuing economic debilitation and military-first policy has also led to the uneven distribution of resources, the paper said.In recent years, the international community has been increasing pressure on the North to improve its woeful human rights record. Last year, the report by the U.N. Commission of Inquiry said that human rights abuses in the North amount to “crimes against humanity.”The KINU plans to publish an English version of the whitepaper in late August.By Song Sang-ho(sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","court hearings death row inmates ,korean government report said wednesday ,survey of north korean defectors ,korea has meted out death ,hearings death row inmates","['North Korea', 'south korean', 'Whitepaper on Human Rights', 'North Korea', 'Korean Institute for National Unification', 'North ’s', 'KINU', 'Pyongyang', 'U.S.', 'U.N.', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'korean', 'the U.N.

Lee Hee-ho, wife of the deceased president who took the reign from 1998 to 2003, has requested approval for her trip from the Unification Ministry, spokesperson Lim Byeong-cheol said. In line with Pyongyang’s proposal, five officials from each side have agreed to meet on June 30 in Gaeseong to discuss details of her visit, according to Kim Sung-jae, who served as the Nobel Peace Prize winner’s last culture minister and currently works at the Kim Dae-jung Peace Center. The former minister will head the South’s delegation, while its counterparts are likely to be led by Maeng Kyong-il, chief of the North’s Asia-Pacific Peace Committee.   Lee Hee-ho (Yonhap)“We received the request today from the center and are planning to decide on Lee’s journey after looking into its needs and whether it meets requirements,” Lim said at a news briefing. The 93-year-old former first lady had initially sought to cross the border late last year but later postponed it due to her deteriorating health condition. Kim Jong-un invited Lee to visit Pyongyang “in good seasons” this year in a letter to her in December, chiefly designed to express gratitude for the flowers sent by her to mark the third anniversary of the death of his father and longtime strongman Kim Jong-il. Last April, Lee’s side offered to meet with the North Korean officials to arrange a trip the following month but they asked to delay it. The exact time frame is to be hammered out but Lee’s side is setting sights on a date before Aug. 15, the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the peninsula, Kim Sung-jae said. “We’ve already held consultations on the land route, lodgings and a meeting with Kim Jong-un last time when North Korea invited her, so we will focus on the timing (in Gaeseong),” he was quoted as saying in a media interview. The project is a rare sign of cordiality between the divided states in the face of escalating tension due to the launch of a U.N. human rights office in Seoul, upcoming South Korea-U.S. military drills and other contentions. If the planned meeting with the young ruler does materialize, Lee will be the first South Korean to see him face to face.

It was sent by Jon Kuk-man, head of the North's university sports federation.In the message, North Korea said it won't take part in the Universiade because of the scheduled opening of the Seoul office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. The field office, which will open Tuesday, will be charged with monitoring and documenting human rights in North Korea.The International University Sports Federation's secretary general, Eric Saintrond, was also listed on the recipient list, but Kim said FISU has yet to receive the same email.Kim said the organizing committee is working with the Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, to determine the veracity of the North Korean message.""It's premature to conclude that North Korea has completely pulled out of the Universiade,"" Kim added.Yoon Jang-hyun, mayor of Gwangju and president of the organizing committee, also held out hope that the North will change its mind.""We express regret over the email from North Korea,"" Yoon said.""But with an open mind, we will wait until the last minute for North Korea to participate.""In March, North Korea had said it would compete in athletics, diving, artistic gymnastics, rhythmic gymnastics, table tennis, judo, women's football and handball.However, the country missed the June 3 deadline to formally register for the event and also let the second deadline of June 15 pass.North Korea took part in the last Universiade held in South Korea, the 2003 summer competition in Daegu.On May 29, the North threatened to strike back at the South for the opening of the human rights office. Pyongyang dubbed the plan to set up the office ""an unpardonable provocation.""North Korea has long been labeled one of the world's worst human rights violators, but it has often bristled at such criticism, calling it a U.S.-led attempt to topple its regime.

The number of people in quarantine stood at 5,216 as of early Monday.The health ministry said the fatality rate of the disease stood at 10.7 percent, much lower than the 40 percent tallied in the past, with most people succumbing to MERS having underlying medical problems""The government is doing all it can to quickly contain the outbreak,"" the finance minister told lawmakers on the Strategy and Finance Committee. ""There is a need to guard against excessive anxiety and to limit the economic fallout.""Choi said that Monday and Tuesday will be a watershed for the country in terms of MERS coming under control. He said that if the spread is arrested as forecast by experts, the situation will calm down, even if there are sporadic isolated cases.He then told lawmakers that the government will quickly reach a decision on the issue of a supplementary budget. There have been growing calls for an extra budget in the wake of the MERS scare and a slowdown in growth.""The final assessment on the matter will be decided after examining all circumstances up till late June,"" the official said.Choi said earlier in the month that the country's growth will hover in the low 3 percent range for 2015, much lower than the 3.8 percent predicted by the finance ministry on Dec. 21.He, however, said that some sort of economy-boosting measures are needed as a result of MERS, and depending on the fallout, the amount of the support could become large. The official hinted that the government might issue bonds if it opts to go forward with the extra budget.""If extra funds are generated, talks will be held within the government to use part of the money to deal with the drought that is affecting the country,"" he said. The official said that while there are concerns that a supplementary budget can lead to fiscal health problems, South Korea's central government debt is relatively small compared to others.""Instead of focusing too much on the short-term balance, there is a need to be flexible, and strive for fiscal health in the medium to long term,"" he claimed. The finance minister said that under present conditions, raising taxes is not a good idea because it can adversely affect the economy.The policymaker, who doubles as deputy prime minister for economic affairs, said sales at local department stores and large discount outlets fell in the first week of June compared with a month earlier. Payments made through credit cards were down 5.5 percent earlier this month, vis-a-vis the first two weeks of May.Data showed that the tourism and leisure industries were hit the hardest with people spending less on entertainment and eating out.On the criticism directed against the government for not disclosing information about the outbreak, which some argue helped spread the illness, Choi conceded that the health ministry did not do a good job in the early stages. He, however, said that while Seoul wants to guard against wrong information getting out and causing more confusion, it is now committed to releasing all information to the public in a timely manner.Choi also said exports and industrial production were hurt by the sluggish pace of global economic recovery, with facility investment and money poured into the construction sector on the wane.""A drop in exports is not as severe as negative growth in global trade volume, but it is facing unfavorable exchange rate challenges,"" he said. Outbound shipments plunged 10.9 percent on-year in May.Both the Japanese yen and the euro have weakened compared with the U.S. dollar, sapping the price competitiveness of South Korean goods in overseas markets.On fears that a weak yen may pose problems, the minister said that such a development is linked to Tokyo engaging in a quantitative easing program. He said that by fueling domestic consumer spending, the government wants to keep the current account surplus in check. He said that unlike in the past, there is little room for policymakers to intervene directly in foreign exchange rates.In regards to employment, the minister said jobs created in the first quarter were down compared with the previous three-month period, but there was a rebound in May. Some 354,000 new jobs were added to the labor market in the January-March period from 729,000 a year earlier. In May, however, 379,000 more jobs were created from the month before.On other developments, the finance minister said the government is keeping close tabs on a rise in household debt, which is starting to raise alarm bells. He, however, said that with other major countries having almost zero interest rates, it is inevitable that South Korea will maintain its low rate policy. Choi said lower interest burden is another factor that can reduce fallout from more debt.On the impact of U.S. interest rate hikes, the official said measures are being examined that can limit sudden capital flight that can destabilize the market.Despite the troubles, the government is fully committed to pushing forward labor, financial, education and public sector reforms that can bolster the country's competitiveness down the line, he said.

More than 180 experts and high-ranking officials participated in the forum “Institutionalizing Anticorruption and Good Governance” to seek identity areas for targeted intervention, as well as general tools and strategies to combat corruption. “The question of combatting corruption is no longer a national issue but a global problem. Institutionalizing anticorruption and good governance in the international viewpoint is, therefore, essential,” Paul Linnarz, the regional representative for economic policy, said in his welcoming speech. Linnarz is also a resident representative of German political foundation Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung’s Japanese office. The two-day forum, cohosted by KAS and Asian Institute of Management Rizalino S. Navarro Policy Center of Competitiveness in Philippines, offered several speeches, experts’ lectures and closed-door discussion sessions. While poor public service and bad leadership are often the sources of corruption, several key elements can greatly affect the corruption level, a Filipino expert said. “Improving the economic competitiveness as well as boosting civic engagement and information flow are key factors for eradicating corruption,” said Ronald U. Mendoza, economics professor at the AIM and former senior economist with UNICEF’s Policy and Practice Group in New York. Participants also discussed some common myths about corruption.While many think that a strong anticorruption agency may be the answer to combating corruption, the accountability issue actually poses an obstacle, an Australian expert pointed out.“In principle, they are accountable to the national parliaments, and in many countries parliaments are so poorly organized that effectively these organizations are accountable to no one,” said Norman Abjorensen, the visiting fellow in the Policy and Governance Program of the Australian National University. “They can then act like a loose cannon, creating more damage than benefits to the anticorruption cause.”The closed-door afternoon sessions focused on the positive role of access to information and IT platforms in tackling corruption. On Thursday, participants will have an anticorruption discussion with Senator Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III, chairperson of the Electoral Reforms and People’s Participation Senate Committee. Another discussion will be held at the AIM over rampant corruption in campaigning and election.

Yun planned to visit Tokyo in April 2013, but his visit was canceled after Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso paid tribute to Japanese war dead at the controversial Yasukuni Shrine.Along with Yun, acting Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan is being cited as a Seoul official who could potentially visit Japan to attend the anniversary ceremony. Observers say whether Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will attend it will be a critical factor for Seoul to determine its representative to the anniversary event.Meanwhile, Seoul and Tokyo plan to hold the eighth round of director general-level talks over the issue of “comfort women,” a euphemism for sex slaves who were forced by Japan to serve in its frontline military brothels.Launched last April, the two sides have held seven rounds of talks in Tokyo. But there has been no critical progress in their efforts to address the issue. Seoul has demanded Tokyo offer an explicit apology and compensation to Korean victims, while Tokyo has argued that the issue was already settled under a 1965 bilateral treaty that normalized the two countries’ relations.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","japan to attend the anniversary ,the 50th anniversary in tokyo ,yun planned to visit tokyo ,anniversary in tokyo and hold ,50th anniversary in tokyo","['South Korea', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'Seoul ’s Foreign Ministry', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'Fumio Kishida', 'Yun', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'japanese', 'Taro Aso', 'japanese', 'Choi Kyung - hwan', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'korean', 'Tokyo', 'Song Sang - ho']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40313694  0.46998978

The ministry said in its press briefing on Tuesday, “We will make a database for medics to identify the MERS patients and the medical centers where they were hospitalized.”The information will, however, be “disclosed only to medics and not the public to avoid misunderstanding and excessive anxiety,” the official said, adding that, “Names of hospitals are not revealed to the public even in advanced countries.”The ministry tried to allay the public’s concerns, saying the virus is under close supervision at medical centers and has no risk of spreading. Despite the government‘s latest action, fears don’t seem to be going away and some civic groups are calling on the government to disclose more transparent information to the public. A local civic group “Pyeongtaek Advocacy Group,” representing the region where one patient was diagnosed with the virus, is calling for making the information public. “Fears are spreading fast but we have no idea of what the government is doing to deal with the issue. The government should be more responsible in handling the incident,” one representative of the civil group said. Seoul on Tuesday confirmed two deaths from MERS, while six more have been added to the list of infected patients in the country. The two dead bodies will reportedly be cremated as the entire bodies are contaminated with the virus. Among the six, two are believed to be the first tertiary infection cases, the ministry said.

Realistically, however, there could be different views on the specific ways and level of pressure, he said on background.It represents a dilemma for South Korea, which is seeking to get tougher on its increasingly hostile communist neighbor.The South's top nuclear envoy, Hwang Joon-kook, held trilateral discussions with his U.S. and Japanese counterparts, Sung Kim and Junichi Ihara, in Seoul last week. Hwang and Kim then visited Beijing for separate talks with China's top diplomat on Korea, Wu Dawei.The series of diplomatic meetings came in response to Pyongyang's claims of launching a ballistic missile from a submarine and mastering a technology to mount nuclear bombs onto missiles.In Tokyo, senior officials from South Korea, the U.S., Japan, China and Russia met for a regional security forum. All the countries are members of the now-suspended six-party talks on the North's nuclear weapons program.""The five parties have agreed on the need for pressure on North Korea. For now, there is no option other than pressure,"" the official told reporters on the condition of anonymity. ""But there could be differences on what and how to do.""Besides U.N.-led sanctions, the human rights issue can be a card to ratchet up pressure on the North, but China and Russia remain opposed to that, he pointed out.""Economic cooperation can also serve as a tool for pressure,"" the official said, but he stopped short of elaborating.What is important is to ""change the thought and calculation"" of the North's leaders and persuade Pyongyang to return to the negotiating table, he added.Pyongyang has not budged at all, passing the responsibility for lack of dialogue to Washington.In a statement issued Sunday, the North's foreign ministry said it's too late for any talks, saying the country will continue its efforts toward a ""balance of forces"" with the U.S. through the development of nuclear weapons.Another South Korean government official said, ""It seems like North Korea publicly used the expression 'balance of forces.'""It apparently shows that Pyongyang has no will for talks aimed at dismantling its nuclear weapons program.

Two of them were patients in the hospital, while the other person is a son of another patient who had visited the hospital to care for his parent, the Health Ministry said.They had not been monitored by the authorities as they had shown no symptoms of the disease when they were dismissed from the hospital, according to the ministry.The total number of MERS infections reached 18 in 12 days since the first outbreak on May 20.Still, the ministry said the country has yet to report any tertiary infections, meaning all 17 people diagnosed since the first case became infected after coming in close contact with the first patient.A confirmed tertiary infection will make any of the 18 people who have been diagnosed a carrier.Initially, the country had isolated only the people who have come in close contact with the first patient, who reportedly caught the disease while traveling to the Middle East in mid-April.As a growing number of people are diagnosed with the disease, the government has begun to isolate every person who has come in close contact with any of the patients.As of Monday, 682 people out of 715 who have come in close contact with any of the patients were in isolation at state-designated facilities or their homes. The remaining 33 have been released as they showed no symptoms of the disease past a 14-day incubation period, according to officials from the Health and Welfare Ministry.Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo said the government is mobilizing all-out efforts to prevent further infection.""This week will become a critical crossroads over whether MERS will continue to spread or subside,"" Moon said in a policy coordination meeting with the ruling Saenuri Party officials in Seoul. ""I am very sorry for worrying citizens and causing them anxiety.""Meanwhile, a person who had come in close contact with the first patient has died while at a hospital in Suwon, located some30 kilometers south of Seoul, according to hospital and health ministry officials.The 58-year-old female patient, whose identity has been withheld, is believed to have died due to acute respiratory failure at around 6:00 pm., hospital officials said.Health officials in the city said the exact cause of death has yet to be identified, also adding that the person had not been diagnosed.The death, if linked to the disease, will mark the first-ever MERS-related death in the country and the second in Asia.MERS is a viral respiratory illness that is fairly new to humans. There had been only 1,142 reported cases in 23 countries since the first case was confirmed in Saudi Arabia in 2012 with all cases linked to countries in and near the Middle East so far.There currently is no vaccine or treatment for the disease that has a very high fatality rate of over 40 percent.

We will be factoring in preliminary data for June as well as consider market indicators such as sales,"" said a Finance Ministry official.The government is set to announce its revised economic outlook later next month when it is also expected to downgrade its forecast of other macroeconomic indicators, such as employment and consumer inflation.Seoul's current growth forecast, announced late last year, stands at 3.8 percent. If it lowers the figure by 0.5 percentage point, the revised outlook of 3.3 percent will be slightly higher than forecasts by other economic institutions.Earlier this month, the state-run Korea Development Institute slashed its outlook to 3 percent from 3.5 percent, while the Bank of Korea cut its forecast to 3.1 percent from 3.4 percent last month.The International Monetary Fund has also lowered its forecast for the Korean economy to 3.3 percent from 3.7 percent, while many private sector think tanks are predicting the economy to expand at the 2 percent level.The series of downgrades come as the country's heavily trade-reliant economy is recovering at a slower-than-expected pace due mostly to faltering global demand and a weak Japanese yen.Industrial output in all industries dipped 0.3 percent on-month in April as sluggish exports offset a recovery in consumption, according to Statistics Korea.Recently released central bank data showed that souring trade conditions have hit manufacturers, with the index gauging their sentiment tumbling to 75 from 80, the first fall in four months.The consumer price index has also been crawling. It increased less than 1 percent for the fifth month in a row in April, well below the government's 2 percent target for this year.Some market watchers raised views that the government may slash its consumer price inflation forecast to the low 1 percent level.The central bank has already slashed its inflation outlook to 0.9 percent from 1.9 percent.

Security Council resolutions barring the communist state from any launch using ballistic missile technology.The UNSC sanctions panel on North Korea unveiled the plan during its regular briefing to the UNSC on Thursday. The move came after Seoul said this week that it had sent a letter to the committee calling for a probe into the North’s SLBM test.Criticizing Seoul for referring its SLBM test to the committee, Pyongyang has demanded that the UNSC convene an emergency session to discuss the South Korea-U.S. military drills, which it claims have worsened stability on the Korean Peninsula.In a letter, North Korea’s U.N.-based office said that, should the U.N. panel take issue only with the SLBM test, it would prove that the UNSC is nothing but a “political tool” for the U.S.“The joint exercise that South Korea and the U.S. conduct is the root cause of the deterioration in the security conditions of the Korean Peninsula,” the letter reads.The North sent similar letters to the UNSC last July and August. But the issues that the North raised were not discussed at any UNSC session.There has been a flurry of speculation over the authenticity of the photos that the North released to claim that it “successfully” conducted an underwater ejection test of the SLBM.Some argue that the photos have been manipulated and that the missile was fired from a submerged barge, not a submarine. But Seoul’s National Intelligence Service said the North did conduct an ejection test of the SLBM.Irrespective of the speculations, Seoul has argued that any use of a projectile using ballistic missile technology constitutes a violation of UNSC resolutions banning the North’s missile launches.Pyongyang’s pursuit of SLBM technology has posed a serious security challenge to South Korea and the U.S. as they have no viable means to counter the SLBM threats given that it is difficult to detect deep-water submarine operations. Seoul believes it would take four to five years for the North to fully develop and deploy a SLBM.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","north slbm test criticizing seoul ,korea recent test of submarine ,slbm test criticizing seoul for ,unsc on thursday the move ,banning the north missile launches","['U.N.', 'North Korea ’s', 'U.N.

The two were transported to a hospital to test for infection, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The fourth confirmed patient, in her 40s, spent about five hours with her 76-year-old father, who was sharing the hospital room with the first of two confirmed MERS patients earlier this month.Passengers arriving from the Middle East pass by a thermal camera at Incheon airport on May 21. (Yonhap)When her father became the third confirmed MERS patient on May 21, she reportedly asked the health authorities to quarantine her, as she was experiencing mild symptoms including a fever and a headache. The woman was worried that she may have MERS, and wished to be isolated at a medical facility for fear of transmitting the virus to her husband and daughter.The authorities, however, sent her home, saying her symptoms were not strong enough to be considered MERS. Yet she eventually showed a high fever five days after her father’s diagnosis and was confirmed as the fourth MERS patient in the country.Since her diagnosis, the Health Ministry has been accused by the public of acting negligently despite widespread fear of the rare disease by rejecting her initial request to be isolated, which left her husband and her daughter also at potential risk of infection. The incubation period of MERS is two to 14 days, and it is believed that patients are not contagious during that period. A fever above 38 degrees Celsius is considered one of the typical symptoms of MERS, along with coughing and shortness of breath.The Health Ministry explained that the fourth patient’s fever on May 21 didn’t reach 38 degrees Celsius, and she therefore wasn’t considered a potential MERS patient. Dr. Kim Woo-joo, who is also the head of the Transgovernmental Enterprise for Pandemic Influenza in Korea, said the fourth patient should have been isolated in a medical facility even if her fever wasn’t above 38 degrees Celsius.“I think (the government) should have been more flexible with the particular case,” he told The Korea Herald. “I think the ministry was focusing too much on the rules that only those whose fever is above 38 degrees Celsius should have quarantined. For the fourth patient, however, they should have taken into account that she was in the same room as three other confirmed MERS patients and she, in fact, nursed one of them.”Asked if the fourth patient’s spouse and daughter should be isolated, Kim said the ministry should consult with the fourth patient first. “If she physically stayed away from her family in the house ― at least 2 meters away at all times ― I think the chances (of infection) aren’t very high,” he said.A total of 63 individuals, including health care workers and the patients’ families, were being monitored for possible infection on Tuesday.MERS is known to be caused by coronaviruses, a large family of viruses that cause a range of illnesses in humans from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. There is no known cure or vaccine for MERS, which has a fatality rate of 40.7 percent.More than 95 percent of the confirmed cases worldwide were in the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The first Korean MERS patient was diagnosed with the disease on May 20, following his trip to the Middle East from April 18 to May 3.Since it was first identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, 1,142 people from 23 countries have been infected by the virus. Among them, 465 died from the disease.

The AREX, which runs from the airport to Seoul Station in central Seoul through 11 stops, allows passengers to travel between the two destinations in 43 minutes on express trains. Subway Line No. 9, which is currently under construction, connects the northwestern part of the capital to the eastern region. With the majority of the line now operating, the remaining 13-kilometer-long route is to complete construction soon, officials said.

Ahn Cheol-soo and Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon hosted a debate at the National Assembly emphasizing the importance of inter-Korean business and resumption of talks.The conservative ruling camp, on the other hand, maintained the principle that any lifting of the sanctions should be preconditioned with North Korea’s admission of the attack.The ruling Saenuri Party stressed that the North should first take “responsible” actions including an official apology on the sinking of the Cheonan before Seoul lifts the sanctions that were imposed because of the torpedo attack.The South Korean government, which had indicated a more flexible approach to the North earlier this month through humanitarian and civic-level assistance, faces a dilemma over the mounting calls to improve ties with the North, which remains adamant and isolated, as showcased in its abrupt cancellation of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s visit last week.On Sunday, the communist state ratcheted up its demand for the lifting of sanctions.Seoul countered by renewing its calls for Pyongyang to come out for dialogue to discuss a range of issues including the lifting of the sanctions that ban economic cooperation and assistance for the North.“We have repeatedly said that should the North respond to our proposal for dialogue, we would discuss bilateral issues including the lifting of the May 24 sanctions and try to narrow our differences,” Seoul’s Unification Ministry said in a press release.“In the process, we will strive to ensure that North Korea takes responsible measures (to deal with the sinking of the corvette).”Hours earlier, Pyongyang denied responsibility for the sinking of the Cheonan, calling Seoul’s blame an “outright fabrication.” Proposing a joint investigation, the North said the sanctions based on the “falsified outcome” of Seoul’s probe are inappropriate.“The South should respond to our demand to jointly investigate the sinking of the corvette if it has evidence to pinpoint North Korea as the culprit,” the North’s powerful National Defense Commission said in a statement, portraying the economic sanctions as a “byproduct of political conspiracy.”“As the bisected ship’s body has been salvaged, the reinvestigation will be a lot easier. The NDC has its inspection team ready that will be sent for the reinvestigation.” Seoul has refused to accept Pyongyang’s earlier proposal for the joint investigation with many arguing that it is wrong to allow “criminals” ― North Korea ― to get involved in the investigation process. A Seoul-led multinational probe team, including experts from the U.S., Australia, Sweden and Britain, concluded that a midget North Korean submarine torpedoed the 1,200-ton vessel, breaking it into two parts. As a critical piece of evidence, the team presented part of a North Korean torpedo that was discovered near the scene of the ship’s sinking close to the tense maritime border.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","korean submarine torpedoed the 200 ,chilly five years after seoul ,2010 which killed 46 sailors ,korean progressive group on sunday ,midget north korean submarine torpedoed","['Seoul', 'North Korea', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'south korean', 'inter - korean', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Seoul', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'the National Assembly', 'inter - korean', 'North Korea ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon ’s', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul ’s Unification Ministry', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'National Defense Commission', 'NDC', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Australia', 'Sweden', 'Britain', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'Song Sang - ho']",3,"[ 0.          3.          4.         ... -0.69348174  0.73924118

Li, who took up the post in March and presented his credentials to North Korea's ceremonial leader, Kim Yong-nam, has not yet met with the North Korean leader amid strained ties over the North's defiant pursuit of nuclear weapons. Li's predecessor, Liu Hongcai, met then-North Korean leader Kim Jong-il less than a month after assuming the post. China is North Korea's economic lifeline and diplomatic backer. Asked about the absence of a meeting between the North Korean leader and the Chinese ambassador, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying replied that, ""As far as I have learned, the Chinese ambassador to North Korea presented his credentials to the North Korean leader on March 30."" ""It means that the ambassador can carry out normal diplomatic activities"" in North Korea, Hua said. North Korean leader Kim has yet to visit China since taking the helm of the reclusive state in late 2011.The alliance between North Korea and China has often been described as being ""forged in blood"" during the 1950-53 Korean War, but it has been wearing thin recently as China's economic and military clout have been growing in Asia.

A legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War, the DMZ bisects the peninsula.North Korea's Rodong Sinmun, the communist party's official newspaper, on Thursday carried an article and photo of their visit to the birthplace of the late leader in Pyongyang.The newspaper reported that Maguire said she was ""highly touched"" after learning about the late leader's revolutionary life.It also quoted Korean-American Eun-hee Ahn as saying that Kim devoted his entire life to the freedom and emancipation of North Koreans.The activists' upcoming trek has spurred rows here as some critics said that their move will not help resolve the pressing issues of North Korea's nuclear weapons program and human rights violations.Touching on what could be seen as pro-North Korean remarks, Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies, said that North Korea has a tendency to use outsiders' visits to the North for propaganda.""There is a need to focus on the purpose of their upcoming event,"" he added.South Korea has decided to allow the foreign activists to cross the heavily fortified inter-Korean border, but recommended they use a western land route instead of walking through the truce village of Panmunjom. Seoul has also advised them to cross the border by car, not on foot.The truce village sits in the middle of the DMZ, which is guarded by stone-faced soldiers on each side of the military demarcation line.But despite Seoul's opposition, the group said the activists will stick to their plan to walk across through the truce village as their peace message should be delivered at a place with a symbolic legacy of the conflict.""South Korea has decided not to allow journalists to cover the event at the DMZ,"" said a government official. ""If the government permits reporters to cover it at the truce village, the move could be seen as official approval for the activists' DMZ crossing.""The activists said that the purpose of the DMZ crossing is to express hope that Korean families separated by the Korean War will be united someday and military tensions between the two sides can be reduced.Seoul has said that the planned event should be made in a way that does not spark unintended tension on the Korean Peninsula, raising concerns that it could be politicized by the North.

The upcoming annual security forum is slated for May 29-31.If held, it will be the first bilateral talks between the top defense officials in four years, as they have shunned such meetings due to deteriorated bilateral relations over history-related issues, including Japan's refusal to apologize for its wartime atrocities.Icy Seoul-Tokyo relations have taken a turn for the worse in recent months after the Abe administration renewed claims to South Korea's easternmost islets of Dokdo, and attempted to deny its wrongdoing during World War II, such as the forced sexual enslavement of Asian women, mostly Korean, for its soldiers. Korea was under harsh colonial rule by Japan from 1910 to 1945. ""On the table would be issues of mutual interest including how to work closely to deter and counter North Korea's nuclear and missiles threats and the implementation of the revised U.S.-Japan defense guidelines,"" another source said.In April, Washington and Tokyo disclosed the upgraded version of their 1978 defense cooperation guidelines, which allows Japan to play a greater military role aboard. South Korea has urged the two countries closely consult with it in implementing the guidelines amid concerns over Japan's possible amendment of its pacifist Constitution and a regional arms race.""To maximize the national security interests, it would be desirable for us to separate security issues from historic and other diplomatic feuds,"" said an official at Seoul's defense ministry, requesting anonymity.    Despite the strained relations, Seoul has been working with Japan on security matters.

Security Council resolutions banning the communist state from conducting launches using ballistic missile technology, Noh said.The response could include measures at the U.N. level, he added, although South Korean officials said it's still too early to talk about specific action through the U.N. council. They said they need more time to review technical aspects of the secretive nation's self-proclaimed success in the SLBM launch.In Seoul, Kerry is also scheduled to pay a courtesy call on Park early Monday. It would be his first trip here in 15 months.His upcoming Asia swing will also take him to Beijing.

Starting with Incheon and Gimhae, the policy expanded to four other airports including those in Daegu and Cheongju last year, officials said.The visa waiver at Gimpo is expected to draw more visitors, especially group tourists from China who wish to travel to Seoul and near by cities, the authorities said. Since the visa waiver program went into effect, the number of visitors has surged, they added. From April to August in 2014, the number of Chinese travelers transferring from local cities to Jejudo Island surged by about 50 percent on average, public data showed. In the case of Yangyang International Airport in Gangwon Province, the number of visitors from the neighboring country recorded about 59,000 last year, jumping by 470 percent, officials said. As part the measures to provide more convenience for visitors, the ministry also said that it would accept online visa applications. In order to get a visa, foreign visitors currently have to visit Korean embassies in their countries. In the meantime, the authorities said they would also tighten checks to stop entry by criminals. The Justice Ministry will expand the passengers’ identity check process before boarding to prevent the entry of criminals, officials said.Foreigners who provide false information for the stay permit will be sentenced to a three-year jail term or fined up to 20 million won ($18,000) along with deportation. Calls for a stronger punishment have mounted, as the maximum fine for falsely filling out the stay permit form is just 500,000 won ($460).

It includes seven facilities where nearly 60,000 Koreans were forced to work during World War II. Japan colonized Korea from 1910-45.Its bid has deepened conflicts between the neighboring countries mired in a decades-long territorial and history row.In the upcoming talks, South Korea will formally ask Japan to drop its bid or clarify that the facilities are related to its wartime atrocity in UNESCO's world heritage document, according to diplomatic sources.To the disappointment of South Koreans, the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), a group of experts, has advised UNESCO to accept Tokyo's bid.South Korean officials said the council apparently took ""technical factors"" into account, rather than historical background linked with Japan's atrocity.They expect the World Heritage Committee to make a different decision as it would consider negative effects from Japan's drive. The committee is scheduled to open a weeklong session in Germany on June 28, which will be attended by government delegates.""As we said in a press briefing yesterday, the responsibility for politicizing UNESCO lies with Japan,"" a ministry official said Friday. ""Japan should retract its bid. UNESCO wants South Korea and Japan to reach a consensus over the problem through dialogue.

The annex, situated between the palace and the Seoul Metropolitan Council building, was built by Japan in 1937 in an alleged attempt to conceal the palace, experts said. The annex has been vacant since the tax agency relocated to the administrative city of Sejong late last year. A temporary plaza will be built on the site, where a symbolic sculpture will be erected, the city said.In addition to removing the building, Seoul City will hold dozens of various events under the theme of “My Independence” to raise public awareness of the historical day. Only 8.7 percent of the current Korean population witnessed the independence day of Aug. 15 in 1945. The city will launch a public fundraiser to build a sculpture for the anniversary of Aug. 15, which will be installed at Yongsan Family Park in March 2019 to mark the centenary of Independence Movement Day ― March 1, authorities said. It will also establish a sculpture that symbolizes peace in a bid to remember the Korean victims of sexual enslavement during the colonial period. The sculpture will be installed by the end of this year at either Gwanghwamun Square or Seoul Plaza, officials said.Seoul City will offer a tourist route which mainly focuses on the human rights issue by linking several historical sites, from Seodaemun Prison History Hall to Namsan, where the history of Japan’s colonialism still remains. The course will be available from December. Other civic events such as exhibitions, performances and forums will also feature the city’s project, they added.

Under the amendment, Seoul secured Washington’s consent to carry out electroreduction, the first stage of pyroprocessing, which Korean experts have touted as a possible solution to deal with its mountain of used fuel rods. The technology is less prone to proliferation risks, as it produces plutonium mixed with safer fissile materials. But James Acton, codirector of the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington-based think tank, stressed that South Korea could only maintain current power prices by continuing to buy its nuclear fuel in the global market, due to the massive research and implementation costs required for reprocessing. He said Seoul should instead craft a long-term management strategy. “Every country that has done some form of reprocessing has found it more expensive and it adds to the costs of energy. … Electricity is more expensive in Japan because of reprocessing,” he told The Korea Herald on the sidelines of the Asan Plenum hosted by the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul last week. Despite the joint 10-year fuel cycle study being conducted by the allies, pyroprocessing will take much longer to produce results, especially as they will also need to develop other key technologies, such as fast reactors and fuel fabrication methods, he added.  James Acton, codirector of the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, speaks during an interview with The Korea Herald on the sidelines of the Asan Plenum hosted by the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul last week. (Asan Institute for Policy Studies)“To make any difference in Korea on spent fuel with pyroprocessing is going to take 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 years. Maybe it will work out very well,” Acton said.“But my big message to Koreans is that pyroprocessing will not solve your spent fuel problems in the next few decades. And irrespective of what happens, you need a long-term spent fuel management strategy as soon as possible.” An advisory panel consisting of municipal leaders, scholars and environmental activists was launched in October 2013 here to look into various options including storage, disposal and reprocessing at home or overseas. It is mandated to make suggestions by the end of June but discussions have made little progress as the parties struggle to close the gaps in their views and some civic groups refuse to participate.One of the major features of the new so-called 123 agreement is a leeway for South Korea to enrich uranium up to 20 percent if necessary through bilateral consultations. The U.S., meanwhile, is to ensure a reliable supply of fuel for 24 reactors here.The clauses could be seen as a small diplomatic coup for Seoul as enrichment and reprocessing had emerged a central political issue in the negotiations. Some had raised speculation that Washington could push Seoul to renounce the techniques in the text, as it did with the United Arab Emirates and Taiwan.The South Korea-U.S. pact appears to be “fair and good” since it benefits both countries as major operators and exporters of reactors, the U.K.-born scholar said, adding that the so-called gold standard would weaken the United States’ industrial edge and global nonproliferation regime. “If this was 50 years ago or 40 years ago where the U.S. and Soviet Union had a monopoly on nuclear technology, the gold standard would have made sense,” Acton said. “Today’s very different because there are lots of suppliers of nuclear energy. … So I would rather like the U.S. to have a strong export market in nuclear power and to promote good nonproliferation rather than promoting perfect nonproliferation and having no industry or not selling nuclear reactors.” South Korea, for its part, is also “not missing out” because the deal differs from the one that the U.S. and other five world powers struck recently with Iran, which he said was “not attractive for a country that is serious about nuclear energy.” In the wake of the framework agreement, the Iranian threat will now be “significantly reduced” with additional scrutiny and limits on its nuclear program, while North Korea will remain a top proliferation concern, he noted. “The fundamental issue is that if we don’t strike a deal with Iran, it will still have an enrichment program which will be much bigger and have no constraints on it,” Acton said. “It’s very hard to apply that kind of model to North Korea; North Korea already has the bomb. … The long-term goal with North Korea has to remain the denuclearization. But I think that in the short term, we need to focus on reducing risks with North Korea because denuclearization is so difficult. It’s a more useful step for the short term.”By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","korea to enrich uranium up ,south korea to enrich uranium ,korea to enrich uranium ,selling nuclear reactors south korea ,small diplomatic coup for seoul","['U.S.', 'South Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'korean', 'James Acton', 'the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace', 'Washington', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'the Korea Herald', 'the Asan Plenum', 'the Asan Institute for Policy Studies', 'Seoul', 'James Acton', 'the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace', 'the Korea Herald', 'the Asan Plenum', 'the Asan Institute for Policy Studies', 'Seoul', 'Asan Institute', 'Korea', 'Acton', 'Koreans', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'the United Arab Emirates', 'Taiwan', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'the United States', 'U.S.', 'Soviet Union', 'Acton', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Iran', 'iranian', 'North Korea', 'Iran', 'Acton', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",15,"[ 0.          0.          5.         ... -0.70210737  0.08991587

American experts have recently estimated the North's current arsenal at some 10-16 bombs.""We certainly have been and remain concerned about North Korea's nuclear program. And we've been working with the five parties, as we've talked about, to pressure North Korea to return to credible and authentic denuclearization talks,"" State Department acting spokeswoman Marie Harf said in response to the report.By the ""five parties,"" she was referring to the five countries involved in the six-party nuclear talks with the North.Asked if the Chinese assessment raises alarm, Harf said, ""We've had alarms for a long time about North Korea's nuclear program. A very high level of alarm. That's why we have worked with our partners to see what we can do to get them back to the table.The six-party talks, which involve China, the two Koreas, Japan, Russia and the U.S., have been stalled since the last session in late 2008. During the deadlock, the North has kept bolstering its nuclear capabilities, conducting its second and third nuclear tests, in 2009 and 2013. Some experts now warn that the communist nation's nuclear arsenal could expand to 100 bombs by 2020.Earlier Thursday, Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Russel said the North won't be accepted as a nuclear state.""Our partners, along with the wider international community, have consistently made clear to the DPRK that it will not be accepted as a nuclear power,"" he said in a statement submitted for a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, saying the five-party unity ""has never been stronger.""Russel also said U.S. alliances with South Korea and Japan form the ""bedrock"" of the six-party process and hailed December's trilateral information-sharing agreement to better cope with the North's nuclear and missile threats.On economic issues, Russel said the envisioned Asia-Pacific free trade deal, known as Trans-Pacific Partnership, which the U.S. has been negotiating with 11 other countries, is the ""economic centerpiece of our rebalance"" to the region.""The most important thing we can do for our economic relationship with East Asia is to complete the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, which is also critical to the future of our economy as it becomes increasingly linked to the region,"" he said.

Curtis Scaparrotti appears to run counter to what U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter said during a visit to South Korea last week that the U.S. is not ready to begin discussions with Seoul about whether to deploy THAAD to the peninsula.   ""I think both countries are taking that into consideration right now, in terms of the other impacts that have to do with the deployment of THAAD on the Peninsula,"" the USFK commander said during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing in response to a question whether Seoul and Washington would push against Chinese opposition to THAAD.   Scaparrotti also said the ""decision process is under way right now,"" though he did not elaborate.   The USFK commander is the one who brought up the need for a THAAD battery in South Korea for the first time in June. The proposal has since become one of the most sensitive defense and political issues in Seoul as China and Russia have expressed strong opposition to such a deployment.   Supporters say the advanced missile defense unit is necessary to meet ever-growing missile and nuclear threats from North Korea, while opponents claim mid- and lower-altitude missile interceptors are enough as the North is unlikely to attack the South with such high-altitude missiles.   ""I think this is a decision for South Korea, having to do with the defense of their country and from my perspective as a commander there, defense of our troops,"" Scaparrotti said. ""The THAAD system, if employed, is focused on the defense of the peninsula. That's what it is specialized to do. It doesn't have any influence beyond that.""   During a House Armed Services Committee hearing on Wednesday, Scaparrotti expressed the need for a THAAD deployment to South Korea, saying it would provide a ""layered defense"" for American troops and bolster the capabilities of Patriot and other existing systems.   On Thursday, the U.S. Pacific commander, Adm. Samuel Locklear, also told the Senate hearing that the U.S. is in discussions about a potential THAAD deployment to the South, though did not elaborate on what those discussions are, including whether they are internal discussions in the U.S. military or whether they mean talks with South Korea.   ""Our ability in the region to partner with our Japanese allies and our South Korean allies to bring the BMD (ballistic missile defense) capabilities to bear has been productive. And in addition, we've been in discussions about the potential deployment of additional THAAD battery, beyond the one that's in Guam but on the Korean Peninsula,"" Locklear said.   Considering its sensitivity, South Korean officials have repeatedly said that there has been no U.S. request for a THAAD deployment, no formal consultations between the two countries and therefore no decision on the issue.

Seoul Metropolitan Government said it would increase the subway fare by 250 won ($0.20) to 1,300 won and bus fares by 150 won to 1,200 won. This is the first hike in 3 1/2 years.The new fares are expected to go into effect from late June after the city council reviews the proposal. As an alternative plan, the city has proposed a 200-won hike only for the subway.To lessen the fee burden and relieve the rush hour congestion, the city vowed to offer an early morning discount. Passengers taking the subway or buses before 6:30 a.m. will get a 20 percent discount, the city said. The new discount offer will be available in Seoul City and inter-city buses in Gyeonggi Province for now, to be later expanded to Incheon, the city added. Seoul City will also extend the facility of free rides ― currently available to Korean senior citizens ― to green card holders aged 65 or older. About 2,200 passengers are expected to benefit from the new service, it said. Fares for under 19s will not be raised, it added.The city has stressed the need to raise the public transportation fare, citing rising deficit and the number of seniors with free passes. According to the city government, the budget deficit of the Seoul subway system reached 420 billion won last year, up 14 percent from two years ago. Bus operators also saw a 25 percent deficit jump to 310 billion won. The free-ride policy for the elderly partially contributed to the subway deficit, officials said. The policy caused about 290 billion won of losses last year with some 250 million elderly trips, the city said. This accounted for 13.7 percent of the total subway users. The city also emphasized that nearly 2 trillion won is needed to improve the safety measures and transportation service by 2018.

William Gortney, commander of North American Aerospace Defense Command and U.S. Northern Command, is different from the U.S. government's official assessment.  ""We stand behind Adm. Gortney's statement,"" a Pentagon official told Yonhap News Agency by phone.  Gortney made the remark during a Pentagon briefing on Tuesday, saying he believes the North has ""the ability to put it on -- a nuclear weapon on a KN-08 and shoot it at the homeland.""  It was the latest in a series of similar assessments by U.S. military commanders.   Last month, Adm. Cecil Haney, commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, told a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing that he believes the North has ""already miniaturized"" some of its nuclear weapons.  In October, Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, said that as USFK commander he assumes the North has the capabilities to miniaturize nuclear warheads and that the country has ""the technology to potentially actually deliver what they say they have.""  The road-mobile KN-08, though untested, is believed to have a range of at least 5,500 km, which puts Alaska at risk. U.S. officials, including Adm. Samuel Locklear, commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, have expressed concern about the missile, saying the missile is harder to keep an eye on as it can be launched from mobile launchers.  North Korea has conducted three underground nuclear tests so far, in 2006, 2009 and 2013. The country has also conducted a series of long-range missile or rocket launches since 1998. In its latest launch in late 2012, the North succeeded in putting a satellite into orbit.  Experts have warned that it is only a matter of time until the North develops nuclear-tipped missiles.  The Northern Command, based at Peterson Air Force Base, Colo., is charged with coordinating homeland defense.

The plan is to expand the scope of punishment to the captain and actual operators of the ship instead of just the owner.If a ship is found to have failed to maintain its static stability by carrying more cargo or less ballast water than regulated, the ship’s owner, operator and the captain will be subject to punishment. They can face up to three years in prison or 30 million won ($27,490) in fine.“In Sewol’s case, the ship’s owner and the operator were the same. But the CEU pointed out that the punishment would be complicated if this wasn’t the case, and we accepted (the proposition),” said an official from the Oceans Ministry. He explained that while punishment of the ship’s operators and captains is possible, the process is complicated as it is not stipulated in the actual law.When the Sewol tilted over and sank on April 16, 2014 ― leaving over 300 dead or missing ―- it had been carrying too much cargo and not enough ballast water for it to remain stable, a December report by the Korean Maritime Safety Tribunal had shown. This caused the ship to topple when it rapidly changed course during its voyage toward Jejudo Island.The revision to the regulation on ships’ static stability is one of the CEU’s plans for improving safety, which is a follow-up on the government investigation on safety-related corruption cases that was initiated by the Sewol tragedy.These plans aim to close legal loopholes and step up punishment for employees who may endanger the safety of citizens, officials said. They include: toughening punishment on facility managers disabling fire-fighting systems; illegal renovation on freight trucks and lorries that allow them to exceed the maximum speed limit; and implementing punishment for employees at aqua-leisure facilities.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","government probe the corruption eradication ,last year fatal sinking ,illegal renovation on freight trucks ,punishment for employees at aqua ,fatal sinking of sewol ferry","['South Korea', 'the Corruption Eradication Unit', 'Prime Minister ’s Office', 'the Ministry of Oceans', 'CEU', 'CEU', 'the Oceans Ministry', 'Sewol', 'the Korean Maritime Safety Tribunal', 'CEU', 'Sewol', 'Yoon Min - sik']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.07096159  0.10177615

The government will aim to eliminate projects that have failed to generate results or are redundant, and programs that customarily got assistance in the past.  The finance ministry said it spends some 58 trillion won ($53.5 billion) annually to support the numerous projects, although about 25 trillion won goes to programs that are fixed by law, and cannot be easily changed.   In addition to subsidy cuts, the government will adopt a ""one-out, one-in"" system in which ministries and agencies can fund new projects only if one existing program is terminated, the ministry said, without disclosing how much money can be saved.  ""The goal of the new guidelines is to prioritize spending amid tax revenue shortfalls and greater demand for welfare and other key programs that can bolster economic competitiveness,"" said Song Eom-seok, head of the ministry's budget office.  Song said that welfare and projects that can help stabilize the livelihoods of ordinary people will get more funding, while more money will be allocated to the creation of a national eco-system that can fuel growth, generate new economic opportunities and help start-ups and business ventures.   The official added that the government will earmark more money for programs aimed at helping young people get practical training while they are at school, in an effort to raise their chances of finding work after graduation.  Spending on public safety will also be increased, along with programs to better cope with a rapidly aging society.  The finance ministry also said that funds will be allocated to reflect President Park Geun-hye's Dresden Declaration, which calls for laying the groundwork for a future reunification of the two Koreas. The initiative emphasizes more exchanges and cooperation between the two sides that are still technically in a state of war.  Projects like building rail lines along the southern side of the 240-kilometer-long demilitarized zone that separates the two Koreas can be pursued, even if bilateral relations remain cool. The lines could then be linked with North Korea's railway line in due course.  Last year, the government allocated 200.3 billion won to expand cooperation with Pyongyang, with 360 billion won being set aside this year.   Other ways to maximize the effect of budget spending is to get firms to engage in public-private partnerships that will permit them to play a greater role in infrastructure building, according to the finance ministry.  The latest guidelines will be sent to government ministries and agencies by Friday, with each responsible for submitting their 2016 budget spending plans by June 5. The government will then examine all plans and submit its 2016 budget proposal to the National Assembly on Sept. 11.

The Korean government immediately lodged a protest, calling the decision a “provocation” against its sovereignty over its indigenous territory. Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yong summoned Ambassador Koro Bessho and delivered a written complaint. “The Japanese government has once again staged a provocation by approving middle school textbooks that distort, downplay and omit obvious historical facts,” ministry spokesperson Noh Kwang-il said at the news conference.  Members of a nongovernmental organization working to promote Korea`s sovereignty over the Dokdo Islets stage a rally outside the Japanese embassy in Seoul on Monday. (Yonhap)“The Japanese government’s ceaseless injection of misleading historical views and territorial views into the country’s young generations is no different from seeking to repeat past wrongdoings, while displaying a lack of resolve to take a responsible role as a trusted neighbor.” The Education Ministry struck a more stringent tone, issuing a statement to “strongly condemn” the announcement and call for an immediate correction. It took issue with the absence of descriptions of Japan’s sexual enslavement of women from Korea and elsewhere, which it said amounted to falsifying history and evading historical judgment. Previous middle school textbooks have failed to touch on the issue of the so-called comfort women at all, officials say. But one of the newly authorized publication introduced the landmark accounts by a Korean sex slavery victim in 1991 and Tokyo’s ensuing probe into the matter and official apology in 1993. “We strongly urge the Japanese Education Ministry to take the lead in keenly repenting for the erroneous past and correct misdeeds through the accurate understanding of the country’s history of aggression so that its distorted historical accounts will not break peace in Northeast Asia as the two countries mark the 50th anniversary of the normalization of their relationship,” the ministry said in a statement. The update follows an amendment of authorization standards in January 2014. In addition, a subsequent revision of teaching guidelines for middle and high school students recommended that history, social studies and geography books state that Dokdo is Japan’s “indigenous territory” and “illegally occupied by Korea.” Of the 18 textbooks newly certified by Japan’s Education Ministry, 15 describe Dokdo as indigenous territory and 13 describe it as illegally occupied. This is an increase from nine and four, respectively, in its last deliberation, which is held every four years. All four geography texts and all but one of the six social studies workbooks carry both statements. All eight history books say that Dokdo was incorporated into Japan’s Shimane prefecture in 1905. Three of them were more elaborate, depicting Japanese fishermen’s activities in the waters surrounding the islets up until the late 1900s. The move is likely to dampen Korea’s efforts to reconcile with Japan ahead of the anniversary by promoting trilateral partnerships involving the U.S. or China and resuming bilateral security cooperation. On Tuesday, Japan’s Foreign Ministry is scheduled to release an annual diplomatic paper reiterating the sovereignty assertion, which would prompt officials to file another complaint and escalate tension. Seoul associated Tokyo’s persistent territorial claim with its imperial past that resulted in its illicit takeover of the islets a century ago.At the height of the Russian-Japanese war in 1905, Japan annexed outcrops to install communication and surveillance devices and collected intelligence on Russian naval movements in the East Sea. Japan returned Dokdo to Korea after winning the war, but then pushed to occupy the entire peninsula.“We’ve been closely monitoring the results of the latest deliberation, expecting that, given last year’s policy changes, the textbooks would include exacerbated content, especially with regard to Dokdo,” a senior ministry official told reporters on condition of anonymity. “While Dokdo-related content is relatively easy to assess, history entails cautious analysis before we demand revisions from Japan, as opinions among scholars here may diverge.”By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","of updated middle school textbooks ,korean government immediately lodged protest ,textbooks newly certified by japan ,year policy changes the textbooks ,in seoul on monday yonhap","['Japan', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Cho Tae - yong', 'Koro Bessho', 'japanese', 'Noh Kwang - il', 'japanese', 'Seoul', 'japanese', 'the Education Ministry', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Tokyo', 'the Japanese Education Ministry', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Japan ’s Education Ministry', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'Korea ’s', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Japan ’s Foreign Ministry', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'russian - japanese', 'Japan', 'russian', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.25349063  0.68783456

Starting Wednesday, the government will begin receiving requests for compensation from bereaved families of those killed in the sinking of the passenger ship Sewol and 157 survivors, according to the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries.The beginning of the process, however, comes nearly one year after the Sewol sank on April 16 while en route to the southern resort island of Jeju.The accident left 304 people killed, mostly high school students on a school excursion, marking one of the worst and most tragic accidents in the country's history. The belated start of the compensation process was partly attributed to a prolonged search for missing passengers that ended Nov. 11 with nine still not found. They are included in the number of people killed.Last week, family members of the victims called on the government to decide on the recovery of the submerged ship before the first anniversary of the sinking.The government has yet to announce whether it will actually push ahead with its plan to salvage the sunken ship. A ministry official earlier said a study on how and when the ferry should be lifted from the ocean was still underway.The government compensation for each student is expected to reach about 420 million won ($378,000) and 760 million won for each of their teachers, who apparently stayed behind to tend to their pupils.Compensation for others, including children and crew members, will vary, depending on their age, job and expected income, the ministry said.The families of the victims are also expected to receive over 200 million won each from public donations that have amounted to over 128.8 billion won as of March 17, according to the ministry.The families of each student from Danwon High School will also receive an additional 100 million won in insurance payments.Those who survived the tragic accident will also be offered government compensation for their injuries and loss of income.However, 15 crew members of the ship who have been convicted of abandoning the ship without aiding their passengers will be completely excluded from any compensation.The 15 convicted crew members have been handed down prison terms ranging from five to 30 years while the ship's 68-year-old captain Lee Joon-seok has been sentenced to 36 years in prison.

(Yonhap)A series of advanced aerial assets that the military has deployed over the last decade have offered greater operational flexibility, which has made it unnecessary for the Air Force to maintain the geographically-divided command mechanism. “Considering the enhanced mobility of the advanced combat aircraft, there is no need to maintain regional Air Force commands as we have done in the past,” an Air Force official said, declining to be named.The decision for the change was made at a session of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Council last Friday, which was presided over by JCS Chairman Adm. Choi Yun-hee. The Air Combat Command will be stationed in Daegu, while the Air Mobility & Reconnaissance Command will be based in Osan. Each of the new commands is to be headed by a two-star commander. The Air Force will test-run the new structure from July and fully introduce it from January next year.“As it is a reorganization of the command structure to enhance operational efficiency, there is no need to increase troops or budgets for the new commands,” said the official.The need for an overhaul of the command structure has been raised for quite some time with officials and experts arguing that in a small operational zone on the Korean Peninsula, dividing the commanding structure according to region is not suitable for optimal aerial operations.In an emergency, both F-15K fighters, based in Daegu, and KF-16s, based in Seosan, are to be mobilized for the same mission, which means the function-based command structure would be better to cope with aerial threats rather than having specific commands take charge of certain regions.The change in the command structure has been caused mainly by Seoul’s recent and future procurement of a series of advanced Air Force assets including airborne command and control aircraft, all of which have increased operational mobility and flexibility, and decreased the need to divide operational areas according to region.The South Korean military plans to introduce refueling tankers, high-altitude and low-altitude unmanned reconnaissance aircraft and stealth fighter jets, which will increase the need for a function-based command structure.“When we first created the regional commands, there were only fighter jets and little need to focus on the functions of aerial assets. But now, we need to reorganize the command structure into a function-oriented one,” an Air Force official told The Korea Herald, declining to be named.The reorganization plan is also designed to streamline the overall command structure and remove any overlapping functions among regional commands.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","military plans to introduce refueling ,said tuesday under the reorganization ,korean military plans to introduce ,reorganization plan the air force ,better incorporate new weapons systems","['south korean', 'the Air Force ’s', 'the Air Force', 'the Air Force ’s Southern', 'Northern Combat Commands', 'the Air Combat Command', 'the Air Mobility & Reconnaissance Command', 'Black Eagles', 'the Air Force', 'the Air Force', 'Air Force', 'Air Force', 'the Joint Chiefs of Staff Council', 'JCS', 'Choi Yun - hee', 'the Air Combat Command', 'Daegu', 'the Air Mobility & Reconnaissance Command', 'Osan', 'the Air Force', 'Daegu', 'KF-16s', 'Seosan', 'Seoul', 'Air Force', 'south korean', 'Air Force', 'the Korea Herald', 'Song Sang - ho']",2,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.59820759  0.46731231

Observers expect his visit to set the stage for the allies’ official consultations over the THAAD issue. U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter. (AFP)Cater is to hold talks with South Korea’s Defense Minister Han Min-koo on the second day of his visit over such pending issues as North Korea’s persistent nuclear and missile threats, and the allies’ efforts to implement the “conditions-based” transition of wartime operational control.Seoul’s Defense Ministry dismissed the speculation that Carter and Han would touch on the THAAD issue as part of their talks’ official agenda.“Secretary Carter will visit Seoul to meet with South Korean officials for the first time since his inauguration (last month),” ministry spokesperson Kim Min-seok told reporters.“As the U.S. has yet to determine whether to deploy a THAAD battery to the U.S. Forces Korea here, that issue is not on the agenda for the talks (between Han and Carter).”Carter is seen to be in favor of strengthening missile defense against North Korea. During his confirmation hearing last Month, he vowed to use a “full range of capabilities” against missiles and weapons of mass destruction from the communist state, stressing that they pose a direct threat to the U.S. The THAAD issue has been one of the hottest diplomatic issues as China has explicitly expressed its opposition to THAAD. Beijing argues that THAAD could undermine its security interests, although the U.S. defends it as a defensive system to intercept North Korea’s ballistic missiles.Seoul has so far taken a cautious stance, arguing that there has been no request from the U.S., no official consultations over the issue and no decision reached yet.Touching on the public concerns over Seoul being put in a tricky diplomatic position over the potential deployment of THAAD, President Park Geun-hye said in a meeting with her aides that Seoul would make its decision “prudently based on a comprehensive analysis of various pieces of information.”Should the allies’ defense chiefs not discuss the THAAD issue at their meeting early next month, the allies could also discuss it at their Integrated Defense Dialogue in Washington slated for mid-April, observers say.The THAAD is a core element of the U.S.’ multilayered missile defense program. It is designed to intercept short-, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles at altitudes of 40 to 150 km during the final phase of their flight, after detecting them with a radar system with a maximum range of about 1,800 km.The U.S. plans to complete its deployment of seven THAAD batteries in the U.S. mainland, Guam and foreign locations that may include South Korea, Japan and the UAE. One THAAD battery consists of six truck-mounted launchers, 48 interceptors, an air-transportable radar system and a fire and communications element.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","secretary carter will visit seoul ,korea during his confirmation hearing ,seoul to meet with south ,seoul defense ministry said tuesday ,will visit seoul to meet","['U.S.', 'Ashton Carter', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Seoul ’s Defense Ministry', 'U.S.', 'Terminal High - Altitude Area Defense', 'Korea', 'thaad', 'U.S.', 'Defense Ashton Carter', 'South Korea ’s', 'Defense', 'Han Min - koo', 'North Korea ’s', 'Seoul ’s Defense Ministry', 'Carter', 'Han', 'thaad', 'Carter', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'Kim Min - seok', 'U.S.', 'the U.S. Forces Korea', 'Han', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Beijing', 'U.S.', 'North Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'Seoul', 'thaad', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Guam', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'UAE', 'Song Sang - ho']",9,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -0.19089249  0.85687768

The AIIB stakes for regional and non-regional members, as well as minimum shares allocated to smaller countries, will also be factors that affect South Korea's eventual holding, it said.Excluding China, South Korea ranks No. 2 in terms of GDP size among the Asian members, although this may fall one notch if Australia opts to join.""By joining the AIIB before the March 31 deadline, Seoul is now in a position to put forward its views on various issues and take advantage of the premium offered to all founding members,"" Choi Hee-nam, deputy minister of international affairs at the ministry, said.Guidelines and charters for the bank's operation and the related anex are due to be determined before the end of June.Talks are expected to focus on the voting rights of each country that will have influence in the bank. Emphasis will likely be placed on who gets to sit on the board and the prospective locations of some of the AIIB's regional offices. The headquarters of the bank will be located in Beijing.The ministry said that while some concerns still linger about the governance structure and transparency of the AIIB, progress has been made.Last year, there were speculations that China would have the final say on all decisions made by the investment bank, but through negotiations, this authority has been transferred to the board of directors, which will not be so easily swayed by a single country, the ministry said.The fact that China may not foot 50 percent of the authorized capital could further weaken that country's influence, it said. The AIIB expects some 35 countries to become founding members.Other officials said China has pledged to address the so-called safeguard issue such as environmental protection, labor and women's rights when the final agreement is forged.On past talks with the United States, which had expressed serious reservations about its allies joining the AIIB, a ministry official said there have been talks on all fronts and at all levels from the finance minister down to working-level general directors.""Washington has said that the final decision rests with Seoul, and they have even acknowledged that there are investment-related demands that South Korean companies have the capability to meet,"" the official said.He explained that North Korea could receive future funding from the AIIB if a motion is passed by a general meeting of its shareholders. The country, however, cannot join the infrastructure bank because it is not a member of the ADB or World Bank, which is one of the prerequisites for membership.

Martin Dempsey said Tuesday that building an integrated air and missile defense system will be a key topic of discussions when he meets with South Korean officials.Heading off on a trip to Japan and South Korea, the general also said that the U.S. is making progress on building an integrated air and missile defense umbrella, and Seoul and Tokyo have ""made some commitments in procurements on their side to make us more interoperable.""Dempsey did not elaborate. But his trip has drawn keen attention due to the possibility of him raising the need for a THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) missile defense battery in South Korea to better defend against North Korean ballistic missile threats.""We're making progress on building an integrated air and missile defense umbrella, (and) both the Koreans and the Japanese have made some commitments in procurements on their side to make us more interoperable,"" he said in an interview aboard his aircraft, according to the Defense Department's DoD News.South Korea has been badly divided over whether to allow such a deployment, with supporters saying the deployment would help better protect against North Korea's ballistic missile threats, and opponents claiming it would inflame tensions with China and Russia. Dempsey is scheduled to hold talks with his South Korean counterpart in Seoul on Friday.Earlier this week, David R. Stilwell, strategic plans and policy deputy director for Asia at the JCS, reportedly said that the THAAD issue will be discussed when Dempsey visits Seoul. But South Korea's defense ministry rejected the report, saying the issue is off the official agenda.Other topics of discussions in Seoul would include the delayed transfer of wartime operational control over South Korean forces from Washington to Seoul, training exercises and response options to North Korean provocations, Dempsey said.""I'll get a chance to visit with both military leaders and political leaders to reassure them of our commitments and to seek their insights into the region,"" Dempsey said of his trip to Japan and Korea.Feedback from the allies is ""important for us to get their insights into the way they see the region evolving, so then we can collaboratively continue to adapt our relationship,"" he said.Dempsey also said that the North's provocative actions in response to annual military exercises between South Korea and the United States only reinforce the need for such drills. Such exercises are very important to ensure there is a ""credible deterrent against provocation"" by the North, he said.""They react in a provocative fashion, which of course has become somewhat predictable and reinforces the need for us to have these meetings and exercises with the frequency that we do,"" Dempsey said in an interview aboard his aircraft.The exercises ensure that the U.S. and the South are prepared with their military capabilities should the communist nation ""do more than just provoke,"" Dempsey said. The maneuvers are a ""critical part of our relationship and we do them with a very steady drumbeat, the same time every year,"" he said.North Korea has long condemned such annual drills as a rehearsal for invasion of the country. In an apparent expression of its anger at the latest exercises, known as Key Resolve and Foal Eagle, the North fired short-range missiles and surface-to-air missiles into the East Sea on two occasions earlier this month.South Korea and the U.S. have repeatedly said the drills are purely defensive.Dempsey said the exercises are held to ""rekindle"" tactics, techniques and procedures, to ensure the United States can operate collaboratively with its own joint force and with its South Korean allies.

A task force aiming to prevent accidents will also be created. They will also urge owners of unregistered sites to close down or change their type of business and specify current safety regulations, which have been accused of having loopholes and unclear wording. The strengthened rules will standardize fire equipment requirements and tent textiles, as well as the uses of combustible materials and electricity. Officials are also considering imposing safety ratings on camping sites.Critics, however, pointed out that the proposals already overlap with a series of safety laws passed in January by amending the Tourism Promotion Act to obligate camping ground owners to register their sites with local governments, while central government officials must ensure safety regulations. Violators are subject to up to two years in prison and 20 million won ($18,000) in fines. The rules are set to take effect in February next year. The revisions were the result of a bipartisan effort to strengthen camping safety across Korea, until last week’s tragedy exposed the loopholes and belatedness of the safety laws.Two families sleeping in a tent at a camping site in Incheon, a port city just west of Seoul, were engulfed by a fire that overtook their tent in seconds last Sunday. Two adults and three children were killed. A man nearby rescued a fourth child. The cause remains under investigation.Law enforcement officials are looking into whether the camping site owner violated construction laws by not installing fire equipment. Police are also checking whether local officials condoned the safety violations and if they received kickbacks in the process.Camping-related industries in South Korea have been on the rise in the last decade. Sales in outdoor equipment such as tents, sleeping bags and bivouac tools reached the 600 billion won mark last year.But public awareness about safety regulations appears to have been low.Saenuri Rep. Han Sun-kyo on Tuesday asserted that only 97 of the nation’s 1,800 camping sites had received regular fire inspections. The Saenuri Party’s policy committee chair Rep. Won Yoo-chul echoed such concerns.“Many camping grounds are often hastily installed tents on privately-owned land,” he said. “They are likely to be exposed to the dangers posed by natural disasters such as floods and avalanches.”By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","country after fire last week ,korean officials vowed tuesday ,conducting nationwide investigation of camping ,korean officials vowed tuesday to ,grounds left five people dead","['korean', 'Saenuri Party', 'Korea', 'Incheon', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'Saenuri', 'Han Sun - kyo', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'Won Yoo', 'Jeong Hunny']",12,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29657096  0.86865795

The Chunmoo multiple launch rocket system is displayed at a defense exhibition at KINTEX in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province, last May. (Yonhap)“When the new MLRS is delivered for operational deployment, it will greatly enhance our counterfire readiness posture, given that the new MLRS has a longer range and its performance will be better than the existing ones,” said the source.The Chunmoo is expected to be deployed to South Korea’s northwestern border islands sometime next year, to cope with North Korea’s persistent artillery threats. On the islands, South Korea has the K-9 self-propelled howitzers, but they only have a range of around 40 km.The North currently has 170 mm-caliber self-propelled howitzers and 240 mm-caliber multiple rocket launchers that have ranges of between 54 km and 65 km. The North has been developing a new 300 mm-caliber multiple launch rocket system that is thought to have a range of some 200 km.The development of the Chunmoo came amid rising concerns over the North’s long-range artillery along the border. Pyongyang has recently shown off its rocket capabilities, while Seoul has largely focused on how to defend against the North’s ballistic missile threats. The Chunmoo was developed to replace the Guryong, which has been deployed since the 1980s. It can fire both 130 mm-caliber rockets and 230 mm-caliber rockets.

Kim is likely to visit Russia in May in what would be his international debut and an apparent message of affront against China.   Li ""is on a mission to warm up relations between the neighbors against a backdrop of the DPRK's recent outreach to Russia,"" the state-run China Daily said, using an acronym for North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  Bilateral relations between North Korea and China, which jointly fought against South Korea, the United States and 20 other allies countries during the 1950-53 Korean War, were once touted as close as ""lips and teeth.""   But, the current Chinese Communist Party leadership led by President Xi Jinping has been increasingly frustrated by North Korea's unruly behavior, including the North's third nuclear test in early 2013.    Yang Xiyu, a researcher for the China Institute of International Studies, told the newspaper that the new ambassador ""will be tasked with the improvement of relations by strengthening economic ties and stepping up efforts to stop the country from pursuing nuclear weapons.""   Zhang Liangui, a professor of Korean studies at the Party School of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said bilateral ties between North Korea and China will not be affected by temporary events.   ""China's relations with the DPRK may undergo ups and downs, but it is not affected by any single event,"" Zhang told the newspaper.   Li, 59, is the second Chinese ambassador to North Korea picked from the Chinese Communist Party's International Department. His predecessor, Liu Hongcai, returned to a vice ministerial post in the department after completing his five-year stint in Pyongyang.   According to the newspaper, Li is ""one of China's few minister-level ambassadors -- one level senior to most other ambassadors -- signaling the geopolitical importance of the DPRK.""   China has appointed such senior-level ambassadors to the United States, Japan and Britain, the newspaper said.   Li studied German at Shanghai International Studies University in the early 1970s and served as ambassador to Myanmar from 2001 to 2005 and ambassador to the Philippines from 2005 to 2007.   China sent its first ambassador to Pyongyang in 1950.

The Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank was set up last October with 21 member states, aimed at spurring the region’s development by financing projects in energy, transportation, telecommunication, agriculture and other key sectors. The $50 billion institution may provide Seoul with a chance to share its know-how for rapid economic ascent, businesses with fresh markets and other economic incentives. Yet the government had been reluctant to announce its participation due largely to the bank’s relatively opaque governance structure and the opposition of Washington, which regards it as a potential rival to the World Bank and other mechanisms where it has a significant say.But a recent series of upgrades in the governance structure and operational principles, coupled with the joining of major European economies, appears to have propelled Seoul to lean toward participation. “We will have to go in that direction,” a Foreign Ministry official said, requesting anonymity citing ongoing discussions. “It’s true that there have been improvements ― now the bank will have a decision-making council and a secretariat to oversee its operation, among others. China has agreed to cut its stake and even said it is willing to yield the secretary-general post to other countries.” At a news conference late Tuesday, Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said intra-agency consultations are underway and that a final decision on Seoul’s involvement will be made by the end-March deadline based on economic benefits and other national interests. South Korea is expected to have conveyed its position to Washington during talks on Tuesday in Seoul between Deputy Foreign Minister Lee Kyung-soo and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Russel. “As the number of participating countries grows, they will help tackle problems that the international community has raised regarding the AIIB’s standards as a multilateral development bank,” another senior ministry official said at a meeting with reporters on Tuesday. Cheong Wa Dae said that nothing has been decided as the government is still looking into China’s offer. “We have never had formal discussions regarding our participation in the AIIB such as through meetings,” senior presidential economic secretary Ahn Jong-beom told reporters on Wednesday. After a surprise announcement by the U.K. last week, Germany, France and Italy unveiled their decision to join the initiative, dealing a fresh blow to the U.S. In a joint statement, the three countries said they are “keen to work with the AIIB founding members to establish an institution that follows the best standards and practices in terms of governance, safeguards, (and) debt and procurement policies.” Washington has lobbied its allies to reject Beijing’s proposal, fretting that the bank may undercut the global financial pecking order some 70 years after the Bretton Woods conference laid the groundwork for institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. While agreeing to the surging needs for infrastructure investment in the region, the U.S. yet again stressed the significance of “high standards” in launching any new multilateral bank, though it was up to a sovereign country to decide whether to sign up. “We believe any new multilateral institution should incorporate the high standards that the international community has collectively built at the World Bank and the Regional Development Bank,” State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki told a news briefing in Washington on Tuesday. “But it will be important for prospective members of the AIIB to push for the adoption of those same high standards, including strong board oversight and safeguards.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","talks on tuesday in seoul ,tuesday in seoul between deputy ,on tuesday in seoul ,reporters on wednesday after surprise ,on tuesday in seoul between","['South Korea', 'China', 'U.S.', 'european', 'the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'the World Bank', 'european', 'Seoul', 'Foreign Ministry', 'China', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'Lee Kyung - soo', 'U.S.', 'State', 'East Asian', 'Daniel Russel', 'Dae', 'China', 'AIIB', 'Ahn Jong - beom', 'U.K.', 'Germany', 'France', 'Italy', 'U.S.', 'AIIB', 'Washington', 'Beijing ’s', 'Bretton Woods', 'the World Bank', 'the International Monetary Fund', 'U.S.', 'the World Bank', 'the Regional Development Bank', 'State Department', 'Jen Psaki', 'Washington', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55354035  0.52152777

Britain announced its plan last week to join the bank, becoming the first Western country to do so. France and Germany followed suit.  ""It's a decision of any sovereign country, including South Korea, to make on AIIB,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said at a regular press briefing.  Psaki said that the United States believes there is a pressing need to enhance infrastructure investment around the world, but any new multilateral institution should incorporate the high standards that the international community has collectively built at the World Bank and the regional development bank.  ""As was true with the United Kingdom, the decision of any country to join is certainly a decision made by a sovereign country. But it will be important for prospective members of the AIIB to push for the adoption of those same high standards,"" she said.  South Korea has also been in a quandary over whether to allow the United States to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile defense system to the country.  The possibility of a THAAD deployment has left South Korea badly divided, with supporters saying the deployment would help better protect against North Korea's ballistic missile threats, and opponents claiming it would inflame tensions with China and Russia.   South Korean and U.S. officials have said there have been no official consultations on the issue.  ""We have not formally consulted with South Korea ... and no decisions have been made on a potential deployment to the Korean Peninsula,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said at a regular briefing.  China has expressed strong opposition to a THAAD deployment to South Korea.  Earlier this week, Chinese Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Jianchao said in Seoul that the South should take China's ""concerns and worries"" into consideration when making a decision on a THAAD deployment.   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Russel took a swipe at Liu's remarks, saying he finds it ""curious that a third country would presume to make strong representations about a security system that has not been put in place and that is still a matter of theory.""  When asked why China is opposed to a THAAD deployment, State Department spokeswoman Psaki said, ""Why are the Chinese opposed?

""The Seoul government has not sent a formal request to halt the launch.""  ""Even if the government makes the request, the group will press ahead with it,"" he stressed.   About 500,000 leaflets, as well as DVDs of the movie ""The Interview,"" which depicts a plot to assassinate leader Kim Jong-un, will be sent to the North, he noted.  Park's group regularly launches big balloons carrying such anti-Pyongyang leaflets in a campaign to spread dissenting messages in the reclusive country.  The upcoming campaign is feared to further escalate inter-Korean tension that is already brewing as the North has strongly protested Seoul's joint military exercises with the United States this month.  Referring to the leaflet plan, North Korea's main propaganda website Uriminzokkiri renewed its military threat Monday.  ""The act of leaflet scattering, which will be carried out amidst the rehearsal of war on North Korea, is an explicit declaration of war,"" the website said. ""(We) do not hide the fact that we will counteract this time with cannons or missiles.""  In spite of the growing inter-Korean tension over the leaflet campaign, the South Korean government largely remains disinclined to interject itself in the matter, repeating its hands-off position.  ""Basically, leaflet scattering by private groups falls on the basic right to free expression. It is something that (the government) cannot regulate by force,"" Lim Byeong-cheol, unification ministry spokesman, said in a briefing.   But in the event of the campaign posing clear threats to the safety of border-area citizens, the government will take necessary action, including a meeting with related activists to call for discretion, Lim noted.  Inter-Korean tension may further worsen over the leaflet issue down the road as more activist groups are expected to launch similar campaigns with the start of the spring season.   Park said he is also planning another campaign in early April jointly with foreign groups, including the U.S.-based Human Rights Foundation.

He claimed to be a conscious objector and said that his life would be in danger if he returned to Sudan. “The decision to bar an applicant from the refugee screening process should be made only when there is no doubt that a person is abusing the system. When a case calls for a more elaborate decision (on granting refugee status), the applicant should be allowed to follow to the proper legal procedures,” the high court said in its ruling. The man was able to enter the country in April 2014, when Incheon District Court ruled it was illegal for officials to confine him at the airport.Last month, he applied for a formal screening process to be considered a refugee.Although the Refugee Act of Korea was enacted in July 2013, the country’s threshold for accepting refugees has been notoriously steep. According to the Center for Refugee Rights in South Korea, there were 2,896 refugee claims in 2014 but only 94 ― or 3.2 percent ― were approved. The approval rate was 3.6 percent and 5 percent in 2013 and 2012, respectively.“The case underscores a flip side of what is considered one of the top airports in the world. The (refugee screening) system needs to be changed, in a way that is in keeping with the objective behind the enactment of the Refugee Act,” Lee said.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","airport last month he applied ,refugee rights in south korea ,officially struck down immigration authorities ,896 refugee claims in 2014 ,recently confirmed insiders said sunday","['sudanese', 'Korea', 'Lee Il', 'Advocates for Public Interest Law', 'African', 'the Seoul High Court', 'sudanese', 'Incheon Airport Immigration Office', 'Korea', 'Sudan', 'Incheon District Court', 'Korea', 'the Center for Refugee Rights', 'South Korea', 'Lee', 'Yoon Min - sik']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50192195  0.8390131

The months-long travel restriction, which banned foreign tourists from visiting North Korea and imposed a strict 21-day quarantine on all people, including diplomats, entering the country, was lifted earlier this week.

She plans to visit Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, respectively, on her first overseas trip of the year.“The trips are meant to expand the Park Geun-hye government’s diplomatic landscape out to the Middle East region and to strengthen ties with Gulf nations this year, which marks the 50th anniversary of (South Korean builders’) entry to foreign markets,” said Ju Chul-ki, senior presidential secretary for foreign affairs. This May 20, 2014, photo shows President Park Geun-hye and Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan (seventh from left), deputy prime minister of United Arab Emirates, attending an installation ceremony of a Korean-made nuclear reactor in Barakah in the Gulf nation. (Cheong Wa Dae)The South Korean government will also seek to diversify business portfolios with Gulf nations to prepare for the post-oil era, shifting their focus from heavy industries of energy and plants to high-value-added industries such as education, medical services and infrastructure improvement.“We will link their policies aimed at diversifying industry (portfolios) with our three-year economic plans,” Ju said.Park plans to introduce her vision of creative economy aimed at nurturing creative ideas from across society, and assimilating them with ICT, science and technology, and other industries.Park’s Middle East trip was previously scheduled for last year, but was put on hold after she came under fierce public scrutiny over the government’s bungled response to the sinking of a ferry that killed 300 in April. Park visited the UAE on a two-day trip instead, on the request of the Middle Eastern country. She attended a ceremony to mark the installation of the first nuclear reactor developed and exported by Korean firms to the country. “It is a must for South Korean presidents to visit (traditional partners) in the Middle East to maintain strategic and economic ties on a regular basis rather than exploring ways to break into new markets in the region,” said In Nam-sik, an associate professor of European and African studies at the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security, referring to the South Korean economy’s heavy economic dependence on the oil-rich nations.The four nations are South Korea’s major destinations for construction and plant exports as well as major providers of fossil fuel energy. Trade volume between South Korea and the four countries accounts for 74 percent of total trade in the Middle East region, according to the presidential office.Earlier this week, Park urged officials to expand economic cooperation with the region, stressing that massive construction and infrastructure projects in oil-rich nations could become a new growth engine for South Korea’s economy.The president said she expected Korean builders to seize opportunities to initiate “the second Middle East boom.” In the 1970s, South Korea sent tens of thousands of engineers and workers to the Middle East during a construction boom in the region.This year marks the 50th year since South Korean builders entered foreign markets, and the 40th year since they set foot in the Middle East.Her tour of the four nations comes at a critical time, with Korean builders suffering from declining orders from the Middle East. With international crude prices falling, oil-rich Gulf nations are expected to cut the number of construction orders this year as profits from oil exports deteriorate. According to a study by Hyundai Research Institute, Korean builders are forecast to lose $6.8 billion worth of construction orders from foreign countries a year if the price of Dubai crude oil drops 10 percent. The study, quoting a recent forecast by Cambridge Energy Research Associate, said the price of Dubai crude could slide to $64 per barrel this year, a sharp drop from an average price of $100 recorded last year. This implies that Korean builders could lose $24.8 billion or one-third of the total amount of orders they won last year, HRI said. Construction orders from the Middle East totaled 47.5 percent last year.On the first leg of her four-nation trip, Park will visit Kuwait for three days and hold a summit with the emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah. The leaders are set to discuss ways to increase bilateral cooperation in energy, construction, railroad, medical and information technology. Park is the first South Korean president to visit the Western-allied Gulf nation in eight years. During her stay, the two sides are also set to announce plans to ease entry of South Koreans to Kuwait, Ju told reporters. Park will also seek Kuwait’s support for peace on the Korean Peninsula and discuss security issues in the Middle East region, he added. Park will then fly to Saudi Arabia on March 4 for a two-day visit to meet newly crowned King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. The two previously met for a summit in Seoul in November. The leaders are to seek expansion of bilateral cooperation in energy, construction, health and communication technology as well as security issues. “Saudi Arabia is one of our core allies that has no diplomatic ties established with North Korea,” said Ju. “We will reconfirm Saudi’s consistent support for South Korea and our policies toward North Korea.” Park also plans to meet Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, chairman of Kingdom Holding Company of Saudi Arabia, popularly known as the Warren Buffet of the Middle East. At her third destination, the UAE, Park plans to meet with Mohammed bin Zayed bin Al Nahyan, prince crown of Abu Dhabi, before heading to Qatar on March 6. It will be their third summit since Park entered office in early 2013. “The UAE has been our strategic partner and we will seek to diversify cooperation in (the) medical, food (and) culture (industries),” the senior presidential secretary said.

Human Rights Council that will run from March 2-5, according to the foreign ministry.  ""Along with the North's rights situation, Cho plans to raise the issue of the Japanese imperial army's sexual enslavement of Korean women in terms of women's universal human rights in his speech,"" said an official at the foreign ministry, asking not to be named.  This year's U.N. meeting is expected to draw further attention from the international community as North Korea's top diplomat Ri Su-yong is also expected to deliver a speech on Tuesday to voice opposition against the global move to slam the North's rights conditions, according to a diplomatic source.  Ri is widely expected to give his address ahead of Cho, given that a foreign minister is entitled to precede lower-ranking officials, including a vice foreign minister, when delivering a speech at a U.N. meeting, according to the source. It will mark the first time that a top North Korean diplomat will address the U.N. rights council.  Pyongyang has long been labeled one of the worst human rights violators in the world. The communist regime does not tolerate dissent, holds hundreds of thousands of people in political prison camps, and keeps tight control over outside information.  In December, the United Nations General Assembly formally adopted a landmark resolution that pushes to refer the North to the International Criminal Court for human rights violations.  The U.N. Commission of Inquiry unveiled its report in February 2014 that accused Pyongyang of ""systematic, widespread and grave violations of human rights.""  During his three-day visit to Geneva that starts on Monday, Cho will also deliver a speech at the Conference on Disarmament on Wednesday, calling for global attention to resolve North Korea's nuclear weapons program, the foreign ministry said.  North Korea's top diplomat Ri is also expected to speak at the conference earlier on Tuesday, which is also the first of its kind, according to the source.  Established in 1979, the Conference on Disarmament is a multilateral forum to negotiate arms control and disarmament.

Pickled foods, unlike kimchi and other fermented foods, are often boiled and thus sterile.  South Korea, which has no such restrictions, imports more than $100 million worth of kimchi from China every year.  Beijing's move follows repeated requests from Seoul. The two countries agreed at their summit in Seoul in July last year that they would expand cooperation and exchanges in the food sector and review regulatory standards.  China has also notified the World Trade Organization of its move to ease its rules on pickled foods, according to officials from South Korea's Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs.  The two countries on Wednesday initialed their bilateral free trade agreement, under which South Korea agreed to reduce its import tariffs on kimchi imports from China.

The nation's spy agency said Tuesday that the teen has been receiving training there.  Countries that include Turkey and Iraq have been used as the main gateways by aspiring foreign terrorist fighters to cross into Syria to join IS.  The 18-year-old, identified only by his surname Kim, disappeared on Jan. 10 during a trip to the southern Turkish city of Kilis, situated near the border with Syria.  Since Kim's disappearance, the Seoul government has requested that Syria's neighboring countries beef up border control to prevent South Koreans from traveling to Syria and other nations put on Seoul's travel ban list.  Seoul has imposed travel bans on six countries -- Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Afghanistan and Yemen.  South Korea's foreign ministry said it held a meeting with 15 local travel agencies earlier in the day to seek cooperation on safe travel for its citizens.  ""Travel agencies are advised not to sell travel packages involving countries near Syria as there is a high chance that local travelers can become a target of terrorists there,"" Lee Myung-yul, director-general at the foreign ministry's consular affairs bureau, said at the start of the meeting.  Meanwhile, the Seoul government has held a series of meetings as part of moves to implement the United Nations resolution on curbing FTFs, according to government sources.  The government has tentatively concluded that Seoul is able to punish people who are suspected of joining terrorist groups or conducting terror acts with a set of current laws.  A review of domestic legal procedures to punish FTFs has been underway around the world as a follow-up to the U.N. resolution slamming violent extremism.  In September last year, the U.N.

The DPRK is the acronym for the North's formal name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.The Rodong Sinmun, a newspaper published by the ruling Workers' Party, also carried a story, coupled with related photos, on Kim's so-called field guidance.The pictures showed the firing of multiple rockets and Kim, in black coat, watching the exercise through binoculars. A tablet PC was seen on his table at a command post.He was accompanied by Hwang Pyong-so, director of the general political bureau of the North's military, Defense Minister Hyon Yong-chol and several other senior military officials.The North's media did not specify the timing of the training and its venue. The reports came a couple of days after Lunar New Year's Day, one of the biggest annual celebrations for Koreans.The South Korean government said the live-fire training was held on Friday afternoon, in which Silkworm anti-ship missiles, SA-2 surface-to-air missiles and 122mm self-propelled artillery were mobilized.The Chinese-made Silkworm missile has a range of up to around 95 kilometers, which means Seoul and the nearby Gyeonggi Province are within its reach. The North is known to have more than 180 SA-2s that can fly as far as about 48 kilometers.""The North Korean military seems to have conducted the island strike and landing exercise this time with South Korea's western border islands in mind,"" despite Kim Jong-un's talk of the U.S. threat, a source at the South's defense ministry said.Meanwhile, the North's Rodong Sinmun took a swipe at the new Pentagon chief, Ashton Carter, for his recent remarks that the communist nation's intercontinental ballistic missiles pose a direct threat to his country.The newspaper called Carter a ""war lunatic,"" accusing him of trying to escalate tension and seeking a cause for deploying the THAAD missile defense system on the Korean Peninsula.

At the time, both men concurred on the need to hold dedicated talks at the earliest possible date.The source said no agenda has been set for the possible talks, although media reports from Tokyo speculated the finance ministers could address their efforts if the United States hikes it key rates as expected later this year.Any move by the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise rates could bring about market volatility and adversely affect certain financial markets in Asia and developing economies. The two ministers could discuss economic and fiscal conditions facing both countries, the source said.Such a meeting, if held, could conceivably segue into a new currency swap arrangement, financial watchers say.There have been consistent reports from Japan that the current $10 billion swap deal will expire on Feb. 23 due to a clash of political egos and pride. Under this arrangement, each country can use their respective currencies to get U.S. dollars from the other side at a pre-determined rate, which could come in handy in an emergency.

John Kirby said during a press briefing in response to a question about whether the U.S. has had any talks with South Korea about the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system.“There’s constant discussions and certainly with our South Korean allies about that. But I have no detail to provide, and certainly no announcements to make with respect to that,” the spokesman said.The remark appeared to run counter to what South Korean and U.S. officials have repeatedly said so far, that there have been no official consultations between the two countries about deploying a THAAD battery to South Korea.But Lt. Col. Jeff Pool, a Pentagon press officer, said Kirby’s comments are not different from previous positions as officials from the two sides have often talked informally to each other about the issue because, for example, there have been frequent press reports about it in South Korean media.He stressed that there are no serious or official talks underway currently.“It would be untruthful to say that we haven’t informally discussed (it) because we already had a site survey in the ROK (South Korea) and Gen. Scaparrotti said that he wanted it,” Pool said, referring to the commander of U.S. Forces Korea.“Also, there are false stories regularly in ROK press about THAAD, so we must discuss with our counterparts,” he said.“Unfortunately some news outlets will choose to distort what the spokesperson said and that will cause unnecessary concern and confusion regarding this important topic.”The possibility of the U.S. deploying a THAAD battery in South Korea has been the focus of attention in Seoul because such a deployment is seen by critics as part of a broader U.S. attempt to get the Asian ally to join its missile defense system.The deployment could inflame tensions with China and Russia because they see the move as a threat to their security interests.The two countries have repeatedly expressed concern and opposition at such a possibility. (Yonhap)","pentagon press secretary said tuesday ,korea about the thaad missile ,south korea and gen scaparrotti ,south korean media he stressed ,south korea but lt col","['the United States', 'South Korea', 'Pentagon', 'John Kirby', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'south korean', 'south korean', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Jeff Pool', 'Pentagon', 'Kirby ’s', 'south korean', 'ROK', 'South Korea', 'Scaparrotti', 'U.S.', 'ROK', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'asian', 'China', 'Russia']",1,"[ 0.          3.          0.         ... -0.46200648  1.09524274

South Korea has so far sent 19 in two batches to an Ebola treatment center in Goderich, near capital Freetown.The decision came as Seoul has accepted a recommendation from Emergency, an Italian non-government agency in charge of the Ebola center, as new cases of the disease have been on the decline, according to the foreign ministry.The number of fresh infections came in at 65 in the third week of January in Sierra Leone, down from 337 in the same period of December last year, the government said.Seoul's third team of medical workers will kick-start a four-week operation from Feb. 23 after undergoing training.An official at the foreign ministry added that Seoul also sent a set of tablet PCs and electronic stethoscopes last week to Emergency to help treat Ebola patients.South Korea has joined global efforts to fight Ebola by sending medical workers and offering a combined $12.6 million in assistance. The virus is estimated to have killed more than 8,700 people since the outbreak in December 2013, according to the World Health Organization.

But it heightened the level to a joint naval and air force drill involving fighters and torpedoes this time.

Ambassador Sung Kim, the U.S. special representative for North Korea policy, made the remarks upon his arrival at the Beijing airport for talks with his Chinese counterpart, Wu Dawei, after visiting Tokyo. North Korea has confirmed the attendance of its leader for a May ceremony in Russia marking the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II, the Kremlin said in a statement on Wednesday, without mentioning Kim Jong-un's name.If realized, it would be Kim's first foreign trip since taking the helm of North Korea in late 2011. Some analysts are concerned that closer ties between North Korea and Russia may complicate diplomatic efforts to denuclearize North Korea. Asked about Kim Jong-un's possible visit to Russia in May, Sung Kim replied, ""I have seen reports that the visit might be possible."" ""The main thing is that Russians remain very much committed to denuclearization and the joint statement of the six-party process,"" he said. ""They have made it very clear that they would strongly oppose nuclear tests by North Korea and, in fact, they oppose continuing nuclear activities by North Korea."" The U.S. envoy further said he held ""very productive"" talks in Tokyo with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts and expects to hold ""very substantive and detailed"" talks with his Chinese counterpart in Beijing. North Korea is seeking to deepen both diplomatic and economic ties with Russia at a time when its political relationship with China remains frosty amid international pressure over its nuclear ambitions and dismal human rights record. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has been under intense pressure over the conflict in Ukraine, is also eager to bolster ties with North Korea in an apparent effort against America's pivot to Asia. Putin invited Kim Jong-un to attend the May 9 ceremony during a meeting with Kim's special envoy in November. China is North Korea's main economic benefactor, but political ties between the allies remain strained, particularly after the North's third nuclear test in early 2013.

FINA is headquartered there, but according to the KSF, FINA said it will confirm the specific location of the hearing later.FINA has separately told Park's camp about the hearing, according to the KSF.Park's career appears to be in jeopardy after the news of his failed doping test emerged earlier this week. The KSF has said Park was tested ahead of the Asian Games in the South Korean city of Incheon, which opened in September, and was notified of the result last October.Park, a four-time Olympic medalist and two-time world champ, has blamed the positive test on an injection he took at a local hospital. His agency, Team GMP, is seeking a legal action against the Seoul-based hospital, and state prosecutors said Tuesday Park received a shot of testosterone, a substance banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). Prosecutors are considering indicting the doctor who administered the injection, surnamed Kim, on charges of professional negligence.According to prosecutors, officials from the hospital have claimed that they gave Park the injection to help boost his hormone levels but that they weren't aware that testosterone was a banned substance.Park's camp has told the authorities that the swimmer repeatedly asked the hospital about the contents of the injection and that he was assured that the shot would be clean.Though Park is arguing that he didn't intentionally take the banned substance, he may ultimately be held accountable for the result and face discipline, based on WADA's World Anti-Doping Code.In Article 10, titled ""Sanctions on Individuals,"" the code states that if an athlete can establish that he or she bears no fault or negligence, the athlete may not face sanctions. However, one exception cited by the same code is ""the administration of a prohibited substance by the athlete's personal physician or trainer without disclosure to the athlete.""The code also points out: ""Athletes are responsible for their choice of medical personnel and for advising medical personnel that they cannot be given any prohibited substance.""

But Seoul and Washington have insisted that the North should first show its sincere commitment toward denuclearization.The North offered on Jan. 10 to temporarily halt nuclear tests if the U.S. suspends its annual military exercises with South Korea this year, a proposal flatly rejected by Seoul and Washington.

Korean Air Lines Co. and Asiana Airlines Inc., the nation's two largest air carriers, set the fuel surcharge at $15 for flights bound for the United States for February, far below $165 from a year ago and down from $58 this month. Flights bound for Europe and Africa also will go down from $56 to $15 next month, according to company officials. Hana Tour Co., the nation's largest tour agency, estimated the demand for international air travel will rise 28 percent on-year to about 250,000 people this month, and predicted that 154,000 people will travel abroad in February, up 22 percent from a year ago. The top destinations were Vietnam and Cambodia, followed by Thailand and Japan, the agency said. ""The demand for overseas travel has sharply risen thanks to the drop in the fuel surcharge, especially to Southeast Asia and Japan,"" a Hana Tour agency official said. Mode Tour Co., the nation's second-largest tour agency, said the number of outbound travelers via its agents jumped 30 percent on-year in January, while half of them traveled to Southeast Asia.Mode expected a 15 percent rise in the number of overseas travelers next month. Interpark INT Co., an online ticketing agency, said its overseas flight ticket sales soared 25.5 percent in January from a year earlier, and booking rates for next month increased 11 percent.

It did not specify the timing and venue.Kim was quoted as stressing the importance of honing capabilities to mount a ""deadly attack,"" saying a ""powerful offensive means rock-firm defense.""A set of photos released by the KCNA showed Kim watching the training and a couple of top military officials -- Hwang Pyong-so and Hyon Yong-chol -- directly leading it aboard a mobile artillery launcher and an armored vehicle. Both Hwang, director of the military's general political bureau, and Hyon, minister of defense, are 66 years old. Carrying a similar report, the (North) Korean Central Broadcasting Station described the U.S. as a deadly foe and claimed it blatantly revealed an ambition to topple the socialist system.Last week, Obama said in an interview on YouTube that the isolated communist regime is likely to collapse mainly due to the Internet-driven inflow of information.The North's broadcaster also condemned the latest spread of anti-Pyongyang leaflets via balloons in the country by a group of conservative activists in the South.On Sunday, the National Defense Commission, Pyongyang's top ruling organ, warned of stern punishment against South Korea, accusing it of allowing the leaflet campaign and planning to start annual joint military drills with the U.S. in March.

Hagel is expected to talk about it again when he speaks with Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani later Thursday.Last month, the three countries signed a memorandum of understanding that calls for voluntary sharing of military secrets on North Korea's nuclear and missile programs between the three countries.The deal paved the way for Seoul and Tokyo to share such intelligence via the U.S. after the two countries failed to strike a bilateral intelligence sharing deal in 2012 due in part to negative public sentiment in South Korea about signing such a pact with the former colonial ruler.Now that the MOU has been signed, the three countries should ""get the ball rolling,"" the source said, referring to U.S. efforts to establish a formula to carry out the agreement.The formula is expected to lay out detailed procedures, including how to determine intelligence to be shared. Such procedures are necessary because the three countries have no idea what intelligence the other partners have, the source said.The intelligence sharing deal is considered an effort to get around frayed relations between South Korea and Japan and move trilateral security cooperation forward.Relations between South Korea and Japan have been strained for years due mainly to Tokyo's attempts to whitewash its wartime atrocities and colonial occupation. Their relations worsened further after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe came into office as he took a series of nationalistic steps.The U.S. has called for Seoul and Tokyo to come to terms with each other. Frayed relations between the two key Asian allies are a cause for concern for Washington as it seeks to develop three-way security cooperation in an effort to keep a rising China in check.

Another faction wants to continue talks with the New Politics Alliance for Democracy to avoid a struggle that could block legislation of other bills.The latter group holds the upper hand, as parliamentary laws require the majority party to present a unanimous front for the divisive bill to pass. The party has 158 of the parliament’s 295 members.The main parties have been divided over the bill since 2005. The Saenuri Party supports a hard-line version that could be used to prosecute Pyongyang officials after unification. The NPAD backs a bill urging Seoul to “persuade” Pyongyang to improve its rights record through regular talks.Saenuri chair Rep. Kim last Thursday suggested ending the near-decade-old partisan impasse by using the so-called fast-track clause in the National Assembly Act, sparking a backlash from NPAD members who called the Saenuri proposal a “bullying tactic.”A draft bill that is designated a fast-track bill is automatically sent up for final vote to a plenary session in 330 days, at which point the majority party can use its superior numbers to approve the law.But labeling it as a fast-track bill requires the support of three-fifths of the parliamentary committee overseeing the legislation. For the North Korea human rights bill, that is the Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee, where the governing party holds 14 of the 23 seats.If all 14 Saenuri lawmakers vote for the Saenuri version of the human rights bill, it will pass. But two senior Saenuri legislators on the panel have openly expressed their opposition to designating the human rights bill as a fast-track legislation.“I see no reason to make a fuss out of this bill,” Saenuri Rep. Choung Byoung-gug said. “There are so many more key bills that we need to pass. I see no reason to draw the ire of the NPAD on this symbolic bill.”Saenuri Rep. Yoo Ki-june, the foreign affairs committee head, expressed a similar opinion.“It will take 330 days to reach the parliament’s full session. By then, this National Assembly will be approaching the end of its term,” he said. The next parliamentary elections are in April 2016, with candidates expected to be announced as early as next January.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","rights bill amid fierce protest ,all 14 saenuri lawmakers vote ,officials on tuesday were torn ,bullying tactic draft bill that ,14 saenuri lawmakers vote for","['Saenuri Party', 'North Korea', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Pyongyang', 'NPAD', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Saenuri', 'Kim', 'the National Assembly Act', 'NPAD', 'Saenuri', 'North Korea', 'the Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee', 'Saenuri', 'Saenuri', 'Saenuri', 'Saenuri', 'Choung Byoung', 'Yoo Ki', 'this National Assembly', 'Jeong Hunny']",12,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.13749593  0.13099514

(Yonhap)""I will also partly reorganize Cheong Wa Dae to improve the work efficiency and help (staff’s) mind take a new turn,” she said. The president also said she will appoint a group of advisors “as soon as possible” to enhance communication between Cheong Wa Dae and the political parties to speed up her economic reform policies.The president, however, didn’t say when she would replace her staff and Cabinet members. Although it appears she may carry out the reshuffle within this month, according to some observers, citing mounting pressure for the revamp from the opposition parties, as well as the sharp drop in her approval rating.According to a local pollster, her job rating plunged to 35 percent last week, the lowest level since she entered office in early 2013. Park had vowed to conduct a reshuffle last week during her New Year’s news conference. But the president said she would keep three secretaries who have been pressured to resign over their alleged involvement in an influence-meddling scandal. She said a decision on the fate of her Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon will be taken later after all pending issues are resolved. But it is widely expected that Park would replace Kim this time as it may be a burden to carry out her reform drive by retaining him. Not only the main opposition party, but also some from the ruling Saenuri Party have been demanding Kim’s removal, accusing him of pulling the strings over state affairs and personnel choices.At the meeting, Park also lamented a recent child abuse case at a day care center in Incheon, stressing that efforts to create safe and healthy child care environment went in vain.Free child care was one of her major welfare campaigns, designed to help mothers with small children return to the workplace and also children with low-income families to have equal opportunities to receive proper care and early education. The Park government, so far, has injected 9 trillion won every year to operate the universal child care system. The program allows parents send their kids to local day care centers for free, and encourages local offices to build more child care facilities.""Despite efforts to create a safe and reliable environment to raise children, it is deplorable that such cases are coming out,” she said. The president ordered the relevant ministries to tighten protection of children and eradicate child abuse cases by closely working together. In a joint measure, the government and the ruling Saenuri Party decided to implement measures to root out child abuse at day care centers.

It also threatened to block the main gate of the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division and carry out a city-wide referendum to ask residents whether they were in favor of the U.S. unit’s presence in the city.The municipality has strongly protested the decision by Seoul and Washington to retain the 210 Fire Brigade, the U.S.’ key anti-artillery unit, in Dongducheon until the South’s artillery reinforcement plan is completed around 2020.The city has been pushing for a series of development schemes on the premise that all U.S. bases in the city would be relocated to Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province by 2016 under the so-called Land Partnership Plan. It has criticized the Seoul government for canceling the plan, saying that the delay would seriously impede its development efforts.The city said it would withdraw its employee from Camp Casey who has helped U.S. military personnel register their cars under the Status of Forces Agreement, a pact that governs the legal status of the 28,500 U.S. troops in Korea. After the withdrawal, the U.S. personnel must visit the city hall for vehicle registration.From next Monday, civic groups in the city plan to stage a one-person demonstration in front of the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division headquarters. On the weekends, Dongducheon Mayor Oh Se-chang and other senior officials plan to join the protest.Next Wednesday, the Seoul government plans to hold a meeting to discuss the support measures. Should there be no progress in devising sufficient measures, the city would take stronger action, including blocking the main gate of the U.S. military base.

He has been serving a four-year term since January 2013.The younger Chey was sentenced to three years and six months in prison for conspiring with the elder Chey in the embezzlement scheme.The Supreme Court also upheld a four-year prison term handed down to Koo last year for fraudulently issuing commercial papers worth about 215 billion won.It was somewhat customary for outgoing presidents to pardon their friends and associates jailed for corruption, stoking controversy that the measure fosters persistent corruption among political and business elite by allowing the well-connected to escape justice.Park, who has been critical of issuing special pardons recklessly, earlier promised to exercise the right in an extremely restrictive manner.

Ethnic Koreans of other nationalities are also encouraged to report themselves if they are residing in South Korea with forged passports.According to the immigration agency, 18,588 foreigners were caught from 2008 to 2013 for either entering or residing in South Korea with a passport with someone else’s identity.The KIS estimates that the majority of illegal residents with forged passports are ethnic Koreans from China.Many of them entered South Korea with illegal passports prior to 2007, the year South Korea was officially declared an immigrant-receiving country by the United Nations. Also in the same year, South Korea launched the employment permit system (EPS), which allowed foreign workers to live in the country for a maximum of four years and 10 months. “(Prior to 2007), it was very difficult for Korean-Chinese people to work in South Korea,” said Lee Moon-han, deputy director of the KIS. “Korean-Chinese were granted a long-term stay here only if they had a South Korean national as their relatives. Many of them entered Korea for jobs with legal Chinese passports but with someone else’s identity.”Korean-Chinese who have used forged passports to enter South Korea but currently reside in China can also report themselves in their home country, at the nearest South Korean embassies. According to Lee, fingerprints and facial recognition have been required for all inbound foreign visitors to Korea since 2012. “Those who have left South Korea with forged passports and try to re-enter with a different passport are very likely to be caught right away at the airport,” he said.For information, call 1345.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","legal passports year after deportation ,korean chinese with forged passports ,south korea with illegal passports ,korea with illegal passports prior ,korea immigration service said thursday","['korean', 'South Korea', 'the Korea Immigration Service', 'KIS', 'Koreans', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'KIS', 'Koreans', 'China', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'the United Nations', 'South Korea', 'EPS', 'korean', 'South Korea', 'Lee Moon - han', 'KIS', 'korean', 'south korean', 'Korea', 'chinese', 'South Korea', 'China', 'south korean', 'Lee', 'Korea', 'South Korea', 'Claire Lee']",6,"[ 1.          2.          0.         ... -0.67416573  0.72643405

The number of people making direct purchases from foreign manufacturers or online shops has been increasing steadily over the recent years as more people seek to save money by bypassing local importers and distributors, who often add a significant amount of service charges to the original product price. In a recent survey by the state-run Korea Internet and Security Agency, more than four out of every 10 Internet users surveyed said they have made at least one direct purchase from an overseas site.However, 56.6 percent of those who made such purchases said they had experienced inconveniences or suffered a financial loss in the process. The commission said it will work with the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law to set compensation for any monetary damages to local consumers since overseas shopping sites are not subject to punishment under local laws.The directive also includes imposing fines for automakers that fail to carry out voluntary and timely recalls on their vehicles that are found to have problems.

But the disagreements themselves should no longer be cited as reasons for not holding summit talks with Japan,” New Politics Alliance for Democracy chair Rep. Moon Hee-sang said.Sour relations between the two Asian neighbors have persisted during President Park’s term, apparently due to South Korea’s distaste for Abe’s revisionist views on history. The prime minister has made statements denying Japanese atrocities during World War II.Moon also “welcomed” Japanese Emperor Akihito’s New Year remarks, as they seemed to imply remorse over Japan’s aggression in the Second World War. The Japanese royal had said “it was most important” for Japan to “learn from” World War II when considering its future policies.“The Abe administration should heed Emperor Akihito’s words of learning from the past,” Moon said.Relations between Seoul and Tokyo have worsened in recent years. Park has apparently refused to hold bilateral talks with Abe due to the prime minister’s historical views. U.S. President Barack Obama attempted to mend ties by mediating a trilateral meeting last March.Prime Minister Abe’s statements denying any forcible recruitment of sex slaves by the Japanese military has especially enraged South Korea. The Japanese military either forcibly recruited or tricked into enslavement thousands of Asian and some Dutch women who are euphemistically called comfort women. Many of the former slaves are from Korea, with the average age of the surviving victims close to 89.Abe has not shown signs he will retract from his revisionist views. Most recently, the Japanese government on Dec. 24 posted a YouTube video that supported Tokyo’s claims over Dokdo, South Korean islets in the East Sea whose ownership Japan contests.The move reignited an issue that has been a major source of tension between Seoul and Tokyo.The main opposition leader also expressed his support for bilateral talks with North Korea.“This year marks the 70th anniversary of our liberation from Japanese colonial rule, and our country’s postwar division. It is time to end seven decades of rivalry and begin a new age of peace,” Moon said.

281,281,Tension between U.S. and N. Korea escalates,"Tension between the United States and North Korea further escalated over the weekend as Washington imposed new economic sanctions Friday against Pyongyang in retaliation for the reclusive regime’s alleged cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment.The North’s Foreign Ministry responded angrily to the punitive measures Sunday, saying that America’s “tenacious adherence” to a hostile policy toward the North would ...","Tension between the United States and North Korea further escalated over the weekend as Washington imposed new economic sanctions Friday against Pyongyang in retaliation for the reclusive regime’s alleged cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment.The North’s Foreign Ministry responded angrily to the punitive measures Sunday, saying that America’s “tenacious adherence” to a hostile policy toward the North would further reinforce its will to protect its sovereignty.U.S. President Barack Obama signed an executive order Friday, while on vacation in Hawaii, to approve sanctions against three North Korean organizations and 10 senior officials as part of his “proportional response” to the attack on Sony that produced the “Interview,” a comedy about a scheme to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.Announcing the decision, the White House accused the North of carrying out “provocative, destabilizing and repressive actions and policies, particularly its destructive and coercive cyberattack on Sony Pictures.” It also said, “Today’s actions are the first aspect of our response.” A composite showing US President Barack Obama in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, 21 November 2014, delivering remarks on his immigration policy and a photograph released by the North Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on 01 January 2013 showing North Korean leader Kim Jong-un delivering a New Year`s Day address in Pyongyang, North Korea. (Yonhap)Seoul’s Foreign Ministry called the sanctions an “appropriate response,” reiterating that cyberattacks to damage private and corporate interests and the openness and security of cyberspace should not be tolerated. Those sanctioned will be banned from accessing the U.S. financial system and doing any transactions with U.S. nationals. But the largely symbolic sanctions are unlikely to further damage the economy of the heavily isolated country which is already under a series of international sanctions for its nuclear and missile tests.The sanctions target the North’s Reconnaissance General Bureau, the country’s premier military spy agency, which Washington and Seoul believe orchestrated a series of cyberincursions against them. Seoul also blames the RGB for launching a string of fatal provocations including the 2010 torpedo attack on the corvette Cheonan that killed 46 sailors. Korea Mining Development Trading Corp., in charge of the arms exports, and Korea Tangun Trading Corp., a defense research agency, have also been added to the sanctions list, as well as 10 senior officials, including those operating in Iran, Syria, China, Russia and Namibia.“Even as the FBI continues its investigation into the cyberattack against Sony Pictures Entertainment, these steps underscore that we will employ a broad set of tools to defend U.S. businesses and citizens, and to respond to attempts to undermine our values or threaten the national security of the United States,” U.S. Treasury secretary Jack Lew said in a statement.The sanctions came as Pyongyang has hardened its rhetoric against the U.S., while continuing its peace offensive toward the South and refraining from launching its usual verbal attacks against Seoul.“The U.S. is wholly responsible for its hitherto antagonistic, hostile relationship with North Korea. The U.S. should throw away its hostile policy toward the North,” said a piece in Saturday’s edition of the Rodong Sinmun, the daily of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party.“Should the U.S. come forward with good will while respecting our sovereignty without intervening in our internal affairs, we would respond to that accordingly.” The two Koreas have moved closer to dialogue since the North Korean leader demonstrated his desire to hold a “top-level meeting” with the South and restore cross-border ties in his New Year address.Supporting the U.S. sanctions against the North, Seoul appears to have reaffirmed that it would deal separately with the issues of inter-Korean cooperation and provocations such as the nuclear development and cybervandalism.In response to Kim’s New Year’s address, Seoul reiterated that it remained open to dialogue in any form. Some observers said the North could specify its desire for inter-Korean talks this week, while others presume that it may wait until after President Park Geun-hye delivers her New Year’s speech, which is expected to be delivered on Jan. 12.The upcoming impediment to inter-Korean dialogue would be the planned annual military exercise between the U.S. and South Korea, which will begin in February. The North Korean leader has called on the allies to cancel the exercise, but the South said the “defense” drills will proceed as planned.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","friday against pyongyang in retaliation ,imposed new economic sanctions friday ,new economic sanctions friday ,new economic sanctions friday against ,order friday while on vacation","['the United States', 'North Korea', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'Sony Pictures Entertainment', 'the North ’s Foreign Ministry', 'America', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'Hawaii', 'north korean', 'Sony', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'the White House', 'Sony Pictures', 'US', 'Barack Obama', 'Las Vegas', 'Nevada', 'USA', 'the north Korean Central News Agency', 'KCNA', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'Foreign Ministry', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'the North ’s Reconnaissance General Bureau', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'RGB', 'Korea Mining Development Trading Corp.', 'Korea Tangun Trading Corp.', 'Iran', 'Syria', 'China', 'Russia', 'Namibia', 'FBI', 'Sony Pictures Entertainment', 'U.S.', 'the United States', 'U.S. Treasury', 'Jack Lew', 'Pyongyang', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'the Rodong Sinmun', 'North ’s', 'Workers ’ Party', 'U.S.', 'Koreas', 'north korean', 'U.S.', 'North', 'Seoul', 'inter - korean', 'Kim ’s', 'Seoul', 'inter - korean', 'Park Geun', 'inter - korean', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'north korean', 'Song Sang - ho']",9,"[ 0.          0.          3.         ... -0.44680792  0.19024697

282,282,S.Korea activist to launch 'Interview' DVDs into N.Korea,"   A South Korean activist said Thursday he plans to launch a series of balloons across the border into North Korea carrying copies of a film which has enraged its leadership.    Former defector Park Sang-hak said the balloons would carry a total of 100,000 copies on DVDs and USB memory sticks of ""The Interview,"" a comedy about a fictional plot to kill North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.   The giant balloons, whi...","A South Korean activist said Thursday he plans to launch a series of balloons across the border into North Korea carrying copies of a film which has enraged its leadership.    Former defector Park Sang-hak said the balloons would carry a total of 100,000 copies on DVDs and USB memory sticks of ""The Interview,"" a comedy about a fictional plot to kill North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.   The giant balloons, which are used by private groups in the South to float anti-regime material across the heavily guarded border, will also carry bundles of leaflets.   ""Probably the first launch will be made in late January if weather conditions allow,"" Park said, adding the exact date would be decided when his partners from the U.S.-based non-profit Human Rights Foundation visit Seoul around Jan. 20.   He said the foundation had financed the production of the DVDs and USB memory sticks.   The Sony Pictures film sparked off an international incident.   Threats made by hackers after a November cyber attack on the movie giant initially prompted Sony to cancel the film's Christmas Day release, after many large US theater chains got cold feet.   The United States blamed North Korea for the cyber attack, but it vehemently denied any involvement.   U.S. President Barack Obama expressed regret at Sony's cancellation and the studio then decided on a limited release. It was also released online.   Last week the North derided Obama as a ""monkey"" for encouraging cinemas to screen the comedy.   South Korean activists -- many of them defectors from the North -- have been carrying out leaflet launches for years.   At times of heightened cross-border tensions, Seoul has stepped in to stop them for fear of retaliation.   The two Koreas agreed last year to restart suspended dialogue when a top-ranking North Korean delegation made a surprise visit to the Asian Games held in the South in October.   The trip raised hopes of a thaw, but was followed by a series of minor military clashes along the border that renewed tensions and talks never materialised.   At one time the two Koreas traded heavy machine-gun fire after the North's military tried to shoot down balloons carrying anti-Pyongyang leaflets.   But in a New Year message Thursday the North's leader Kim called for top-level talks with the South, and Seoul responded positively.    Park said his launch operation would get into its stride in March when the wind direction is favorable. ""I will never succumb to any threats,"" he said.

283,283,Saenuri Party’s year rides on reforms,"Rep.

Kim Moo-sung, chairman of the Saenuri Party, reiterated the need for innovation and change on Thursday as the ruling party embarks on a year that hinges on the success of its reform drives. Kim said that Korea faced many political, economic and social challenges, and that the party had a lot to tackle in 2015.“When the country is in difficulty, the Saenuri Party should be the group that leads innovation to open a new age,” Kim said. He went on to say that the party should rally behind “the spirit of reform to become the icon of innovation,” which would enable the party to win general and presidential elections down the road. This year, the conservatives are faced with a number of reforms, the success of which could have a lasting impact on the party’s leaders. Chief among the reform issues is the public sector pension system, which is expected to continue to pile up large deficits. With the party leadership having emphasized the issue for some time, it was selected as the most pressing matter of 2015 by ruling party members in a recent survey conducted by a local daily. However, the matter is unlikely to be resolved easily. The issue has already missed the deadline of end-2014 that Cheong Wa Dae called for, and resistance from labor groups and the opposition bloc is expected to continue. The issue has been met with fierce resistance from government employees from the outset, and they have since warned that they would launch a campaign for President Park Geun-hye’s administration to step down. With much riding on the issue, the Saenuri Party is said to have experienced some trouble in selecting the chair for the committee, as the position will bear the brunt of the wrath of those opposing the reforms. The chair will also be unable to avoid taking the blame should the efforts to reform the pension system fail. The party chairman, however, is taking on the issue with his characteristic drive, stating that results will be seen by April.Kim has also taken on the task of reforming the conservatives, which he touted as his main agenda since taking the helm of the party. Despite his support, the process has faced hurdles. The plans drawn up by the party’s reform committee were initially rejected at the general meeting of lawmakers in November, and the committee was accused of failing to communicate properly.The reform plan eventually received party approval, but only after significant changes had been made and doubts had been raised about Kim’s leadership. All aspects of the modified plan were accepted by the party at the very end of last year, but failure to achieve significant change would deal a considerable blow to Kim, whom pundits consider one of the few conservative bigwigs to practice his own brand of politics with relative independence from President Park.
