""No country has succeeded with political polarization.""  For decades, local politics has been divided mainly along regional and ideological fault lines. South Korea's southeast region has been the political stronghold of the ruling conservative Saenuri Party, while the southwestern region has been the political turf of the main opposition liberal New Politics Alliance for Democracy.  ""A new party will put rational reform at the center of politics,"" Ahn said as he called for a new political paradigm to end what he claims is old politics riddled with enmity and confrontation.  He is pushing to launch a new political party by early February for April's general elections.  Ahn, the founder of the nation's largest anti-virus software firm Ahnlab Co., co-led the main opposition party with Moon Jae-in last year, but he quit the party earlier this month following internal strife with Moon.  Ahn said a tax hike is inevitable to the growing social needs and called on lawmakers to be frank on the issue, even if they could face public rebuke over a possible tax hike.  He also stressed the importance of the South Korea-U.S. alliance and called for the development of relations between South Korea and China.  China has overtaken the United States as South Korea's No. 1 trade partner in recent years.

Choi Kyung-hwan, the president’s top aide with a mission to sway parliamentary election nominations in favor of pro-Park figures.Choi is coming back to his third-term seat after his successor as finance minister was named in a Cabinet reshuffle Monday. He is expected to spearhead the faction loyal to President Park Geun-hye, and bracing for his return is the party’s chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung, who represents the “non-Park” faction.The power struggle between the two factions has already been vicious over a series of bills, leadership appointments and other party affairs. And the fight is likely to intensify over the party’s nomination rules for the April 13 general elections.The outnumbered pro-Park faction -- currently led by Supreme Council member Rep. Suh Chung-won -- has been pushing for wider strategic nominations not only in weak battlegrounds, such as the Jeolla provinces, but also in strong regions of metropolitan areas. Through this, the faction aims to expand its clout. Saenuri chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung attends an event celebrating the holiday season on Tuesday. YonhapKim, on the other hand, remains steadfastly set on his defunct open primary project or something similar, vowing to keep the nomination as transparent as possible -- meaning more involvement of voters and ordinary party members and less influence from Park.Political pundits have said the anticipated power struggle within the Saenuri Party reflects the chronically backward politics of South Korea, where the months before each parliamentary elections are tainted with nomination struggles amid the lack of a fundamental system.“Saenuri Party has been enjoying steady approval ratings despite the low public popularity of the Park administration and the ruling camp in large part thanks to the internal feud at the opposition NPAD,” said Yoon Seong-yi, political professor at Kyung Hee University.“With Saenuri also falling into the same chaos, the party is likely to suffer a setback. This is the most representative case of Korea’s backward politics where those who seize power do not end up seeking fundamental improvements in the nomination process once they win,” he added.With Choi returning to the stage, the pro-Park faction is expected to align more systematically, having direct communication with Cheong Wa Dae through Choi and presidential aide on political affairs Hyun Ki-hwan.It has been the resolve of the pro-Park faction to build up the party base and eventually seek to hoist a pro-Park member as the party’s next chair. Kim’s tenure ends in July. The next chairperson has to take on the crucial task of leading the party through the 2017 presidential election.Kim, who has been dubbed as a likely candidate to run for president, is likely to resign from his position before the end of his term. Based on the party rules, a party chairperson cannot double as presidential candidate. The Saenuri Party, meanwhile, held the first meeting of its special committee on nomination rules Tuesday. Wary of the looming factional battle, the party members were seen to take a cautious approach in public.“It is hoped that (the members) will refrain from (making moves) that can be perceived as a factional problem by people,” said Rep. Hong Moon-pyo, the party’s first deputy secretary-general.Kim, for his part, began to meet with high profile potential parliamentary candidates, starting off with Ahn Dae-hee, former prime minister-nominee, who he met Tuesday.

Ahn Cheol-soo on Monday announced his plan to form a new party by early February and pledged to build a robust opposition bloc to eventually form the next administration.“I have so far failed to meet the people’s expectations to change politics and the nation,” said Ahn in a televised press conference. “I owe it to the people and my supporters. The only way to repay the debt is to achieve a change of government and practice new politics that transforms people’s lives.”With some dissenting opposition lawmakers weighing the option to join Ahn, who bolted from the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy on Dec. 13th, his new party is aiming to emerge as a third party in the April 13 general elections.  Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo on speaks during a press conference held at the National Assembly on Monday. (Yonhap)While Ahn dismissed the possibility of merging with the NPAD in the run-up to the elections, the businessman-turned-politician highlighted that he would join forces with the NPAD dissenters who had already left the party. A total of seven NPAD lawmakers have left the party since its leader Rep. Moon Jae-in took the helm in February. Among them, Reps. Moon Byeong-ho, Yoo Sung-yop, Hwang Ju-hong and Kim Dong-cheol quit the party in the wake of Ahn’s defection. They flanked Ahn at the press conference to show their support.The four dissenters expected that several more dissenting lawmakers would follow them, noting that Ahn’s burgeoning popularity in opinion polls would encourage the lawmakers to join Ahn’s camp -- particularly those representing the NPAD stronghold of South Jeolla province. “I think one or two NPAD lawmakers will leave this week,” said Moon Byung-ho. “I think (the NPAD lawmakers) are agonizing over their next move because Ahn’s approval ratings among voters in the Jeolla provinces has been soaring. The region will emerge as the center of a typhoon,” he added. Among the eight seats in Gwangju, the capital city of South Jeolla Province, the number of seats held by the NPAD was reduced to five as Reps. Chun Jung-bae, Park Joo-sun and Kim Dong-chul left the party. The remaining five are reportedly considering following suit, except for Rep. Kang Gi-Jung. By region, Ahn’s new party recorded the highest approval rating of 31 percent in Gwangju in a survey conducted by local pollster Realmeter on Monday. The polls showed that Ahn’s future party’s approval rating came in at third with 16.3 percent, following the NPAD’s 25.7 percent and the Saenuri Party’s 38.2 percent. While setting his new party’s objective of winning the 2017 presidential elections, Ahn vowed to create a third opposition group that can prevent the Saenuri Party from gaining more than 200 seats, the mark for an overwhelming majority in the Assembly, in the 2016 general elections. Observers noted that the fate of Ahn’s new political party would determine whether the third party would succeed in South Korea’s political landscape, where two major parties have mostly enjoyed supremacy against independents attempting to create a third party. Except for the late President Kim Dae-jung’s defection from the then-main opposition Democratic Party in 1995 -- he had created his own party, National Congress for New Politics, and emerged as the biggest opposition in the 1995 general elections -- the defectors’ attempt to replace the main opposition have failed. “Ahn’s new party will serve as a watershed moment for the Korean political system; whether it can transition from a two-party system to a multiparty system,” said Choi Jin, the chairman of the Institute of Presidential Leadership.“Due to the legacy of the military dictatorship, third parties have struggled to establish themselves and ended up being minor parties. But things have been changing in favor of the creation of a third party, as diverse voices are springing up in the pluralist Korean society,” said Choi. Other observers, such as Kim Jong-in, the former senior presidential secretary for economic affairs who lured Ahn into politics in 2011 when Ahn became popular among young voters, dismissed the possibility that Ahn’s new party would emerge as a significant political group in the elections. “In politics, image is not everything. I think Ahn has proved nothing since 2011. His new party would gain some seats in the South Jeolla Province and Seoul metropolitan areas. But the election would ultimately come down to the rivalry between the Saenuri Party and the NPAD,” said Kim in a media interview. By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","winning the 2017 presidential elections ,opposition presidential candidate rep ,since 2011 his new party ,government and practice new politics ,opposition presidential candidate rep ahn","['Ahn Cheol', 'Ahn', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Ahn Cheol', 'the National Assembly', 'NPAD', 'NPAD', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Moon Byeong - ho', 'Yoo Sung - yop', 'Hwang Ju - hong', 'Kim Dong - cheol', 'Ahn ’s', 'Ahn ’s', 'Ahn ’s', 'South Jeolla', 'NPAD', 'Moon Byung - ho', 'NPAD', 'Ahn ’s', 'Jeolla', 'South Jeolla Province', 'Chun Jung - bae', 'Kim Dong - chul', 'Kang Gi - Jung', 'Ahn ’s', 'realmeter', 'Ahn ’s', 'NPAD', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'Ahn', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Assembly', 'Ahn ’s', 'South Korea ’s', 'Kim Dae - jung ’s', 'Democratic Party', 'National Congress for New Politics', 'ahn ’s', 'korean', 'Choi Jin', 'the Institute of Presidential Leadership', 'korean', 'Choi', 'Kim Jong - in', 'Ahn ’s', 'Ahn', 'Seoul', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Kim', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",1,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.08641682  0.67935318

Ahn Cheonl-soo, who had left the party over a power struggle with the current party leader Rep. Moon Jae-in. They were the first to follow behind Ahn in leaving the party after several other dissenters retracted their initial decisions to defect and decided to stay for the sake of an opposition victory in next year’s general elections. Reps. Moon Byung-ho, Yoo Sung-yop, and Hwang Ju-hong -- who had warned of their defection since Ahn left the NPAD on Dec. 13 -- vowed to create a new opposition bloc with other dissenters who had already left the NPAD or are planning to quit the party. “We are leaving the NPAD to walk the path of victory and reunite the opposition bloc,” Moon said in a news conference at the National Assembly. “We will gather forces from the people who agree with us and create a new political group to realign the opposition bloc,” said Moon. But the prospects of their plan to rival the established parties remained to be seen as the majority of the NPAD dissenters, who have echoed the defectors’ criticism against the current NPAD leadership, were seen to be reluctant to follow their lead. Representatives Hwang Ju-hong (center), Moon Byung-ho (left) and Yoo Sung-yop talk to reporters after a press conference announcing their NPAD defection at the National Assembly on Thursday. YonhapExcept for Rep. Kim Dong-cheol, who is reportedly considering leaving the party, there have been no other NPAD lawmakers inside or outside the mainstream suggesting they would quit the party in the foreseeable future. Even Rep. Song Ho-chang, who had worked for Ahn’s presidential campaign in 2012, has decided to stay. As an opinion poll released by local pollster Realmeter showed Wednesday that the NPAD’s approval ratings were almost double that of Ahn’s prospective party, some dissenters cautioned that more defections would lead to a division of the opposition -- a scenario that has led to election defeats in the past. “South Korea’s political structure is based on two major political parties whose support comes from regional divisions,” said Rep. Kim Boo-kyum, another NPAD dissenter who decided to remain at the party. “Third parties have always raised hopes for a new kind of politics, but they often gave up midway,” said Kim.  For example, the divided opposition bloc suffered a crushing defeat in the 1996 general election as then-main opposition Democratic Party split into two opposition groups -- National Congress for New Politics and Unified Democratic Party. Mindful of the scenario, the three defectors have yet to outline their next move -- whether they will join forces with Ahn or other NPAD defectors, such as Rep. Chung Jung-bae, who has recently created his own minor party, or Rep. Park Joo-sun, who on Thursday stressed the imperativeness of the dissenters forming a single opposition bloc. Meanwhile, NPAD third-term lawmaker Rep. Choi Jae-sung announced Thursday that he would not run in the election. The move was considered to be in support of chairman Moon’s reform initiatives that he vowed to uphold in Wednesday’s press conference to keep the house in order.Moon has said he would adopt a bottom-up approach for nominating candidates for the 2016 general elections amid calls for the established NPAD members to forgo their run to make way for fresh faces. Moon had warned that NPAD lawmakers categorized in the bottom 20 percent in their job performance reviews would be deprived of the opportunity to stand for reelection. Among the dissenting lawmakers, Hwang and Yoo refused to undergo the review.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","opposition lawmakers thursday bolted from ,three main opposition lawmakers thursday ,main opposition lawmakers thursday bolted ,lawmakers thursday bolted from the ,opposition lawmakers thursday bolted","['the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Ahn Cheonl', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Ahn', 'Moon Byung - ho', 'Yoo Sung - yop', 'Hwang Ju - hong', 'Ahn', 'NPAD', 'NPAD', 'Moon', 'the National Assembly', 'Moon', 'NPAD', 'NPAD', 'Hwang Ju - hong', 'Moon Byung - ho', 'Yoo Sung - yop', 'NPAD', 'the National Assembly', 'Kim Dong - cheol', 'NPAD', 'Song Ho - chang', 'Ahn ’s', 'Ahn ’s', 'South Korea ’s', 'Kim Boo - kyum', 'NPAD', 'Kim', 'Democratic Party', 'National Congress for New Politics and Unified Democratic Party', 'NPAD', 'Chung Jung - bae', 'Park Joo', 'Choi Jae - sung', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'NPAD', 'Moon', 'NPAD', 'Hwang', 'Yoo', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.77469218  0.7211054

Ahn Cheol-soo on Sunday reiterated his call for an early convention to replace current chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in.Ahn of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy demanded last week that a party caucus be held by January to select a new leadership before the April 13 general election. Moon rejected the idea Thursday but instead accepted a set of reform measures suggested by Ahn three months ago. Ahn, again, called on Moon to reconsider.“This is not the time to cling to one’s vested rights. … Let me know clearly if you have no intention to transform our party together … (Accepting my reform measures) is not enough to overcome the crisis that the party faces,” Ahn said in a press conference, reiterating the need for Moon’s referendum. The power struggle between Moon and Ahn is seen as fueling the factional divide in the NPAD, which is beset by flagging support and threats from dissenting lawmakers that they will leave the party unless changes are made. Since Moon took office in February, the NPAD has seen a string of liberal heavyweights’ departures. Rep. Chun Jung-bae defected in March in protest against Moon’s refusal to nominate him for the 2015 April by-elections. Third-term lawmaker Rep. Park Joo-sun left the party in September amid Moon’s push to overhaul the party in the wake of by-election defeats. With over a year left in Moon’s tenure as a party leader, sources described Ahn’s remark as an ultimatum to his former rival Moon, indicating Ahn would join the defectors unless Moon accepted his “final” proposal. Moon and Ahn had competed during 2012 presidential race.“I am not going to make any more suggestions or proposals. … If Moon is reelected, I will endorse the decision and give my full support to him. I sincerely urge Moon to consider what is best for the party,” Ahn said.Ahn highlighted that the referendum on Moon’s leadership was the only option to reassure the voters and the NPAD members in the run-up to the general election, refuting Moon’s dismissal that his plan was an attempt to deepen party divisions.   Former NPAD chairman Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo on Sunday helds press conference at the National Assembly. YonhapMoon did not immediately respond to Ahn’s challenge, saying he would “not speak today” about Ahn’s press conference.Public opinion remained split over the issue. According to the survey of local pollster Realmeter released on Thursday, 32.9 percent of NPAD supporters endorsed Moon’s leadership, outweighing 21.4 percent of those who approved Ahn’s referendum move. More unaffiliated voters, meanwhile, supported Ahn’s plan with 36.4 percent agreeing to it.The two NPAD heavyweight’s feud escalated after Moon asked Ahn to join a three-way coalition leadership with Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon on Nov. 18. Ahn rejected the proposal and insisted on holding a party caucus to overhaul the leadership. The NPAD has been pushing to overhaul the party with a tougher in-house nomination procedure and ethical regulations in light of heavy factional fighting and repeated election defeats. Observers have forecast another major defeat by the NPAD against the Saenuri in the April general election based on current approval ratings. According to a Dec. 3 survey from local pollster Realmeter, the NPAD’s ratings came at 27.1 percent, while the ruling Saenuri Party recorded 43.9 percent.On Thursday, the NPAD leader had vowed to strengthen his grip on the party’s governance. Moon said he would oversee the committee recruiting candidates for the parliamentary race and that he would refer them to the party for transparent nominations. Moon also pledged he would hold accountable those who refuse to undergo the party’s review board for the nomination. As an example, Moon urged the party’s ethics committee to discipline Rep. Yoo Sung-yup and Hwang Ju-hong, who refused to participate in the review process.  The latest move has been to change the party’s name. With 73 percent of its members supporting the change, the party will gather public opinion about the new name from Dec. 7-14. The party will select the name through the votes of NPAD members and a public survey.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","the general election refuting moon ,april 13 general election moon ,elections third term lawmaker rep ,general election refuting moon dismissal ,march in protest against moon","['Ahn Cheol', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Moon ’s', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'NPAD', 'Chun Jung - bae', 'Moon ’s', 'Park Joo', 'Moon ’s', 'Moon', 'Ahn ’s', 'Moon', 'Ahn', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Ahn', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Moon ’s', 'NPAD', 'Moon ’s', 'Ahn Cheol', 'the National Assembly', 'YonhapMoon', 'Ahn ’s', 'Ahn ’s', 'NPAD', 'Moon ’s', 'Ahn ’s', 'Ahn ’s', 'NPAD', 'Moon', 'Ahn', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'NPAD', 'NPAD', 'Saenuri', 'realmeter', 'NPAD ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'NPAD', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Yoo Sung - yup', 'Hwang Ju - hong', 'NPAD', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",7,"[ 2.          0.          1.         ... -0.19012132  0.25978297

(Yonhap)The resignation of the seasoned scholar added to controversy swirling around the Park Geun-hye administration’s mission to establish a “correct” history lesson, which it vows to accomplish by retrieving school textbook rights from the private sector.The path toward government-controlled history lessons is still lined with obstacles, as polls indicate an increasing number of citizens opposing the need for the state textbooks. Gallup Korea said Friday that 36 percent of Korean adults supported the policy while 53 opposed it, versus 36 and 49 percent, respectively, last week.Here are five major points of dispute over the history textbooks.Supposed involvement of Cheong Wa DaeAlthough it was a sexual harassment scandal that ultimately brought down Choi, the 69-year-old had already been embroiled in controversy after a media interview in which he indicated the presidential office pressured him to support the contentious policy. He said Wednesday that Hyun Jung-taik, senior presidential secretary for policy coordination, called him to request that he attend Wednesday’s press conference by the National Institute of Korean History, where the state-run body named him as one of the authors. Choi added that he was a “shield” for the NIKH on the state textbook issue, and that the institute should thank him. Choi denied Thursday that the phone call had happened, then flip-flopped again later in the day to say he did receive a phone call but claimed that it was merely a conversation between old friends.Cheong Wa Dae did not officially comment on Choi’s remarks.Despite Choi’s efforts, the news fueled a fierce reaction from the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy who said that Cheong Wa Dae had been pulling the strings on the policy despite its insistence that the Education Ministry was in the driver’s seat.Last month, it alleged that the ministry had formed a secret textbook team off the books on direct orders from the presidential office. The government acknowledges the team’s existence, but denied it had any illegal nature.Transparency of the publication processDuring Wednesday’s press conference, the NIKH said that Choi and Shin Hyong-shik -- a professor emeritus of Ewha Womans University who specializes in ancient Korean history -- would be participating as two of six main authors of the textbook, and that some 36 writers would author the book. But the conference lacked details despite Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea’s pledge the day before that “all processes will be transparent.” NIKH chief Kim Jung-bae said the authors “should be allowed to feel relaxed (while working), at least until the copies are finished,” indicating that the NIKH may withhold the authors’ identities until they finish writing the books. National Institute of Korean History president Kim Jung-bae (right) reacts to a question during a press conference on the government’s plans for its history textbook publication at the government complex in Seoul on Wednesday. (Yonhap)The NIKH limited the number of questions from the local media for Kim to five and was seen attempting to stop Shin from answering a question directed at him. Hwang has so far pledged to unveil sections of the textbook online for public feedback while the book is being written.The NPAD has criticized the government for running “secretive operations.”But proponents of the state textbooks say that it should be the officials’ priority to ensure the authors’ safety, as they can be subject to public criticism for their participation. Upon news of Choi’s appointment as an author, malicious online rumors targeting him circulated on social media. Hwang vowed to respect the authors’ wishes to remain anonymous.Maintaining unbiased contentThe state-authored textbooks will strive to narrate a history that is not biased in favor of any side, the government has said. Their goal was further elaborated by their open criticism against the current books, which they claim favor leftist views.“We can no longer teach our precious children with distorted and biased textbooks,” Hwang said in Tuesday’s press conference.The conservatives have pointed to some textbooks’ descriptions that they say make it seem as if South and North Koreas share responsibility for the 1950-53 Korean War, citing parts that describe frequent border skirmishes that occurred in the buildup to the war.Hwang added that the textbooks say that the South Korean “government” was established and the North Korean “country” was founded in 1948, which students could perceive as meaning the North is superior.He pointed out that the majority of scholars with textbook writing experience repeatedly participate as authors, saying the homogenous pool makes state-issued textbooks inevitable. The ministry has said the current system has failed to work as the authors have challenged government requests to revise the content. Opponents of the state textbooks say that such claims are exaggerated.Rep. Do Jong-hwan of the NPAD rebuked Hwang’s argument regarding the Korean War, saying that current textbooks make it clear that the North invaded the South. He said that while individual authors carry out legal actions in cases of conflict, the publishers have revised the content as per government orders.With regard to the description of the South Korean “government” being established in 1948, Do said it was because the Constitution states that the current government succeeds the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea established in 1919, which is not the case in North Korea. Aug. 15, 1948, the day when South Korea’s first formal government was founded, is also at the center of a history textbook debate. All high school history textbooks say that the South Korean government, not South Korea, was established that day.The dispute stems from calls by conservative “New Right” scholars to set the date as “Korea Foundation Day.” It rose to the surface during the former Lee Myung-bak administration, but faced fierce opposition from organizations related to Korea’s independence movement that it denies legitimacy of the provisional government. The state-authored history textbooks of the 1980s and 1990s also specify that the government was established on that day. While the government-issued curriculum guidelines also say the “government” was established, the 2015 guidelines for the state history textbook have been changed to say that the course will deal with how “South Korea” was established. Progressive civic groups, historians and teachers opposing the policy say that the change aims to whitewash aspects of controversial political figures including Park Chung-hee, a former president of Korea and the incumbent leader’s father, who is criticized for his dictatorial rule in 1960s and 1970s.They say that establishing 1948 as the year of the country’s foundation will respectively reduce the descriptions of the independence movement during the Japanese colonial period and instead depict pro-Japanese figures as those that helped found the country.Rushed schedule The NIKH’s timeline gives roughly 14 months to complete the state textbook -- two of which will be spent on setting a concrete plan, recruiting authors and testing the book in classrooms.Yang Jung-hyun, a history professor at Pusan National University with experience of authoring a state-published textbook, pointed out that past publications took at least two or three years.The NIKH has vowed to appoint “the very best” experts in each field as authors, but the incident with Choi left a dent in its recruitment process. Rep. Jeong Jin-hoo of the minor Justice Party called it “an obvious result of an unprepared, rushed plan.” He pointed out that the Education Ministry revised the 2015 curriculum guidelines on Thursday, merely two months after confirming the curriculum in September.The revision was to ensure that state textbooks are distributed to classrooms by 2017. Alternative textbooksFourteen progressive education chiefs across the country who protest state textbooks have vowed to work on developing alternate history textbooks for use. Calling the government decision “regrettable,” Gangwon Education Superintendent Min Byung-hee said his office would develop education materials for students’ “balanced historical view of history.”The Education Ministry is mulling legal action against such movements.The Korean History Research Association, one of the nation’s biggest historical societies, said last week it would start discussing plans to author an alternate textbook. Korean law does not allow schools to substitute state-approved textbooks, but education chiefs can create supplementary textbooks.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","history textbooks resigned after allegations ,textbooks resigned after allegations surfaced ,issued history textbooks resigned after ,debate all high school history ,history textbooks resigned after","['Choi Mong - lyong', 'Seoul National University', 'Choi Mong - lyong', 'Yeouido', 'Gallup Korea', 'korean', 'Cheong', 'Choi', 'Hyun Jung - taik', 'the National Institute of korean History', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Cheong', 'Dae', 'Choi ’s', 'Choi ’s', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'the Education Ministry', 'NIKH', 'Choi', 'Shin Hyong - shik', 'Ewha Womans University', 'korean', 'Hwang Woo - yea ’s', 'nikh', 'Kim Jung - bae', 'NIKH', 'National Institute of korean History', 'Kim Jung - bae', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'Hwang', 'NPAD', 'Choi ’s', 'Hwang', 'North Koreas', 'Hwang', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'Jong - hwan', 'Hwang', 'south korean', 'the Provisional Government', 'the Republic of Korea', 'North Korea', 'South Korea ’s', 'south korean', 'South Korea', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Korea', 'South Korea', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Korea', 'japanese', 'pro - japanese', 'Yang Jung - hyun', 'Pusan National University', 'NIKH', 'Choi', 'Jeong Jin - hoo', 'Justice Party', 'the Education Ministry', 'Gangwon Education Superintendent Min Byung - hee', 'Education Ministry', 'the korean History Research Association', 'korean', 'Yoon Min - sik']",19,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.22347561  0.20229766

YonhapChong resigns 16 months after he assumed the post on July 17 last year following his predecessor Kang Byung-kyu, who stepped down to take responsibility for the sinking of the Sewol ferry that claimed 304 lives.While Chong did not specify whether he would run in next April’s general elections, his candidacy to run in his hometown Gyeongju was widely speculated on even as he was named to the ministerial post. The speculation peaked when Chong made a toast during an August gathering with ruling Saenuri Party members wishing them for an election victory. The opposition demanded Chong’s immediate resignation and filed an impeachment motion against him in September for violating the neutrality of public officials as a minister overseeing the country’s elections. “I will fulfill my responsibility without a hitch in the ministry’s work until a successor is named,” Chong said. While saying he does not have any “detailed plans,” Chong said he would “make a prudent decision after listening to public opinion,” in response to query whether he would throw his hat into the ring for the next National Assembly.“Even after I withdraw from my ministerial post, I am set on doing all that I can for the sake of the country’s development and the success of the Park Geun-hye government,” he said.Chong joins a host of other members of Cheong Wa Dae and the Cabinet who have resigned with a high possibility of running in the election.They include former Oceans and Fisheries Minister Yoo Ki-june, former Land and Transportation Minister Yoo Il-ho and Vice Transport Minister Yeo Hyung-koo. From Cheong Wa Dae, presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook and deputy head of the presidential security service Park Jong-joon. Two presidential advisers on politics -- Yoon Sang-hyun and Kim Jae-won -- also recently stepped down.In August, as his election law violation controversy escalated, Chong held a news conference and apologized for his toast, but refused to step down, instead vowing to ensure that his ministry would remain neutral in the elections. He denied he had plans to run for an assembly seat.Sources and news reports said President Park is likely to replace several more members of the Cabinet this week enabling them to join the parliamentary race.It is speculated that Deputy Prime Minister and Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea and Gender Equality Minister Kim Hee-jung -- both elected Saenuri Party lawmakers -- may seek another parliamentary term.Under South Korea’s election law, civil servants planning to join the legislature are required to resign from their posts at least 90 days before joining the race.By Yeo Jun-suk(jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","resign from his post sunday ,his election law violation controversy ,opposition demanded chong immediate resignation ,yonhapchong resigns 16 months after ,resignation and filed an impeachment","['Chong Jong - sup', 'Cabinet', 'Chong', 'Chong Jong - sup', 'Kang Byung - kyu', 'Chong', 'Gyeongju', 'Chong', 'Saenuri Party', 'Chong', 'Chong', 'Chong', 'National Assembly', 'Chong', 'Cheong', 'Cabinet', 'Oceans', 'Fisheries', 'Yoo Ki - june', 'Land and Transportation', 'Yoo Il - ho', 'Yeo Hyung - koo', 'Min Kyung - wook', 'Park Jong - joon', 'Yoon Sang - hyun', 'Kim Jae - won', 'Chong', 'Park', 'Cabinet', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'Gender', 'Kim Hee - jung', 'Saenuri Party', 'South Korea ’s']",18,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.42235607  0.59401834

The decision came after the party said it was considering enacting a law to ban the government’s move, and also filing suit with the Constitutional Court. NPAD chairman Moon Jae-in, however, said the party needs some time to review legal matters before bringing it to the top court. Since Tuesday, the opposition lawmakers have been refusing to attend the sessions, including the Assembly’s budget committee to review next year’s budget. The opposition, however, faced a dilemma as to whether to continue the boycott or not, as it faced backlash from the ruling party denouncing their parliamentary hold-up as an act of abandoning people’s livelihoods.Despite the NPAD’s boycott, the ruling Saenuri pushed ahead with the parliamentary review of next year’s budget Thursday.

The ruling Saenuri Party’s lawmakers unilaterally opened the Assembly’s budget committee to resume the 2016 review that had been stalled since the opposition boycotted the Assembly on Nov. 3. The law stipulates that the committee must finish the review by Nov. 30 and budget bill must be passed no later than Dec. 2. But lawmakers of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy refused to attend the session and continued their three-day boycott, though the party leadership appeared to be in a dilemma over the backlash to their parliamentary hold-up. Rival party`s whips, Rep. Lee Jong-kul of the NPAD(right) and Rep. Won Yu-chul of the Saenuri Party, met with the National Assembly Speaker Chung Eui-hwa to discuss plans to resume parlimentary sessions. Yonhap“I don’t think we can resolve (the textbook) issue overnight. We cannot afford to invest ourselves only in the textbook issue. We also have to revive the nation’s weak economy and improve people’s livelihoods,” said NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in. Moon also reiterated that the government rationale for rewriting history books is absurd, comparing it with an attempt to sympathize with North Korea. “The government’s argument that South Korea was founded on Aug. 15, 1948, is against the Constitution. It is nothing but an attempt to deny South Korea’s legitimacy and orthodoxy and sympathize with the North,” said Moon, pointing out that North Korea claims that it was founded in 1948.The NPAD asserted that South Korea was founded in 1945 because it is the only legitimate government that succeeded the Daehan Jeguk (1897-1910), the last empire of Korea, and the Korean provisional government during the 1910-1945 Japanese colonial era. Other minor opposition blocs, such as the Justice Party, agreed to the need for a fresh approach. Justice Party chairman Rep. Shim Sang-Jung asserted that the liberal blocs should come up with a new plan for the escalating textbook controversy.“We need to rebuild the coalition among opposition blocs,” Shim said in press conference Thursday. “The coalition should be expanded to address other issues, such as the ruling party’s attempt to push for labor reforms,” said Shim. In an attempt to sway the voters by emphasizing on public livelihood, the Saenuri Party urged the NPAD to bring the Assembly back on track.“Even though we are facing important issues related to people’s lives, the NPAD is walking away and derailing the parliamentary session. The NPAD is surely using this opportunity to overshadow its problems at home,” said Saenuri Party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung, referring to lingering factional feud at the rival camp.The Saenuri Party’s move followed the government’s official announcement Tuesday that it would reinstate state-authored textbooks for middle and high schools and that it had started gathering a panel of history experts to author them.The Saenuri lawmakers have demanded the NPAD stay away from the textbook issue and withdraw the parliamentary boycott, saying the NPAD should stop “politicizing” the education issue that is now relevant to policies of the administrative branch, not the legislative one.

NPAD lawmakers on Tuesday stage protest against the government`s final decison to adopt state-authored textbooks. (Yonhap)“(The government) ignored the overwhelming majority of the public and turned a deaf ear to the people’s plea. They have shut down fax machines since Monday afternoon and rejected oppositions’ messages,” said NPAD leader Rep. Moon Jae-in at the Assembly’s hall where fellow party members staged a sit-in. They were holding the parliamentary sit-in for the first time since the Sewol disaster that claimed hundreds of lives last April. They called the government’s reinstatement of state textbooks a “dictatorial” move. The NPAD lawmakers have yet to decide when to end their protest.Reluctant to hold talks with the Saenuri Party’s leadership -- an event that was scheduled for Wednesday to discuss the parliamentary impasse -- the NPAD pledged to continue its opposition, with such plans as filing a constitutional appeal and a campaign to gather signatures from those who oppose the policy.The Saenuri Party denounced the boycott and blamed the NPAD for derailing parliamentary proceedings. The ruling party demanded the rivals stick to the legislative schedule to pass pending draft bills and finish budget reviews. “Considering that the Assembly faces a busy and crucial moment, I feel it’s so regrettable that the NPAD boycotted the plenary session it had agreed to hold. I strongly urge the NPAD to let historians and other experts deal with the textbooks and return to its own legislative work,” said Saenuri Party whip Rep. Won Yoo-chul. Meanwhile, municipalities’ top educators were divided over the textbook controversy. A group of liberal superintendents, teachers unions and college professors publicly criticized the government for reintroducing state textbooks, while some conservative educators supported it. Kim Ji-cheol, the education chief of South Chungcheong Province, said in a statement Tuesday that he regretted that the government had pushed through the process in what he described as an attempt to undermine diversity in public education. Some branches of the Korean Teachers and Education Workers’ Union -- the nation’s biggest progressive teachers’ union -- issued a statement condemning the government’s move. About 100 professors from Gangwon National University announced their protest in a public statement.Conservative superintendents such as Daejeon’s education chief Seol Dong-ho, however, endorsed the government policy, saying that the municipality would follow the government’s decision if it decided to author the textbooks.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","lawmakers on tuesday stage protest ,on tuesday stage protest against ,tuesday stage protest against the ,tuesday stage protest against ,boycotted parliamentary sessions in protest","['New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Saenuri Party', 'the National Assembly', 'Assembly', 'NPAD', 'npad', 'NPAD', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Assembly', 'NPAD', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Assembly', 'NPAD', 'Saenuri Party', 'Won Yoo', 'Kim Ji - cheol', 'South Chungcheong Province', 'the Korean Teachers and Education Workers ’ Union', 'Gangwon National University', 'Daejeon ’s', 'Seol Dong - ho', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",1,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.48736078 -0.14822006

Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn and Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea will hold a briefing at Seoul Government Complex at 11 a.m. Tuesday, according to the Prime Minister’s Office, where the government will confirm the policy to revise the publication system for secondary history education. Education Ministry officials move boxes containing petitions gathered and sent by the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy opposing the government’s reinstatement of state-authored history textbooks in front of the ministry building in Sejong City on Monday. (Yonhap)The Education Ministry has been collecting public opinion on the issue for 20 days, under Korean law that stipulates that the government is to give notice in advance on policy changes or plans that could inconvenience the public. The abrupt change in schedule indicated that the ruling Saenuri Party and President Park Geun-hye are seeking to make official the much-disputed policy, which has been at the center of a political and social standoff.Rep. Kim Jung-hoon of the Saenuri Party’s policy committee urged the ministry on Monday to “finish confirmation as soon as possible to end political and ideological confusion, and focus on creating the correct history textbook.”The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, whic has strongly opposed the state textbook policy, said it would launch a sit-in protest from Monday evening and boycott the plenary session at the National Assembly Tuesday in light of the news.Rival parties and the public have been split over the government’s resolve to implement what it called a “correct history textbook,” and some of its tactics in pushing the plan.Last Sunday, the NPAD raised suspicion that the ministry was running a secret team on direct orders from the presidential office. The ministry acknowledged the existence of such a team, but said there was nothing illegal in its nature.Three NPAD lawmakers visited the ministry complex around 2 p.m. to hand over a petition against the state textbook and asked why Minister Hwang Woo-yea had turned down their request for a meeting, pointing out that his official schedule remained empty for the day. The ministry’s school policy office head Kim Dong-won, who accepted the petition on Hwang’s behalf, said Hwang was attending a personal appointment. The lawmakers also echoed an allegation made by a local media outlet last week that the ministry’s team tasked with collecting public opinion was deliberately ignoring calls. “(The ministry) could not be reached via fax nor phone, and it ignored the parliament’s demand to receive suggestions online,” said Rep. Do Jong-hwan of the NPAD.He also said that over 1 million people have signed a petition against the state textbooks, some 400,000 of which were delivered to the ministry. “(The ministry) should think about why so many people are against the idea. If it pushes ahead, even more people will protest, which I worry will cripple the education system in general,” he said. The Saenuri Party, on the other hand, delivered a written opinion welcoming the state textbook policy. Both the government and the ruling party had maintained that the content of current textbooks ― authored by eight private publishers ― are biased in favor of the leftists and is “self-depreciative” of Korean history.“(The textbooks) derogate the efforts of the former generation, who worked to write the proud history of Korea. ... The narrow-minded view of history makes children think that ‘our country is full of problems’,” the party said.The news of confirmation came a little over an hour after Kim Dong-won promised the lawmakers that all petitions will be carefully considered before the ministry reaches a decision, fueling criticism from the opposition that the government gathering public opinion was merely a formality.The government has also asked regional education offices to punish the teachers who denounced the state textbook policy. Korean law states that civil workers ― which include teachers ― cannot take politically motivated action. Local Kyunghyang Shinmun claimed Monday that the ministry had contacted college chiefs to get them to support the policy. The ministry denied the allegations. NPAD Rep. Bae Jae-jung, meanwhile, pointed out that the ministry has already spent 2.2 billion won ($1,930) on promoting the state textbook policy, which is about twice its annual PR budget.The latest poll results of by Gallup Korea ― announced last week ― showed that 49 percent of Korean adults were against the policy and 36 percent supported it. The rest remained unsure.It also showed that the president’s approval and disapproval ratings were both at 44 percent, and the biggest reason for disapproval ― 31 percent ― was the state textbook.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","tuesday prompting flurry of protests ,issued history textbooks from thursday ,pr budget the latest poll ,sit in protest from monday ,at the national assembly tuesday","['Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Education', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'Seoul Government Complex', 'Education Ministry', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Sejong City', 'yonhap)the Education Ministry', 'korean', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun', 'Kim Jung - hoon', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'the National Assembly', 'NPAD', 'NPAD', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'Kim Dong - won', 'Hwang', 'Jong - hwan', 'NPAD.He', 'the Saenuri Party', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Kim Dong - won', 'korean', 'Kyunghyang Shinmun', 'Bae Jae - jung', 'Gallup Korea', 'korean', 'Yoon Min - sik']",10,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.52504438  0.43017444

We should not be left suffering (like this),” said Rep. Lee during a meeting with NPAD lawmakers.The remarks came amid intensifying political and ideological standoff intensifying after a head-on collision between Park and Moon at a rare meeting at Cheong Wa Dae.On Thursday afternoon, Moon urged her to scrap the plan but the president refused to do so, saying that it was aimed at ensuring the “correct” recognition of Korean history for future generations. She also expressed regret over the opposition leader’s allegations that her efforts had become increasingly politicized.With NPAD vowing to resist her drive, the president is also expected to make a public appeal on the plan during her budget speech at the National Assembly next week. Though the issue remains controversial, the opposition party is expected to face a bumpy road ahead with its resistance to Park’s drive as the legislature holds no power to stop the plan. The government can implement the plan by revising enforcement ordinances.The opposition party has been adamantly opposing her drive to issue the state-designated history textbooks that could be used to whitewash pro-Japan activities during the colonial era and the military dictatorships decades ago. The Park administration, meanwhile, has been pushing for the plan, stressing the need to provide a balanced view of history through a single set of history books authored by government-designated writers.Meanwhile, Lee Byung-ki, Park’s Chief of Staff, denied allegations that Cheong Wa Dae put pressure on the Education Ministry over history textbooks.“I heard that there as a government-ruling party consultation meeting (on textbooks) but Cheong Wa Dae has never issued a guideline to the ministry,” Lee told lawmakers at a parliamentary audit session on Friday.“I know it was the Education Ministry that made a final decision to publish state-authored textbooks after collecting the opinion of people from all walks of life.” By Cho Chung-un(christory@heraldcorp.com)","plan threatening to boycott president ,authored history textbooks on friday ,threatening to boycott president park ,plan during her budget speech ,threatening to boycott president","['Park Geun', 'Park', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Saenuri', 'the National Assembly', 'Saenuri', 'Lee', 'NPAD', 'Park', 'Moon', 'Cheong Wa Dae', 'Moon', 'korean', 'NPAD', 'the National Assembly', 'Park', 'Lee Byung - ki', 'Park ’s', 'the Education Ministry', 'Lee', 'the Education Ministry']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.21315452  0.31311131

While the annual parliamentary audit was completed last week, the Steering Committee along with those on intelligence and gender equality are holding sessions separately as they are composed of lawmakers belonging to other committees as well.Kang on Tuesday had claimed that the previous presidential race was rigged, suggesting ballot manipulation and authorities’ interference. The remarks were lambasted by Cheong Wa Dae and the ruling Saenuri Party. The NPAD reportedly frowned upon Kang for deviating attention away from its full-fledged fight against the government’s state-authored history textbook.“The party believes (Kang’s) allegation was not commonsensical or able to garner public support,” said NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in. But he added that there are lingering questions surrounding the election, and that the Supreme Court should seal the controversy by making an overdue ruling on a lawsuit filed by activists raising such allegations.The Saenuri Party, meanwhile, demanded that Kang be expelled from the NPAD and have his lawmaker status rescinded.From news reports","main opposition party thursday removed ,party thursday removed its rep ,opposition party thursday removed its ,opposition party thursday removed ,the main opposition party thursday","['Kang Dong - win', 'the National Assembly ’s', 'House Steering Committee', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy ’s', 'Lee Choon', 'Kang ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'the National Assembly', 'NPAD', 'Kang Dong - win', 'YonhapLee', 'Cheong', 'the Steering Committee', 'Kang', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kang', 'NPAD', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the Supreme Court', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Kang']",1,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.67677391  0.33502591

Moon Jae-in, former President Roh Moo-hyun and the progressives.Taking aim at the chairman of Foundation for Broadcast Culture Ko Young-joo’s repeated description of Moon as a “communist,” the New Politics Alliance for Democracy lawmakers urged him to step down as he had lost the political neutrality required to oversee MBC, of which the FBC is the largest stakeholder.Accusing Ko of being President Park Geun-hye’s personal choice for the post, the NPAD demanded Park should apologize for appointing what it called a “McCarthy-like” figure.“Ko defamed the main opposition party and the National Assembly. It is beyond the people’s tolerance,” NPAD whip Rep. Lee Jong-gul said. “Ko’s extreme rightist position can’t be compatible with overseeing a major broadcasting company.”“We don’t think Ko is alone. It appears that President Park selected him while being aware of his slanted views. Does the president agree with Ko’s view? Does the president believe that she can run the nation without his resignation?” Lee charged.The accusation reflected escalating ideological tit-for-tat between rival parties in the run-up to the 2016 general elections. While the ruling Saenuri Party turned up the heat in its attempt to revise what they see as “left leaning” history text books, the NPAD hit back at Ko’s “extreme rightist” remarks. In 2013, months after Moon was defeated by Park in the 2012 presidential election, Ko said that it would have been a matter of time before Korea became a communist country if Moon had been elected. The remarks were brought back to spotlight during the annual parliamentary audit last Friday.“When looking at the recent developments, one cannot help but doubt the identity of President Park,” said Supreme Council member Rep. Joo Seung-yong during the party’s emergency meeting convened to discuss Ko. “(Park) will be met with resistance from the people and the opposition unless she sacks him.”Despite the strong pushback from NPAD lawmakers, Ko refused to withdraw his position during the audit, and rather, told lawmakers that he is “confident” that Moon is a communist, along with the late President Roh Moo-hyun, whom he described as a “transformed” communist. The former prosecutor had confronted Roh, then a lawyer, in the 1980s during his investigation into allegations against student activists accused of attempting to overthrow the government, otherwise known as the “Burim Case.” The students were convicted but were retroactively declared innocent of the charges in 2014.After finishing his career as a prosecutor, Ko claimed that he was subjected to political retribution during Roh’s presidency (2003-2008). He dismissed the court’s acquittal decision as being left-leaning, alleging that North Korea had attempted to infiltrate Pyongyang sympathizers into South Korea’s judicial system. Before being appointed as the chief of FBC in August, he was chairman of the Committee for Restoration of National Normalcy, a conservative civic group, which published documents in 2008 that classified some NPAD lawmakers as North Korean sympathizers. Despite the NPAD’s calls for him to resign, the head of Korea Communications Commission, who appointed Ko and other board directors, denied that it had the authority to sack him, and argued that Ko would perform his duty. “We understand that Kim’s remark leans toward (a particular perspective), but we think Ko is capable of doing his job as a board member,” said KCC chairman Choi Sung-joon.Other NPAD lawmakers such as Rep. Song ho-chang raised fresh allegations that Ko had violated the law that bans illegal solicitation of public officials. Song claimed that Ko took a case related to his job at government agencies while he was a public official. Ko strongly denied the allegations. Meanwhile, the ruling Saenuri Party Leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung criticized Ko for making “problematic” remarks during the parliamentary audit. But he downplayed the possibility of his dismissal, saying that he had yet to consider the option.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","defamed the main opposition party ,wednesday demanded the resignation of ,pushback from npad lawmakers ,resign the head of korea ,main opposition party on wednesday","['Korea', 'MBC', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Foundation for Broadcast Culture Ko Young - joo ’s', 'Moon', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'MBC', 'Ko', 'Park Geun', 'Park', 'the National Assembly', 'NPAD', 'Lee Jong - gul', 'Ko', 'Ko', 'Park', 'Ko', 'Lee', 'Saenuri Party', 'Ko', 'Moon', 'Park', 'Ko', 'Korea', 'communist', 'Moon', 'Supreme Council', 'Joo Seung - yong', 'Ko', 'NPAD', 'Ko', 'Moon', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Roh', 'Ko', 'Roh ’s', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'South Korea ’s', 'the Committee for Restoration of National Normalcy', 'NPAD', 'north korean', 'Korea Communications Commission', 'Ko', 'Ko', 'Kim ’s', 'Ko', 'KCC', 'Choi Sung - joon', 'NPAD', 'Song', 'Ko', 'Song', 'Ko', 'Ko', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Ko', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",1,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.62300646  0.44560242

Suh Chung-won, a key loyalist to the president, collided with embattled party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung on Monday, highlighting the escalating factional tug-of-war over who will take control of the party’s nominations for next year’s general election. Taking aim at Kim’s remarks during a media interview, the seven-term lawmaker accused the party chair of seeking to sway public opinion to turn candidate nominations in his favor and of unilaterally attempting to determine the nomination process without prior discussion with party members. Saenuri Party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung (left) listens as Rep. Sun Chung-won, member of the Supreme Council, criticizes him over the nomination deal at the party’s meeting on Monday. (Yonhap)Kim had said in the newspaper interview that he would pursue a different form of strategic nomination -- a process in which party leadership strategically nominated disabled and female candidates -- as well as nominating high-profile candidates for constituencies that the party is traditionally weak in. It was considered a step back for Kim who had openly shut out the possibility of a full-fledged strategic nomination, considered to benefit party members loyal to President Park Geun-hye. Suh and other Park loyalists denied they were seeking such a strategic nomination, lambasting Kim for toying with nomination processes unilaterally.“I will not tolerate an individual trying to sway (the party) the way he wants,” Suh said, also referring to Kim’s surprise agreement with the main opposition party leader Rep. Moon Jae-in over the adoption of a survey-like nomination procedure for elections. Kim shot back by saying that Suh should make such remarks at a closed-door meeting.“It is a shame that my request for distinguishing between public remarks and private comments was denied. We should stop (the fighting) in front of the people,” said Kim.The verbal fight resulted in a failure of establishing an independent panel within the Saenuri Party to determine the nomination rules. The party had decided to seek alternatives that the party had hoped to provide a breakthrough to the stalemate between Kim and pro-Park faction.The confrontation came amid a partisan stalemate over the reallocating the electoral districts for the 2015 general elections. While rival parties agreed to find ways on Monday to maintain the number of lawmakers elected from constituencies in rural areas, both parties failed to come up with specific measures to address the partisan differences over the rezoning scheme.The Saenuri Party has insisted that the National Assembly increase the number of lawmakers elected from constituencies and cut the portion of proportional representation while the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy has argued that more lawmakers should be elected through the proportional representation system. On the sideline of the intensifying in-house scuffle at the Saenuri Party, the main opposition leader Rep. Moon Jae-in urged President Park to withdraw her membership from the ruling party, ramping up his calls for the president to stay away from parliamentary discussion over nominating candidates for next year’s general elections. His remark followed his recent accusation against Park’s objection to the party leaders’ agreement on nomination rules as regressing democracy. He had described Park’s move as “dictatorial attempt” to undermine the democratic rule of separation of power. “I urge President Park to leave the Saenuri Party and focus on improving the people’s livelihood,” Moon was quoted as saying by NPAD spokesman Rep. Kim Yung-rok. “Park’s desire for post-presidency power should not distract our efforts to reform nomination procedure for elections,” said Kim. The Saenuri Party, for its part, dismissed Moon’s call. “We cannot tolerate the opposition party’s comments on Park,” said the Saenuri Party spokesman Rep. Kim Young-woo, calling it “incomprehensible” and “laughable.”By Yeo Jun-suk (jasoneyeo@heraldcorp.com)","president collided with embattled party ,the party meeting on monday ,lawmaker accused the party chair ,monday highlighting the escalating factional ,loyalist to the president collided","['Saenuri Party', 'Suh Chung - won', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'Kim ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Sun Chung - won', 'the Supreme Council', 'yonhap)kim', 'Kim', 'Park Geun', 'Park', 'Kim', 'Suh', 'Kim', 'Moon Jae -', 'Kim', 'Suh', 'Kim', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Kim', 'pro - park', 'the Saenuri Party', 'the National Assembly', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Park ’s', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Moon', 'NPAD', 'Kim Yung - rok', 'Park', 'Kim', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Moon', 'Park', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Young', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",13,"[ 0.          0.          3.         ... -0.73203433  0.2884081

He was also grilled over a golf trip he took shortly after a North Korean land mine injured two South Korean troops in August.Controversy has been brewing after the 61-year-old Army general was found to have described former President Park Chung-hee’s 1961 coup as a “military revolution” in his master’s thesis in 2001. Facing a relay of demands by opposition lawmakers for a clear explanation, Lee simply responded that it was “inappropriate to display a personal opinion” and that he had a “firm belief in political neutrality.” As the lawmakers called for a recess in protest against his repeated refusal to give an answer, Rep. Chung Doo-un of the ruling Saenuri Party who chairs the National Assembly’s defense committee adjourned the morning session early.  Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman designate Lee Sun-jin (right) reviews documents during a parliamentary hearing at the National Assembly on Monday.

The former chief of the Army’s 2nd Operations Command became the JCS chairman designate last month as the first-ever Army Academy graduate. If he secures parliamentary endorsement and then presidential approval, he will succeed Adm. Choi Yoon-hee, whose two-year stint has come to an end. Lee also apologized for playing golf only days after two Army staff sergeants were critically wounded in a mine blast while patrolling the southern part of the heavily fortified demilitarized zone in Paju, Gyeonggi Province.His golf trip coincided with the JCS’ unveiling that the mines were deliberately planted by North Korean troops who had crossed the border. In his defense, the general said he did not know about the findings at the time but his comment rather fueled criticism, given heightened tension that brought the two Koreas to the brink of an armed clash. “Even though I was not aware of the situation, I admit that it was not thoughtful for a commander to play golf,” Lee said. Should North Korea attack a border island again, the JCS will retaliate against its origin with additional weaponry including warplanes, Lee said. “A strike on the origin involving fighters can be extra,” he said, when Saenuri Rep. Yoo Seung-min pointed out that the South only mobilized K-9 self-propelled howitzers during Pyongyang’s shelling on Yeonpyeongdo Island in 2010 which killed two civilians and more than a dozen soldiers. “As the JCS chairman, I will instruct joint forces to hit the target.” On Pyongyang’s nuclear capability, he said it is estimated to have a stockpile of highly enriched uranium and been working on miniaturizing its atomic devices, but the scale of the warhead arsenal or any of their deployment remains unconfirmed. Lee also reiterated that it will be “helpful” for the U.S. Forces Korea to station advanced missile defense assets on the peninsula but South Korea has currently no plan to adopt them.“The decision on any stationing will be made based on our own needs and national interests,” he added.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","fire during parliamentary hearing monday ,controversial views on former presidents ,monday as lawmakers questioned his ,korean troops in august controversy ,also apologized for playing golf","['Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'Lee Sun - jin', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'Army', 'Park Chung - hee ’s', 'Lee', 'Chung Doo - un', 'Saenuri Party', 'the National Assembly ’s', 'Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'Lee Sun - jin', 'the National Assembly', 'yonhap)lee', 'the Supreme Court', 'Chun Doo - hwan', 'Army', '2nd Operations Command', 'JCS', 'Army Academy', 'Choi Yoon - hee', 'Lee', 'Army', 'Paju', 'Gyeonggi Province', ""JCS '"", 'north korean', 'Koreas', 'Lee', 'North Korea', 'JCS', 'Lee', 'Saenuri', 'Yoo Seung - min', 'k-9', 'Pyongyang', 'Yeonpyeongdo Island', 'JCS', 'Pyongyang', 'Lee', 'the U.S. Forces Korea', 'South Korea', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",11,[0.         1.         1.         ... 0.06570838 0.13768506 0.37533033]

Moon Jae-in on Friday accused President Park Geun-hye of attempting to hold on to her influence by having her followers elected in next year’s general election in response to the ruling camp’s nomination rule row.“It is a dictatorial way of thinking for (President Park) who wants to maintain her power and secure her post-presidency position by getting her close confidants nominated for (a general election).” Moon said of Cheong Wa Dae’s open opposition to the rival party leaders’ agreement earlier this week on a new nomination procedure for April’s parliamentary vote.“Cheong Wa Dae’s attempt to interfere with the nomination issue is an act that denies autonomy and responsibility of party politics,” he said at the New Politics Alliance for Democracy meeting, calling for his embattled counterpart to stick to his guns.Saenuri Party Chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung(left) and the NPAD Chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in. YonhapMoon’s remark came amid an escalating tit-for-tat between Cheong Wa Dae and the ruling Saenuri Party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung.The scuffle peaked on Thursday as Cheong Wa Dae publicly denounced Kim’s move and the ruling party leader subsequently denied the accusation. Kim even boycotted party meetings and public events where he was scheduled to attend alongside Park.Mindful of the party being plunged into disarray, Kim and the presidential office agreed to stop the blame game later Thursday evening. On Friday, the Saenuri Party lawmakers decided to form a special body to discuss how to nominate candidates for next year’s general elections. “We are going back to square one,” said the Saenuri Party whip Rep. Won Yoo-chul, “We should nominate excellent candidates who will perform well (at the upcoming elections). There will be no preconditions. We will address this matter in accordance with democratic rules and party’s regulation,” said Won. While predicting that the NPAD would benefit from the standoff between the President and the ruling Party, experts warned that the NPAD should be cautious as the Saenuri Party would eventually heal the wounds despite the president office’s “unprecedented” interference in the political party’s affairs. “Things are turning out better for Moon as his case for democracy is very strong,” said Yoon Pyung-joong, a political philosophy professor at Hanshin University. “But given the fact that the president enjoys much higher approval ratings than the NPAD, the impact of Moon’s appeal could be offset,” said Yoon.   “True, Park did violate democratic rules ... but Kim and Park would avert the worst case scenario as both needed each other’s supports. Park needs Kim who has a robust support base in his constituency. Kim, for his part, knows that he will never be able to run for president without Park’s support.”Chairman Kim, meanwhile, continued to challenge the Park loyalists, saying that there will be no “strategic nomination” as written in the party Constitution and rules.“Strategic nomination is a wrongful system. I will no longer discuss it,” Kim told reporters while attending an event. Political parties have often resorted to unilaterally nominating key figures to competitive constituencies.

Jeong Jin-hoo of the minor opposition Justice Party, claiming that the notion of cutting costs for the kindergartens was glossed over by education offices across the country as a result.Jeong also pointed out that the average fee for an English kindergarten was 751,000 won ($630) per month this year, an 8.5 percent climb from 692,000 won in 2013. Only 9 percent of the kindergartens cut fees while 33.2 percent had raised them. The average monthly income for a Korean household in the second quarter of this year was 4.27 million won, according to Statistics Korea. Seoul had the priciest English kindergartens at 1.01 million won, while institutes in the city of Gwangju saw the most drastic increase of 20.3 percent, from 219,000 to 263,500 won.“The ministry promptly announced it would reduce costs for English kindergartens, and they did practically nothing. They should at least try to implement the policy they’ve announced,” said Jeong. The rise in private education spending, particularly for children before they start compulsory education, has been causing concern in Korea. While the government has boasted that private spending dropped for the fifth straight year in 2014 to 18.2 trillion won, the amount of money spent per student had actually increased for the second consecutive year.According to the Korea Institute of Child Care and Education, last year’s private education spending for children below the age of compulsory schooling jumped 22.2 percent to mark 3.2 trillion won. Woo Cheon-shik, an official from the Korea Development Institute recently announced that the actual amount of money spent on private education may be much larger than the ministry’s estimate.“Our analysis of the figures from Statistics Korea indicate that the annual private education spending is 32.9 trillion won, and is trending up,” he said in a seminar cohosted by the Finance Ministry’s Committee for the Mid/Long-term Strategy and the presidential National Economic Advisory Council.Woo warned that the bloating private education costs can widen the already considerable disparity between haves and have-nots in terms of money they spend on education. The top 10 percent of income earners in Korea spend on average 16 times more money on their children’s private education than the bottom 10 percent, according to local civic group A World Without Worries About Private Education. With parents spending more on their children’s education, Korea has seen a surge in the “edu-poor” in recent years, which refers to those who have become poor due to their children’s education costs.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","kindergartens cut fees while 33 ,an opposition lawmaker said thursday ,private education an opposition lawmaker ,of the kindergartens cut fees ,suppress the billowing tuition for","['south korean', 'the Education Ministry', 'Jeong Jin - hoo', 'Justice Party', 'Jeong', 'korean', 'Statistics Korea', 'Seoul', '’ve', 'Jeong', 'Korea', 'the Korea Institute of Child Care and Education', 'Woo Cheon - shik', 'the Korea Development Institute', 'Statistics Korea', 'the Finance Ministry ’s Committee', 'Korea', 'a world without worry about Private Education', 'Korea']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.70270437  0.41251671

They claimed the government was singling out some liberal-leaning artists to deny them support from the nation’s largest funding agency, a move that Rep. Lee Jong-kul, floor leader of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, cast as a “return to anti-democracy.”  “The Park Geun-hye administration has tightened its grip on the arts and culture. I warn against its attempt to return to the era where democratic values were banned and denied. We will do whatever it takes to uphold the right to freedom of speech and improve the culture industry,” Lee said Tuesday.Rep. Lee Jong-kul. YonhapHis remark followed the NPAD lawmakers’ revelation during the parliamentary inspection into government agencies. Rep. Do Jong-hwan of the NPAD charged that Arts Council Korea manipulated the funding list to exclude those critical of the government, such as directors Lee Yun-taek and Park Geun-hyeong. Lee’s play titled “A Time to Offer Flowers,” was excluded from the list, though his play was awarded the top score in the evaluation process. Lee had supported Rep. Moon Jae-in in the 2012 presidential campaign. Park, whose play had a scene where actors mock President Park’s policy, failed to bring his play to the final list in first place. Park had said in a media interview that his political satire led to his project’s outright withdrawal from the list. As the scandal over censorship escalates, artists have held press conferences to denounce what they called “politically motivated” interference in cultural affairs and called for the government to stop censoring art products. “Freedom of speech is one of the greatest achievements from the past democratic movement. We have fought against the dictatorship really hard to achieve these goals. We believe censorship is the government’s attempt to control the public and undermine democratic values,” an association of advocacy groups for artists said in a press conference. But Arts Council Korea denied the allegation, saying that the agency had never considered political factors in determining the list for funding. In a statement, the agency said that they had simply laid out individual views about Park’s plays and that Lee’s work was excluded from the list as he had frequently received financial support from the agency before.Critics said the controversy well reflects the transition period of Korea’s democracy that still falls behind advanced nations, but downplayed the NPAD attempt to associate the government’s move with steps taken during the dictatorship, as they have different motives.“Fundamentally, a democratic government has the duty to endorse civil society. Korea is still struggling with this issue. The trend nowadays in advanced nations is to minimize the interference of the administration. It would be problematic if the level of (government) interference continues to rise,” Lee Taek-gwang, a professor of cultural studies at Kyung Hee University.“But it is different from what we witnessed during dictatorship. Back then, the government engaged in censorship under the logic of national security. As the overall society democratizes, the government also becomes one of the interest groups. Rather than making a direct interference, it is more so that the government is acting on behalf of its interests. The case for dictatorship is more of political rhetoric,” said Lee.By Yeo Jun-suk (Jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","government to stop censoring art ,main opposition party on tuesday ,actors mock president park policy ,government to stop censoring ,the government to stop censoring","['Lee Jong - kul', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Lee', 'Lee Jong - kul', 'yonhaphis', 'NPAD', 'Jong - hwan', 'NPAD', 'Arts Council Korea', 'Lee Yun - taek', 'Park Geun - hyeong', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Arts Council Korea', 'Park ’s', 'Korea', 'NPAD', 'Korea', 'Lee Taek - gwang', 'Kyung Hee University', 'Lee', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46805915  0.2544933

Moon Jae-in on Monday withdrew a self-imposed vote of confidence, pledging to conduct sweeping reforms to reunite the party mired in intensifying factional clashes.Moon’s much-anticipated decision, which followed Sunday’s endorsement by mainstreamers, was seen to put a sour end to weeks of raucous infighting prompted by his press conference on Sept. 9 to stake his leadership on the New Politics Alliance for Democracy’s reform measures. Moon Jae-in (Yonhap)While praised by Moon and his followers, his renewed approbation was shunned or discounted by some key party figures and potential rivals, including former party whip Rep. Park Jie-won and former cochairmen Kim Han-gil and Ahn Cheol-soo.Moon said he respected the decision made by a group of lawmakers and key members of the party to support him and urged the party to take the agreement as a chance to put an end to the factional feud and start afresh. On Sunday, the NPAD’s executive committee had agreed to proclaim confidence in the chairman without a vote and demanded Moon’s dissenters stop questioning his leadership. “I will withdraw my plan and humbly accept the loyalty (sworn by the party members). I will fulfill my responsibility to reform and reunite the party,” Moon said in a statement.“I will also make efforts for the unity of the progressive blocs to win the general elections.” Going forward, Moon is expected to speed up his efforts to dissolve factional feuds and seek ways to improve transparency in the party’s nomination rules in a dire attempt to restore the voters’ trust ahead of the general elections in April next year.However, Moon’s decision, as well as the agreement reached by the mainstreamers, were slammed by some 20 members of the nonmainstream factions, who called the recent development a political show and a half-baked show of confidence.Ahn, in particular, has been seeking to generate fresh momentum with supporters by hitting out at Moon and proposing alternative ways to reform the party. Rep. Chun Jung-bae, an NPAD-turned-independent lawmaker, also said on Sunday that he plans to launch a new party by January, saying that there is no future for the NPAD.Moon, for his part, defended his decision and leadership.On Ahn’s criticism about the party leadership showing double standards against corruption involving heavyweight figures, Moon countered by saying that the case of former Prime Minister Han Myung-sook, imprisoned for bribery, was a “clear case of a politically unfair” ruling, while speaking in a radio interview.The chairman also expressed his displeasure with Rep. Chun’s plan of launching a new party, defining it as an attempt to divide the party that goes against the voters’ sentiment in the South Jeolla Province region, where the party holds a strong sway.Chun lashed out at a news conference Sunday, saying he hoped Moon would “mind his own business” in response to the chairman’s request for him to rejoin the NPAD.

(Yonhap)None of the major or minor parties have so far managed to set the agenda in their checking of the administration, instead being sidetracked by internal struggles ahead of next year’s general election.A slight chance of a redemption fizzled out as their superficial questions against high-profile witnesses such as Lotte Group chairman Shin Dong-bin simply highlighted the need to overhaul the outdated audit system and practices.Meanwhile, Cheong Wa Dae has been reveling in its newfound momentum, as President Park Geun-hye, with approval ratings back above 50 percent, pushes ahead with her reform initiatives.Buoyed by what the government trumpeted as the “successful management” of the North Korean situation upon the Aug. 25 agreement and her attendance at China’s Sept. 3 military parade, it indeed seemed no other political power was close to keeping the administration in check.While the ruling Saenuri Party churns out nothing but praise for Park’s policies, the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy remains too preoccupied with in-house battles to seriously criticize her initiatives. Observers said the dynamics between Park and the Assembly had shifted in favor of the administration, as it had more ability than the legislative branch to take initiative in state affairs.“There should be a healthy tension between the administration and the National Assembly,” said Lee Jung-hee, political professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. “Political parties sometimes need to unite and speak out against the government, but recently, there has been no such move.” The legislative absence was reflected in Park’s relentless push to reform the labor market, an issue that rival parties struggled to take the initiative on. The Saenuri Party, which has been cautious, even reluctant to protest against the president, especially since the July carnage that eventually resulted in “defiant” party whip Rep. Yoo Seung-min resigning, after Park threatened to veto an agreement he had landed with the NPAD. The Saenuri Party wasted no time in endorsing her labor reforms. The NPAD, for its part, struggled to address the president’s drive as the party is still mired in factional infighting over the party’s governance, structure and the fate of its leader Rep. Moon Jae-in. Professor Lee said the dysfunction in the legislative branch stemmed from lawmakers’ lack of policymaking expertise. Lawmakers’ ability to analyze policy and draft relevant bills is behind that of the ministries and other government branches.“If you compare the bill drafted by the executive branch to one drafted by the legislators, you will notice that the latter is inferior in terms of the depth of research and relevance to the issue,” he said. According to research by the Citizens Coalition for Economic Justice, a Seoul-based civic group, most bills, particularly those from prolific lawmakers, were found to be almost identical, churned out under different names, or contained similar provisions to those of the existing laws. The lawmakers’ lack of expertise is best shown during the ongoing parliamentary inquiry into government agencies. During the sessions, some of those who were eager to showcase their policy expertise were subjected to public ridicule for asking off-topic questions. Rep. You Dae-woon of the NPAD, for instance, came under attack for demanding the nation’s police chief to “demonstrate” how to shoot a gun before lawmakers in his questioning about gun accidents.Critics attributed their below-standard performance to the lopsided characteristics of Korea’s political parties, which have an overabundance of high-profile political heavyweights and an insufficient system to support rank-and-file lawmakers’ legislation. “Compared to the United States, where each congressman has about 20 to 50 aides, Korean lawmakers are only allowed to have a maximum of six aides. The number of policy researchers in the Assembly is only one-tenth of that of the U.S,” said Yoon Seung-yi of Kyung Hee University.The systematic fallout stems from the fact that even the established lawmakers have a hard time holding on to their seats in the Assembly and consequently the parliamentary committees. With more than half of the incumbent lawmakers losing their seats during each election, those currently in office frequently change from one committee to another depending on vacancies. Preferences also play a major part in fickle rotation of committee compositions as popular ones are often allotted to high-profile members as rewards.Such a frequent turnover among lawmakers prevents them from accumulating knowledge to address issues that are only getting more diverse and complex these days, political watchers say. Some critics half-jokingly label the Assembly as an organization for “amateurs” or “interns.” The dysfunctional parliament, the pundits said, will persist unless changes are made to the unique culture of Korea’s political system that centers on the prominence of party heavyweights, not rank-and-file lawmakers’ political expertise in legislative affairs.“Since Korea’s political parties’ depend upon the prominence of party heavyweights, the best strategy for lawmakers who want to raise their profile is to impress the top-brass in parties, not to develop political expertise,” said Yoon.The origin of major political parties traces back to the history of Korea’s politics. While the era of Three Kims ― former Presidents Kim Dae-jung and Kim Young-sam and retired heavyweight Kim Jong-pil ―- has ended after they dominated Korean politics for more than a decade since the 1980s, the tendency lives on as parties often depend on and revere a political leader.In 2008, there was even a party named “pro-Park (Geun-hye) association” in the midst of the nomination battle within the Grand National Party, a precursor to the Saenuri Party.This long-running phenomenon has led to undermining public trust toward the parliament, as the voters view the parties as a proxy organization campaigning under an eventual presidential candidate, rather than an entity formed by like-minded legislators.According to a report from Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, only 17.4 percent of surveyed voters said they trusted the National Assembly, which was about 20 percent lower than their sentiments toward the executive branch. Of all public organizations, it ranked the lowest in public trust.Experts predicted that Park would maintain her dominance over the National Assembly until next April’s general election because the ruling Saenuri Party leadership will refuse to oppose her as she is just more than halfway through her five-year presidency. “I am pretty sure that President Park will hold on to her dominance … because those who seek future power dare not resist those who are currently in power,” said Shin Yul, political professor at Myongji University.

Moon Jae-in, chairman of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, held a meeting with key members of the party in the afternoon. At the meeting, Moon said he would think about withdrawing the vote as lawmakers including Rep. Park Byeong-seung urged him to find another way to seek the unity of the party, such as holding a joint meeting of NPAD lawmakers and other key party members.Moon promised the lawmakers that he would keep an eye on their proposal to see if it would be as effective as performing the vote, said Choi Jae-sung, general affairs manager at NPAD.The chairman, however, decided to adhere to his initial plan as the party’s floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul remained uncooperative about conducting the vote, believing his attitude was a clear expression of him wanting Moon to step down. “The floor leader who was also in the meeting said he doesn’t know what to do with the vote and he has no authority to convene legislators for that,” said Choi.“This was an attempt to sideline Moon’s plan of doing the vote.”In a surprising announcement last week, Moon said he would have his chairmanship tested -- widely seen as an attempt to consolidate his leadership and silence objection from nonmainstream members of the party. The vote of confidence is scheduled to take place next week before the Chuseok holiday that falls from Sept. 26 to 29.

According to Rep. Baek Kun-ki of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, a Korean weapons brokerage based in the U.S., was involved in the Defense Acquisition Program Administration’s 2012 bid to adopt new AW-159 Wildcat helicopters in breach of the agency’s revised guidelines of 2010 ― which ban the participation of agents in a procurement project worth $2 million or higher. The chopper contract was valued at 589 billion won ($503.2 million).In its defense, the Seoul-based DAPA said the company only served as a “consultant,” not a broker directly involved in the deal. But in related documents submitted by the agency for a parliamentary audit, it was specified as a “trade agent,” Baek refuted. “The company can hardly evade questions about its suspected brokering activity given that it took part in a briefing session on the helicopter purchase in January 2012 as a trade agent,” he said. “It is unacceptable that DAPA broke its own rules to facilitate the broker’s participation by simply changing its position as a consultant.” The allegation emerged as a pangovernmental team consisting of prosecutors, state auditors, police and tax officials are looking into alleged malpractices by the country’s major defense brokers who have held sway over high-profile state procurement deals. The helicopter bid was at the center of its probe, with at least seven Navy executives indicted for forging the Wildcat’s test certificates to meet the qualifications. Former Patriots and Veterans Affairs Minister Kim Yang was also arrested in late June on charges of taking some 1.4 billion won in bribes from its U.K. manufacturer Agusta Westland. “With our defense industry lacking competitive edge, the back-scratching alliances between military and industry officials make the essential problem,” NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in said, calling for the nurturing of small- and midsize firms to consolidate the fundamentals. DAPA Minister Chang Myoung-jin conceded, saying there is a “possibility for corruption originated from personal connections” and vowing to continue to implement steps to stamp out irregularities and take greater care of major programs on his own. During the session, opposition lawmakers also launched a salvo on the rampant supply of faulty equipment in the military. After analyzing data by the Defense Agency for Technology and Quality, NPAD Rep. Kim Kwang-jin said that 103 out of 110 life jackets distributed in 2012 to the sailors of the 7,600-ton Aegis-equipped destroyer Seoae Ryu Seong-ryong failed to pass the quality test due to defects in their buoyant materials. NPAD Rep. Ahn Gyu-baek raised criticism for a perceived lax management of night vision goggles, saying Seoul’s current regulations do not stipulate any lifespan for quality assurance and thus the tools may foil soldiers’ night operations if used for too long.

Han Jeong-ae of the NPAD. Yonhap“Chong violated the law especially considering the fact that he holds the position that oversees the elections,” the party said.But the party decided to reserve the impeachment on Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan who made similar comments in favor of the Saenuri Party during the same dinner. Choi refused to apologize for his remark. A source said that any move against Choi would be decided later by taking the parliamentary audit procedure into consideration.The rival parties are gearing up for parliamentary elections next April.As the controversy escalated, Chong held a news conference last month and apologized for his toast but refused to step down, instead vowing to ensure that his ministry would remain neutral in elections.The ruling Saenuri Party, meanwhile, rebuked the NPAD’s move, calling it an excessive political offensive.The party said that because only incumbent ruling party members were present at the dinner, Chong’s toast had no political motivation.Under relevant laws, the National Assembly can initiate an impeachment motion against a Cabinet minister if one-third of the lawmakers endorses it. Over half of the 298-member Assembly must vote for the motion to be referred to the Constitutional Court.

39,39,Mothers lash out at day care service changes,"The South Korean government’s plan to charge households with full-time housewives for the currently free day care service should they utilize it for more than seven hours daily is stirring controversy nationwide, with some critics calling it misogynistic and discriminatory. 　“The government is discriminating against full-time housewives by doing this,” said Rep. Nam In-soon of the main opposition New Politics All...","The South Korean government’s plan to charge households with full-time housewives for the currently free day care service should they utilize it for more than seven hours daily is stirring controversy nationwide, with some critics calling it misogynistic and discriminatory. “The government is discriminating against full-time housewives by doing this,” said Rep. Nam In-soon of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy. “Every mother, regardless of their employment status, should be able to access the public child care service for free.”Since 2013, the Welfare Ministry has offered a child care allowance for all parents with young children up to the age of 2 years. The parents currently have two options. They can either send their child to a state-run day care center for free, or opt to receive an allowance ranging from 100,000 won ($85) to 200,000 won monthly, according to the age of the child, and raise them at home on their own.Currently, all state-run day care centers offer services that are up to 12 hours daily, and the service is worth 780,000 won a month for 11-month-olds, 540,000 won for 1-year-olds and 410,000 won for 2-year-olds.  Upon the government`s revision, public day care service will only be free for seven hours daily for households with full-time housewives starting from July next year.(Yonhap)As the monthly child care allowance of 200,000 won is worth much less than the exempted day care cost of 780,000 won, the proportion of parents -- regardless of the mothers’ employment status -- who opt to send their children to centers instead of receiving the allowance increased significantly from 2011 to 2014, from 28.6 percent to 35.4 percent. According to the Welfare Ministry, this has made it difficult for double-income households, who are in desperate need of all-day day care service, but who can’t find their child a spot due to the service’s high popularity. As of 2012, public day care centers accounted for only 5.2 percent of all day care facilities in the country, according to the Korea Institute for Child Care and Education. Meanwhile, there are more than 5 million double-income households in Korea, accounting for 43 percent of all households in the country as of 2013. “Why is it full-time housewives’ fault that working mothers can‘t send their children to day care?” said one housewife online. “Is it wrong when a housewife catches up with her friends and enjoys coffee for a few hours while having her child at a day care? The government is indirectly and unjustly blaming housewives by revising the current system. The ones who should be blamed are policy makers and public servants who failed to serve all parents who are struggling with child care regardless of their employment status.”Upon the revision, public day care service will only be free for seven hours daily for households with full-time housewives starting from July next year. Single-parent households, households with three or more children, households with a person with disabilities and households with a mother who is seeking employment will be exempted from paying extra even if the mother is a full-time housewife. The revision, however, triggered fierce opposition from full-time housewives nationwide, who claim that they are often unjustly blamed and even criticized for sending their children to day care while not having to work and staying at home. Many of them online claimed they are often left with their baby alone all day at home, without any support from their working husbands and extended families, which leads to social isolation and even depression.The country’s misogynist online communities, including Ilbe, have infamously referred to full-time housewives who opt to send their children to day care or hire help with their husbands’ income as “Mom-chung,” meaning “mom bugs,” for not “fulfilling their responsibilities as mothers” while being financially dependent on their spouses. “It’s not like I didn’t want to work,” said a 31-year-old full-time housewife who wanted to remain anonymous. “It was this double, lose-lose situation. I would feel guilty and stressed while enduring long work hours and having my child raised by someone else, or lose my job and be a full-time mother. And being a full-time mother with limited support often isolates you from social life. This is why we need day care service too.”Overseas studies have long shown that personal stress influences a parent’s behavior toward their children. Parents who are experiencing severe child care-related stress or having marriage stress have a higher chance of abusing -- or neglecting -- their children, according to a 1991 study by Michigan State University.The social isolation of a parent due to having to raise a child alone has also been linked to child abuse and neglect, according to a 2002 report by the World Health Organization.In Korea, the number of child abuse cases increased by 44 percent last year from 2013, with 80 percent of the abusers being parents.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","housewives fault that working mothers ,housewives for the currently free ,double income households in korea ,discriminating against full time housewives ,full time housewives fault that","['south korean', 'Nam', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'the Welfare Ministry', 'the Welfare Ministry', 'the Korea Institute for Child Care and Education', 'Korea', 'Ilbe', 'Michigan State University', 'the World Health Organization', 'Korea', 'Claire Lee']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29818931  0.12485337

The prosecutors did not file an appeal.  The revelation prompted the main opposition New Political Alliance for Democracy lawmakers to claim the judiciary branch was unjustly lenient toward the leader of the ruling party.The Supreme Court’s punishment standard stipulates that the sentence for habitual abuse of drugs should range from four years to nine years and six months.They also raised questions over the prosecutors seeking below-standard prison terms and not filing an appeal.Rep. Kim Moo-sung of the ruling Saenuri Party. Yonhap“I can’t buy the prosecutors’ argument that they followed the punishment standards in seeking the sentence,” said NPAD lawmaker Rep. Lim Nae-hyun, who has served as a prosecutor in drug-related cases. “The prosecutors didn’t even file an appeal when (the defendant’s) accomplice was jailed without suspension,” said Lim.Faced with NPAD lawmakers’ flurry of criticism, Minister of the Justice Kim Hyun-woong came forward to refute the allegation, saying the prosecutors’ appeal would be filed only when the court’s sentenced term is less than half of what the prosecutors sought. The court that handled the case also shunned the NPAD claims. Seoul Eastern District Court said in a statement that the court’s punishment standard is not legally binding and the below-standard sentence is often handed down if the violators purchased drugs for personal use, not for distribution. Kim, for his part, denied the allegation that he was involved in the court’s decision and claimed he had not known the situation until after the verdict.“I don’t think I have ever seen a judge who is more lenient toward politicians’ families.

Kim Moo-sung, who has been unleashing remarks daily targeting Naver and Daum Kakao. The Saenuri Party has been asserting that the Internet portals, which it describes as “de facto mainstream media outlets,” have intentionally painted a negative picture of the ruling party and violated the principle of media neutrality in political affairs. “We need to discuss ways to ensure the fairness and objectivity of portal news,” Kim said. “I believe the portals are virtually news media as they are able to change headlines.”Rep. Kim Moo-sung of the ruling Saenuri Party. YonhapHe also took issue with the portals’ “lenient” regulations by acknowledging one-man news groups as media, which he said enabled them to use their news reports as bait to pull in visitors and attract advertisements from businesses. The party has demanded the chiefs of the two companies face questioning during the parliamentary audit session that opened Thursday.The Saenuri Party’s think tank, the Youido Institute, backed the party’s argument, with its big data analysis of the news reports carried by the two portals. The findings suggested that the reports highlighted by the portals are more hostile toward the ruling party and the government.The NPAD, has rebuked the Saenuri Party, accusing it of putting pressure on the major portals in the run-up to next year’s general elections.The NPAD dismissed the Youido Institute study as biased and manipulated, and denounced the party for seeking to strongarm the portals to create favorable public opinion toward the government and the ruling party. “The people are aware that (Kim’s) intimidation against the portals stems from his personal and political greed ahead of the general and presidential elections,” said NPAD lawmaker Choi Min-hee during a party meeting Thursday.“I would like to ask him whether he is aware of the RUBICS system (Real-time User Behavior-based Interactive Content recommender System) and the technology used by the portals to operate? Rep. Kim is basically fighting with the IT system.”The NPAD spokesman Kim Yung-rok said that the Saenuri Party had constantly raised the issue before the elections because the portals had significant influence over the voters, particularly those in their 20s and 30s.The portals have become Korea’s most influential news providers, especially for young voters, as they use the Internet as the most frequent medium to access the news produced by traditional news outlets such as newspapers, radio and television, as well as Internet news groups.Rather than clicking on individual media websites, the users often click onto the portals, which aggregate the headlines of registered media groups on their main or news page. They also provide rankings of most searched words and news reports.According to a survey by the Korea Press Foundation, the Internet was the most frequent access point for news. In a one-week analysis over the method respondents used to keep up with the news, nearly all, or 99.6 percent of those in their 20s and 98 percent of those in their 30s said they used the Internet. The number was bigger than that of newspapers (17.6 percent of 20-somethings and 22 percent of 30-somethings) and television (86 and 92.8 percent).The portals, for their part, rushed to respond to the escalating debate. Naver said it would hold an editorial advisory board meeting to review the institute’s findings and discuss measures to address the issue. Daum denied the accusation that they univocally changed headlines. The Internal giant said in a statement that they did not change the headlines arbitrarily unless they needed to quickly adjust the number of characters to fit the site’s layout.Experts were also split on the issue, with some stressing the freedom of the press and others highlighting neutrality.“Under a democracy, a media outlet’s major role is its criticism of the government and the ruling party,” said Kang Sang-Hyun, a journalism professor at Yonsei University. “Media outlets can criticize the policies they oppose and praise the policies they approve of,” Kang. “If the users find reports interesting, they will top the most-favored list. If not, people wouldn’t read them. This is how the current media landscape works. Bringing in the portals’ CEOs and yelling at them is absurd and wrong. I am afraid the move is similar to what dictatorships would do,” Kang said.Shin Sung-ho, journalism professor at Sungkyunkwan University, gave a different point of view.“Most people access news through portals, which are basically operating as media. It is only right that (the portals) therefore take due responsibility and face regulations as a media,” he said.“While news is also cultural content, (the portals) are making it appear like it is free … this is a unique phenomenon only seen in Korea. There is a need to fix this,” Shin added.(jaonsyeo@heraldcorp.com)","internet portals are politically biased ,democracy has slammed the ruling ,slammed the ruling party attack ,portals ceos and yelling at ,mudslinging between the rival parties","['Saenuri Party ’s', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Naver', 'Daum Kakao', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Kim', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Saenuri Party', 'YonhapHe', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'the Youido Institute', 'the Saenuri Party', 'NPAD', 'Youido Institute', 'NPAD', 'Choi Min - hee', 'Interactive Content', 'Kim', 'Kim Yung - rok', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Korea', 'the Korea Press Foundation', 'internal', 'Kang Sang - Hyun', 'Yonsei University', 'Kang', 'Kang', 'Shin Sung - ho', 'Sungkyunkwan University', 'Korea']",10,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.62495154  0.76101404

Moon Jae-in proposed a vote of confidence in his leadership in line with the fate of the controversial reform measures, and urged the party to end factional infighting. He called for the unity of the party in order to win the general election next year and the presidential election in 2017.“If the reform proposal fails to pass, I will step down from the post of chairman,” he said.“But if (the council) approves the proposal and renews confidence in my leadership, let us put an end to controversy over my position.”NPAD chairman Moon Jae-in speaks at a press conference in Seoul on Wednesday. YonhapMoon’s abrupt decision came as he came under growing pressure to resign from members of the party who remain skeptical of the reform proposals.The proposals call for an electoral committee of nonparty members to nominate candidates for the next parliamentary elections in April. The panel also suggested offering extra points to fresh figures, women and the handicapped in the nomination process. Earlier in the day, a subcommittee at the New Politics Alliance for Democracy passed the proposal, but it has to get a final endorsement from the party’s executive council. The council plans to put the proposal to vote next Wednesday.Moon putting his leadership on the line was seen as his last resort to put a break to intensifying factional feuds between pro-Roh Moo-hyun members, regarded as mainstreamers in the party, and nonmainstream members. “Recent cases of (party members) publicly attempting to shake the party and divide the party have just crossed the line,” he said, without mentioning names. “To save the party, tighten discipline and build principle, it is inevitable to call for a vote of confidence in my leadership.”The surprise press conference was also held a few hours after Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, a former joint party leader, met party defector Chun Jung-bae to discuss the future of the opposition party. Chun, who recently won a parliamentary seat in a by-election as an independent candidate, has reportedly asked Ahn to join a new party he plans to launch.  Ahn on Sunday lashed out at the NPAD reform committee, saying its attempt to reform the party had failed and that he has different views from Rep. Moon.Ahn, a software mogul-turned-politician, urged the reform committee to overhaul the party in a way to break away from what he described as “outdated” liberal values that resonate little with the general public.Meanwhile, some observers say that Moon was making a calculated move as the party’s executive council is very likely to pass the proposal. More than 60 percent of the council belong to his faction, said Hwang Tae-soon, a political commentator on a cable TV show.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","party to end factional infighting ,opposition party leader said wednesday ,resign in an emergency press ,next parliamentary elections in april ,proposal to vote next wednesday","['Moon Jae - in', 'Moon Jae -', 'Seoul', 'YonhapMoon', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Moon', 'pro - roh Moo - hyun', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Chun Jung - bae', 'Chun', 'Ahn', 'NPAD', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Hwang Tae - soon', 'Cho Chung - un']",1,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.66746515 -0.14440979

43,43,Ahn urges NPAD to make ‘real changes’,"　Former presidential candidate and member of the main opposition Rep.

Ahn Cheol-soo on Sunday called for sweeping changes to keep the party afloat amid faltering public support against its vapid reform moves.Ahn, a software mogul-turned-politican, urged the NPAD reform committee to overhaul the party in a way to break away from what he described as “outdated” liberal values that he said resonate little with the general public. The former cochairman of the NPAD suggested that addressing burgeoning corruption scandal is the key to bringing the voters’ attention back to the party that has been reeling from the defeat in the latest by-election at the hands of the ruling Saenuri Party. Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo of the main opposition NPAD. Yonhap“The party has been peppered with a lack of moral discipline and exclusive leadership. ... Even though calls for addressing such issues are mounting, we are not allowed to speak out by those who stick to conventional wisdom and enjoy vested interest,” Ahn said at a press conference at the National Assembly.  “Publicizing the issues will be the first step in the right direction to overhaul the party. Breaking away from old-fashioned liberals and addressing the party’s corruption should be at the core of our efforts to rebuild the opposition party,” Ahn added.  Ahn upping the pressure on NPAD leader Rep. Moon Jae-in and reform committee chairman Kim Sang-kon and painting them as being out of touch on reform issues was largely seen as an attempt to widen his clout within the party. Moon and Kim, for their part, rebuked Ahn’s remark as being “unconstructive.”Kim said he would not tolerate any attempt to undermine the party’s unity and incite infighting in the party to gain political advantages. Moon echoed Kim’s remarks, saying, “Those who sit in an important position should join efforts in the party reform.” He urged party members to restrain from “shaking” the party and come up with a plan to steer the party in the right direction instead.The tit-for-tat reflected the party’s fractional conflicts that trace back to the origin of the reform committee. The NPAD has launched the reform committee to overhaul the party leadership that has embroiled in factional infightings between mainstream and nonmainstream lawmakers. Ahn, who had vied against Moon during the presidential race in 2012 before eventually giving his support, is classified as a nonmainstream member who has often questioned Moon’s leadership.   Designed to unify the party’s divided organization, the reform committee has rolled out a total of nine proposals to reorganize the party, including ways to overhaul the party’s nomination system for elections. According to the plan, 20 percent of incumbent lawmakers who are deemed unfit would not be nominated.  With the latest proposal aiming to deal with the party’s leadership structure, the committee’s reform initiative has faced criticism that they have failed to garner public attention it had expected in the first place. Making matters worse, a number of NPAD heavyweights have recently been involved in corruption scandals, which have overshadowed the committee’s newly published reform plan. Han Myeong-sook, a former prime minister and NPAD member, was sentenced to two years in jail for receiving illicit political funds. By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","to overhaul the party breaking ,addressing the party corruption ,party afloat amid faltering public ,overhaul the party breaking ,to overhaul the party nomination","['Ahn Cheol', 'NPAD', 'Saenuri Party', 'Ahn Cheol', 'NPAD', 'the National Assembly', 'Ahn', 'NPAD', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Kim Sang - kon', 'Moon', 'Kim', 'Ahn ’s', 'Moon', 'Kim ’s', 'Moon', 'Moon ’s', 'NPAD', 'Han Myeong - sook', 'NPAD', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",9,"[ 2.          0.          1.         ... -0.45741785  0.02849403

The construction plan calls for a 3.5-kilometer long cable car system to be built at the southern region of Mount Seorak in Yangyang County, about 215 kilometers east of Seoul, setting up a means of convenient transportation all the way up to the peak of the Osaek area hiking course. The ministry, however, said it gave its approval under the condition that Yangyang County add supplementary plans that further address environmental and safety issues to its initial construction plan. The approval will be finalized once Environment Minister Yoon Seong-kyu gives the go-ahead. The cable car project has been a controversial issue among environmentalists here, who have argued that the mountain's natural environment must be preserved. Likewise, it has taken Yangyang County several years to have its plan passed. The county government had submitted its cable car construction plan in 2012 and in 2013, but was rejected both times due to issues that the structure's design could pose a threat to the habitat of some of the wildlife in the area. Advocates, on the other hand, say that the cable car will help to boost tourism and thereby add to the economic development of the region, especially ahead of the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, located just south of the county. Construction is to begin next year until October 2017. The cable car will have its trial run for about three months starting in November 2017 before its official operation starts in 2018.

Moon Jae-in on Wednesday urged the government to broaden the scope of reunions for separated families following the two Koreas’ agreement to resume the event.The New Politics Alliance for Democracy chairman said during a party meeting that the reunion list should include more than 1,000 members of separated families, as more of them are passing away without having the opportunity to see their loved ones. His proposal came a day after the two Koreas’ agreement to defuse the latest cross-border military tensions and improve inter-Korean relations. Both sides agreed to push for the reunion to coincide with Chuseok, the national thanksgiving holiday, and hold working-level talks beforehand.NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in. (Yonhap)“Now is the time for us to implement what South and North Korea agreed upon,” said Moon. “First, we should hold the reunion on a massive scale. Half of those who applied for the reunion have already passed away.”The reunions have been held sporadically, with last year’s event on Mount Geumgangsan being the first in four years.Applicants in their 70s account for about 80 percent of the separated, which means at least 6,600 people should meet every year to see their loved ones within their lifetime, Moon said. He urged the government to reach a deal with the North to include at least 1,000 people in the upcoming reunion list.The proposal came as part of Moon’s four initiatives, which included calls for the government to resume inter-Korea business, expand civilian exchanges and honor former inter-Korean agreements from the former Roh Moo-hyun and Kim Dae-jung administrations. Moon has been shifting his policy platform to national security and foreign affairs in recent weeks as he seeks to reinforce his wavering leadership and his party’s low approval ratings.On the same day, Moon met with the U.S. and Chinese ambassadors to Korea, Mark Lippert and Qiu Guohong, to discuss ways to improve inter-Korea relations and address North Korea’s nuclear ambitions. “The task we must address to normalize relations with the North is how to solve North Korea’s nuclear development. I believe that prompt resumption of six-party talks is the most viable option. I’d like to ask China to play a crucial role in resuming the talks,” NPAD spokesman Rep. Kim Sung-soo quoted Moon as saying.The Chinese ambassador was also quoted as saying that he echoed Moon’s call and highlighted collective efforts to achieve denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula. Qiu reportedly said Chinese senior officials would discuss the issue during Moon’s scheduled visit to China in mid-October.  Moon announced Tuesday he would visit China to attend the International Conference of Asian Political Parties, a regional meeting between lawmakers in Asia and senior Chinese officials.

Chung, an orthopedics doctor who had served as a head of Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, testified before lawmakers at a National Assembly hearing that telemedicine would expand medical services to those living in remote areas and benefit the nation’s public health care system. “Telemedicine is a useful tool for public health service and the medical industry’s globalization. Combined with information technology and medical experts, it would give those living in remote areas access to quality medical services,” said Chung. His appointment is not subject to lawmakers’ approval.  Chung Chin-Youb, the nominee for the minister of Health and Welfare.

They labeled the introduction of telemedicine as a move to privatize the health care service. Faced with these claims, Chung said he opposed health care privatization and that it did not fit with Korea’s public health care system, which he described as “a model system for the rest of the world.”  Chung would fill the post of Moon Hyung-pyo, who was heavily criticized for his handling of Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak last June.

The remarks came during a trial of the former secretary -- on charges of leaking official secrets and violating the presidential records management law.  President Park Geun-hye (Yonhap)Cho further argued that although he was acting on Kim’s orders, the presidential office put the blame on him for gathering and writing false facts and leaking confidential files to his benefit. Kim has denied the allegations.The leaked presidential documents took center stage late last year after the confidential reports were exposed to the public. The documents suggested that Chung Yoon-hoi, Park’s former aide, colluded with presidential aides and meddled in state affairs by forming a secret group. Chung was Park’s chief of staff when she entered politics in the late 1990s.Cho also reportedly testified in court that he had delivered memos to the president’s younger brother Park Ji-man to warn him when it was deemed he was meeting people with ill intentions. “I verbally warned Park Ji-man and his wife not to meet people who approached him with bad intentions, but he did not listen. So I gave him a memo that carried brief profiles of those people and their reputations,” he said. Cho also said that his direct boss, the former senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, also knew about the memo, which was later identified as part of the leaked confidential information.Cho’s claims contradicted the prosecution’s conclusion earlier this year that he was behind the fabrication of the documents and delivered them to Park’s brother.Prosecutors said in an interim report in January that Cho, while serving at the presidential office in 2013 and early 2014, ordered Park Gwan-cheon, the police officer who worked for him, to deliver 17 presidential documents to the president’s brother.

During Hyun’s six-year tenure, ridiculed as “lost years” by his opponents for compromising the agency’s political correctness and independence, the watchdog’s international reputation suffered a setback.

Lee Sung-ho, nominee for chiarman of the National Human Rights Commission. (Yonhap)“It is pretty obvious that Lee might be yet another version of Hyun who acted as a puppet of Cheong Wa Dae,” said NPAD floor leader Lee Jong-kul. “Despite the ICC’s repeated request for transparent nomination for the post, Lee’s selection was neither widely discussed nor transparent,” said Rep. Lee. NPAD lawmakers also questioned the former judge for his lack of experience in human rights and his past court decisions that were deemed offensive to sexual minorities while he served as a judge in 2013. According to reports, Lee had asked a defendant, who had applied for a gender change, to submit photos of sexual organs to verify his request although the photos are not mandatory under court regulations. His predecessor, Hyun, was also heavily criticized for making scores of controversial remarks including “Does sexual discrimination still exist in this country?” and “Korea has turned multicultural ... what with ‘(derogatory term for African-Americans)’ living amongst us.”Lawmakers also pointed to the agency’s lack of efforts to embrace diversity and transparency of its composition, or “Paris Principle,” a minimum standard which human rights agencies should meet to be considered credible, and more importantly, to be rated A grade.Mindful of mounting criticism of the agency, Lee vowed to secure A-grade status and push for revising relevant laws to ensure the agency’s diversity and transparency, if confirmed. He also pledged to compensate for his lack of experience in human rights by reaching out to minority groups.“If confirmed, I will try to hear the voices of the marginalized and underprivileged.

Rep. Park Ki-choon of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy is suspected of receiving illegal political funds worth 350 million won ($299,000) and valuables such as luxury watches and bags from the head of a distribution agency, only known by his surname Kim, prosecutors said.
  
The Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office suspects that the three-term lawmaker helped Kim's business in exchange for the money and valuables.
  
Park's detention is subject to parliamentary consent as sitting lawmakers in South Korea are immune from arrest while the National Assembly is in session. 
  
The Ministry of Justice will submit a motion to arrest the lawmaker, with the approval of President Park Geun-hye, to the National Assembly.
  
The motion must be reported at the earliest plenary meeting and the National Assembly speaker must put the matter to a vote within 72 hours, after waiting a day. The motion is carried if half of the sitting members are present and half of those are in favor.
  
If the motion is passed, only then will a district court hold a hearing to decide whether to issue an arrest warrant for Park. 
  
Prosecutors allege that the 59-year-old Park's key positions on the parliamentary Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs Committee, where legislation on the construction industry is dealt with, during the 18th and the current 19th National Assembly, put him in a favorable position to help Kim.

Kim Hyun-sook of the ruling Saenuri Party, an economics professor-turned-politician.“Nominee Chung is the right person to strengthen the nation’s public medical sector, and to bring stability to public health as he holds a deep understanding and insights on Korea’s overall medical sector through his 25 years’ service at Seoul National University Hospital,” said presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook.The new senior secretary has also demonstrated her expertise in the fields of welfare and women policies while serving as a research fellow at Korea Institute of Public Finance, and teaching at Soongsil University in Seoul, Min said.Park’s nomination of a medical professor for the nation’s top post in charge of health and welfare came amid persistent public distrust due to the government’s bungled initial response to MERS. Last week, the country declared a de facto end to the outbreak that killed 36.Calls had been mounting for Park to apologize and to replace incumbent Moon, a former scholar on pension system, saying he lacked leadership while dealing with the virus spread. The government has been under fire for concealing information of MERS-infected patients and the hospitals where they were admitted and treated. The health ministry had rejected calls to disclose names of MERS-hit hospitals, stressing that it would paralyze the nation’s medical sector. Authorities later revealed the names and routes patients traveled. But its belated revelation sparked public anger, with many blaming the government’s slow response for aggravating the spread of the disease.Min also said that the president will deliver a public address on Thursday to present her vision on state affairs.It was not immediately known whether Park will apologize to the public for the government’s slow initial response.Cheong Wa Dae had admitted last month that the government’s response to the outbreak was “insufficient,” but no official apology has been made so far.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","tuesday afternoon sacked health minister ,afternoon sacked health minister moon ,on tuesday afternoon sacked health ,afternoon sacked health minister ,hye on tuesday afternoon sacked","['Park Geun - hye', 'Health', 'Moon Hyung - pyo', 'Chung Chin - youb', 'Chung', 'Seoul National University Hospital', 'Chung Chin - youb', 'Kim Hyun - sook', 'Saenuri Party', 'Chung', 'Korea', 'Seoul National University Hospital', 'Min Kyung - wook', 'Korea Institute of Public Finance', 'Soongsil University', 'Seoul', 'Park', 'Moon', 'Park', 'Dae', 'Cho Chung - un']",18,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.541767    0.55308783

Samsung C&T; had initially demanded the military pay about 36 billion won to cover the costs of laborers and construction equipment that had been put on stand-by during the construction delay.The DAPA official said it is also planning to use its right to indemnity, asking the protesters to reimburse the compensation.If completed as scheduled by the end of this year, the 1 trillion won project will allow South Korea a launching point from which to send naval vessels into southern waters, the key trade route for the country.A Navy official said protesters are preparing a major rally near the construction site for Aug. 3, when their demonstration marks the 3,000th day since launching.

The court ruled in favor of the law, saying the rule was necessary to prevent “distortion of information” and ensure “fairness” in elections. Of the panel of nine judges, five voted in favor of the law, while four deemed it as unconstitutional.  (Yonhap)Under the current Public Official Election Act, news websites have been required to authenticate Internet users’ identity before enabling them to post comments and videos either advocating or opposing certain candidates and parties on their forums during an election campaign.  Those violating the law face a fine of up to 10 million won ($8,600). The court said in the verdict that false rumors and propaganda on news websites can rapidly and widely hamper fairness of elections, given the credibility of media outlets.It also added that the law does not violate press freedom or people’s right to express political opinions, considering that writers’ personal information remain withheld after news sites check their identities. But four judges against the regulation said the public’s right to free speech should be guaranteed at most especially during election campaigns to promote “fairness” of elections. They argued that the real-name verification rule is in place for the sake of the authorities to more efficiently investigate election-related crimes, treating citizens as “potential criminals.”With the ruling, Internet users will still be required to verify their identities with their names and resident registration numbers to make political remarks on news websites during campaigning periods.Rep. Yoo Seung-hee, a head of the free speech committee in the opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, called the court’s decision as “retreat in liberal democracy.” “The real-name verification law has been politically abused to discriminate against opposition party candidates and their supporters,” he said in a statement right after the ruling. South Korea ranks 60th among 180 countries in the press freedom index by Reporters Without Borders. Another global indicator by media watchdog Freedom House rated Korea as “partly free” to free speech.The real-name verification law, introduced in 2007, was applied to websites with more than 100,000 visitors a day. The court ruled the so-called “Internet real-name system” stipulated in the information and communications network law unconstitutional in 2012, saying that the system had undermined freedom of speech.Under the elections law, however, the regulation remained intact for campaign periods.Following the 2012 ruling, the government came under growing pressure to change the law to uphold the Constitutional Court’s decision, with the National Election Commission asking the National Assembly to amend the relevant laws.Later in the year, Rep. Jin Sun-mi of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy presented a revised election law, but the amendment has not yet been made.Daum Communications, then the nation’s second-biggest search engine, which provided news on its website, filed a constitutional appeal in 2013 after the authorities imposed a financial penalty on the firm for allowing netizens to make political comments without checking their identification. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","posting political comments on internet ,thursday ruled constitutional an election ,criminals with the ruling internet ,political comments on internet forums ,political remarks on news websites","['South Korea ’s', 'Constitutional Court', 'Yoo Seung - hee', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'South Korea', 'Freedom House', 'Korea', 'the Constitutional Court ’s', 'the National Election Commission', 'the National Assembly', 'Jin Sun - mi', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Daum Communications', 'netizen']",11,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.29657146  0.21059188

Kim Moo-sung said many young Koreans are frustrated because there are not enough jobs in the market, and his party has been working to loosen the nation’s rigid labor market. Saenuri Party chairman Kim Moo-sung speaks at Columbia University in New York on Thursday. (Yonhap)“I plan to make utmost efforts to help many young people find quality jobs through labor reforms to ensure they have a better future,” he said.“Unlike the flexible labor market in the U.S., South Korea’s job market is very rigid. That is why we find it difficult to create more jobs for young people, and they are suffering from low wages.” Trying not to miss a cue, the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy chairman also underscored his labor polices, saying that reforms must be conducted in a way that the “pains of the laborer” are shared by businesses and the government.The remarks came at a time when rival parties are at loggerheads over the labor reform plans which are aimed at providing greater flexibility and tackling a divide between regular workers and nonregular workers. Labor groups have been opposing the reforms saying they could induce massive layoffs.The ruling party hopes to pass the reform bill during the regular session scheduled for September.The main opposition party, however, appears to be seeking to slow down the Saenuri Party’s momentum in an attempt to highlight the conflicting issues over the reform plans among different interest groups before general election campaigns kick off next year.NPAD chief Rep. Moon Jae-in said his party would seek a broader negotiation platform, consisting of various stakeholders, to better reflect demands from the nation’s two labor umbrella groups. The idea, however, collides with the Saenuri Party’s plan to start a bipartisan negotiation by resuming a stalled tripartite meeting between the government, labor and business.The labor market overhaul is one of the reform measures in President Park Geun-hye’s three-year economic revitalization plan. She and her party argue that labor reform is key to reviving the sluggish economy, improving the business environment for investments and eventually creating more decent jobs.The labor groups have opposed the move, claiming it is intended to force regular workers out and replace them with nonregular workers, which would lower the overall quality of jobs.The NPAD has also played down the reforms, alleging they were drafted in favor of the corporate sector.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","party chairman vowed on thursday ,young koreans are frustrated because ,loggerheads over the labor reform ,thursday to push for sweeping ,labor reforms in south korea","['Saenuri Party', 'South Korea', 'Columbia University', 'New York', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Koreans', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Columbia University', 'New York', 'U.S.', 'South Korea ’s', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'NPAD', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'Park Geun - hye ’s', 'Cho Chung - un']",1,"[ 0.          1.          2.         ... -0.42528126  0.27455476

Kim Young-woo said, urging NPAD Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo to retrieve the bill of indictment. Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, who heads the NPAD’s committee on the spy agency scandal, speaks during a press conference at the National Assembly, Thursday. (Yonhap)Ahn, a software mogul-turned-politician, heads the NPAD panel probing the scandal.Thursday’s filing comes amid an escalating public blame game between the NIS and its distrusting critics, led by senior main opposition party officials. Local reports and the opposition accuse the NIS of bugging critics of the Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye administrations using malware purchased from Hacking Team, an Italian malware surveillance vendor. The NIS admits to the purchase but denies illegal use of the malware.An NIS agent was found dead last week in an apparent suicide, adding another twist to the ongoing scandal. The opposition suspects that the NIS could have covered-up the death as a suicide, citing closed-circuit television recordings showing that the color of the dead agent’s car registration plate appeared different from the earlier hours of the day and when police found the agent’s body.Police officials denied tampering with the car, saying that the CCTV images color appeared different due to “optical illusions” caused by differences in the cameras’ angles. Police later Thursday added that authorities had conducted experiments using the same car model of that of the dead agent, demonstrating that the CCTVs produced images with different colors.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","opposition party filed charges thursday ,wiretapping government critics for years ,party filed charges thursday against ,panel probing the scandal thursday ,allegedly wiretapping government critics for","['New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'National Intelligence Service', 'Lee Byung - ho', 'NPAD', 'Song Ho - chang', 'the NPAD ’s', 'Won Sei - hoon', 'Nam', 'NIS', 'Won', 'npad', 'Park Soo - hyun', 'Seoul', 'NIS', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'Saenuri Party', 'Suh Chung - won', 'NIS', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Young', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Ahn Cheol', 'the NPAD ’s', 'the National Assembly', 'yonhap)ahn', 'NPAD', 'NIS', 'NIS', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Park Geun', 'Hacking Team', 'italian', 'NIS', 'NIS', 'NIS', 'CCTV', 'Jeong Hunny']",5,"[ 2.          0.          2.         ... -0.2525003  -0.17431144

Hong Joon-pyo (Yonhap)Lawyers for Hong Joon-pyo, governor of South Gyeongsang Province, denied charges that he received illicit political funds from the late business tycoon Sung Woan-jong during the first hearing held Friday in connection with a high-profile graft scandal.The hearing took place at Seoul Central District Court, about three weeks after the prosecution indicted Hong and former premier Lee Wan-koo without detention for violating the Political Fund Act by accepting illicit political funds from Sung, the deceased chairman of Keangnam Enterprises.Hong did not appear in court for the hearing.But Yoon Seung-mo, the former vice president of Keangnam Enterprises, was present to admit to his charges that he had delivered the money on Sung’s behalf to Hong in 2011 at the National Assembly.During the hearing, Hong’s legal representatives maintained that such a meeting did not take place.The governor is charged with receiving 100 million won ($89,000) from Sung in June 2011, when the four-term lawmaker was running for chief of the Grand National Party, the precursor to the ruling Saenuri Party.Sung sent shockwaves across the nation in April after he committed suicide, leaving a handwritten note in his pocket that listed the names of eight politicians close to President Park Geun-hye, and the bribe sums he allegedly handed over. Among the eight political heavyweights, only Hong and Lee were indicted, with the remaining six cleared of the bribery charges due to the lack of evidence and expiration of the statute of limitations.In the hearing, the prosecution asked the court to rapidly process the trial, citing the circumstantial evidence that Hong had attempted to bribe Yoon to sway the ruling in his favor.

Members of MINBYUN-Lawyers for a Democratic Society and Jinbo Net, two local human rights groups, are likely to back the efforts.“A parliamentary probe into the National Intelligence Service scandal is a must, but a more thorough and forcible investigation is necessary, including raids led by law enforcement officials,” a PSPD official was quoted by Yonhap news agency as saying early Wednesday.The report is expected to name incumbent NIS chief Lee Byung-ho and past NIS heads Lee Byung-kee and Nam Jae-joon as the accused, a PSPD spokesperson said later Wednesday, asking not to be named as the person was not authorized to talk to media on the case.“We only have a rough draft, but we are going to file it no matter what. We’re in the middle of finalizing the details, such as the how and when,” the source added.“We’re going to try to file it at least by the end of next week,” MINBYUN spokesperson Park Ju-min said later Wednesday.The announcement by activists from the PSPD comes as local media reported earlier in the day that the NIS had allegedly bugged South Koreans in China for years using malware developed by Hacking Team, a Milan, Italy-based malware surveillance vendor. Hacking Team allegedly produced malware for the NIS since at least 2010, according to leaked emails available on WikiLeaks. The NIS last week confirmed that it had purchased 20 malware programs from Hacking Team, but denied using them to spy on South Korean nationals.Local reports, however, continue to accuse the NIS of bugging outspoken critics of the Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye administrations, citing the leaked emails.  Activists at a rally criticizing the NIS`s alleged wiretapping in Jeonju, North Jeolla Province, Wednesday.

The hearing took place at Seoul Central District Court, over three months after late Keangnam Enterprises chairman Sung Woan-jong shook the country with his suicide memo implicating eight political heavyweights as potential subjects of his bribery.Lee was among the two who eventually took a fall from the memo scandal, as he was indicted earlier this month for allegedly receiving 30 million won ($26,000) in bribes from Sung. Lee did not appear in court as it was not mandatory for those indicted without detention. The ex-prime minister stepped down from the post in April after the allegations were raised. Prosecutors urged the court to promptly proceed the trial process, citing concerns that the memory of testifiers can be affected as time goes by. The prosecution has reportedly submitted the evidence of late Sung’s “bribery memo” and the voice record of the phone interview with a news outlet in which Sung testifies that he had handed over the funds to Lee. The next hearing will he held on July 31, officials said.South Gyeongsang Province Gov. Hong Joon-pyo, who was indicted along with Lee for the same charges, will face a separate hearing Thursday. Hong is accused of receiving 100 million won from a high-ranking official of Sung’s company. He was also one of the eight figures listed in late Sung’s memo. Hong has reportedly prepared for the hearing with a group of top-notch lawyers, sources said. The attorney group comprising eight lawyers will be led by L.K.B & Partners’ head lawyer Lee Kwang-bum.

He has never held any official position in the current administration.  Prosecutors concluded that Jeong has not met with any presidential aides since October 2013 to receive briefings on state affairs.  There have been rumors the younger Park and Jeong had been in a veiled feud over who would be the heavyweight in Park's administration.

Those are the law, principles and justice,” he said in an apparent rebuke to the president and fellow party members who pressured him to resign.Yoo had been singled out by President Park during a speech on June 25 as a force that hindered the smooth passage of her policies in the legislature. She also vetoed the National Assembly Act revision that would have given more leeway for lawmakers to request changes to government ordinances.

New Politics Alliance for Democracy floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul (center) urges Saenuri Party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung (sitting) to cast his vote on the National Assembly Act revision at the plenary session Monday. YonhapThe remark came after National Assembly Speaker Chung Ui-hwa declared that the vote failed to meet the quorum of 149 lawmakers, with only 130 lawmakers attending.The boycott of the revote prompted the main opposition New Politics Democratic Party to deride the ruling party for succumbing to pressure and abandoning the will of the people and their legislative authority.Cheong Wa Dae hailed the parliament‘s decision that it, once again, confirmed the value of the Constitution. Despite the ruling party’s decision that effectively discarded the bill, the latest hullaballoo appeared to have pushed the Saenuri Party and President Park to cross the Rubicon, with both losing momentum to restore their estranged relationship, experts said. Cheong Wa Dae and the ruling party have been drifting apart with the party remaining divided over the fate of its floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min. The Saenuri whip has been resisting calls initiated by Park and her loyalists in the party to step down for not cooperating with her major state agenda. The intensifying strife between Park and her party has so far resulted in a massive delay in her reform drive and also severely damaged her leadership in state affairs, even before she has reached the halfway point in her five-year term. Piles of contentious bills needed to resolve urgent matters, such as a supplementary budget drafted to help the victims of Middle East respiratory syndrome, remain deadlocked at the parliament, alongside Park’s bill seeking to revive the nation’s sluggish economy. The communication channel between the government and the ruling party has been shut down since May, when the Saenuri Party made a legislative deal with the NPAD to pass a reform bill on the civil servants’ pension system in tandem with the revision to the Assembly law. The bill was to empower lawmakers to request a change in government decrees.Park, who blasted politicians for pursuing their own political interests, has also been suffering from a severed relationship with the party leadership. The president keeping her distance from the Saenuri chief on Friday at the opening ceremony of the Gwangju Universiade Games clearly exposed her strained ties with the chairman, despite his repeated pledges that the party would work only for the success of her government. She appeared to have decided to wait until the party makes a decision on the fate of Yoo, whom she directly called a “betrayer” for publicly opposing a number of her state agenda items, including her controversial welfare expansion.Despite Park’s denouncement and constant verbal threats from her loyalists, Yoo refrained from commenting on his fate Monday, a de facto deadline for him to make a final decision on his position.Yoon Pyeong-joong, a political professor at Hanshin University, illustrated the internal feud between the pro-Park faction and a group of nonmainstream members including Yoo’s sympathizers as a power struggle between old and new conservatives who both feel an urgent need to transform the entire conservative bloc.“Whatever Yoo decides of his fate, whether he would stay or quit as Saenuri’s floor leader, it won’t put an end to the ongoing conflict between Cheong Wa Dae and the Saenuri Party,” he said. “It would only lead to a second round of confrontations.” The power struggle between the two factions lays bare Saenuri lawmakers’ insecurities that in the future they won’t be able to remain a mainstream political force if they don’t abandon the vision and political philosophy previously pursued by old conservatives like Park, he explained.A growing number of voters, especially among those who consider themselves conservatives, are seen expressing disappointment with Park and her leadership over a series of crises involving the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome and the sinking of the Sewol ferry last year, as well as her economic reform drive that has shown no significant progress so far. “The reason some Saenuri lawmakers are resisting Park, an imperialistic president whose term has not reached halfway yet, is because they know if they don’t make significant changes within themselves right now, they will lose their parliamentary seating in the next general elections and also their political position,” he said.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","the president veto new politics ,monday apologized for causing public ,after park condemnation of politicians ,the bill vetoed by president ,president veto new politics","['Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Saenuri', 'the National Assembly', 'Kim', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Lee Jong - kul', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'the National Assembly Act', 'YonhapThe', 'National Assembly', 'Chung Ui - hwa', 'New Politics Democratic Party', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Rubicon', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'Park', 'Park ’s', 'the Saenuri Party', 'NPAD', 'Assembly', 'Saenuri', 'Yoo', 'Yoo', 'Yoon Pyeong - joong', 'Hanshin University', 'Yoo ’s', 'Yoo', 'Saenuri ’s', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'Park', 'Sewol', 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'Cho Chung - un']",14,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.54399347  0.17407095

Yoo Seong-min should resign for backing a bill that would have given the legislature the right to request revisions to government decrees. Park vetoed the bill, saying it had violated the principle of checks and balances in government.Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Yoo Seung-min attends a party meeting at the National Assembly on Tuesday. (Yonhap)But Yoo sympathizers say Park went too far in demanding his resignation, calling her demand a bullying tactic against Yoo, a rising figure in the governing party. Park appears focused on avoiding premature lame-duck status, critics said, by replacing Yoo with one of her supporters in the wake of multiple policy crises that have cut her approval ratings, and with a nationwide parliamentary poll looming next year.Park’s anti-Yoo actions, however, could backfire, pundits added, and accelerate her lame-duck status. Experts cited recent polls showing popular opposition to the president’s calls for Yoo to resign.“I’m not sure if Park is a lame duck right now. But she could be asking for it, if she goes further with her anti-Yoo campaign,” said Lee Nae-young, Korea University professor of politics, citing a Jowon C&I; poll of 700 adults last week showing 58 percent of respondents opposed Park’s stance on Yoo.Park’s approval ratings fell to 29 percent on June 18, during the height of the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak here, from 40 percent in late May, before rebounding to 33 percent last week, according to Gallup Korea. Gallup’s weekly polls generally survey 1,000 adults nationwide and have a 95 percent confidence level on a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percent.“I think Park’s already a lame duck,” Yang Seung-ham, professor at Yonsei University said, citing her lack of policy success stories.“Her credibility just fell too much after the Sewol ferry accident last year, and the MERS outbreak (this month),” Yang added.“The latest fight is a sign that Park loyalists are doing everything they can to hold on to their power before the president’s influence disappears.”The Park-Yoo fight began last week when Park urged voters to vote against Yoo in next year’s parliamentary elections. The comment sparked public outrage, as the president appeared to be overstepping her constitutional authority. The opposition said Park’s statement constituted election meddling.“One way of resolving this is by giving Yoo some kind of justification for him to resign, so that he can save some face,” Lee said. “But that option runs the risk of sparking mass protest from Yoo supporters,” the Korea University professor added.“The best way out for Park now is to invite Yoo to the presidential office and show the public that she is taking a more conciliatory stance toward him,” Yang said.“That way, she can give off an impression of remorse for her earlier statements, and minimize the image that she is a bully trying to have her way,” he added.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","party feud persisted on tuesday ,popular opposition to the president ,resign for backing bill ,the ruling party feud ,park vetoed the bill saying","['Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Saenuri Party', 'Yoo Seung - min', 'the National Assembly', 'Yoo', 'Yoo', 'Park ’s', 'Yoo', 'Park', 'Lee Nae - young', 'Korea University', 'Park ’s', 'Yoo', 'Park ’s', 'Gallup Korea', 'Gallup', 'Park ’', 'Yang Seung - ham', 'Yonsei University', 'Yang', 'Yoo', 'Park ’s', 'Yoo', 'Lee', 'Yoo', 'Korea University', 'Park', 'Yoo', 'Yang', 'Jeong Hunny']",14,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.51498055  0.3827273

Yoo Seung-min. The escalating internal strife continued to paralyze the National Assembly as the main opposition party jumped into the fray by blasting the hierarchical relations between Cheong Wa Dae and the governing party.After an emergency supreme council meeting, Saenuri chief Kim Moo-sung apologized to the people for causing concern and vowed that he would prevent the party from falling apart. Yoo, however, said he would spend time thinking deeply about his fate. The meeting was held after loyalists to Park, including Reps. Seo Cheong-won and Lee Jeong-hyun, battered floor leader Yoo to resign for disrupting ties between Cheong Wa Dae and the party over a controversial assembly law. Yoo apologized to the president Friday following the president’s expression of her blunt dislike of him last week, but has been resisting calls to leave the post. Park also remained mute on Yoo on Monday, appearing to have passed the baton to the party to make a decision on him.“I believe Yoo would make a decision from a broad point of view,” said Seo before attending the emergency supreme council meeting.“He used to say that he hopes for the success of the Park Geun-hye administration, and now is a good opportunity for him to help her government be a success.” Rep. Lee, who served as Park’s top political and press aide, urged Yoo to quit, stressing that he has to take responsibility for causing the political chaos. “Politics is about holding responsibility for the outcomes (of actions). Now is the time for the floor leader to take that responsibility,” he said in a radio interview. Ruling Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Yoo Seung-min attends the Navy’s 2nd Fleet Command in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, on the 13th anniversary of the Second Battle of Yeonpyeong, Monday. YonhapCalls have been mounting among the Saenuri members for Yoo to resign after Park vetoed a revision to the National Assembly Act on Thursday, citing unconstitutionality.Park blasted both parties for overstepping their boundaries and neglecting their duties by passing the bill that enables lawmakers to seek changes to government ordinances. Park also slammed lawmakers for “betraying the people” and said their act should be judged by voters in the next election.Her sharp criticism exposed cracks in the relationship between Park and her own party as she directly blamed the Saenuri leadership for succumbing to the opposition party’s demand to revise the National Assembly Act on the condition of passing a reform bill on the pension of civil servants.Meanwhile, nonmainstream members and sympathizers of Yoo were seen uniting against the pro-Park faction. They accused the president’s loyalists for driving a political witch hunt.“Even a criminal under sentence of death won’t be executed right away,” said Rep. Kim Seong-tae, a Saenuri legislator regarded as being out of the party’s mainstream.A group of 20 nonmainstream lawmakers of the party released a statement, urging the supreme council members not to make a unilateral decision to throw Yoo out.“The floor leader has been elected through a party caucus accordingly with the party’s constitution,” read the statement. “The supreme council should not make a decision on its own, ignoring the consensus of all the (Saenuri) lawmakers over (the fate of Yoo), elected through a democratic procedure,” it added.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","ordinances park also slammed lawmakers ,intensifying internal feud between lawmakers ,also slammed lawmakers for betraying ,government ordinances park also slammed ,park also slammed lawmakers","['Supreme council', 'Park Geun', 'Yoo Seung - min', 'the National Assembly', 'Cheong', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Park', 'Seo Cheong - won', 'Lee Jeong - hyun', 'Yoo', 'Yoo', 'Yoo', 'seo', 'Lee', 'Yoo', 'Saenuri Party', 'Yoo Seung - min', 'Navy', '2nd Fleet Command', 'Pyeongtaek', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'YonhapCalls', 'Saenuri', 'Yoo', 'Park', 'the National Assembly Act', 'Park', 'Saenuri', 'the National Assembly Act', 'Yoo', 'Kim Seong - tae', 'Saenuri', 'Yoo', 'Saenuri', 'Yoo', 'Cho Chung - un']",14,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.26757497  0.29122302

Rhee In-je of the ruling Saenuri Party has refused to show up for questioning over his allegations despite an earlier promise to meet with prosecution investigators on Saturday.   The six-term lawmaker is suspected of receiving 20 million won (US$17,800) in illicit political funds from the late business tycoon Sung Wan-jong just before the 2013 general elections.   The summons came as part of the prosecution's investigation into a suspected ""bribery list"" left behind by Sung, the late chairman of construction firm Keangnam Enterprises Inc., who committed suicide in April.   Sung suggested in a memo that he had given illegal political funds to eight people, including Hong Moon-jong, a ruling party lawmaker who served in a key post in the election camp of President Park Geun-hye, as well as Yoo Jeong-bok and Seo Byung-soo, the current mayors of Incheon and Busan.   Rhee was part of the now-dissolved minor conservative Advancement and Unification Party when Sung served as the party's floor leader.   Prosecutors had also sought to question Rep. Kim Han-gil of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy for allegedly taking tens of millions of won from Sung while running for the main opposition party's top position in May 2013.   Kim has twice refused to answer prosecution summons, they said.   The officials from the prosecution said they will consider all ""available means"" to summon the two lawmakers, though they noted issuing an arrest warrant was currently not an option as parliament is in session.   According to legal experts, available measures may include pressing charges against the two without questioning them.

The revisions, which could have given lawmakers authority to request changes to government decrees, violated the principle of checks and balances, Park had said.The National Assembly on Sunday. (Yonhap)In-house feuding continued to escalate at the Saenuri Party posing Park loyalists against sympathizers of Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min.The pro-Park members stepped up their demand for the resignation of Yoo, who reluctantly agreed to the president’s veto. Yoo had agreed to sponsor the amendments as part of a legislative deal with the NPAD, which agreed to vote on the public service pension reforms, a bill that the main opposition had formerly opposed. President Park had criticized Yoo for the logrolling scheme.“People in support of the position of Cheong Wa Dae are set on taking Yoo down from his post no matter what it takes,” a Saenuri Party lawmaker was quoted as telling Yonhap News on Saturday.“The president’s demand, in simpler words, was that since Yoo is no better than a traitor, he should step down from his post and quit politics.”On Thursday, Park vetoed the Assembly Law revision and sharply denounced the legislation, saying that the lawmakers were attempting to challenge the government’s administrative power. She also singled out Yoo for a betrayal that should be judged by voters in the next election.The main opposition party criticized Park’s statements against Yoo.“Each and every lawmaker is a constitutional organ,” Rep. Moon Jae-in, the NPAD’s chair, said later Sunday. “Intervening in parliamentary politics and exerting pressure on (Yoo) to resign and apologize is nonsense,” Moon added.NPAD floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul expressed his party’s determination to “do everything” it could to hold the revote, saying it would take priority over other pending high-profile bills.“Right now, putting the amendment to a revote at the plenary session on July 1, is extremely important,” Lee said. “We will do our best to make that happen at our meetings with Saenuri Party officials (this week).”To put the legislation to a revote this Wednesday, the main opposition party needs the approval of the majority Saenuri Party. If the ruling party refuses, the NPAD must get a nod from National Assembly Speaker Rep. Chung Ui-hwa.But NPAD officials cast doubt on the likelihood of either, throwing jibes at the accentuated power struggle at the Saenuri Party.“I have to say at this point that (the NPAD) would prefer a Park loyalist as a negotiating partner, rather than having Rep. Yoo,” the NPAD’s chief deputy floor leader Rep. Lee Choon-suak said later Sunday.“Having a Park loyalist (as a negotiating partner) would mean we won’t have to worry about them saying one thing and changing it the next time after we seal a deal,” Lee said, adding that a Park loyalist would be in constant contact with Cheong Wa Dae officials over controversial legislation.“We would be able to negotiate with the person who is really in charge, the president,” he added.The NPAD also remained pessimistic about the possibility of the bill actually going up for a vote at the decision of the Assembly speaker, a former member of the Saenuri Party.“(Speaker) Chung will keep the bill pending, citing the lack of any agreement between us and the ruling party over the amendments,” Lee said.“I suspect that the speaker will use the Saenuri Party’s refusal as an excuse to keep the bill from a revote, holding out until this parliamentary session ends on July 6,” he added.  By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","politics on thursday park vetoed ,opposition party sunday repeated calls ,thursday park vetoed the assembly ,sunday yonhap in house feuding ,quit politics on thursday park","['the National Assembly', 'Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park ’s', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'Park', 'the National Assembly', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park', 'Saenuri Party', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Yoo', 'Yoo', 'NPAD', 'Park', 'Yoo', 'Saenuri Party', 'Yonhap News', 'Yoo', 'Park', 'Assembly', 'Yoo', 'Park ’s', 'Yoo', 'Moon Jae - in', 'NPAD ’s', 'Moon', 'NPAD', 'Lee Jong - kul', 'Lee', 'Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri Party', 'National Assembly', 'Chung Ui - hwa', 'NPAD', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Park', 'Yoo', 'NPAD ’s', 'Lee Choon', 'Park', 'Lee', 'Park', 'Cheong', 'Assembly', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Chung', 'Lee', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'Jeong Hunny']",14,"[ 0.          0.          6.         ... -0.53846258 -0.14105031

The NPAD vowed not to cooperate with the ruling party for an indefinite period, except for issues related to Middle East respiratory syndrome.“President Park’s exercise of her veto is nothing more than a dirty political trick to evade the government’s responsibility over (the outbreak of MERS) and to turn the public criticism to something else,” said NPAD chairman Moon Jae-in at an impromptu news conference held at the National Assembly. “The president is the one who should be judged by the people.”Main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy leader Rep. Moon Jae-in and other lawmakers protest President Park Geun-hye’s decision to veto the revised National Assembly Act at the National Assembly on Friday. (Yonhap)Moon was firing back at Park who bashed politicians both from rival parties Thursday for pursuing their own political interests, instead of legislating urgent bills aimed at improving their livelihoods. In a rare lengthy statement delivered in a strong tone, Park blasted both parties for overstepping their boundaries and neglecting their duties for passing the bill that enables lawmakers to seek changes to government ordinances. Park also slammed lawmakers for “betraying the people” and said their act should be judged by voters in the next election.Her sharp criticism also exposed cracks in relationship between Park and her own party as she directly blamed the Saenuri leadership for succumbing to the opposition party’s demand to pass the revision to the National Assembly act.Rumors also swirled around Friday that Park may defect from the ruling party ahead of general elections next year. Cheong Wa Dae denied, saying it is “a novel-like story.”In an all-out effort to salvage the deteriorating relationship, the governing party on Thursday evening decided to reject the opposition’s demand to override Park’s veto. The bill requires the approval of more than two-thirds of attending lawmakers. If the vote fails to meet the quorum of 149 lawmakers, the bill will automatically be scrapped.Rep. Yoo Seung-min, floor leader of the ruling Saenuri Party, also offered a public apology to the president forcausing her concern. But he defended himself, saying he had done his best to pass a reform bill on civil servants’ pensions for the success of the Park government.“I feel truly sorry to President Park Geun-hye. I owe an apology to the president for the ruling party’s lack of support to her devoted drive on state affairs,” Yoo said.“But I, as well as the party chief and other lawmakers, truly wanted to support the Park government by passing the (pension) bill by any means. … I expect that she will open her heart to us,” he said.Despite his apology, Cheong Wa Dae also turned a cold shoulder to the party ― a move seen as pressuring the chief whip to resign. An official told Yonhap news agency that Saenuri Party seems to be unaware of the gravity of the president’s remark.Factional feuds within the ruling party appeared to be intensifying with pro-Park lawmakers demanding Yoo to step down and nonmainstream lawmakers confronting the idea. Park’s approval ratings, meanwhile, rebounded to 33 percent this week, a 4 percentage points increase from the previous week, according to a local pollster Gallup Korea.

Kim Moo-sung rejected the NPAD’s proposal later Monday, saying the National Assembly’s special MERS panel the was already serving as a bipartisan work group.“The (special MERS panel) is already functioning. The panel is a group dedicated to creating possible solutions, while staying as far away from party politics as possible,” Kim said. “It is my job as a senior party official to ensure that the already existing bipartisan panel works.” New Politics Alliance for Democracy leader Rep. Moon Jae-in (left) and floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul attend a news conference to announce the party’s statement on MERS at the National Assembly on Monday. (Yonhap)The Assembly’s special MERS panel was formed by leaders of the main parties earlier this month. The committee includes nine opposition and nine ruling party lawmakers.The NPAD’s proposal included plans to increase government spending in areas most affected by the deadly respiratory virus, including Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, where the first MERS patient was reported to have stayed and spread the virus. NPAD chair Rep. Moon Jae-in also suggested increasing spending beyond this year’s budget, and raising the corporate tax as a possible way to obtain funds to tackle MERS.The MERS outbreak left 27 dead while over 3,800 remained quarantined as of Monday. The number of confirmed patients rose to 172 earlier in the day. But the overall outlook appeared positive as the virus’ spread was expected to be contained in the coming days.President Park’s approval rating rose by 0.3 percent to 34.9, the local pollster Realmeter reported Monday. The rise ended two weeks of continued falls likely caused by the administration’s apparent failure to stem the growth in the number of MERS-related deaths.The weekly survey polled 2,500 adults nationwide from June 15-19, using automated and computer-automated phone interviews. The study’s results had a 95 percent confidence level, and a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percent.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","rival parties on monday argued ,thousands quarantined senior lawmakers ,mers related deaths the weekly ,parties on monday argued over ,the virus npad chair rep","['New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Saenuri Party ’s', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'the National Assembly ’s', 'Kim', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Lee Jong - kul', 'the National Assembly', 'Assembly ’s', 'Pyeongtaek', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Realmeter', 'Jeong Hunny']",11,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38243732  0.46740317

Chung Ui-hwa’s mediation over the bill. Chung had proposed to amend contentious words to bridge the partisan gap and prevent potential clashes with the Constitution. “(My proposal’s) whole purpose is to eliminate the bill’s unconstitutionality,” said Chung. “Therefore, I believe there will be no unnecessary clashes between the legislature and the executive branch. I sincerely appreciate both parties’ cooperation,” Chung said. The bill initially stated that the assembly can “demand” the government change an enforcement decree, but Chung had asked the lawmakers to replace the word “demand” with “request” to prevent constitutional violations.The NPAD agreed Monday to accept the speaker’s proposal at a meeting where key NPAD lawmakers attended. The party pointed out that the speaker’s version is “virtually” the same as the original one, arguing it is “merely” the change of a phrase. “We have agreed to accept the speaker’s proposal,” said NPAD floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul. “The change is only limited to the word choice, basically replacing the word ‘demand’ with ‘request.’ We have decided to stop political bickering (over the issue),” said Lee. Lee urged the speaker to ask the president to stop threatening to veto the bill, demanding the speaker’s commitment to bringing the bill to the floor once again for a vote even if the president vetoed the bill. The speaker said it is “unlikely” that the president would veto the bill. The ruling Saenuri Party, however, refused to give the NPAD assurance to bring the bill to the floor in the event of the president’s veto. “I can’t not give my word to the NPAD (on the vote),” Saenuri Party floor leader Yoo Seung-min said Monday. Meanwhile, Cheong Wa Dae has yet to rule out the possibility of vetoing the bill. “(The speaker’s proposal) could still violate the Constitution. The government could veto the bill if it perceives that (the bill) could encroach upon its executive right,” said Rep. Kim Jae-won of Saenuri Party, a senior aide to the president.

The NPAD boycotted Friday’s adoption of Hwang’s parliamentary report, leaving the meeting in protest just before the panel adopted the report by a vote of seven to six. The adoption allows the National Assembly to put the confirmation to a vote in a plenary session. “(The unilateral adoption) was an inevitable decision,” said Saenuri Party floor spokesperson Rep. Min Hyun-joo on Saturday in a statement. “We need to build a robust governance system to address the public fear over the MERS outbreak,” said Min. Min urged the NPAD to attend the Assembly’s plenary session next week and put Hwang’s confirmation to a vote. Saenuri Party can push through the confirmation as they hold a majority with 160 out of 298 parliamentary seats. The NPAD, however, has repeated its objection to Hwang and continued to dismiss him as “unfit” for the nation’s second-in-command. “Saenuri abandons its right and duty as lawmakers,” said NPAD vice floor spokesperson Rep. Kim Jung-hyun. “Saenuri has compromised the role of the National Assembly by adopting the report. If they continue to do this, they would end up being a rubber stamp to support Cheong Wa Dae’s decisions,” said Kim. The NPAD also said Sunday that it would amend a parliamentary law to mandate high-profile candidates like Hwang submit relevant information for their confirmation hearing. The NPAD criticized Hwang for being “insincere” in response to its request for information, failing to prove Hwang’s qualification for the post. Meanwhile, the NPAD on Sunday urged President Park Geun-hye to withdraw her threat to veto the revised parliamentary law that allows lawmakers to demand the government make changes in decrees. As the rival parties continued to clash over the bill, Assembly Speaker Chung Ui-hwa offered mediation by changing contentious language in the bill.Chung suggested watering down the language to prevent any further debate of it potentially violating the Constitution, such as by stating that the Assembly can “request” instead of “demand” changes to government ordinances. The Saenuri Party has decided to accept Chung’s proposal, while the NPAD continued internal discussion of whether to consent.“Despite the concern that the speaker’s proposal could encroach upon the legislative branch, we have continued to discuss with party members and the speaker. We ask Cheong Wa Dae to give a sincere response to (our efforts),” said NPAD floor speaker Park Soo-hyun.

The governing Saenuri Party and the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy failed to agree on a parliamentary procedure to confirm the nominee. The Saenuri Party urged for Hwang’s confirmation at the plenary session on Friday, while NPAD opposed it. “Both parties couldn’t reach an agreement over the parliamentary schedule for Hwang’s confirmation,” said Rep. Lee Choon Suak of NPAD. The main opposition party insisted that the three-day hearing this week had failed to shed any light on allegations of Hwang’s ethical lapses.The remark came after the Saenuri Party hinted at a “unilateral” push to put the nomination to a vote. “We will convince the National Assembly’s speaker to put it to a vote unless the NPAD comes for negotiation,” said Saenuri floor leader Rep. Yoo Seung-min on Thursday.Yoo pointed out that Friday is “virtually” the deadline for the approval because the law dictates that lawmakers complete the process by Saturday.But NPAD repeated its rejection of the nominee, who they claim is “unverified.” The party has been claiming that Hwang is unfit for the premiership as he had given “insincere” and “insufficient” explanations to the allegations against him. The P.M. nominee faces allegation that he dodged military service and violated the code of conduct as a lawyer. The NPAD also charges that he pretended to have a rare case of hives to avoid mandatory military service and was involved in a controversial pardon when he was a lawyer in 2012. He has denied the allegations. “We were not able to begin the procedure for Hwang’s approval right now,” said NPAD floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul. “We couldn’t adopt the final report for the hearing and I don’t think the assembly is likely to hold a plenary session tomorrow in a smooth manner.” Lee added that the party would continue its efforts to block Hwang’s approval.

Park added that continued public fear over the disease would likely hurt consumer spending and the tourism industry.“MERS is a controllable virus that we can contain. I understand that the public is alarmed at the disease’s spread. But I urge citizens to refrain from excessively reacting to MERS for the sake of the economy,” Park said.“I also would like to urge the Finance Ministry to ensure that the MERS outbreak does not hurt our tourism industry,” the president added.

P.M. nominee Hwang Kyo-ahn. (Chung Hee-cho/The Korea Herald)Park named Hwang, the incumbent justice minister, to serve as her new prime minister last month after then-Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo resigned due to growing suspicion that he had accepted illegal campaign funds during campaigning for the April 2013 parliamentary by-elections.Hwang’s appointment is subject to parliamentary approval. But opposition lawmakers have accused Hwang of a series of ethical lapses during his public career, including accusations that he had illegally avoided military service in 1980 and that Hwang had illicitly meddled in recent investigations into sensitive politicized cases.Hwang had kept silent on the accusations until his hearing began Monday.“I assure you my skin disease (made me) medically designated unfit to serve (on active duty) by a medical officer,” Hwang said, in response to questions on whether he had lied about having hives.“I suffered from (hives) for 17 years after entering college,” Hwang added. “There was a rule (in 1980) saying that I had to receive three months of treatment. If it did not heal in that time I was exempt. I received up to six months of treatment but was not able to get rid of (the disease).”Opposition lawmakers also accused Hwang of meddling in the state probes into the 2012 presidential election electioneering scandal by exerting pressure as the incumbent justice minister on prosecutors to partially cover up the case, a claim that the former prosecutor denied.Former National Intelligence Service chief Won Sei-hoon is facing charges of having spread unconfirmed rumors that opposition candidates running against President Park during the 2012 election were pro-communist and pro-North Korea officials.Hwang also added that he would quit his job as the justice minister if lawmakers vote against his appointment to the Prime Minister’s Office, an unlikely possibility, as the governing party holds a majority in the legislature.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","2012 presidential election electioneering scandal ,lawmakers vote against his appointment ,new law to overturn presidential ,presidential election electioneering scandal ,lawmakers to overrule presidential","['Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'the National Assembly', 'Hwang', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Park', 'Park', 'Hwang', 'P.M.', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Chung Hee - cho', 'Korea herald)park', 'Hwang', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Hwang', 'Hwang', 'Hwang', 'Hwang', 'Hwang', 'National Intelligence Service', 'Won Sei - hoon', 'Park', 'Hwang', 'the Prime Minister ’s Office', 'Jeong Hunny']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.18669941  0.1712663

On Monday, Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo said that his ministry is also considering the establishment of a disaster hospital. “We (the ministry) do believe that the hospital is necessary. I promise to come up with specific plans,” he told the National Assembly.The hospital will function as a “control tower” in case of disasters that require large-scale medical support. Unlike other hospitals, it will have the capacity to mobilize medical staff as well as house special quarantine facilities such as negative pressure isolation rooms, critical for preventing cross-contamination from room to room. The decision came amid growing criticism over the government’s management of calamities that have occurred in the past few years.The idea for the hospital first surfaced in 2009 when H1N1 flu virus landed in Korea, but was scrapped due to budgetary constraints. It resurfaced again as a slew of emergency situations ― such as the MERS outbreak and last year’s deadly sinking of ferry Sewol ― underscored the need for state-backed medical support.In March, Saenuri leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung met with Yonsei University chief Jeong Kap-young, who suggested that such a hospital should be actively considered. The two met after visiting U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert who was attacked by a leftist extremist.“Right after the Sewol accident, local health care staff had difficulty in providing medical assistance due to the lack of manpower and hospital wards,” Rep. Shin Eui-jin told local media Sunday, adding that the same problem occurred during the MERS outbreak.As of Monday afternoon, 88 people have been infected by MERS, six of whom died. A total of 2,508 people have been quarantined.

The pro-Park members held a closed-door meeting Tuesday to discuss their calls for Yoo’s resignation. The argument, however, was rebuked by such members as senior member Rep. Lee Jae-oh.Lee instead said Yoo should be applauded for successfully finalizing negotiation with the opposition party.“We need to give Yoo a word of encouragement,” said Lee. “Yoo did not unilaterally passed the law. We, the supreme council, have gathered before to give endorsement to him. I understand there is controversy over the law, but what we should do first is to tell him that he did a good job,” said Lee. The former rival to President Park in the run up to the 2012 presidential candidacy, Lee also took aim at Cheong Wa Dae, saying, “Does this government even have any common sense by instigating internal conflict at such a time when it should be dealing with the (MERS spread)?” Meanwhile, Saenuri Party leader Kim Moo-sung urged the lawmakers to stop the blame game, stressing there are no factions within the party.The latest feud, meanwhile, highlighted the ups and downs in relations between President Park and Yoo.Yoo, the third-term lawmaker, began his political career by working for Park when she was serving as the leader of Grand National Party, a forerunner to Saenuri party. He served as a top aide to support Park’s party leadership and her bid to be the party’s presidential candidate in 2007. Their relations began to sour in 2011 when Park served as chief of the party’s emergency panel. He publicly criticized Park’s positions, including her decision to change the party’s name from Grand National Party to Saenuri Party. Even though he vowed to do his “utmost” to support Park in his election to be floor leader, he has continued to clash with the president over her welfare policies, such as by dismissing a policy as a false commitment.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","the floor leader to resign ,president over her welfare policies ,clash with the president over ,urged the lawmakers to stop ,the party the latest feud","['Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun', 'Cheong', 'Dae', 'Lee Jang - woo', 'Yoo Seung - min', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Yoo', 'Lee Jae - oh', 'Lee', 'Yoo', 'Yoo', 'Lee', 'Yoo', 'the supreme council', 'Lee', 'Park', 'Lee', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Park', 'Yoo', 'Yoo', 'Park', 'Grand National Party', 'Saenuri', 'Park ’s', 'Park', 'Park ’s', 'Grand National Party', 'Saenuri Party', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",14,"[ 0.          0.          3.         ... -0.37142372  0.2986041

It also released a list of 14 government decrees that it claimed were inconsistent with upper laws, pledging to take issue with them in a blunt rebuttal against President Park Geun-hye’s threat to veto the new parliamentary powers the day before.The New Politics Alliance for Democracy asserted that the legislature has the “legitimate” authority to demand changes to the executive’s enforcement decrees, refuting Park’s argument that the bill would “paralyze” the government’s activity. The move was expected to escalate the tension between the National Assembly and Cheong Wa Dae in the lead-up to upcoming parliamentary session. Park said Monday that she would reject the bill unless the assembly revised the bill. The rival parties passed the bill last Friday after reaching a bipartisan agreement.  Members of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy including chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in (front, right) attend a party lawmakers workshop in Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi Province, Tuesday. (Yonhap)“The president doesn’t need to make a fuss out of (the bill),” said NPAD floor leader Lee Jong-kul on Tuesday. “The National Assembly has the mechanism to verify whether the bill is right or wrong. I urge the president to trust the Assembly, so that it can do its job,” he added.On Monday, the NPAD said that it would seek changes to a total of 14 government decrees that they said undermined the legislature’s efforts by falling short of serving their intended purposes. Among them are decrees for the special Sewol law, child care subsidies and compensation for victims of the Gwangju democratic movement. The NPAD has claimed the government used the decree to bypass the law. “Those are examples of the government violation of upper laws,” said NPAD Rep. Kang Gi-jung on Monday. “If the president vetoes (the revised assembly law), it would violate democracy and reflect her views that the executive branch is beyond the Constitution,” said Kang.The ruling Saenuri Party, for its part, downplayed the forcibleness of the revised parliamentary rule, saying the government does not have an obligation to abide by the Assembly’s demand. The party pointed out the law lacks specific clauses to force the government to accept the amendments suggested by the lawmakers. “(The NPAD)’s rationale is a bit exaggerated,” said Rep. Chang Yoon-seok of Saenuri Party. “It is a critical issue as to whether a branch can force other branches to do something and, thus, the law should spell it out in specifics. Obviously, the law does not spell it out, so the NPAD is interpreting the law in its favor,” said Chang.The revision to the Assembly Law’s Clause 2 of Article 98 stipulates that the parliament can demand a revision or change to an enforcement ordinance and the head of the relevant ministry must “handle” the demand and report back with the result. Previously it had stated that in cases where an ordinance is deemed to conflict with a higher law, the parliament could notify the head of the relevant ministry.Meanwhile, the NPAD on Tuesday held a workshop to review the causes of their crushing defeat in the April by-election and discuss action plans for this month’s parliamentary session. “We attained our goals at the last parliamentary session,” said NPAD Chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in. “We have come up with a measure to address wrongdoings such as a decree for the Sewol bill. I am confident that we will achieve the same result in the next session,” said Moon.

Shim Jae-kwon told The Korea Herald in a recent interview. “They think that putting up something that will gain public attention, like a remembrance day, will continue that kind of strained relationship.”In April, Shim, a senior opposition member of the legislature’s foreign affairs panel, proposed a National Assembly resolution urging the U.N. to establish a comfort women remembrance day resembling the Holocaust Remembrance Day created in November 2005.The Foreign Ministry, however, expressed its concern over the bill, saying that the international body had too many memorial days and countries with victims have different positions over Japan’s sexual enslavement. New Politics Alliance for Democracy Rep. Shim Jae-kwon. (Chung Hee-cho/The Korea Herald)The term “comfort women” refers to the thousands of Asian, and some Dutch, females forced into sexual slavery by Imperial Japan in the 1930s and ‘40s. Most came from Korea and China, but there were others from the Philippines, Vietnam and elsewhere in Asia, historians have said.The issue has gained increasing attention in Korea due to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s comments hinting that senior Tokyo officials still deny that women were forced into sexual slavery.Abe’s failure to issue an explicit apology for the issue on his trip to Washington in April also reinforced such beliefs here.South Korean President Park Geun-hye cites Abe’s stance as one of the main reasons Seoul-Tokyo ties remain frosty.The foreign ministry objects to the move as calls to set up a comfort women’s remembrance day could risk alienating key U.N. members already fatigued by the issue, according to Shim.“The foreign ministry said there are already some 120 U.N.-designated anniversaries. And it said it was already difficult to organize cooperation among other comfort women victims’ countries.”Those are ridiculous reasons not to pursue a comfort women remembrance day, Shim said.“(A U.N.-backed comfort women remembrance day) is something that has a high possibility of being established, and something that could clearly express our government’s stance on the issue,” he added.The second-term lawmaker added that key disagreements between his liberal party and the conservative Saenuri Party over a North Korea human rights bill persisted. Close to 20 versions of the bill have stalled in Seoul’s unicameral parliament since 2005 due to partisan disagreements.“Let me make this clear: Our party does not oppose a North Korea human rights bill. Nor are we hesitant about writing one,” he said.“But it is our stance that the human rights bill must be a practical one ― something that genuinely enhances rights in the North, not something that worsens tensions.”The Saenuri Party and Shim’s NPAD are at loggerheads over three points, Shim said.The NPAD says the human rights bill must not be misused as a source of funds for potentially provocative activities such as the sending of anti-Kim Jong-un leaflets by activists from the South to the North.The Saenuri Party says the leaflets should be protected under the freedom of expression clause in the Constitution.The two parties are also at odds over which government bureau should be in charge of the human rights bill. The NPAD supports putting the Unification Ministry, Seoul’s main North Korea policy bureau, in charge. The Saenuri Party backs a plan dividing the many functions of the bill among multiple government organizations.The NPAD and the Saenuri Party also disagree over the use of a human rights records office to be established by the North Korea human rights bill, Shim said.The main opposition says that the records office must be put under the Unification Ministry and primarily used as an information source for policymakers.The Saenuri Party says it should be put under the Justice Ministry, and used to prosecute North Korean violators of human rights after unification. The office could also deter North Korea officials from committing more crimes, Saenuri officials have said.“I am not against penalizing North Korean officials who have violated human rights,” Shim said. “But I believe that such a role must come second to information gathering for policymaking.”“And you must remember that North Korea’s human rights issue cannot be approached purely from a humanitarian, or a philosophical point of view,” Shim said.The human rights predicament there has political ramifications in inter-Korean relations, Shim said. That makes it different from the civil rights issue in the U.S. or the aborigines’ plight in Australia, the lawmaker added.The main opposition lawmaker also expressed his opposition to possible U.S. plans to deploy a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery in Korea, even if Washington decides to fund the deployment on its own.“I am not opposed to placing (THAAD) in Korea if it can block North Korean missiles. But I think THAAD is the wrong answer to intercepting North Korea weapons.“North Korea is likely to fire missiles far below the THAAD’s reach,” Shim said.“And the diplomatic cost of bringing the system here outweighs the system’s defense capabilities,” the lawmaker added, noting China and Russia’s opposition to the deployment of THAAD here.THAAD is a missile system designed to intercept incoming missiles at altitudes between 40 and 150 kilometers. U.S. officials have raised the possibility of placing the system here, although South Korean officials assert there has been no request to do so from Washington.Shim, 68, is a second-term lawmaker representing the Gangdong-gu district in eastern Seoul. The lawmaker is a former aide to the late President Kim Dae-jung.

(Yonhap)The parties hastily extended the on-going extra parliamentary session, originally set for closure Thursday, by one more day as their negotiations dragged on.The legislation ended months of bipartisan wrangling over the pension reform drive championed by President Park Geun-hye.Park has repeated calls for the passage of the reform bill aimed at reducing growing deficits in the civil servant pension fund as the administration pushes for reform and deregulation in a bid to invigorate the stagnant economy.The civil servant pension reform bill requires government employees to contribute 9 percent of their monthly income to their pension scheme, raising the rate from the current 7 percent over the next five years, while shaving their pension payment rate to1.7 percent from 1.9 over the next two decades. In connection with the civil servant pension move, a special National Assembly committee and a social consultation group will be established to explore ways to revamp the broader national pension fund, including whether to improve pension benefits from the fund, according to a parliamentary rule also passed in the general meeting. South Korea is facing a growing fiscal burden on its pension management due to the country's fast-aging population, the result of grim birth rates. The government warned that by next year it will be forced to use 10 billion won (US$9 million) of taxpayer money every day to backfill deficits stemming from civil service pensions unless the parliament passes the reform bill by early May.In the face of the growing urgency, the rival parties had initially agreed to pass the bill through the National Assembly in early May, but the efforts fell through due to gaps over the issue of reforming the broader public pension system.Both parties hailed the passage of the much-awaited reform bill, with ruling party leader Kim Moo-sung saying, ""I am very grateful to have come up with a successful conclusion after so much tough processes."" NPAD leader Moon Jae-in said, ""I want to praise our party for leading the proper reform that will prop up the fiscal economy while properly guaranteeing post-retirement income.Also approved in the early-morning voting session was a revised national health bill that requires tobacco sellers to put pictorial warnings about the dangers of smoking on cigarette packs.

Kim Moo-sung a political opportunist in a sarcastic speech Saturday at a service commemorating his father’s death in 2009.The senior Roh killed himself amid a politicized graft probe targeting his family, largely pushed for by conservatives such as Kim. Roh had rightly vouched for his father, supporters said. But critics of the late president said Roh had wrongfully attacked a conservative who attended the service in good faith. Kim was the first conservative party chairman to attend the memorial service of the liberal Roh.But the domestic debate surrounding Roh’s Saturday speech seemed to miss the point. Roh’s speech wasn’t about hitting back, although the junior Roh did little to conceal his hatred for Kim. Whatever his true intentions, and whichever political inclinations it belied, Roh’s words were echoed by many regardless of their political standing.Ultimately, it was more of a request to Kim ― a leading contender for the presidency in 2017 ― or the current administration, to think of the bigger picture, amid an ever-changing Northeast Asian order triggered by a rising China, a revisionist Japan, a nervous U.S., and an unpredictable, nuclear-armed North Korea.Roh began his speech by sarcastically thanking Kim for “making the difficult trip” to attend the event. He then accused Kim of falsely calling President Roh a pro-North Korean politician to woo centrist and conservative voters during the 2012 presidential race.But the words that followed these initial expressions were what mattered.“Please don’t take my words the wrong way,” Roh said. “I am not asking for an apology. Nor am I asking for words of contrition.”“I am merely asking you to consider the reality. The reality that we are surrounded by more powerful countries,” he added. “A leader who uses ideology and regional domestic rivalries to divide and conquer votes for political power cannot lead.”“China has risen high during the past three decades. Nothing says we cannot fall just as swiftly in the next 30 years,” Roh said. “Please think of the larger picture.”Roh appeared to touch on Korea’s history of becoming the unwanted center of great power struggles in Northeast Asia, often fought between a rising power and an established one. Those wars were often fought in Korea, due to the absence of a balanced foreign policy able to convince opposing powers that Korea would stay neutral.That absence, in turn, was based on factionalist politics, not unlike the politics of modern Korea, where differences of opinion are shelved as either “ultraconservative” or “pro-North Korean.”In 1592, Korea was invaded by an assertive Japan with ambitions of conquering China’s Ming Dynasty. In 1627 and 1636, the Manchus, the immediate forefathers of China’s Qing Dyansty, invaded Korea, to force them to their side against the Mings, the then-most powerful Asian nation.The first Sino-Japanese War, fought for influence over Korea between the dominant power at the time, the Qings, and a swiftly rising Imperial Japan in 1894-5, resulted in more Korean civilian deaths than those of the main combatants.These conflicts were preceded by factionalist domestic politics in Korea. Before the 1592 Japanese invasions, officials were split between those arguing a Japanese invasion was imminent and those arguing against. These arguments were based more on party loyalty than on deep, discerning analyses.Before the 1627 and 1636 Manchu invasions, Korean politicians were similarly split between factions supporting the Mings and those supporting the Qings. Again, these loyalties had more relevance in domestic political affiliations than insightful foreign policy thinking.In 1894, Korean leaders were split into the pro-Japanese, the pro-Qing, the pro-West and the pro-Russian factions.Today, Korea is likewise split into the left and right, into the liberals and the conservatives. Differences of political opinions are shunned, rather than embraced.Korea is facing a growing security and foreign policy dilemma. Its dependence on China for exports and animosity toward Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s revisionist views on World War II draws Seoul closer to Beijing. But Seoul’s security requirements against Pyongyang compel South Korean officials to stay under the U.S. security umbrella, and appease Washington officials.Roh’s speech has a point. Factionalist politics will only worsen this dilemma. A relatively united Korea on the other hand will be free to design a well-thought foreign policy, able to implement a subtle but effective balancing act.

Park approved Cho’s resignation Monday. Cho cited her failure to persuade parties to pass the civil service pension reforms.Cho’s sudden resignation stoked speculation that the former gender equality minister was preparing to run in next year’s general election.Cho Yoon-sun. (Yonhap)Her close ties to Park supported rumors that the president would be unlikely to dump Cho. Cho was Park’s spokeswoman in early 2013, and served as her gender equality minister before being picked as the first female political affairs secretary to the president last June.Praised for her gentle yet effective communication style, the lawyer-turned-politician’s political career saw smooth sailing despite her serving only one parliamentary term between 2008 and 2012. Cho failed to earn the party’s nomination for the general elections in 2012, but returned to spotlight when Park picked Cho as her spokesperson during the campaign and presidential transition period. The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, meanwhile, called Cho’s resignation a de facto sacking, and a gesture of the president’s determination to have her way in the proposed reforms. Cho’s removal was deliberately timed to pressure the NPAD to agree to the reform plans, they said.“Reports said Ms. Cho resigned. But it was sacking, no matter how you look at it,” NPAD floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul said early Tuesday.“Keeping the welfare minister at his post while removing a nominal secretary that even ruling party officials say had no fault in the (stalled pension reforms) is, in effect, a threat against the National Assembly,” Lee added. NPAD Reps. Lee Seok-hyun (left) and Lee Jong-kul (right). (Yonhap)Park, her Saenuri Party and the NPAD have been locked in a cat-and-mouse political game over the reforms that aim to vastly downsize pensions dealt out to retired civil servants. Reforms backers say the pension has enlarged the public debt by as much as 524 trillion won ($480 billion). Leaders of the main parties agreed earlier this month to pass Park’s reform plans. But the deal also included NPAD-backed measures to strengthen the national pension ― a public scheme for almost all taxpayers.President Park expressed her objection to the compromise. Her gesture pressured the Saenuri Party to ditch the agreement, creating the current impasse, Park critics said.Cho’s Monday resignation was timed to add pressure on lawmakers to “get on with” the president’s demands, which do not include reforms to the national pension and the basic pension, some analysts said.“I don’t know what (the president) is thinking, but I would advise her to step into the negotiations herself instead of adding unnecessary pressure on lawmakers to agree to her demands,” said Chung Jin-min, professor of politics at Myongji University.“If someone had to be fired, it shouldn’t have been the senior secretary for political affairs,” Chung added. “Cho is under the command of Presidential Chief of Staff (Lee Byung-kee) and ultimately President Park herself.”Another observer cautioned against making “unnecessarily broad” interpretations of Cho’s resignation based on unconfirmed rumors.“Park’s removal of Cho is not a threat against anyone. I think that the removal was due to Cho’s perceived inability to communicate the president’s stance to the ruling party negotiators at the front lines,” said Yang Seung-ham, professor of Korean politics at Yonsei University.

Jung Cheong-rae over his verbal attacks last week, revealing the deepening intraparty division.Jung is at the center of an intensifying factional feud as he accused his colleague Rep. Joo Seung-yong of “blackmailing” the party while trading blame over the defeats in the April parliamentary by-elections. “As a senior member of the party, Jung made comments that that he should not have,” said the members in their request delivered to the party’s ethics committee. People who filed the petition are reportedly non-mainstream members, raising speculation that their actions were taken to confront the pro-Roh faction within the party. Jung criticized Joo, at a public meeting on Friday, for “blackmailing” the party, saying that he was issuing empty threats to step down from his position at the NPAD Supreme Council. He added that Joo was undermining the party’s unity amid falling approval ratings after the electoral defeats. The attack followed Joo’s demand that Rep. Moon Jae-in step down as party chairman to take responsibility for the defeats. Infuriated by Jung’s remark, Joo walked away from the meeting and said he would resign from his post as a supreme council member. NPAD chair Moon apologized for the incident, saying it was an embarrassment for the party. Despite Jung’s efforts to meet Joo to apologize, he could not.The party’s ethics committee said it would start looking into the facts and decide later whether to begin an investigation.“We are trying to verify the relevant facts regarding the case,” Rep.

The resignation of Rep. Joo Seung-yong dealt yet another blow to the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, which has been faltering under deepening factional infighting that was aggravated by the party’s defeats in parliamentary by-elections on April 29. His decision to step down appeared intended, in part, to express his discomfort over NPAD Chair Rep. Moon Jae-in. Joo has accused Moon of “favoritism and incompetence.”Joo’s resignation will likely worsen tension among the NPAD’s multiple factions, observers said, as Moon and Joo are senior members of the party’s opposing groups.  Rep. Joo Seung-yong (left) of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy speaks during a session of the party‘s Supreme Council in Seoul on Friday. (Yonhap)“All of us in the Supreme Council must resign. We must take responsibility for last week’s election losses,” he told reporters. “Not taking responsibility for the defeats is another form of factionalism, favoritism, and unfairness.”The governing Saenuri Party trounced the NPAD last week, winning three of the four contested districts in the parliamentary by-elections. The NPAD failed to win a seat, losing to an independent in Gwangju, a city long considered an NPAD stronghold. Joo has accused Moon of favoritism toward the pro-Rohs, the leading faction within the NPAD, named after the late ex-President Roh Moo-hyun. Moon served as the presidential chief of staff for Roh. Joo is a member of the non-Rohs, a coalition of NPAD lawmakers who blame the pro-Rohs for the party’s falling approval ratings and last week’s election losses.They said Moon was politically incompetent as he had failed to win an election that was projected as an assured NPAD win due to the escalating graft allegations against some senior officials of the ruling bloc, who are suspected of taking bribes from a deceased construction mogul. “Continuing work under current conditions mean we will fail to win the general elections and the presidential election,” Joo said. South Korea holds nationwide parliamentary polls next year and a presidential race in 2017.“The citizens of our country and members of our party have asked for an explanation on the pro-Roh’s domination of our party,” Joo said. “The pro-Rohs have given none. I hence resign from the Supreme Council.”Joo’s comments Friday came after a verbal fight with Rep. Jung Cheong-rae, an outspoken pro-Roh lawmaker.“Threatening to resign, while not resigning, is the same as blackmailing,” Jung said of Joo.“I have blackmailed no one. I have, on multiple occasions, restrained from responding to Rep.

They should also secure the financial sustainability of the national pension fund by collecting public opinion,” said senior press secretary Kim Sung-woo in an impromptu news conference.Parties failed to pass the bill as the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy demanded that the revision explicitly state that the income-replacement rate of the national pension would be raised to 50 percent, from the current 40 percent. The income-replacement rate is the figure multiplied to a pensioner’s average lifetime monthly income. The ruling Saenuri Party rejected the demand, raising concerns that such a plan would place a huge financial burden on 20 million national pension subscribers, nearly half of South Korea’s population, as it requires a substantial hike in their contribution to the fund. The bill, drafted by the ruling party on the request of President Park Geun-hye, was widely expected to be passed at the plenary session on Wednesday as the rival parties had agreed on a set of reform measures over the weekend.They agreed to raise the contribution rate of public service pensions from 7 percent to 9 percent in the next five years, while reducing entitlements from 1.9 percent to 1.7 percent in stages over 20 years.The two sides also agreed to raise the payout rates of the national pension. But the surprising decision drew fierce opposition from Cheong Wa Dae due to the fear of increased burden on taxpayers. Top officials, including Welfare Minister Moon Hyung-pyo, blasted the parties for acting outside their authorities and said it was a matter that required public approval to even begin discussions. The presidential office’s remarks on Thursday were seen as an expression of urgency to push forward Park’s reform drives with less than three years of her term remaining. The president, in her three-year economic reform plan unveiled last year, vowed to eradicate corruption and overhaul four sectors including the civil servants’ pension, labor and education markets. The plans, however, have been put on hold due to the Sewol crisis last year as well as a series of political scandals. Cheong Wa Dae officials expected that the reform bill on civil servants’ pension would set in motion her reform drive, if it gets parliamentary approval.The fate of the civil servants’ pension reform bill, however, remains unclear as the opposition NPAD is sticking to its demand to combine the issue of national pension system with the bill, while the ruling party is walking on eggshells in the face of vehement opposition from Cheong Wa Dae and some from pro-Park factions within the Saenuri Party.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","office on thursday urged rival ,presidential office remarks on thursday ,corruption and overhaul four sectors ,presidential office on thursday urged ,thursday urged rival parties to","['Dae', 'Kim Sung - woo', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Saenuri Party', 'South Korea ’s', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Cheong', 'Welfare', 'Moon Hyung - pyo', 'Park ’s', 'Dae', 'NPAD', 'Cheong', 'pro - park', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Cho Chung - un']",1,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.41790593  0.59714055

Na Kyung-won, chairwoman of the parliamentary committee on foreign affairs and unification. “If we fail to pass the bill again, we would be abandoning our historical duty.” The first draft of the North Korean human rights bill was introduced in 2005. Rep. Kim Moon-soo of the Grand National Party, predecessor to the Saenuri Party, and fellow legislators submitted the bill to the Assembly’s committee on foreign affairs and unification, but the committee failed to pass the bill in time as ruling and opposition lawmakers locked horns over the content.The bill was resubmitted in 2008 and passed the committee. But it made no headway at the plenary session as opposition parties blocked the passage, saying it would provoke North Korea and damage already strained inter-Korean ties.The bill was put back into the spotlight last year when the United Nations adopted a landmark resolution against Pyongyang, calling for a referral of North Korea to the International Criminal Court for human rights violations. Boosted by the U.N. resolution, Rep. Kim Young-woo of the Saenuri Party and fellow lawmakers repackaged previous legislation and proposed a comprehensive version of the North Korean human rights bill last November. The updated bill calls for the government to appoint a special ambassador for North Korea’s human rights; to establish a comprehensive archive to investigate and collect human rights abuse cases; and to offer support for activities by human rights groups. The progressive bloc, however, criticized the conservatives’ version as not comprehensive enough. The liberals pointed out that the bill lacks direct support for North Korean people such as food and medical aid, while the conservatives place importance on transparency over assistance. The opposition also claimed the bill could cause unexpected clashes with the North. They believe it would encourage anti-North groups to “further provoke” Pyongyang, such as by sending leaflets to the North. In October last year, North Korea responded by shooting down the balloons carrying the leaflets.The opposition proposed their own version of the North Korean human rights bill earlier this year. It highlighted improving the livelihood of North Koreans by providing direct humanitarian support. It also planned to build a dedicated agency to oversee the distribution of assistance. As political bickering continued over the bill, other countries have come forward by addressing the North’s human rights abuses.The U.S. passed the North Korea Human Rights Act in 2006 and extended it until 2017. It aims to help North Korean refugees by providing humanitarian and legal assistance to them and grants to organizations to promote human rights in North Korea. Japan also enacted a similar act in 2004. It is designed to resolve the abduction of Japanese nationals to the North while bringing the public and international community’s attention to North Korea’s human rights conditions. Unlike the bills by the U.S. and Japan, experts believe that Seoul’s version will take on a more profound and significant meaning. They pointed out that South Korea has a higher stake with the inter-Korean relationship.“As for the South Korean government, the bill will serve a different purpose from the U.S. and Japan,” said Hong Seong-phil, a law professor at Yonsei University. “The bill will help the Korean government formulate its reunification policy, so that it can prepare for the two Koreas’ reunification.” Yang Moo-jin, professor at the University of North Korean Studies, suggested the government take a cautious approach in legislating the bill. “Even if the bill were to be passed, the (Korean) government should apply it carefully as to not provoke the North. Until then, the government should serve as a middleman between the North and regional powers such as the U.S. and Japan,” Yang said.

108,108,President blasts parties’ pension agreement,"President Park Geun-hye on Monday criticized the scale of the latest deal on the public servants’ pension reform as falling short of public expectations, amid growing complaints that it was hastily reached by rival parties.“(The agreement on) pension reform has slightly reduced the financial burden (to operate the system), but it is regrettable that the scale of reform fell short of people’s expectations,” Park s...","President Park Geun-hye on Monday criticized the scale of the latest deal on the public servants’ pension reform as falling short of public expectations, amid growing complaints that it was hastily reached by rival parties.“(The agreement on) pension reform has slightly reduced the financial burden (to operate the system), but it is regrettable that the scale of reform fell short of people’s expectations,” Park said at a meeting with senior secretaries at Cheong Wa Dae. The remark came three days after rival parties agreed to raise the contribution rate of public service pensions from 7 percent to 9 percent in the next five years, while reducing entitlements from 1.9 percent to 1.7 percent in stages over 20 years. The reform measure is expected to save about 333 trillion won from 1,980 trillion won in public funds estimated to be spent to operate the pension system over the next 70 years. President Park Geun-hye (Yonhap)The president’s discontent came as her party had originally pushed to raise the contribution rate to 10 percent and cut the entitlement to 1.65 percent to garner savings of nearly 429 trillion won.Park, who returned to work Monday after a week of bedrest, welcomed that the parties could strike a deal before the deadline, saying it was a step forward for her reform drive both in public and private sectors. She, however, voiced her opposition over the agreement to increase payouts from the national pension system for the general public, which many fear will raise the burden on taxpayers. She stressed that the matter required the people’s consent first and needs to be discussed separately from the reform bill on public servants’ pension system. While her remark did not imply that she would use her veto powers to block the plan, she clearly disapproved of the parties’ decision that was made beyond their authorities. “An institutional change to modify the nominal income replacement rate of the national pension, which has about 20 million subscribers, would place a huge burden on the people,” she said.“It is something that must seek the people’s consent beforehand and also a matter that should be decided carefully after forming a social consensus.”As per the unexpected bipartisan agreement the nominal income replacement rate ― the percentage of a subscriber’s annual income that is paid out each year on retirement ― will be raised to 50 percent from the current 40 percent. This means an employee would receive about 50 percent of his annual income as pension after retirement. But Cheong Wa Dae and the government have complained to the ruling party that this would require a massive injection of public funds and that the decision was made without proper consultation with the government.Meanwhile, the president’s remarks is expected to spark a heated debate in parliament with the ruling party seeking to avert criticism for reaching an agreement with the main opposition party without consulting the government. The inclusion of the national pension system ― that has about 20 million subscribers ― in the agreement was the major demand of the main opposition party, and the ruling party is being criticized for blindly accepting it for political reasons just to get endorsement for reform of the public servants’ pension system that has only 1.1 million subscribers.The rival parties agreed to form a special parliamentary committee to draft a bill on modifying the payout rate of the national pension and put the bill to a vote in September. They also agreed to inject 20 percent of the funds saved from the civil servants’ pension reform into the national pension fund. Welfare minister Moon Hyung-pyo, former senior researcher on the nation’s pension system, lashed out at the decision saying that that the funds saved from public servants’ pension fund won’t be enough to cover the cost of raising the income replacement rates of the national pension system. The ministry has claimed that subscribers need to spend an average of 18 percent of their income to fund a 50 percent income replacement rate. A subscriber is obliged to pay 9 percent of their monthly income to the national pension fund.The ruling party chief tried to contain the fallout by admitting there were shortcomings.“I humbly accept the criticism over the civil servants’ pension reform bill and I agree to many parts of (the deal that drew criticism),” he said.“But we will put efforts to reflect the public opinion in the course of the negotiation.”The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, however, pressed the ruling party to keep its promise and pass the bill by fully reflecting the agreement reached on Saturday. “It is a meaningful work to raise the income replacement rate to 50 percent along with the reform of civil servants’ pension reform,” said NPAD leader Moon Jae-in.The meeting on Monday was Park’s first with her aides since she returned to work from her recent Latin American tour. During the meeting, the president touched on a wide range of contentious issues including her drive to reform the political sector as well as ways of granting proper presidential pardons. On the outcome of the by-elections last week, Park said it carried the people’s message for the government to initiate radical reform and eradicate corruption in public and political sectors. Her Saenuri Party achieved an unexpected victory in the parliamentary by-elections amid growing criticism over her top aides involved in a snowballing graft scandal.

The law goes into effect starting September. The parliamentary approval ends months-long debates over child safety and teachers’ privacy and human rights.“It was a shame the bill was rejected in February,” said Rep. Shin Yee-jin of the ruling Saenuri Party. “I believe the bill will present us with an opportunity to prevent child abuse and improve quality of life for those working at child care centers” she said. The government will cover the costs of installing the CCTV.Under the bill, child care centers must install surveillance cameras and keep the recordings for at least 60 days. The footage will only be disclosed when parents and authorities request their disclosure. The bill also allows child care centers to install Internet-linked cameras to allow parents to check on their children in real time. But Internet cameras can only be installed with the agreement of both parents and teachers.The bill stipulates the government should make efforts to reduce teachers’ stress and workload by providing counseling services and increasing the child care staff, as their heavy workload has been cited as a cause of child abuse at day care centers.The bill was pushed earlier this year after a series of child abuse cases outraged the public. Last January, a 33-year-old worker at an Incheon day care center was caught on CCTV beating a 4-year-old for not finishing her meal.But the bill was rejected by the Assembly in March. Some lawmakers reportedly raised concerns that the CCTV might infringe upon students’ privacy and violate the rights of teachers at child care institutions. Alongside the bill, lawmakers approved the legislation for banning online media outlets from posting obscene advertisements and pictures on their websites. Lawmakers also unanimously approved the resolution to send money to Nepal, where a magnitude-7.8 earthquake struck Saturday and claimed thousands of lives. The National Assembly will collect money from staff members and lawmakers to raise $100,000.

Moon, from the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, denied speculations Thursday that former late President Roh Moo-hyun granted a special pardon to deceased businessman Sung Woan-jong in his last days in office, even though he was not eligible for the pardon. Moon was Roh’s chief of staff at the time.Saenuri chief Kim Moo-sung on Friday intensified a verbal attack against Moon, stating he has failed to clarify the speculation. “The person who knows about (how Sung was granted a presidential pardon) is Moon,” Kim said after a government-party meeting on rice supply. “Why did he hold a press conference if he was not going to talk about it?”The governing party raised the speculation, suggesting that Roh’s aides, including Moon, might have questionable ties to Sung, who has been at the center of the graft scandal.Moon flatly denied the speculation and accused Saenuri of trying to divert public attention from the burgeoning graft scandal, which involves political heavyweights in the ruling party.The opposition leader also demanded the establishment of a special probe, saying it is not appropriate for the president to appoint the investigative team when it is her aides that are being investigated. “President Park Geun-hye should give a clear answer about whether she would keep her promise to launch an independent counsel,” said Moon. The opposition leader also demanded Park’s top aides including her Chief of Staff Lee Byung-kee step down from the post for his alleged involvement into the case. Prior to his apparent suicide earlier this month, former Keangnam chairman Sung left a list of eight high-profile politicians who received bribes, including Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo and Park’s Chief of Staff Lee. Prime Minister Lee has since offered to resign.The presidential office has rejected Moon’s demand.“We are concerned that Moon’s remarks could invite suspicion that he is trying to influence the probe,” said presidential spokesperson Min Kyung-wook in Chile, where Park is on a three-day state visit.Park has said she is willing to consider the measures necessary to completely resolve the suspicions.“I have no reason to rule out an investigation by an independent counsel if the adoption of it can help find the truth,” Park was quoted as saying, according to the ruling party chief ahead her four-nation swing to South America.By Cho Chung-un, news reports (christory@heraldcorp.com)","friday collided over opposition leader ,thursday that former late president ,the probe said presidential spokesperson ,rival parties friday collided over ,presidential office has rejected moon","['Moon Jae - in', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Moon', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Sung Woan - jong', 'Moon', 'Roh', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'Moon', 'Sung', 'Moon', 'Kim', 'Roh ’s', 'Moon', 'Sung', 'Saenuri', 'Park Geun', 'Moon', 'Park ’s', 'Lee Byung - kee', 'Keangnam', 'Sung', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Park ’s', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Moon ’s', 'Moon', 'Min Kyung - wook', 'Chile', 'Park', 'Cho Chung - un']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.78140509  0.48959115

How the illegal money was spent should be clearly ascertained. Only then can we end the politics of money and the vicious circle of corrupt politics,” Moon said during a press conference. Main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in holds a press conference at the National Assembly in Seoul on Thursday. (Yonhap)Moon also pressured President Park’s Chief of Staff Lee Byung-kee to step down, and urged Justice Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn and senior civil affair secretary Woo Byung-woo to take their hands off the ongoing prosecution’s probe.“The truth can’t be uncovered when those who are suspected of corruption still remain in their current positions. They should bow out,” he said.Before committing suicide earlier this month, former Keangnam Enterprises chairman Sung left a list of eight high-profile politicians including Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo and presidential chief of staff Lee, indicating they took bribes. The prime minister offered to resign on Monday.Touching on speculation about the special pardon in 2007, Moon stressed that no officials in the Roh administration received kickbacks from Sung.“I hope that political strife will not emerge again over the issue of the special pardon. I can say for certain that no one in Cheong Wa Dae during the Roh administration received any dirty money,” he said.Speculation erupted earlier this week after a ruling party lawmaker argued that former President Roh included Sung on the list of special presidential pardons at the last minute, despite opposition from the Justice Ministry. The argument indicated there were corrupt ties between the Roh government and the disgraced businessman.The NPAD has countered that Roh’s decision to include Sung on the list was made because of calls from then-President-elect Lee Myung-bak’s transition committee. Lee’s side has rejected the claims.Regarding the special probe, ruling party leader Kim Moo-sung told reporters, “If (Moon) is that confident, I will welcome a probe into the case (to see if anyone in the Roh government had received any bribes).”During the press conference, Moon demanded that an independent probe be launched to investigate the scandal surrounding the so-called resource diplomacy policy conducted by the former Lee government. The opposition parties have argued that corruption in the implementation of the policy wasted taxpayers’ money.Moon also called on President Park to craft viable legal and institutional frameworks to stamp out corruption and push for political reform. He asked Park to provide answers to his demands after she returns from her four-nation trip to Latin America next week.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","resignation of president park geun ,moon also pressured president park ,corrupt politics moon from the ,government and the disgraced businessman ,thursday called for the resignation","['Moon Jae - in', 'Park Geun', 'Moon', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Sung Woan - jong', 'Saenuri Party', 'Roh ’s', 'Moon', 'Roh', 'Sung', 'Moon', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the National Assembly', 'Seoul', 'Lee Byung - kee', 'Justice', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Woo Byung - woo', 'Keangnam Enterprises', 'Sung', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Lee', 'Moon', 'Roh', 'Sung', 'Cheong', 'Roh', 'Roh', 'Sung', 'the Justice Ministry', 'Roh', 'NPAD', 'Roh', 'Sung', 'Lee Myung - bak ’s', 'Lee', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Moon', 'Roh', 'Moon', 'Lee', 'Moon', 'Park', 'Song Sang - ho']",3,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.48037893  0.48983216

I express my deepest regrets to everyone at the university,” Park said in a statement released Tuesday. Park had prompted an uproar from university professors after he threatened to fire those opposing the board’s plans to alter the university’s admission process through vulgar remarks made in an email sent out to the president of CAU and some 20 professors at the university.The outgoing Doosan Heavy chairman had written, “It isn’t good manners to not strike ones neck when one has asked for it” and that he “would strike in the most bloody and painful way possible,” vowing to use his “authority over faculty appointment to take revenge” on those opposing the board’s plans.Chung-Ang University is scheduled to convene an emergency board of directors meeting soon to discuss Park’s profanity.The prosecution plans to summon Park for his ties to former CAU president Park Bum-hoon, who has been under investigation for allegedly abusing his power to grant special privileges to the university while he worked as a senior secretary for education under the former President Lee Myung-bak.By Sohn Ji-young (jys@heraldcorp.com)","fire for threatening university professors ,threatening university professors who opposed ,university professors after he threatened ,korean olympic committee park resignation ,professors who opposed forthcoming school","['Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction', 'Park Yong - sung', 'Chung - Ang University', 'Seoul', 'the Korean Olympic Committee', 'Park ’s', 'CAU', 'Park', 'CAU', 'Doosan Heavy', 'Chung - Ang University', 'Park ’s', 'CAU', 'Park Bum - hoon', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Sohn Ji - young']",11,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.19035818  0.05341849

Kim Moon-soo. Both members of the Saenuri Party, they are likely to pass the parliamentary hearing as Hwang has already done so and Kim is considered to be relatively neutral.Among the bureaucrats is former Finance Minister Yoon Jeung-hyun. Yoon served as chief of the Financial Supervisory Service during the Roh Moo-hyun administration and Minister of Strategy and Finance during the Lee Myung-bak administration. He is considered a veteran administrator.“I think politicians are likely to get nominated (for the Prime Minister),” said Choi Young-jin, professor of Korean politics at Chung-Ang University. “Candidates require parliamentary support ― mostly from the ruling party ― to get through parliamentary hearings. Plus, the president will need someone who can secure the ruling party’s support in her third year of presidency.” Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo stepped down late Monday, posing a challenge for the government over the premiership that has been a source of frequent political tension.The president is expected to accept his resignation after she returns. In the meantime, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan will serve as an acting prime minister.Lee’s offer of resignation came only 63 days after he took office, potentially marking him the shortest-ever-serving prime minister. Five prime ministers or prime minister-designates have so far resigned during the Park administration. Three of them ― Kim Yong-joon, Ahn Dae-hee and Moon Chang-keuk ― never set foot in the prime minister’s office, as they stepped down before being officially appointed after harsh parliamentary hearings. “The prime minister’s absence takes a toll on the presidency,” said Choi. “One of the prime minister’s major roles is to communicate between the president and the executive branch. It needs to relay the president’s intentions to bureaucrats and vice versa,” said Choi.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","graft scandal experts said president ,resign over graft scandal experts ,scandal experts said president park ,scandal experts said president ,appointed after harsh parliamentary hearings","['Lee Wan - koo', 'Park Geun', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Kim Moon - soo', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Hwang', 'Kim', 'Finance', 'Yoon Jeung - hyun', 'Yoon', 'the financial Supervisory Service', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Finance', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Choi Young - jin', 'korean', 'Chung - Ang University', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Choi Kyung - hwan', 'Lee', 'Park', 'Kim Yong - joon', 'Ahn Dae - hee', 'Moon Chang - keuk', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",11,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35442409  0.65392965

Moon Jae-in, chair of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, urged the governing Saenuri Party to agree to an impeachment motion to be submitted by as early as Wednesday. If the ruling party accedes, it appears likely the motion will pass.“Lee’s (alleged) involvement in a graft scandal has paralyzed the government,” Moon said earlier Monday. “The longer the scandal drags on, the more burden it will be on the Park Geun-hye administration. The Saenuri Party must agree to vote on impeaching Lee,” he added. Lee Wan-koo. (Yonhap)Many of the majority Saenuri Party lawmakers and almost the entire opposition are expected to support the motion, parliamentary sources said. President Park must approve the motion for it to take effect.“I don’t think the scandal will even last that long,” Yoon Pyung-joong, professor at Hanshin University, said, suggesting that Lee could either succumb to the pressure to resign, or Park would be forced to sack him. “Not only would (the Assembly impeaching) a prime minister be unprecedented, but the president would need to distance herself from Lee unless she wants to risk becoming a lame duck with still more than half of her term left.”South Korea has considered impeachment motions for eight of its past prime ministers, and has put three of those motions to a legislative vote since the country’s founding in 1948. However, the Assembly has never approved an impeachment against a prime minister.Lee allegedly accepted 30 million won ($28,000) in unlisted campaign funds in the April 2013 parliamentary by-elections from the late Sung Woan-jong according to a local newspaper’s interview with the businessman on April 9, hours before the police found him dead in an apparent suicide.The prime minister has denied accepting any black money from Sung. Lee has also denied having close relations with the deceased. But prosecutors on Sunday said phone records showed Lee and Sung had up to 210 phone conversations since March last year, adding to the mounting evidence against Lee.Sung is the former chair of construction firm Keangnam Enterprises and a former governing party lawmaker.Prosecutors had been probing Sung in the days before his death, on allegations that the mogul had swindled government subsidies, a charge that he vehemently denied. Sung had called the investigations against him a witch-hunt at a press conference on the eve of his death.One day later, hours before his death, Sung alleged giving illegal funds to Lee and other Park administration officials, in the run-up to the 2012 presidential race and also before the 2007 Grand National Party presidential primary. The GNP is the Saenuri Party’s forerunner.Authorities on Sunday added they had evidence backing allegations that Sung had also bribed financial regulators when Keangnam Enterprises had been under a workout program in 2013.Park officials linked to Sung’s graft claims have denied receiving money. They include South Gyeongsang Province Gov. Hong Joon-pyo, former presidential chiefs of staff Huh Tae-yeol and Kim Ki-choon, Saenuri Rep. Hong Moon-jong, and Lee, among others.Justice Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn expressed concern on Monday at a hearing in the Assembly that the ongoing probes were challenging, as Sung’s allegations dated back to 2007, and also because he is no longer alive to provide further testimonies.The growing scandal is also expected to adversely influence the Saenuri Party candidates running in the parliamentary by-elections on April 29, observers said. Four parliamentary seats are on the line.Saenuri chair Rep. Kim Moo-sung appeared to renew efforts to minimize the scandal’s impact on the coming polls when he apologized to voters on Monday.“The (Sung Woan-jong scandal) has shown how much politicians have lost the public’s trust,” Kim said. “I take this moment to apologize as one of those politicians.”“The Saenuri Party will ensure that ongoing prosecutorial probes into the scandal will be carried out justly. We will agree to any special prosecution probe if current investigations fail,” the five-term lawmaker added.The alleged bribe scandal is impeding the Park administration’s efforts to implement its policy agenda this year as lawmakers shift focus to the scandal, and away from legislative revisions to South Korea’s public service pension and other initiatives Park calls “key reforms.”By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","apologized to voters on monday ,witch hunt at press conference ,the assembly impeaching prime minister ,opposition party leader on monday ,scandal has paralyzed the government","['Lee Wan - koo', 'Moon Jae - in', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Saenuri Party', 'Moon', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Lee', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park', 'Yoon Pyung - joong', 'Hanshin University', 'Lee', 'Park', 'Assembly', 'Lee', 'Korea', 'Assembly', 'Lee', 'Sung Woan - jong', 'Sung', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Sung', 'Lee', 'Sung', 'Keangnam Enterprises', 'Sung', 'Sung', 'Sung', 'Lee', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'Sung', 'Keangnam Enterprises', 'Sung ’s', 'South Gyeongsang Province', 'Hong Joon - pyo', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'Saenuri', 'Hong Moon - jong', 'Lee', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Assembly', 'Sung ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Sung Woan - jong', 'Kim', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park', 'South Korea ’s', 'Jeong Hunny']",8,"[ 0.          0.          4.         ... -0.40127569 -0.12383813

The list includes officials from the ruling and main opposition parties.Investigators are considering questioning political heavyweights late next week, starting with South Gyeongsang Gov. Hong Joon-pyo, according to reports. The former ruling party chairman is one of eight whose names appeared in a memo left by former Keangnam chairman Sung Woan-jong before his apparent suicide last week.  An official enters the office of the National Digital Forensic Center as the prosecution focuses on recovering data from devices owned by those linked to Sung Woan-jong on Friday. (Yonhap)Hong, a former ruling party leader, is accused of accepting 100 million won from Sung through a middleman.The special investigation team has seized a 30-page secret document from Sung’s aides. It reportedly includes 14 names of political officials, including up to eight from the main opposition party. Authorities said Friday they were looking into 34 pieces of evidence, including hard drives and cell phones confiscated from Keangnam Enterprise and the late chairman’s aides. The investigation team has sent material to a digital forensic department to restore deleted files, which are believed to contain a list of lawmakers who Sung and his company delivered money to. Authorities have also reportedly secured surveillance footage of Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo’s campaign office when he was running for a by-election in 2013. Sung claimed he delivered 30 million won to Lee. The prime minister, however, has denied the claim and his ties with Sung. Authorities have refused to elaborate on plans to summon politicians, citing a lack of evidence.“For now, we are trying to restore (deleted) files as much as possible in order to go to the next level,“ said an official at the team. “Questioning of (witnesses or suspects) could only start after reviewing documents.”Amid the prosecution’s widening probe, Saenuri chairman Kim Moo-sung urged the nation to root out rampant political corruption and praised President Park Geun-hye, saying she can effectively lead the anti-graft mission. Kim and Park met in a closed-door meeting Thursday afternoon before the president left for a 12-day Latin America trip.The president said she would take every possible means to resolve escalating graft allegations, including launching an independent probe. She also said she would determine the fate of the embattled prime minister after she returns from her trip. Lee, one of the eight on the graft memo, has been pressured from both parties to step down from his post. But Rep. Moon Jae-in, chairman of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, lashed out at the prosecution over reports the authorities could include opposition lawmakers as part of their graft probe.The prosecution has raided former Keangnam executives who managed finances for the firm between 2002 and 2008, when former liberal President Roh Moo-hyun was in power. He said the prosecution is diluting its ongoing investigation into ruling party members. “(The prosecution) appears to be attempting to water down the investigation by dragging the opposition party to it. I feel outraged,” said Rep. Moon.He also urged the prime minister to voluntarily step down from the post, saying it would keep his honor intact and release the political burden from President Park. Despite mounting calls, Lee told reporters Friday he would focus on state affairs “more diligently” than before during the president’s trip to South America.Park’s approval rating dropped to 34 percent this week, down 5 percentage points from the previous week, according to local polls by Gallup Korea.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","opposition party authorities said friday ,suicide last week an official ,political heavyweights late next week ,political corruption and praised president ,seized 30 page secret document","['South Gyeongsang', 'Hong Joon - pyo', 'Keangnam', 'Sung Woan - jong', 'the National Digital Forensic Center', 'Sung Woan - jong', 'Yonhap)Hong', 'Sung ’s', 'Keangnam Enterprise', 'Sung', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Sung', 'Lee', 'Sung', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Park Geun', 'Kim', 'Park', 'Lee', 'Moon Jae - in', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Keangnam', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Moon', 'Lee', 'Park ’s', 'Gallup Korea', 'Cho Chung - un']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45279729  0.59781617

The mainstream group of victims' families has been critical of the government and the ruling party's handling of the aftermath of the ferry accident, including a compensation package offered to the families before the submerged ship has been recovered from the sea.The 6,825-ton ferry Sewol sank off Jindo Island on April 16, 2014, claiming the lives of more than 300 people.""As the government earlier decided to salvage the ship following the president's announcement to do so, the Saenuri Party will also muster efforts to recover the vessel as soon as possible,"" Yoo told reporters before leaving the accident site. Succumbing to overloading and strong currents, the illegally refurbished ferry sank off the southwest coast, leaving 304 passengers dead or missing.

Jung Chung-rai of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy said in a statement.The move comes as pressure mounts on the embattled prime minister over the snowballing bribery scandal involving a businessman who killed himself last week.In a memo and media interview before his suicide, Sung Wan-jong, a former head of a mid-size construction firm, claimed that he gave up to several millions of dollars to eight heavyweight politicians, mostly close aides to President Park Geun-hye.The prime minister is accused of accepting 30 million won($27,000) in cash from Sung while Lee was running for a parliamentary seat in April 2013.Despite Lee's strong denial of the bribery allegations, the ruling and opposition parties stepped up calls for his resignation as the prosecution launched its investigation into the scandal.In the statement, Jung claimed that Lee is trying to hold onto the prime minister position to fend off the prosecution's broadening investigation. There would be enough legal grounds for an impeachment if Lee's denial of the suspected bribery is found to be false because lying in a parliamentary session constitutes perjury, Jung said in the statement.The parliament can initiate an impeachment motion against a prime minister if one-third of the lawmakers endorse it. The impeachment proceedings are referred to the Constitutional Court if half of the 294-strong National Assembly votes in favor.So far, no South Korean prime minister has been impeached.Faced with the relentless resignation pressure, the embattled prime minister apologized for the scandal although he still denied the suspicions. ""Whatever the reason, I feel very sorry,"" Lee said in a National Assembly session.He also defied the resignation demand, saying that he cannot decide whether to quit because of a memo or unilateral claim.

The resolution was put to a vote four days after a special parliamentary panel on history supported it.“We strongly condemn repeated provocations by the Japanese government that infringe on our territorial sovereignty and fabricate history,” said the resolution.“We express our regret over (Tokyo’s) two-sided approach: On the surface, it talks about fostering a future-oriented relationship on the 50th anniversary of the normalization of ties, but behind the scenes, it distorts and fabricates history, and encroaches upon our territory.”The resolution came after Tokyo recently published a set of foreign and defense policy papers in which it described Dokdo as part of its territory. It also approved elementary and middle school textbooks in which Dokdo was described as Japan’s islets.“The issue of distorted history in school textbooks is fostering conflicts not only for the current generation, but also for future generations of both countries. And we express our serious regrets over it,” the resolution reads.The resolution also lashed out at Tokyo for approving middle-school history textbooks that contain arguments about the “Imna Japanese Headquarters.”Some in Japan have argued that Japan advanced into the southern part of the Korean Peninsula during the late fourth century and ruled part of the peninsula with the Imna Japanese Headquarters in Korea’s ancient Gaya Kingdom (A.D. 42-562). “Talk about the Imna Japanese Headquarters represents Japan’s intention to return to its past militarism. Tokyo should immediately repent for it. We call on it to rectify (the historical distortion),” the resolution said.The passage of the resolution reflected the growing anti-Japanese sentiment here, which has made it difficult for both governments to pursue practical cooperation in security and other areas. Washington’s push for the trilateral security cooperation with Seoul and Tokyo has also been stymied by historical animosities between the two countries. Amid deepening public resentment, President Park Geun-hye and her Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe have not been able to arrange a bilateral summit yet. Since her inauguration in February 2013, Park has met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping six times.The conservative Tokyo government has shown a revisionist view of history, refusing to accept calls from Seoul and Beijing for more contrition regarding its wartime atrocities including the sexual enslavement of Asian women during World War II.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","tuesday passed resolution condemning tokyo ,passed resolution condemning tokyo repeated ,tuesday passed resolution condemning ,regret over tokyo two sided ,on tuesday passed resolution condemning","['the National Assembly', 'Tokyo', 'South Korea ’s', 'japanese', 'Tokyo ’s', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Japanese', 'Korea', 'Gaya Kingdom', 'Japanese', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'anti - japanese', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Park Geun', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Park', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'asian']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23901895  0.22122252

The April Revolution in 2010 ousted former President Kurmanbek Bakiyev and established a new constitution and parliament as the first Central Asian country. Bakiyev replaced his predecessor Askar Akayev in a landslide election victory in 2005 after the Tulip Revolution.“Since 2010, our country embarked on a path of democracy and development. There’s no turning back,” the ambassador echoed Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev’s address on Tuesday, which paid homage to the revolutionary achievements, in an interview with The Korea Herald. Kyrgyzstan, where 28 percent of the population is ethnic minority, is taking steps to integrate multiethnic groups and rebuild housing and infrastructure. To end corruption, the government implemented the Istanbul Action Plan at the OECD meeting in Paris in March. It also adopted the National Strategy for Sustainable Development aimed at achieving social integration; establishing the rule of law; improving business environment; and eliminating poverty.A string of market reforms has been installed by privatizing state companies; setting up fair rules of competition; and opening doors to foreign investment through free economic zones. Agriculture, mining, transport, communications and tourism sectors have potential for collaboration. “Unlike the Chinese, Russian, Turkish and Iranian companies, which have long operated in our country, trade and investment between Kyrgyzstan and Korea do not adequately reflect the two economies’ growth prospects,” Chotonov said. The ambassador added that Korean companies can invest in hydropower and infrastructure construction. A delegation from the Kyrgyzstani Parliament and Ministry of Agriculture and Melioration is participating in the World Water Forum 2015 in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province. Kyrgyzstan is the third-largest producer of hydropower in the Commonwealth of Independent States, generating over 14 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually from its 252 rivers. The country also produces 840 million tons oil-equivalent of renewable energy through hydro, solar and wind powers.The Kyrgyz government signed an agreement with the Korea International Cooperation Agency last year to receive official development assistance. Korea’s POSCO and Mineral Resources Authority and Mine Reclamation Corporation are operating in the capital Bishkek.

It said about 300 civic groups would join the rallies.The KCTU, in particular, has already vowed to take the initiative in staging sit-in protests or going on general strike before politicians pass the bill.While the union of civil servants claims the government is seeking to fill its budget deficit with money from the pockets from civil servants, ruling party lawmakers stress that the nation has to act to government debt from ballooning.Meanwhile, the Saenuri party also clarified that it would pass the bill on mandating CCTV installation at all day care centers, aimed at preventing child abuse, in the April session.It also plans to carry out coordination with opposition parties to seek ways to pass the motion on human rights conditions in North Korea in the coming parliamentary session.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","general strike before politicians pass ,servants are threatening protests against ,civil servants are threatening protests ,on general strike before politicians ,threatening protests against the ruling","['Saenuri Party ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Kim', 'the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions', 'KCTU', 'Saenuri', 'CCTV', 'North Korea', 'Kim Yon - se']",10,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.62456399 -0.04261719

She said the draft included three key elements of banning unjust business favors and bribe taking and preventing public officials from pursuing private benefits in handling their given work. But the last element was omitted from the final law, she said.Commenting on the controversy over the law's constitutionality for including journalists and private school teachers among those subject to it, Kim said, ""I don't think this goes against the Constitution."" She cited a recent public survey in which nearly 70 percent of South Koreans answered in favor of the inclusion. ""I think we can't just criticize this as wrong at a time when there are already moves to reform in the civilian sector,"" she said. ""The law, in particular, expanded its scope to fields with strong social responsibilities, so I also don't think this violates people's rights for equality.""Last week, the Korean Bar Association filed a petition with the Constitutional Court challenging the constitutionality of the law, arguing that it has elements that possibly go against the Constitution and problems of fairness.The association said the law's inclusion of journalists among those subject to it can infringe on freedom of the press and people's rights for equality and the law's articles requiring people to report their spouses' acceptance of a bribe or expensive gifts to the authorities or face criminal punishment go against principles of freedom of conscience and self-responsibility in the Constitution.During the news conference, Kim also voiced regret for the law's limitation of the scope of family members with duty to report acceptance of bribes to ""spouse.""The event comes amid rival parties' moves to amend the newly passed anti-corruption law among mounting questions over its scope and constitutionality.The bill's hasty passage is widely seen as an attempt by lawmakers to please voters ahead of next year's parliamentary elections as public demand for the legislation has been high in a country where corruption involving public officials causes national outrage.The law is scheduled to go into effect in September 2016 with a grace period of one and a half years from the day when it is promulgated.

Yoo Il-ho, the minister-designate for land, infrastructure and transport, along with Rep. Yoo Ki-june, the nominee for oceans and fisheries minister, were the first to be grilled by the National Assembly in this week’s confirmation hearings of Park’s new Cabinet. Yoo Il-hoThe main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy said it doubted the nominees’ “sincerity,” pointing to their reluctance to state their position in running for reelection in next year’s general election. Doing so would leave them a maximum of 10 months in their ministerial posts.“Both nominees have at best about eight months to serve in their positions, excluding the time it takes for them to adjust to their new jobs. The nominees will have little time to carry out any meaningful policy initiatives,” NPAD Rep. Lee Un-ju said. Yoo Ki-juneAll candidates running for legislative seats must resign from public office at least 90 days before the vote. NPAD Rep. Hwang Ju-hong said, “Former Prime Minister Nam Duk-woo once said two years were far from enough time to get anything done. … I can’t help but ask, what you will do in 10 months.”Both appointees refused to comment on whether they would run in 2016.As criticism mounted over the two appointees’ credentials with the opposition accusing the designation as deriving from their political affinity to the president, some of the ruling party members joined in.“How will you lead an organization knowing that you will likely vacate your position in the near future?” Saenuri Rep. Lee Jong-bae asked the nominee for oceans and fisheries minister.The two also face allegations of property speculation, tax evasion and other “morally questionable” actions in the past.Yoo Il-ho is accused of evading up to 7.64 million won in taxes ($6,870) when he sold an apartment in 2005. Yoo Ki-june is also questioned for his vote in 2012 in favor of disbanding the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries.Both Yoos have also admitted to illegally having changed the home addresses of their children so that they could attend schools in wealthier neighborhoods.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","opposition lawmakers on monday grilled ,opposition lawmakers on monday ,lawmakers on monday grilled two ,juneall candidates running for legislative ,lawmakers on monday grilled","['Park Geun - hye ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'Yoo Il - ho', 'Yoo Ki', 'the National Assembly', 'Park', 'Cabinet', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Lee Un - ju', 'Ki - juneAll', 'Hwang Ju - hong', 'Nam Duk - woo', 'Saenuri', 'Lee Jong - bae', 'Yoo Il - ho', 'Yoo Ki - june', 'the Ministry of Oceans', 'Yoos', 'Jeong Hunny']",1,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.43394586  0.26351491

He also cited the “worsening business environment.”While the business sector is likely to demand a restricted hike of between 0 and less than 5 percent, the Finance Ministry is reportedly pushing for a hike of about 10 percent.The 2014 minimum salary in Korea is 5,580 won per hour, up 7.2 percent from a year earlier. When an employee works eight hours a day, he or she is paid 1.16 million won a month and 13.99 million won a year.Some labor groups demand a hike of 20 to 30 percent, reiterating that the current minimum wage does not even meet the minimum cost of living in the nation.Employment and Labor Minister Lee Ki-kweon, meanwhile, supported the wage hike, saying Monday that the ministry would “reflect President Park Geun-hye’s instructions to narrow the income gap” between the haves and the have-nots in its fine-tuning of the hike level.While the labor sector welcomed the minimum wage hike in theory, some also stressed that the policy should not eventually target the more flexible labor market in which businesses will be allowed to increase the ratio of temporary workers and have authority to dismiss them easily.Moon Jae-in, chairman of the opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, argued that it was necessary to increase the minimum monthly income. “The business sector should seriously review the situation that a four-family member household manages to live with a monthly income of just 1.1 million won,” he said.According to the Employment-Labor Ministry, the Roh Moo-hyun administration raised the minimum wage by 13.1 percent between 2005 and 2006, the Lee Myung-bak administration by 2.75 percent between 2010 and 2011 and the Park Geun-hye administration by 7.2 percent between 2013 and 2014.Meanwhile, Samsung Group downplayed speculation that its flagship Samsung Electronics had frozen workers’ pay, arguing that the freeze only applied to basic pay. “Considering the hike in performance-based pay and various allowances, the real increase comes to 4.2 percent on average.”The minimum wage for 2015 will be determined in early August.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","pressure businesses to accept wage ,hike will undermine the financial ,government looks to pressure businesses ,businesses to accept wage raises ,some labor groups demand hike","['the Finance Ministry', 'Choi Kyung - hwan', 'Saenuri Party', 'Choi ’s', 'the Korea Employers Federation', 'South Korea', 'the United States', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'GNI', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Australia', 'Korea', 'KEF', 'Bahk Byung - won', 'the Finance Ministry', 'Korea', 'Labor', 'Lee Ki - kweon', 'Park Geun', 'Moon Jae - in', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'the Employment - Labor Ministry', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Samsung Group', 'Samsung Electronics', 'Kim Yon - se']",10,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -0.37335381  0.21627678

Yoo Seong-min sparked a public backlash, as he hinted at the possibility that there were lobbying activities from owners of day care centers to hamper passage of the bill.Though Yoo stressed that many Saenuri lawmakers held firm convictions that human rights could be breached if the surveillance cameras are installed, he neither denied nor confirmed pressure from the child care center industry. Ruling Saenuri Party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung (right) and floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min attend a party meeting Wednesday at the National Assembly. (Yonhap)“(I don’t know) if the pressures from nurseries or kindergartens somewhat affected (the parliamentary rejection),” Yoo said in the meeting of party leaders.Saying that the Saenuri Party should also be held accountable for failing to pass the bill, he promised to offer more opportunities for debates in the coming April extraordinary session of the National Assembly.While the main opposition New Politics Alliance for New Democracy also apologized, young parents’ anger at politicians appeared to grow.Parents’ groups denounced lawmakers for not taking appropriate countermeasures against abuses by nursery employees on young children despite a series of high-profile child abuse incidents.“(Many lawmakers) are not ignorant of children’s human rights as they regard the day care centers as part of teachers’ private lives,” parents’ group Haneul Sopoong said in a statement.Some raised the speculation that lawmakers made a dubious “political decision” ahead of the April 29 by-elections. “It seems that the Saenuri Party was seeking to take the initiative in passing the CCTV bill in the April session right before the elections,” one netizen claimed. Opponents of the bill cite the cost of installing CCTV at all nurseries ― estimated at about 60 billion won ($54.5 million) ― and doubts of its efficacy in preventing child abuse.Nationwide concern about child abuse by day care staff erupted in January after a 33-year-old female worker at an Incheon day care center was caught on CCTV beating a 4-year-old for not finishing her meal.Similar cases followed, including one in which three female workers hit children under 5 for not finishing meals or following the class. One of them was found to have put wet tissues in the mouth of a 22-month-old, according to police.On Tuesday, the bill was voted down in the plenary session of the Assembly as the yes vote of 83 failed to reach the majority of 86 among the 171 attendees.

Private school owners were also included on the list at the last minute. But other groups including lawmakers, civic group activists, lawyers and conglomerate executives were excluded, stoking criticism.Further, spouses will also be penalized if they accept more than 1 million won in cash, gifts or services.The legislation is expected to curb the scale of gifts, congratulatory money, condolence money and cash given in an attempt to build cozy relations with government officials, employees at private schools and employees in the media.Major civic groups have welcomed the bill, claiming that it will improve transparency in areas including personnel policy.But some lawmakers from both the ruling and opposition parties continue to question the bill’s feasibility and a possible breach of the Constitution.Rep. Lee Sang-min of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy said the law was influenced by conflicts of interest.Lee was quoted as criticizing his fellow lawmakers for neglecting clauses that would directly affect them, citing conflict of interest.Some lawmakers are also prone to pressuring companies to hire their relatives, while arranging adviser posts at various private entities, he claimed.Lee and some other critics also denounced the Assembly for omitting civic group activists from the target list, claiming they were also subject to scrutiny considering past cases. They cited a leader from a citizens’ right advocate group monitoring speculative capital, who was recently taken into custody for taking bribes from the U.S.-based Lone Star Funds. Rep. Kwon Sung-dong of the ruling Saenuri Party also pointed out possible abuse of power by authorities due to the wide scope of fields that the bill targets.According to current laws, prosecutors must prove that a suspected official received monetary gifts for a specific purpose. The new anticorruption law, however, states that all those who accept more than 1 million won, regardless of the purpose, will be subject to punishment.Kwon raised the possibility of violation of the Constitution, stressing that the law restricts the nongovernmental sector too tightly. In addition, he cited the issue of fairness, saying that there were many private sectors “with public functions” like private schools and the media.He also said the law went against the freedom of conscience, pointing to the obligation to report to investigative authorities any irregularities committed by a spouse.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","services will be jailed for ,million won in cash gifts ,spouses will also be penalized ,passed the national assembly tuesday ,fellow lawmakers for neglecting clauses","['the National Assembly', 'Lee Sang - min', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Assembly', 'Kwon Sung - dong', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kwon', 'Kim Yon - se']",11,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.31816328  0.26071462

(Yonhap)For gifts that are work-related and worth 1 million won or less, the penalty is a fine of up to five times the gift's value.""We respect the decision of the National Assembly,"" presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook told reporters shortly after Air Force One touched down in Riyadh.He also said he expects the law to help root out corruption in a country that has a track record of cozy relationships between politicians and businessmen.Min is accompanying President Park Geun-hye, who is visiting Saudi Arabia, the second stop on her four-nation swing that will take her from Kuwait to the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.Passage of the bill had been delayed amid wrangling over its details, including a clause that requires public officials to report a family member's acceptance of a bribe.Critics argued that the clause infringes on the constitutionally-guaranteed freedom of conscience and destroys family relationships.On Monday, the ruling Saenuri Party and main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy agreed to keep that clause but limit the scope of another clause to apply the law only to public officials and their spouses, not their other family members.The official, not the spouse, would be subject to the relevant punishment.The parties also agreed to allow an 18-month grace period for enforcement of the law from the date of its proclamation.The bill was drawn up to tighten loopholes in existing anti-corruption rules under which public officials cannot be punished for accepting expensive gifts and services unless there is evidence of reciprocity.Hailing the law's passage, civic groups expressed hopes that it will serve as an opportunity to sever the chain of corruption in the Korean society and make the country more transparent.Speaking during a party meeting earlier in the day, NPAD Chairman Moon Jae-in said the new law's removal of the distinction between work-related and unrelated gifts is a ""big achievement.""South Korea has climbed three notches in an international corruption awareness ranking to 43rd out of 175 countries in 2014, according to a global anti-corruption watchdog.The Berlin-based Transparency International said in December that South Korea scored 55 out of 100 in its 2014 Corruption Perceptions Index, with high scores meaning low corruption.Also Tuesday, the parliament voted down a bill that requires child care centers to install surveillance cameras in a 83-42 vote with 46 blank ballots. The bill was proposed after the disclosure of video footage of a 33-year old female teacher striking a 4-year-old girl and ordering her to finish her leftovers at a day care center in Incheon in January, which caused widespread public outrage.

She had allegedly posted politically sensitive messages online ahead of the presidential election scheduled for later that month.The four lawmakers, who are now members of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, said the 35-hour campout did not constitute illegal confinement.""We did not confine Kim. We were only trying to uncover the truth behind the NIS's illegal electioneering,"" an attorney said on behalf of the four at the hearing held at the Seoul Central District Court.South Korea's Public Official Election Act prohibits NIS officials from voicing their political opinions ahead of the presidential election.While agent Kim was never charged with violating the act, two former ranking NIS officials and the former head of the NIS, Won Sei-hoon, were found guilty of illegal electioneering by an appellate court last month. Won has since requested a Supreme Court trial.The election victory of President Park Geun-hye, the then ruling party candidate, over her main opposition candidate came at a slim margin of 3.6 percentage points. The neck-and-neck result has unnerved opposition lawmakers, who claim the NIS's alleged online smear campaign against their candidates is what turned the tide in Park's favor.""Even if what we did comprises illegal confinement, the fact that the NIS meddled in the election should exempt us from punishment,"" the lawmakers' attorney said.The second hearing is scheduled for March 23.

Revisions to cut pension payments have been raised as ways to secure the sustainability of the civil servant pension fund.  ""Seoul Mayor Park has recently made a remark that goes against the pension reform, saying that pensions are the only hope for low-paying civil servants,"" Kim said in the meeting of senior party members earlier in the morning.   ""It was very inconsiderate of him to make the improper remark as someone well-aware of the financial difficulties of the country,"" Kim said, adding that such a dissenting remark lets down those preparing for public employment.  Claiming that Park indicated the need to push back the April deadline set for the outlining of the reform, the party leader also noted that the reform drive will lose momentum if that happens.   ""Mayor Park should know the scale of the public pension's shortfall before making such remarks,"" he also said, bitterly criticizing the mayor.  Park immediately hit back, releasing the recording of the interview and clarifying that he didn't oppose the pension reform plan.   ""As shown in the recording, it was nothing more or less than the opinion that anything wrong in the civil workers' pension plan should be addressed, although prudence is needed (in doing so),"" Kim In-chul, the city government's spokesman, said.   The full sentence of what Park said in the interview carried out three days earlier was ""(The reform) should be well discussed as (pensions) are the only hope for civil workers.""   Touching on the April deadline, the mayor noted, ""I understand that the reform should be implemented when the momentum is in the air, but the process for social consensus is important as well.""  The recent bickering between the two president hopefuls reflects their subtle cleavage over the reform drive.   Park and Kim have been widely cited as the most promising presidential candidates from the liberal and conservative blocs for the next presidential election set for late 2017.

Baek Jae-hyun of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy said the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy wrote in response to his inquiry that there was no behind-the-scenes agreement and U.S. beef imports were resumed following a year of bilateral negotiations on the safety of the meat.  ""The government, under the premise of guaranteeing public health and food safety as much as possible, concluded negotiations based on scientific grounds, international standards and the national interest,"" the trade ministry said, according to the letter disclosed by Baek.  The ministry's response comes amid controversy over former President Lee Myung-bak's claim in his recently published memoir that his administration resumed U.S. beef imports in his first year in office due to a prior secret agreement between his predecessor, late President Roh Moo-hyun, and then U.S. President George W. Bush.  The decision to start imports sparked weeks of massive anti-government street protests as many viewed it as a hasty move without the guarantee of safety checks against mad cow disease.  ""As former President Roh said in a statement in April 2007 that (the negotiations) would be concluded within a reasonable period in line with the recommendations of the World Organization for Animal Health, we understand that there was no behind-the-scene agreement,"" the letter said.  The agriculture and foreign ministries also confirmed that there was no secret agreement, it added.  Baek accused Lee of making false claims in his memoir in order to escape responsibility for his decision.  ""The government has officially confirmed that the content of the memoir is false,"" he said.

But contradictory tax policies and debates over constitutional reforms threaten to derail Park’s proposed economic restructuring reforms.Many of Park’s initiatives were initially welcomed by the public. Her catchphrase during the 2012 presidential race, “welfare without taxation,” received particular applause. Support for her proposed reform of the national pension for retired civil servants has also been high.  President Park Geun-hye (Yonhap)Multiple polls dating back to last September have shown public support for the pension reforms ranging from 60 to 80 percent.Pension reforms could save the government up to 55 trillion won ($49.5 billion), government statistics show. Park has said that money could be used to finance her welfare policies.Scandals involving Park’s top aides and former National Intelligence Service chief Won Sei-hoon have dominated debates in the National Assembly, though, impeding moves to discuss and legislate Park’s proposed reforms. Park aides were accused of monopolizing access to the president, to the frustration of top Cabinet officials. Won is accused of having illegally swayed public opinion in the weeks leading up to the 2012 election by posting online comments. The tobacco tax hike last December likewise hindered Park’s reforms by sparking a public uproar against her government, as the policy appeared to go against Park’s pledges to increase welfare without increasing taxes. The public mood worsened in January when tax settlement calculations showed taxpayers this year would have to forfeit much of their returns or even pay more taxes.Many of the legislations considered “critical” to Park’s efforts to boost economic growth here have been left pending. These include the pension reforms, bills aiming to energize tourism and bills facilitating crowdfunding for start-ups.And although prosecutors found accusations against Park’s aides “factually erroneous,” public trust in the Park administration appears low. The Feb. 9 guilty ruling against Won by an appellate court in Seoul did not help.Gallup Korea reported that only 30 percent of the public supported Park as of Feb. 12, in a survey of 1,010 adults nationwide. The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percent on a 95 percent confidence level.“Park must begin prioritizing policies, and seriously start thinking about what kind of president she wants to be remembered as,” Seoul National University professor Kang Won-taek said.“Simply reforming the pension for retired civil servants is going to be a big challenge,” Hong-ik University professor Chung Goon-gi said. “The Park administration must become more efficient in its policymaking.”But prioritizing may not suffice for Park if rumors that lawmakers could begin discussing constitutional reforms in the coming months turn out true. Lawmakers have backed moves to reduce the president’s power over domestic affairs by revising the Constitution.Analysts say any debate on such changes is likely to hijack discussion on Park’s reforms, further lowering hopes for advocates of Park’s reforms.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","wednesday overshadowed by political scandals ,her third year in office ,2012 presidential race welfare without ,the tobacco tax hike last ,political scandals raging tax disputes","['Park Geun', 'North Korea', 'Park', 'Park ’s', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Park ’s', 'National Intelligence Service', 'Won Sei - hoon', 'the National Assembly', 'Park ’s', 'Cabinet', 'Won', 'Park ’s', 'Park', 'Park ’s', 'Park ’s', 'Park', 'Seoul', 'Gallup Korea', 'Park', 'Seoul National University', 'Kang Won - taek', 'Chung Goon - gi', 'Park', 'Park ’s', 'Park ’s', 'Jeong Hunny']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42260966  0.45571181

Yoo Seung-min, floor leader of the Saenuri Party, on Feb. 17 instructed the party’s policy-setting committee to review ways to introduce cheap tobacco products, though he said that nothing had yet been determined.Yoo reportedly cited the burden of the price hike on low-income citizens.His opposition counterpart Jeon Byung-hun seemingly echoed his remarks. Jeon said in a press release on Feb. 19 that it was necessary to release hand-rolling tobacco, which is cheaper than ordinary cigarettes.Government officials, however, expressed skepticism at the proposal.An official of the Health and Welfare Ministry expressed concern that an adoption of low-priced products would elevate public anger, as it could signal that the cigarette price hike was simply a way of increasing tax revenue.Ministries, including the Finance Ministry, and the ruling party have continued to argued that the price increase was a matter of public health, rather than tax revenues.In some countries, hand-rolled tobacco is sold in pouches that also include rolling papers or cigarette tubes.

The recently appointed vice minister of education, Kim Jae-choon, was to announce the government’s official position on the issue. “The general consensus around the ministry was that we need to gather more public opinion before announcing our position,” explained a ministry official. Kim acknowledged the reporters’ inconvenience but did not elaborate. But the ministry was unable to provide even a rough outline of the briefing upon inquiry on Monday morning, raising doubts about whether the officials had a firm grasp of the issue. Reporters were notified about the briefing just two days in advance ― unusually short notice for a press meeting on such an important issue. Furthermore, meetings held by such high-ranking officials are seldom canceled at the last minute.Another ministry official said Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea had not yet reviewed the content, and that he would mull things over during the Lunar New Year’s holiday. He added that officials may have hastily scheduled the briefing in the hope that Hwang would have had time to study the plans during the weekend.The Education Ministry rolled out plans last month to gradually expand the role of personality evaluations in the college admissions process, particularly for teaching courses. The move came after a spate of child abuse cases raised concerns about the ethics of teachers and child care workers.The initial response was a flurry of complaints by teachers and students, who were perplexed about having to deal with another admissions process. Authorities explained that they were not creating a new model for college admissions, but were simply looking to accredit colleges that use personality tests effectively and expand that model to other schools.But few parents were reassured by the ministry’s explanation. Only 8.7 percent of Korean adults said they had faith in the government’s education policy, according to a survey results announced last week by the Korean Educational Development Institute.

Legislators in Lee’s governing Saenuri Party are likely to have supported him in the secret ballot. The New Politics Alliance for Democracy likely opposed Lee, who is suspected of multiple ethical lapses in his 40-year political career. National Assembly Speaker Rep. Chung Ui-hwa opens the plenary session in which Rep. Lee Wan-koo of the ruling Saenuri Party was approved as the new prime minister on Monday. (Yonhap)The split vote means Lee’s political clout in his first months as prime minister is likely to be limited. Allegations lodged mainly by the NPAD that Lee evaded conscription, speculated in real estate and collaborated with the juntas of the 1980s will also curb his influence, analyst said.The vote came after a tense week of partisan deadlock. The plenary vote on Lee’s appointment was originally set for last Thursday. But the NPAD expressed its opposition to Lee, and threatened to boycott the Assembly indefinitely, unless the Saenuri Party agreed to delay the vote. Saenuri floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min acceded.Lee’s nomination late last month had initially received bipartisan support. Lee had earned the opposition’s trust through his role in mediating divisive partisan bills such as the special Sewol bill, as the Saenuri Party’s floor leader last year. The tables were turned, though, after reports of draft evasion and property speculation arose in Lee’s confirmation hearing last week. Avoiding the military draft is considered especially detrimental to public office seekers here as the nation is still technically at war with North Korea.NPAD Rep. Jin Sun-mee cited Military Manpower Administration records from the 1970s to assert that Lee had dodged the obligatory draft, possibly through taking advantage of his position as a civil official.Lee first denied the accusations under oath, saying he had received his first military medical test in Hongseong, South Chuncheong Province. But Jin charged that MMA papers showed Lee had received his medical exam in Seoul, raising concerns that Lee had committed perjury.Lee suffered another blow during his hearing when the NPAD divulged a voice recording of him apparently trying to intimidate journalists. He can be heard telling reporters that he “knows” higher-ups in the media industry who can get them fired if they write critical reports about him.Lee apologized, but public dissatisfaction with him appears to have risen due to the disclosure, according to pollsters Gallup Korea and Realmeter.In a Gallup poll of 1,010 adults nationwide from Feb. 10 to 12, only 29 percent approved Lee’s nomination. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percent. A Realmeter survey of 1,500 adults from Feb. 11 to 13 found that 38.7 percent of respondents were behind Lee, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percent.“Putting Lee in the Prime Minister’s Office may benefit us in the short term,” NPAD Rep. Hong Jong-haak said before the Monday vote. “But Rep. Lee is a consistent liar as was shown in last week’s hearing,” he added.President Park Geun-hye is likely to have picked Lee to serve as the Cabinet’s second-in-command for his skills as a deal-broker, as he could help break through the NPAD’s opposition to draft bills that Park has labeled “critical” for economic growth. These include bills aiming to boost crowdfunding and reforms of the national pension for retired civil servants.But the partisan strife over Lee’s suspected wrongdoings has cast a shadow over his credibility as the top government deputy, according to critics.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","281 votes in monday plenary ,in monday plenary session legislators ,monday vote but rep lee ,votes in monday plenary session ,new prime minister on monday","['the National Assembly', 'Lee Wan - koo ’s', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Saenuri Party', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Lee', 'National Assembly', 'Chung Ui - hwa', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee', 'NPAD', 'Lee', 'Lee ’s', 'NPAD', 'Lee', 'Assembly', 'Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'Lee', 'North Korea', 'Jin Sun - mee', 'Manpower Administration', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Hongseong', 'South Chuncheong Province', 'Jin', 'MMA', 'Lee', 'Seoul', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'NPAD', 'Lee', 'Gallup Korea', 'Gallup', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Prime Minister ’s Office', 'Hong Jong - haak', 'Lee', 'Park Geun', 'Lee', 'Park', 'Lee', 'Jeong Hunny']",8,"[ 0.          0.          3.         ... -0.26837233  0.20799972

All five sitting lawmakers of the party immediately lost their seats in the parliament.The decision was based on the assumption that Lee Seok-ki, one of the UPP lawmakers, planned to overthrow the South Korean government in case of a war with North Korea.In a ruling that apparently contradicts this assumption, however, the Supreme Court last month partially sided with Lee, finding him not guilty of plotting a rebellion but guilty of encouraging other members of his secret organization to do so.

Rep. Jin Sung-joon (Yonhap)Lee Wan-koo, former floor leader of the ruling Saenuri Party tapped for the post, said during last week's confirmation hearing that he asked the National Assembly Secretariat to correct his assets report after learning that he mistakenly omitted his 2003 purchase of the Tower Palace apartment. Rep. Jin Sung-joon of the main opposition New Politics Alliance said the secretariat has confirmed this was not true.The opposition has raised suspicions that Lee had accepted illegal political funds in 2002 that could have been used to purchase the high-class apartment in southern Seoul and that the nominee omitted the property from his assets list to hide the source of the money.The fresh allegation was raised on the eve of the parliamentary plenary session during which lawmakers would vote on whether to approve Lee as prime minister.After the hearings, the rival parties agreed to postpone the vote, initially expected Thursday, to Monday. Since being nominated last month, Lee has come under fire for alleged ethical lapses that include real estate speculations, attempts to control the press and the dodging of mandatory military service.By law, the candidate for prime minister must earn parliamentary approval.Bashing Lee for ""lying (about the transaction) in front of the people,"" Rep. Jin urged the nominee ""to make a decision"" in an apparent demand that he withdraw.The nominee did not comment on the fresh allegation.On Sunday, a group of opposition lawmakers issued a statement calling on Lee to ""expect no more leniency from the people and to voluntarily withdraw before the plenary session.""Lee is President Park's third nominee for prime minister since May, after the first two quit over allegations of ethical and other lapses. Lee's failure to win the approval could cause another major setback for the Park administration in running state affairs. Her approval rating has been nearing an all-time low for her administration.In South Korea, the prime minister is the second-highest position after the president, but the job has largely been a ceremonial role as power is concentrated heavily in the president.

Security Council have loudly accused Russia of backing separatists in Ukraine, but the threat of a Russian veto has blocked them from taking action in close to 30 meetings on the crisis. Now, Russia is asking for their support. Russia circulated a surprise draft resolution, obtained Friday by The Associated Press, endorsing the new cease-fire agreement on Ukraine and calling on all parties involved to fully carry it out. U.N. diplomats said the council is expected to meet Sunday to vote on the resolution, just hours after the cease-fire is to take effect at one minute after midnight.Russia, as a permanent member of the 15-seat council, can veto any proposed resolution it dislikes. It has denied backing the separatists in eastern Ukraine, who made a late grab for territory Friday before the cease-fire takes effect.The brief draft resolution expresses ``grave concern at the tragic events'' in the region. It says a solution to the conflict is possible ``exclusively'' by peaceful means. Russia last year offered a few resolutions calling for a cease-fire, but they were unpopular with council members who were angry over its annexation of Crimea early in the crisis. The United States quickly denounced one draft that called for establishing humanitarian aid corridors in the region as ``hypocritical.''This time, Russia's draft includes a reference to the ``sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine,'' something that Western diplomats have insisted that any U.N. resolution reaffirm. The latest cease-fire agreement was reached Thursday after long overnight talks among the presidents of Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France. Its terms include the formation of a sizeable buffer zone between Ukrainian forces and the rebels, while Ukraine regains control of its border with Russia.A previous cease-fire called in September never fully took hold. When asked Friday whether he thought this new deal would fall apart, Ukraine's ambassador to the United Nations, Yuriy Sergeyev, said, ``We are not naive, you know.'' More than 5,300 people have been killed in the fighting in Ukraine since April, while the United Nations has warned of a ``frozen'' conflict that could linger for years or decades.","council have loudly accused russia ,fighting in ukraine since april ,friday before the cease fire ,overnight talks among the presidents ,russia circulated surprise draft resolution","['UNITED NATIONS', 'AP', 'the United States', 'the U.N.

The former Saenuri Party floor leader was nominated late last month by President Park Geun-hye. But allegations of conscription evasion, real estate speculation, and the disclosure of a recording of a recent conversation in which the lawmaker appeared to threaten reporters who wrote critical stories of him brought criticism of his appointment.A plenary meeting to vote on Lee’s nomination was scheduled for Thursday. But worsening partisan strife over the appointment compelled lawmakers to postpone the full session to Monday.Even though it appears Lee will receive parliamentary approval in Monday’s plenary vote, it will be difficult for him to wield any genuine authority as prime minister in the foreseeable future, experts said, as public opinion against the third-term lawmaker is unlikely to fade quickly. (Yonhap)The majority Saenuri Party supports Lee’s nomination. The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy is against the move.The NPAD threatened Thursday to boycott the parliament and indefinitely stall the passage of some dozen bills strongly supported by the governing party and President Park if the Saenuri Party uses its majority to railroad the confirmation motion. The Saenuri Party holds 158 seats in the 295-strong parliament.The bills are central to President Park’s proposed economic restructuring policies. The draft laws include those aiming to facilitate crowd-funding, legalizing telemedicine, and revisions to laws that currently ban the construction of casinos near public schools.The NPAD has the ability to resist the bills as NPAD Rep. Lee Sang-min holds the chairmanship of the Assembly’s Legislation & Judiciary Committee. The committee chief is authorized to indefinitely block bills from being forwarded to a final legislative voting.“The recent public backlash at allegations against Lee and a boycott by the opposition is likely to force the prime minister nominee into an involuntary silence on policy issues,” Yonsei University professor Yang Seung-ham said.But NPAD officials must also risk political damage if they resist Lee’s nomination, analysts say.At stake is the Chungcheong region, the home provinces of Prime Minister nominee Lee. He also served as South Chungcheong Province’s governor from 2006 to 2009. The swing region is a usually heated electoral battleground in South Korean elections.If the NPAD continues to stall Lee’s nomination, the party must risk losing votes in Chungcheong in future elections, including next year’s parliamentary polls, which could affect the 2017 presidential race.The NPAD’s chair, Rep. Moon Jae-in, elected to his post last Sunday, is also under pressure to resist Lee’s nomination by party hard-liners.

But accusations including real estate speculation, draft-dodging and intimidating journalists have endangered his appointment. The disclosure of Lee’s voice recordings was expected to intensify a partisan fight over whether the appointee was fit to serve in the nation’s second-highest official post.Lee, who has acknowledged the voice in the recordings was his, will have to convince legislators of his eligibility by Thursday, when a plenary vote decides his nomination.  Prime Minister nominee Lee Wan-koo speaks at his confirmation hearing at the National Assembly in Seoul on Tuesday. (Lee Gil-dong/The Korea Herald)In the recording divulged by New Politics Alliance for Democracy legislators, Lee can be heard telling reporters that he had “enough power to handpick” the presidents and professors of local universities.Lee can also be heard saying in an apparently threatening tone that he would vote for a strict anticorruption bill that would incriminate civil servants and reporters if they or their families received gifts, however small. The draft bill is known as the Kim Young-ran bill, named after a former Supreme Court judge who initially pushed for the bill.“You know what? I’ll just let (the anticorruption bill) pass,” Rep. Lee says in the taping. “Then you’ll know what we (public officials) have to deal with.” Lee appears to be protesting a story that mentioned allegations of Lee having speculated in real estate.Lee initially received bipartisan support when he was picked to serve as prime minister on Jan. 23. The third-term lawmaker’s reputation as a moderate compromiser and deal broker had won the political trust of some senior main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy legislators.But reports that the appointee had made successful investments in Gyeonggi Province and a luxury apartment in Seoul’s posh Gangnam district in the early 2000s raised eyebrows. Lee was also accused of helping his son dodge the country’s mandatory military draft in 2006 and of having evaded service himself by pretending to have flat feet.Parts of the leaked recording were already publicized last week by public broadcaster KBS, showing him making threatening comments to journalists writing critical stories about him. Lee can be heard saying he “knows people” in the media, and that he could “get certain (reporters) fired.”Lee tried to extinguish the growing political wildfire during his hearing by defending his comments as being made in an informal gathering.“I would like to first apologize. But everything I said (in the recording) was during a luncheon with a few young journalists that I personally meet from time to time.”“And as to my remarks on the KYR bill, I would like to emphasize that I am a believer in the freedom of the press. If the bill passes, reporters could be subject to harsh restrictions that limit their freedom,” the lawmaker said.“But I beg your forgiveness.”If the National Assembly votes against Lee, Park’s prospective Cabinet shake-up could be delayed or canceled altogether as her “welfare without taxation” policy continues to take fire from critics, including members of her own party.Park’s tax policies have been dismissed by critics as unrealistic, with lawmakers stressing lower-than-expected tax revenues. On Tuesday, the Finance Ministry announced that the government had collected 10.9 trillion won ($10 billion) less than expected in tax revenues last year.A dozen bills aiming to boost economic output will likely remain pending if Lee’s nomination is stonewalled and exacerbates partisan strife. The bills include one designed to stimulate crowd-funding and one legalizing the construction of tourist attractions such as casinos near public schools.Analysts say that the Park administration badly needs Lee’s political acumen as her public ratings have fallen to new lows, with polls suggesting less than 30 percent of the public approve of her performance.

The prime minister is the second-highest position after president, but the job has been limited to a largely ceremonial role as power is concentrated heavily in the president.Outgoing Prime Minister Chung Hong-won will remain in the job until Lee is confirmed by the National Assembly, where Park's conservative party commands a majority.

Moon Jae-in, elected to head the New Politics Alliance for Democracy on Sunday, slammed Park’s so-called “welfare without taxation” policies, which sparked a public uproar after her administration raised the tobacco tax and decreased tax returns in this year’s settlements, while corporate taxes for conglomerates stayed the same, according to critics.Moon also visited the graves of past authoritarian presidents Syngman Rhee and Park Chung-hee, breaking an unofficial moratorium by left-wing figures. But the conciliatory nature of Moon’s visits were downplayed, due to his criticism of Park.“Park’s policies have divided and fractured our nation,” Moon said only seconds after visiting the graves of Rhee and Park, the incumbent president’s father.“President Park’s policies have created divisions domestically. Externally, her policies have led to troubled South-North relations,” Moon said. Saenuri Party Chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung (left) shakes hands with main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy Chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in on Monday. Moon was elected to the post on Sunday. (Yonhap)Later during a meeting with governing Saenuri Party chair Rep. Kim Moo-sung, Moon echoed the opposition’s demands to raise corporate taxes for funding Park’s welfare plans. Park administration officials have balked at the idea, citing an economy with inflation rates in the 1 percent range. The governing party welcomed Moon’s visit to the resting places of presidents Rhee and Park but disagreed with Moon’s tax policy proposal.“Rep. Moon did the right thing,” governing party spokesman Rep. Kim Young-woo said. “But Moon must cooperate with the Park administration for our country to move forward,” he said in response to Moon’s critical remarks.South Korea’s political left has generally maintained a critical stance toward Rhee and Park. Its leaders have often refused to pay respects at their tombs in the New Year, on Independence Day or on other symbolic holidays.Rhee is credited with contributing to Japan’s defeat in World War II and leading the nation in the Korean War. But he is also known as an authoritarian who violently repressed political opponents and allegedly committed war crimes.Park is often credited with boosting South Korea’s economic output in the 1960s and ’70s, but is also remembered for using a security apparatus to silence dissidents such as the late former President Kim Dae-jung, a figure revered as one of the godfathers of the South Korean left.“Every past administration has its deeds and misdeeds,” Moon had said after winning the NPAD convention on Sunday. “President Park (Chung-hee) is remembered for the economic growth he fostered. President Rhee is remembered for his work in founding our country. I will visit them.”Saenuri leader Rep. Kim told Moon he would reciprocate by visiting the grave of former President Roh Moo-hyun, a left-leaning figure who died in 2009. Moon served as Roh’s chief of staff.Moon also later stopped by the tomb of Kim Gu, an anti-Japanese independence activist during Japan’s rule of Korea.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","party on monday dismissed president ,democracy on sunday slammed park ,monday dismissed president park geun ,on monday dismissed president park ,monday dismissed president park","['Park Geun', 'South Korea ’s', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Park ’s', 'Moon', 'Syngman Rhee', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Moon ’s', 'Park', 'Moon', 'Rhee', 'Park', 'South - North', 'Moon', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'New Politics Alliance for', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Moon', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Moon', 'Park ’s', 'Moon ’s', 'Rhee', 'Park', 'Moon ’s', 'Moon', 'Kim Young', 'Moon', 'Moon ’s', 'South Korea ’s', 'Rhee', 'Park', 'Rhee', 'Japan', 'South Korea ’s', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'Moon', 'NPAD', 'Park', 'Rhee', 'Kim', 'Moon', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Moon', 'Roh', 'Moon', 'Kim Gu', 'anti - japanese', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Jeong Hunny']",3,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.53759938  0.33032468

The policy has drawn criticism even from her ruling party that it is impossible to provide welfare without raising taxes.She was critical of calls from some lawmakers that the government should raise taxes to make up a revenue shortfall, saying the government did not do its best in revitalizing the economy. Park speaks in a regular meeting with her top aides at the presidential office on Monday.(Yonhap)""We should seriously think about whether we have done all we can before placing an additional burden on the public,"" Park said in a regular meeting with her top aides at the presidential office.""What is important is to find ways to solidify welfare while minimizing public burden.""South Korea has about a 20 trillion won ($18 billion) shortfall in tax revenue as protracted slow growth undermined the tax base.She reiterated calls for revitalizing the economy, saying it will help create more jobs and raise tax revenues, further alleviating the public's financial concerns.""I ask the parliament again to quickly pass bills meant to revitalize the economy,"" Park said.Park's ruling Saenuri Party commands a parliamentary majority with 158 seats in the 295-member National Assembly, which can allow the ruling party to push bills through the parliament unilaterally without cooperation from the main opposition party.Park's comments came as Moon Jae-in, the new leader of the main opposition party, vowed to raise the corporate tax rate and withdraw tax cuts for the rich in what he described as an attempt to establish a fair tax system.South Korea's corporate tax rate on taxable income exceeding 20 billion won was lowered from 25 percent to 22 percent during the preceding Lee Myung-bak administration.Moon, who had lost the presidential election to then ruling party candidate and now president Park in 2012, was elected chairman of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy in a national convention on Sunday.Kim Moo-sung, the chairman of the ruling party, voiced support for the president's stance.""The Saenuri Party and the Park Geun-hye government are bound together by a common destiny, and the Saenuri Party will become a reliable assistance force and help (solve) the president's problems,"" he said in a meeting with foreign correspondents in Seoul.He added that the best solution to the welfare controversy would be a ""grand social compromise,"" which he acknowledged would not be an easy task.Also Monday, Park called for more slashing of the country's red tape to make it easier for mergers and acquisition of local startups as part of efforts to revitalize startups and venture firms.

He is scheduled to undergo confirmation hearings at the National Assembly on Tuesday and Wednesday, after which a plenary session will be convened on Thursday to put his nomination to a vote.Lee and his second son are suspected of avoiding conscription, a highly sensitive issue in South Korea, which remains technically at war with North Korea since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. All able-bodied South Korean men between the ages of 18 and 35 must serve in the military for about two years.The prime minister nominee is also suspected of speculating in real estate, plagiarizing his doctoral thesis and intentionally omitting parts of his annual wealth report.""Prime Minister nominee Lee should decide his course of action on his own,"" a group of lawmakers from the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy said in a statement. ""He should fully explain about the suspicions and apologize to the nation.""Lee is not qualified to become a prime minister because he has persisted in denying the suspicions, the lawmakers said, adding that what is more serious is his ignorance of his wrongdoing.The ruling party criticized the main opposition party for pressuring the prime minister nominee to step down, based only on suspicions without undergoing a legal procedure.""It is not desirable to try to make the nominee drop his nomination, citing only suspicions,"" Saenuri spokeswoman Rep.

Chung will remain in the country's No. 2 political job until Lee is confirmed by the National Assembly, where Park's conservative party commands a majority.

Lee had indeed suffered from flat feet before 1971, how did he get approved to serve? If he had flat feet, it would have been common sense for him to have applied for a re-exam immediately,” Jin said.“It appears he was relieved from his military duties once he was able to secure a job,” Jin said in reference to Lee’s passing the national civil service exam in 1974.Lee’s confirmation hearing will begin next Tuesday.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","main opposition party on friday ,son avoided the military draft ,opposition party on friday accused ,lawmakers from the new politics ,faked medical records to avoid","['South Korea ’s', 'Cabinet', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Lee', 'NPAD', 'Jin Sun - mee', 'the Military Manpower Administration', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Jin', 'Jin', 'Jeong Hunny']",2,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.73868126  0.32625955

The remark quickly raised speculation that the minister may have been under pressure from the presidential office to backpedal on the policy to avoid agitating taxpayers already upset with the recent tax increases.Cheong Wa Dae, however, exacerbated the mess Thursday as it flatly denied the minister’s remark, saying that the government would consider introducing the new system. The ministry backtracked from the new health insurance policy entirely on Moon’s judgment, said presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook. “We believe that (the remark came from) the health minister’s own judgment that the government may need deeper discussion on the policy in order to form a social consensus,” he said.The Park government has been seeking ways to implement a new system to fairly impose health insurance fees based on subscribers’ income levels.The new policy on health insurance was to plug an obvious loophole in the system. Under the current payment system, some subscribers with similar incomes pay different health insurance fees and those who are registered as a dependent in a family are not obliged to pay the mandatory fees even if they hold massive amounts of assets.The unfairness of the system sparked criticism when a mother and her two daughters committed suicide last year after suffering from financial difficulties. Because none of the family members were employed, they had to pay a monthly health insurance cost of 50,140 won, which was calculated based on their assets, even though other rich subscribers enjoy the same health service for free if they are registered as dependents.The revision of the system was one of Park’s campaign pledges.Minister Moon’s remark follows the harsh public criticism the Park administration faced over the government’s new tax settlement scheme. In the face of strong resistance, the government and the ruling Saenuri Party agreed to push for revision of the tax code to offer more tax refunds to eligible taxpayers.The main opposition New Politics Alliance Democracy lashed out at the government for backtracking on its plan to revise the current health insurance payment system. “It is the president’s duty to seek the public’s understanding after honestly explaining the reason why the government has given up on the policy,” said Rep. Woo Yoon-keun.“This is not the first time that Park didn’t keep her promises, but it is apparent that the people would be more disappointed on this,” he said.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","thursday over the government inconsistent ,upset with the recent tax ,hyung pyo told lawmakers wednesday ,controversy escalated on thursday over ,with the recent tax increases","['Moon Hyung - pyo', 'Dae', 'Moon ’s', 'Min Kyung - wook', 'Park ’s', 'Moon', 'Park', 'Saenuri Party', 'New Politics Alliance Democracy', 'Woo Yoon - keun', 'Park', 'Cho Chung - un']",18,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.13157307  0.37246788

Rep. Shin Hak-yong of New Politics Alliance of Democracy is suspected of creating a slush fund of around 100 million won ($92,000) with the money he pocketed from salaries of his three aides between 2007 and last year. Investigators believe that the 63-year-old three-term lawmaker took the money in exchange for helping them get party nominations for local elections. Two of the aides were elected as councilors of local assemblies in the last two elections held in 2010 and 2014.The prosecution said they would question Shin on whether he was involved in creating the illegal fund and pulled strings to help them get party nomination to run for local assembly seats.Shin has denied the allegations.“The allegations (of creating a slush fund from salaries of the aides) are not true,” Shin told reporters before entering the Seoul Central District Prosecutor’s Office. “It is unthinkable for me to exercise influence on party nominations.”Investigators have requested Shin to appear for questioning multiple times since last year. But the lawmaker disobeyed a summons, citing schedule conflicts. As part of the investigation, the prosecution raided the homes and offices of the three concerned political aides and summoned them last year.The lawmaker is currently standing trial over a separate case of bribery. He is suspected of having received kickbacks from the head of Seoul Art College in return for helping it change its name. The college chairman had offered bribes to Shin and his colleagues to omit the term “vocational” from the school’s original name, prosecutors said.

With 96.8 percent of polling stations counted, Syriza had 36.4 percent _ and 149 of parliament's 300 seats _ versus 27.8 percent for Prime Minister Antonis Samaras' conservatives.  If Tsipras, 40, can put together a government, he will be Greece's youngest prime minister in 150 years, while Syriza would be the first radical left party to ever govern the country. The prospect of an anti-bailout government coming to power in Greece has revived fears of a bankruptcy that could reverberate across the eurozone, send shockwaves through global markets and undermine the euro, the currency shared by 19 European countries. Syriza's rhetoric appealed to many in a country that has seen a quarter of its economy wiped out, unemployment above 25 percent and average income losses of at least 30 percent. Tsipras won on promises to demand debt forgiveness and renegotiate the terms of Greece's 240 billion euro ($270 billion) bailout, which has kept the debt-ridden country afloat since mid-2010.  To qualify for the cash, Greece has had to impose deep and bitterly resented cuts in public spending, wages and pensions, along with public sector layoffs and repeated tax increases. Samaras soon conceded defeat Sunday, saying he had received a country “on the brink of disaster” when he took over in 2012 and was close to ushering it out of the crisis. “I was asked to hold live coals in my hands and I did,” he said.  The country's progress in reforms is reviewed by inspectors from the International Monetary Fund, European Commission and European Central Bank, collectively known as the troika, before each installment of bailout funds can be released. Tsipras pronounced the troika and its regular debt inspections “a thing of the past.” Greece's creditors insist the country must abide by previous commitments to continue receiving support. In Germany, Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann told ARD network that he hoped “the new Greek government will not make promises it cannot keep and the country cannot afford.” The election results will be the main topic at Monday's meeting of eurozone finance ministers. Belgium's minister, Johan Van Overtveldt, said there is room for some flexibility, but not much.  “We can talk modalities, we can talk debt restructuring, but the cornerstone that Greece must respect the rules of monetary union _ that must stay as it is,” Van Overtveldt told VRT network.  JPMorgan analyst David Mackie said negotiations between the new government in Athens and creditors “are likely to be very difficult” but cannot drag on indefinitely. “If Greece is unable to honor its obligations this year, then economic, financial and banking stress is likely to lead either to an agreement, or to a second round of elections, or to an EMU exit,” he said, referring to Greece's membership in the eurozone. But Re-Define think tank analyst Sony Kapoor said that while Greece has failed the eurozone and EU authorities, they have also failed Greece. “The Greek rescue package was financially unsustainable, economically wrong-headed, politically tone-deaf and socially callous,” he said. “Syriza deserves a chance, and their victory will force the EU to confront the elephant in the room: unpayable debt and bad policy decisions.” He noted that Syriza's moderation of its rhetoric before the election “is promising, making it likely that it will govern closer to the center than many think.” A Syriza official said Tsipras would meet Monday with the head of the small Independent Greeks party, which elected 13 lawmakers, “to confirm the support and possible participation of the Independent Greeks in the new government.” The official, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak on the record, said Tsipras would likely be sworn in as prime minister later Monday, and the new government would be formed in the following couple of days.   The centrist Potami (river) party was battling for third place with the Nazi-inspired Golden Dawn, whose leader and several lawmakers campaigned from prison, where they are awaiting trial on charges of participating in a criminal organization. (AP)","victory in sunday parliamentary elections ,historic victory in sunday parliamentary ,party vowing to end greece ,from bankruptcy in 2010 yonhap ,victory in sunday parliamentary","['Greece', 'Alexis Tsipras', 'Greece', 'greek', 'tsipra', 'Syriza', 'Antonis Samaras', 'Tsipras', 'Greece', 'Greece', 'european', 'Greece', 'Greece', 'the International Monetary Fund', 'European Commission', 'European Central Bank', 'Greece', 'Germany', 'Bundesbank', 'Jens Weidmann', 'ARD', 'greek', 'Belgium', 'Johan Van Overtveldt', 'Greece', 'Van Overtveldt', 'VRT', 'JPMorgan', 'David Mackie', 'Athens', 'Greece', 'Greece', 'Re - define', 'Sony Kapoor', 'Greece', 'EU', 'Greece', 'greek', 'EU', 'Syriza', 'Tsipras', 'Independent Greeks party', 'Tsipras', 'Potami', 'Nazi', 'AP']",11,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32615691  0.14250654

The revision, however, left some people with an annual income of less than 55 million won ($50,733) having to pay additional taxes.Under Wednesday's agreement, the government will raise tax credits for families with children and restore tax credits for new births and adoptions, Ju said.Unmarried salaried workers who do not qualify for tax credits received by families will receive separate tax credits, while tax deductions for post-retirement savings will be expanded, he said.The exact amount of tax credits will be determined by the end of March following an analysis of this year's tax returns.Any additional taxes that need to be paid under the new tax settlement scheme will be payable in installments.The ruling party and the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy will discuss ways to revise the tax code to reflect the proposed changes and handle the relevant bill during April's parliamentary session, Ju said.The parties will also jointly push for legislation to enable the retroactive payment of the tax credits, he said.During the meeting, Finance Minister Choi Kyoung-hwan apologized for causing ""an inconvenience and burden"" to the public.

The president’s powers are too broad, they say, and the office’s authority over Cabinet nominations, among other things, should be cut back.But talks on reform have fizzled out due to wrangling over other issues and President Park Geun-hye’s lukewarm response to the proposals. Parliamentary sources said the trend would continue as other sensitive issues beg the National Assembly’s attention.President Park Geun-hye and the top brass within her governing Saenuri Party have emphasized that it is the economy that matters most, not political debate on constitutional reform, which could drown out legislation of key economic reform bills.Park and the Saenuri Party have vowed to prioritize labor market deregulation and public servants’ pension reforms this year. The policies aim to increase employment and reduce the national debt. Saenuri Party chair Rep. Kim Moo-sung’s urge to follow through on the reforms was visible when he expressed frustration during a press briefing following his New Year speech last week.Reporters had asked about political scandals and constitutional reform, and barely discussed the speech itself, which focused on economic reforms.The Saenuri Party on Thursday appeared determined to put off constitutional reforms.After a lengthy two-hour closed-door meeting of the floor leaders and chairs of the NPAD and the Saenuri Party, spokesmen for the two parties released a joint statement saying they agreed on the “need for constitutional reform,” but that they would “discuss details at a later date.”The NPAD, the main supporters of constitutional reform, also appear to be taking a break from the issue.“We are not sure when we will be able to discuss the matter again,” NPAD deputy floor leader Rep. Ahn Gyu-baek told The Korea Herald on Sunday. There was no major in-house debate on how to push for constitutional reform at the Assembly, the lawmaker added.Constitutional reform is almost as old as South Korea itself. The country was founded in 1948. The first revision came in 1952, and the Constitution was amended eight more times under military rule. The last revision came in 1987, when military rule ended.“Calls for constitutional reform usually come when politicians want to change the political rules to their advantage,” Myongji University professor Chung Jin-min said.A majority of NPAD and a few Saenuri lawmakers support strengthening the prime minister’s authority over domestic affairs and allowing the parliament to elect the prime minister, instead of giving the president the right to appoint the administration’s No. 2 official.

It read, “...","The presidential office said on Wednesday it will dismiss a public relations official who reportedly raised allegations that Saenuri Party leader Kim Moo-sung secretly triggered a recent political scandal involving competing groups of aides to President Park Geun-hye.Eum Jong-hwan offered to resign after a news photograph showed Kim’s written memo, apparently a quote from a remarks made by Eum last month. It read, “K and Y are behind the ‘document gate.’ Will unveil the truth. You will see. An announcement will come shortly.” “K” is said to stand for the ruling party leader and “Y” for Rep. Yoo Seong-min of the same party.Lee Jun-seok, a ruling party member, said Eum made the remark during a meeting between Cheong Wa Dae and party officials on Dec. 18, which he relayed to Kim during a recent conversation.“Administrative officer Eum denied the report that he made such a statement but tendered his resignation, taking responsibility for causing concern by misbehaving as a public official,” presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook told reporters. Eum is one of the presidential officials embroiled in the scandal. Kim has been struggling to head off the allegation about his role in the scandal after the photo published Tuesday sparked a new feud within his party.“It was preposterous,” Kim said in his New Year news conference Wednesday. Kim Moo-sungKim expressed concerns that the so-called Chung Yoon-hoi scandal is threatening to derail President Park’s economic reform initiatives.The scandal began to surface last November after presidential papers that investigated Chung Yoon-hoi, Park’s former secretary, were leaked to a local daily.The papers alleged that Chung had meddled in government affairs and personnel decisions using his close ties to incumbent Cheong Wa Dae officials.Chung has denied the accusations. Prosecutors have concluded the rumors are false and indicted those who wrote the report and leaked it to the media. But the public appears unconvinced, according to multiple local polls. A survey by Ace Research and Consulting Group and the Seoul Shinmun, a local daily, showed 63.5 percent of 1,010 respondents did not trust the prosecution’s investigations.The poll was conducted a few days after the prosecution announced its investigation results, with a margin of error of 3 percent and a 95 percent confidence level.Park’s critics had been anticipating a reshuffle of Park’s top aides in the New Year, but she expressed reluctance to do so, sparking criticism within her own party.“It doesn’t matter if the scandal is true or not,” Saenuri Rep. Lee Jae-oh said Wednesday. “If the public wants the president to change her aides, then the president must deliver. If you go against public opinion, it’s going to get more difficult to push through key reforms and legislation.”Lee is a well-known Park opponent, and a confidant of ex-President Lee Myung-bak, Park’s former political rival.But pro-Park Saenuri Party lawmakers refuted their critics. “I also have something to say,” Rep. Lee Jung-hyun said only minutes after Rep. Lee Jae-oh had expressed his doubts about the president.“The public wants the government and us politicians to improve the economy. I think that the president has been genuinely trying to do just that.”If the Saenuri Party’s internal bickering escalates, political wrangling could impede legislation of bills aiming to restructure Korea’s economy, effectively paralyzing Park’s goals of reforming the public officials’ pension and easing employment regulations.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","resign after news photograph showed ,secretly triggered recent political scandal ,presidential office said on wednesday ,published tuesday sparked new feud ,president to change her aides","['Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Park Geun', 'Eum Jong - hwan', 'Kim ’s', 'Eum', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Lee Jun - seok', 'Eum', 'Kim', 'Eum', 'Min Kyung - wook', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim Moo - sungKim', 'Chung Yoon - hoi', 'Chung Yoon - hoi', 'Park ’s', 'Chung', 'Cheong', 'Dae', 'Chung', 'Ace Research and Consulting Group', 'Park ’s', 'Park ’s', 'Saenuri', 'Lee Jae - oh', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Park ’s', 'pro - Park Saenuri Party', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'Lee Jae - oh', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'Korea', 'Park ’s', 'Jeong Hunny']",11,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.65162385  0.59027761

She also said investigations found no wrongdoing by the three aides.Park has been under intense pressure mostly from the opposition party to fire the three presidential aides who allegedly exerted undue influence in the running of state affairs.In a news conference Monday, Park asked who would be able to work for her if she were to fire the aides just because they came under suspicion of wrongdoing.Lee claimed that Park's rejection of the opposition demand gave a boost to the three aides.Park stood by the three aides, though she offered an apology for causing public concerns over the leak of a presidential document that has sparked a political firestorm over allegations that one of her former aides tried to exert undue influence on state affairs.The apology on Monday came a week after prosecutors announced a preliminary conclusion that a senior police officer fabricated a presidential document.

Moon said.He also called for greater efforts to improve ties with North Korea, saying the government should lift all sanctions the previous administration imposed on the North for torpedoing a South Korean warship in March 2010 and resume a joint tour program to the North's scenic Mount Kumgang.The opposition leader lashed out at Park for failing to mention safety issues, which have become a major public concern since April's deadly ferry sinking that left more than 300 people dead or missing.He also claimed that Park's economic policies based on deregulation, freeing up the labor market and prioritizing conglomerates will not help revive the slumping economy.

A bill sponsored by the ruling Saenuri Party and the Park Geun-hye administration will provide government support to develop the domestic cruise industry. It had been pending in the Assembly since July 2013.The bill will allow the central and local governments to lower related taxes, and legalize gambling on cruise ships weighing more than 20,000 tons.Legislators passed the Mariana Bay Infrastructure Vitalization Act, submitted to the National Assembly in 2012 by the government, which will lower real estate and investment taxes on bay development projects.The two bills were stalled due to protests by the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, which had charged that they would mostly benefit a few rich investors. The NPAD was especially suspicious of the cruise industry bill as it legalized large-scale casinos.Insiders said the main opposition, however, let the bills pass as the governing party had yielded to the opposition’s demands on other bills. One of those bills authorized damages payment by the government to families of victims killed in the Sewol ferry accident last April.The 6,800-ton Sewol’s sinking in the West Sea left more than 300 dead, most of them schoolchildren. Prosecutors blamed marine industry regulators for condoning safety violations in the months leading up to the disaster.Local media and government critics also charged the Coast Guard of having botched the rescue operations.The opposition parties had consistently demanded that the government pay damages to the victims for the faults. The governing party had been ambivalent about the suggested payments, as it appeared to link President Park, the government’s top executive, to the accident.But the bill passed Monday after the NPAD agreed to take out the word “compensation” from the bill in previous negotiations. Compensation legally implies that a specific entity holds responsibility for the reason for making payments to victims.Lawmakers also authorized a special parliamentary panel to investigate accusations that the Lee Myung-bak administration had misspent millions of won in public money, under the former president’s “resource diplomacy” policy.Lawmakers, though, failed to pass the so-called Kim Young-ran bill.The KYR bill, named after its initial proposer, the former chief of the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission, proposes to penalize all public officials who receive more than 1 million won ($920) or an equivalent amount in products or services from outside interest groups.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","the legislature but lawmakers failed ,schoolchildren prosecutors blamed marine industry ,the bill passed monday after ,tons legislators passed the mariana ,diplomacy policy lawmakers though failed","['the National Assembly', 'Saenuri Party', 'Assembly', 'the Mariana Bay Infrastructure Vitalization Act', 'the National Assembly', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'insider', 'Sewol ’s', 'the Coast Guard', 'Park', 'NPAD', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Kim Young - ran', 'KYR', 'the Anti - Corruption and Civil Rights Commission', 'Jeong Hunny']",9,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.39925587  0.39627701

Kim Young-han, senior presidential secretary for civil affairs (Yonhap)Presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook said the secretary refused to show up after calling the parliamentary request for his attendance a political offensive, and expressed his intention to resign. “Cheong Wa Dae will sternly hold him responsible, including recommending his dismissal, for defying both the agreement between ruling and opposition parties and the chief of staff’s directive,” Min told reporters.Earlier in the day, Chief of Staff Kim apologized over the scandal for the first time. “I will deeply self-reflect over the shameful incident,” he told the National Assembly’s steering committee. Presidential Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon (left) bows to lawmakers at the National Assembly’s House Steering Committee on Friday. Kim expressed “remorse” over a recent scandal linking up to 10 current and former presidential aides accused of exerting undue pressure on top government personnel decisions. (Yonhap)Kim, who has been under growing pressure from both ruling and opposition parties to resign, added that he would “not care much” about holding on to his current job.The chief secretary also promised to take stern measures against the civil affairs aide for disobedience. He said he would advise President Park to accept Kim Young-han’s resignation.The abrupt development is likely to reignite political bickering over the so-called Chung Yoonhoi scandal ahead of Park’s New Year’s press conference scheduled for Monday. Park is widely expected to apologize and call for an end to political fighting.The incident was brought to the public spotlight in November when a local daily reported the leaked presidential office paper that claimed Chung, Park’s chief secretary when she was a lawmaker, continued to exert his influence. Prosecutors on Tuesday concluded the rumors were false. A police officer who wrote the leaked papers is facing charges of publicizing government papers without authorization. An ex-presidential office aide is also accused of condoning the leak.The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy claimed that the prosecution covered up the case, and accused the civil affairs secretary of interfering in the investigation.At Friday’s session, lawmakers planned to question the aides linked to the Chung scandal, but only two senior aides attended. NPAD lawmakers threatened a parliamentary boycott, demanding the aides show up.“If there is truly nothing to hide, I demand the aides attend today’s hearing,” NPAD Rep. Park Beomkye said.Minor opposition Justice Party Rep. Kim Je-nam also asked why the presidential office had refused her request for up to 23 documents related to the recent scandal.Lawmakers from President Park’s Saenuri Party defended Kim, saying that he could answer for all the other aides as the chief of staff.“Whether or not the senior civil affairs secretary attends is not important.

Kim Jae-won of the ruling Saenuri Party told reporters.The junior secretary is suspected of intervening in the prosecution's probe into the allegations sparked by the leak of a presidential document in late November.The junior secretary's disobedience is widely expected to deal a heavy blow to the presidential office still reeling from the allegations that Park's former aide Jeong Yun-hoe and her younger brother Ji-man were engaged in a power struggle. On Monday, the prosecution concluded the allegations were unfounded.""I will accept his resignation offer and recommend (the President) to dismiss him to hold him responsible (for the disobedience),"" the presidential chief of staff told the session.The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy (NPAD) called on the presidential office to fire him immediately instead of accepting his resignation.  During the session, Kim, the chief of staff, apologized for the leak and vowed to take action to tighten discipline among his officials.""(I) have deeply looked into myself due to this shameful incident,"" Kim told lawmakers. ""I feel sorry for causing concern among the people and lawmakers.""It was his first official apology over the scandal. President Park has not made any official comment since the prosecution announced the probe results Monday.""I've never clung to my post, and I am ready to quit whenever I complete my duty,"" Kim said. He has been under pressure to resign, particularly from the opposition, to account for the political turmoil.""Upon reading the document on Chung's alleged political meddling, I was sure that all the contents were false, and felt no necessity to take any action,"" he added, saying Chung has not been close to the president since 2004.The former aide Chung served as President Park's aide when she was a lawmaker but has never taken any official post in her administration.
