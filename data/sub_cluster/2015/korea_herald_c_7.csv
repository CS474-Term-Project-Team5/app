The revised election bill to redraw electoral districts, also remained up in the air.Parliamentary Speaker Chung Ui-hwa, who had refused to push ahead with the bill on his own authority, said that he would submit his version for review to the National Election Commission at midnight.“There will be a legislative emergency situation starting from midnight, when the current constituency system loses its binding power,” Chung told reporters on Thursday morning.His plan will involve keeping the number of regional parliamentary seats at the current 246 and that of proportional representatives at 54.Chung’s bill is expected to undergo a review by the commission, which will then resubmit it to the Assembly for endorsement by Jan. 8. National Assembly on Dec. 31. YonhapIn a New Year address, President Park Geun-hye reiterated her calls for the swift passage of pending bills.“I will complete the three-year economic innovation plan and also achieve reforms in the public sector, finance, education and labor,” Park said.The president had repeatedly underlined that the pending bills were crucial to improve the nation’s economy, create jobs and promote public safety.While the government and the ruling party continued to call for the passage of what they referred to as the people’s welfare bills, the opposition camp vowed to block them, which they saw as aggravating inequality and job insecurity.“The Minjoo Party is the only party that may suggest an alternative to the working class,” Minjoo Party leader Rep. Moon Jae-in said in his New Year’s address.His Saenuri counterpart, meanwhile blasted the main opposition for holding back the economic and labor reform bills.“The opposition party will face the people’s judgment in the general election for blocking the nation’s economic improvement,” said Saenuri leader Kim Moo-sung at the Supreme Council meeting.By Bae Hyun-jung (tellme@heraldcorp.com)","last general assembly thursday morning ,its last general assembly thursday ,last general assembly thursday ,thursday morning his plan ,national election commission at midnight","['the National Assembly', 'Chung Ui - hwa', 'the National Election Commission', 'Chung', 'Assembly', 'National Assembly', 'Park Geun', 'Park', '“the Minjoo Party', 'Minjoo Party', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Saenuri', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'Supreme Council', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",2,"[ 1.          1.          1.         ... -0.37843752  0.41125658

In a struggle to meet this schedule, the leadership of the ruling Saenuri Party and the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea had met on Sunday for a dead-end negotiation but in vain.Accordingly, the current constituency demarcation will lose legal effect, starting from Jan. 1. The NEC will also stop taking applications for candidate registration until a new electoral map is confirmed and effectuated.Preliminary candidates who have made their registration by Wednesday, however, will be temporarily allowed to carry on with their campaigns, according to the commission.The most plausible scenario is that Assembly Speaker Rep. Chung Ui-hwa will authorize his power and submit a compromise draft to the constituency committee.Despite growing pressure from the ruling party and the presidential office, Chung has consistently refused to push ahead with the bill, urging for bipartisan agreement until the last minute.Chung’s draft is likely to conform to the current system, allocating 246 seats to local constituencies and 54 to proportional representatives.But there is still a chance that parties may reach a last-minute agreement on 253 regional seats and 47 proportional seats, in an effort to maximize the number of local candidates within the house.Meanwhile, it is the preliminary candidates of the opposition camp who are expected to face additional difficulties as they must now apply the party’s new name in their campaign materials.The main opposition party on Monday changed its title to the Minjoo Party of Korea, replacing New Politics Alliance for Democracy as part of a rebranding effort following scores of defections by key party members this month.By Bae Hyun-jung (tellme@heraldcorp.com)","sunday for dead end negotiation ,nation election watchdog said wednesday ,legislative deadline was midnight dec ,deadlocked over redrawing the electoral ,election watchdog said wednesday","['the National Assembly', 'the National Election Commission', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'NEC', 'Assembly', 'Chung Ui - hwa', 'Chung', 'Chung ’s', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",0,"[ 1.          1.          1.         ... -0.60514134  0.42441112

Yonhap“We are not going to tolerate them shifting their responsibility on the central government by using innocent parents as their hostage.”Among the 17 education offices nationwide, only 10 of them have set aside a budget for the “Nuri” subsidy program, which gives allowance that fully covers kindergarten and day care tuition fees for all children aged 3-5, albeit only for the first two months of 2016. Among the remaining seven, Sejong City and Gangwon and North Jeolla provinces have partially funded the programs by allocating their budget for children who will be attending kindergartens, but not those at day care centers. Four municipal education offices -- Seoul, Gwangju, and Gyeonggi and South Jeolla provinces -- have not set aside a budget for the program, meaning parents who live in those regions must start paying for their children’s kindergarten or day care costs starting January. According to the regional education offices, the Nuri program requires some 2.1 trillion won ($1.9 billion) to implement nationwide next year. The central government recently allocated 300 billion won to support the municipal offices to finance the program, but the education superintendents have stressed that they are still 1.8 trillion won short of making the allowance program possible for 2016.Just a day before the press conference, a group of education superintendents, including the Seoul education chief Cho Hi-yeon, gathered to express their frustration, publicly requesting President Park Geun-hye to meet with them in person to discuss the matter. Jang Huy-gook, superintendent of the Gwangju Metropolitan Office of Education, who also represents all education chiefs nationwide, argued that day care centers are child care institutions, not educational institutions, and therefore regional education offices are only responsible for supporting kindergarten costs.“We have repeatedly told the central government that we are at least willing to finance the budget that is required for children who will be sent to kindergarten,” said Jang on Wednesday at the gathering in Seoul. “But day care centers are being regulated by the Ministry of Welfare, not the Ministry of Education. We believe that day care centers are child care institutions, not educational institutions. Therefore we think it’s reasonable for the central government, precisely the Welfare Ministry, to finance the Nuri allowance for parents who send their kids to day care centers, while we finance the program for those who send their children to kindergarten. It’s absurd for the central government to ask us to finance 1.8 trillion won while they’ve only given us 300 billion won.”The Education Ministry is not the only central government agency who is preparing a legal battle against municipal agencies. The Welfare Ministry also announced Wednesday that it would file a lawsuit against the governments of Seoul and Seongnam City, Gyeonggi Province, claiming the regional governments went against the law by setting aside a budget for special allowance program -- a monthly subsidy of 500,000 won -- for young unemployed Koreans without “consulting” the central government.Along with the Education Ministry, the Welfare Ministry also created controversy over its own child care subsidy program for infants aged 0-2 earlier this year. In September, it announced that it will charge households with full-time stay-at-home mothers for the currently free day care service should they utilize it for more than seven hours daily starting July next year. The revision, which the ministry claimed was “to better support double-income households,” was criticized by critics who called it misogynistic and discriminatory.

The Constitutional Court delivers a ruling over the constitutionality of a 1965 treaty to normalize relations between Seoul and Tokyo on Wednesday. (Yonhap)Under the treaty, Tokyo offered Seoul $5 million in free grants and loans, and has thus argued that “all compensation issues” were settled with the treaty. This has triggered a series of lawsuits from individual victims and their families demanding separate reparations.Lee Yun-jae, the daughter of Lee Hwa-seop, mobilized by Japan for forced work in China in 1942, filed the petition in 2009, arguing that her family was not adequately compensated for her late father’s unpaid wages due in part to the treaty.Lee argued that a government panel established under a local act to support the victims failed to reflect the current value of the Japanese currency when calculating the compensation in 2008. She filed an administrative lawsuit to cancel the panel’s decision to offer Lee’s family 11.65 million won ($9,900) and applied for a constitutional petition against both the 1965 treaty and the local act to support the victims and their families.But the Constitutional Court refused to judge on the constitutionality of the treaty that it said would not affect the administrative legal case, and said that the local act was constitutional. It said that the calculation at the time, which reflected the rise in consumer prices, was based on “reasonable” standards.However, three of the nine judges voted against the local law, saying the government panel’s calculation of Lee’s unpaid wages did not correctly reflect the currency’s current value as it failed to take into account the economic growth rate.The court ruling drew keen attention as it could influence bilateral relations between Seoul and Tokyo amid ongoing negotiations over the issue of Japan’s wartime sexual enslavement of Korean women.Tokyo has long argued that all legal compensation issues were settled under the 1965 treaty based on Article 2 that stipulates that the problem concerning property, rights and interests of Korea, Japan and their nationals had been settled “completely and finally.”But Seoul has claimed that the humanitarian issue involving former sex slaves was not on the agenda during the treaty negotiations, and that the sex slave issue should be handled separately.The Supreme Court rendered in 2012 that it is hard to conclude that the individual victims’ rights to claim compensation were removed due to the normalization treaty.Despite the 2012 ruling, Japanese firms that are engaged in lawsuits involving Korean victims of forced labor have refused to compensate the plaintiffs.

13,13,Postnatal care center sued for TB infection in South Korea,"Choi Young-doo, a father of two children, received an abrupt phone call from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in August. He was told that his second child, born in June, may have been exposed to tuberculosis while staying at a Seoul-based postpartum center for the first two weeks of his life.　“It was just really absurd,” Choi told The Korea Herald. “I thought no one ever got TB in our country ...","Choi Young-doo, a father of two children, received an abrupt phone call from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in August. He was told that his second child, born in June, may have been exposed to tuberculosis while staying at a Seoul-based postpartum center for the first two weeks of his life.“It was just really absurd,” Choi told The Korea Herald. “I thought no one ever got TB in our country anymore.”Choi is one of 150 parents whose newborns were exposed to the virus by a nurse at the facility, a franchise postnatal center owned by DGRM Ltd., and who together filed a lawsuit against the center seeking financial compensation, following a criminal suit in September. Some 120 infants are believed to have been exposed to TB at the center from June to August.  A mother is holding her newborn at a postnatal center in South Korea. File photo/Yonhap.Following the phone call in August, Choi and other parents were invited to meet with health authorities at the KCDC. They were told not to worry. “I was told that the chance of my son being diagnosed with TB was like 1 in 1,000,” he said. But just about a week later, Choi’s newborn was diagnosed with latent TB (LTB), meaning the bacteria was in his body but inactive and causing no symptoms.  He was told by the doctor that his son still had to take antibiotics, as without treatment about 5 to 10 percent of those with LTB develop the TB disease at some time in their lives. “I was also told (from my doctor) that even if he takes antibiotics now, there is no guarantee that he won’t develop TB later in his life,” he said. “It just broke my heart. I was so angry at the medical authorities for letting this happen just a few months after the MERS outbreak.”As of Monday, 23 infants had been officially diagnosed with the disease, and 57 others, including Choi’s son, had been diagnosed with LTB.Each victim stayed at the facility for about a week. The nurse who infected the infants was told by her doctor in July that she may be TB-positive after taking a chest X-ray, but continued to come to work regardless.“The parents of the infants who have been infected by TB, and those whose babies have been told to take antibiotics to avoid developing TB later, deserve financial compensation from the center as they have so immensely suffered emotionally, especially with the side effects of the TB drugs,” the parents’ lawyer Lee Sung-jun said in the complaint. At most postpartum care centers, which are largely unique to South Korea, newborns stay in a separate room with other babies away from their mothers and are looked after by nurses on shifts. They are united with their mothers for breast-feeding and other bonding time. The schedule for the mothers, who often opt for the service for postpartum rest, includes body massages, facials, child care education classes and exercise sessions. The parents are each seeking legal compensation ranging from 1.5 million won ($1,300) to 8 million won for emotional and financial damages, especially for having to make their infants take tuberculosis medication that can be highly toxic to the liver.According to Yeyul, a law firm representing the parents, their infants have been taking Rifampicin, also known as Rifampin, an antibiotic to treat TB and LTB. The babies experienced the severe side effects of the drug, including vomiting, loss of appetite, blood in the urine and sleepiness. “My baby also experienced loss of appetite and diarrhea,” said Choi.Choi claimed that the owner of the postnatal center, the CEO of DGRM Ltd., never offered a proper apology to the parents. The CEO, surnamed Kim, had been scheduled to meet with the parents and the officials of the KCDC in October, but abruptly canceled his attendance just a day before the event. “He once told me, ‘It’s not like the babies are dead,’” Choi said. Choi also said that the KCDC’s early handling of the outbreak was extremely unprofessional. “As parents, we always kept in touch with one another,” he said. “So we knew that in September that at least 26 children were diagnosed with LTB.“But the KCDC announced that only 13 had been confirmed with LTB after their own investigation. It turns out they simply didn’t know some parents chose to spend their own funds to get tested by a different doctor who wasn’t recommended by the KCDC.” By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","son being diagnosed with tb ,their infants take tuberculosis medication ,by her doctor in july ,week the nurse who infected ,their infants take tuberculosis","['the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Seoul', 'Choi', 'the Korea Herald', 'DGRM Ltd.', 'TB', 'South Korea', 'Choi', 'KCDC', 'TB', 'Choi ’s', 'TB', 'LTB', 'LTB', 'TB', 'TB', 'Choi ’s', 'TB', 'TB', 'TB', 'Lee Sung - jun', 'South Korea', 'Yeyul', 'Rifampin', 'TB', 'LTB', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'DGRM Ltd.', 'Kim', 'KCDC', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'KCDC', 'KCDC', 'LTB', 'KCDC', 'Claire Lee']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47713113  0.20843215

Five business lobbying groups, including the Federation of Korean Industries and the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said a bipartisan deal is urgent to draw up business plans and adopt reform measures in workplaces.In September, labor, management and the government reached a landmark deal to ease labor restrictions to allow companies to dismiss workers who are either negligent or underperforming.However, no follow-up measures have been taken as related bills were pending in the parliament. ""Without labor reforms, it is hard to create jobs for youth and achieve sustainable economic growth. But the parliament has not had enough discussions to put into practice of such measures,"" representatives of the groups said in a joint conference.They also urged the parliament to approve the measures to ease regulations in the service sector and other areas so they can expand investment in new business projects.""We are standing at the critical juncture of between a virtuous cycle for new jobs or getting bogged down into the low-growth economy,"" they said.They echoed the same concern raised by President Park Geun-hye, who warned that South Korea's economy could face the difficulties of reviving its economy without a much-wanted overhaul in the labor and public sectors. The high unemployment among youths has emerged as a major social problem in Asia's fourth-largest economy, prompting calls for more active measures to address the issue.The jobless rate for people between the ages of 15 and 29 reached 8.1 percent in November, up from the 7.4 percent reading a month earlier, marking the lowest level reported since May 2013, according to official data.

Choi Yoon-hee, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for receiving bribes from an arms dealer in connection with the Navy’s purchase of multi-mission maritime helicopters.The joint investigation team for corruption involving arms procurement projects said that Choi is suspected of ordering officers to forge an assessment report to show that the AW159 Wildcat supplied by Agusta Westland meets the Navy’s requirements in 2012. The Navy had been pushing the project in the wake of the sinking of the Cheonan corvette in 2010, in which 46 sailors and officers perished. Without any actual evaluation of the model, the Defense Acquisition Program Administration decided in January 2013 to buy eight Wildcat helicopters worth 580 billion won by 2016 and the process is underway. Adm. Choi Yoon-hee, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff YonhapThe investigators said Choi appears to have a close relationship with an arms dealer identified by his surname Ham. Ham has also been indicted for bribery.In exchange, Ham allegedly arranged a job for Choi’s close subordinate, while repeatedly offering fine dining to Choi’s wife.In exchange for the Navy’s final decision to purchase the Wildcat, Ham is also suspected of delivering 20 million won ($17,200) to Choi’s son, who has been preparing to open a business, in September 2014. Choi reportedly admitted that his son received the money from the dealer, but insisted that the exchange had no relation to him. Choi’s son claimed that he gave 15 million won back to the dealer.Two researchers at state-run defense institutes have also been indicted for receiving bribes from Ham in exchange for favorable assessment in arms procurement.Choi is the highest-ranking military officer to face trial over arms graft since 1996 when former Defense Minister Lee Yang-ho was questioned for being involved in illegal lobbying. Lee was not punished due to lack of evidence.The joint investigative team encompassing prosecutors, government officials and experts launched in November last year to zero in on arms graft cases have indicted 74, of whom nearly 20 have so far been sentenced to imprisonment. The accumulated volume of the indicted bribery cases exceeds 1 trillion won. Of the indicted, 11 are former or incumbent military generals. The team is originally slated to wrap up their work by the end of this month, but calls have been rising for an extension of their operation.

Korea Midland Power Co. has been running without a chairperson for six months, while KNOC did not have a CEO for four months, Korea South Power Co. for three months and Korea East-West Power Co. for the past month.Most recently, Korea Electric Power Corporation, the nation’s top utility company, was expected to look for someone to replace current president Cho Hwan-eik whose term ended on Dec 16. With the state companies accelerating the process for nominating their CEOs, industry observers speculated that the post would be filled with politicians who would be dropped from the political parties’ nomination for 2016 general elections. “As far as I know, the government has told us to begin the process of nominating the CEOs. If we can’t find a suitable person, the position could be filled with retired ministers or politicians who were denied opportunities to run for the elections,” an official from an energy company told the Korea Herald, wishing to remain anonymous. Officails receive submission from prospective candidates for the 2016 general elections. YonhapThough the committee at each company selects the final candidates for the leadership post, it has been an open secret that the government has a huge say in the process because the president appoints the nominees in accordance with the recommendation of the Industry Minister. The leadership positions for the state companies have often been held by the retired senior government officials and politicians from the ruling party. The post was considered a reward for the high-profile figures who were forced to end their careers in the government and politics.   For instance, Korea District Heating Corp.’s CEO Kim Sung-Hoi was a former lawmaker who had served between 2008 and 2012. Kim became the president of the heating company in 2013 after the ruling party rejected his candidacy for the 2012 general election.The barrier between public enterprises and political circles has been low, with many incumbent CEOs throwing their hats into the ring for the April 13 general election.To name two, Korea Airports Corporation President Kim Seok-ki and Incheon International Airport Corp. President Park Wan-su last week announced their resignations to run in the elections. Korea Broadcast Advertising Group President Koak Sung-moon, a former lawmaker, is also contemplating running. “I am afraid frequent leadership changes will compromise the companies’ competitiveness. We have to ensure the elected chiefs fulfill their legal terms” an anonymous retired government official who had worked for state-companies told the Korea Herald. The CEO of state companies’ legal term is three years. According to the study of 177 state companies released by civic group Citizens United for better Society in May, 72 companies has suffered from an average of 56 months vacancy for their leadership during the Park Geun-hye administration from 2013 to 2014.

General Assembly on Thursday adopted a resolution denouncing North Korea’s woeful human rights situation and encouraging the U.N. Security Council to refer the case to the International Criminal Court.The resolution involving the ICC referral was endorsed for the second consecutive year, underscoring growing global concerns about what U.N. Human rights chief Zeid Ra‘ad al-Hussein recently decried as “gross” human rights violations.(Yonhap)A total of 119 countries voted for the resolution, while 19 countries voted against it with 48 countries abstaining. The resolution, which is not binding, has been passed annually at the U.N. General Assembly for 11 consecutive years.Last month, the U.N.’s Third Committee in charge of human rights matters passed the resolution overwhelmingly before sending it to the General Assembly. The European Union and Japan have been seeking such human rights resolutions every year.The adoption of the resolution Thursday came after the Security Council opened discussions on the North Korean case earlier this month for the second consecutive year.Testifying before the Security Council, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid said that it was “essential” to refer the North Korean situation to the ICC.“(North Korean) Victims are still unable to find judicial redress and there is still no accountability grounded in the work of an independent judiciary,” he said.“Once again, this year, the General Assembly has called on the Security Council to take action by referring the situation in DPRK (North Korea) to the International Criminal Court, which I believe to be essential, given the scale and extreme gravity of the allegations,” he added.The chances for the ICC referral appear to be low as China, one of the five veto-wielding powers and a traditional ally of the North, has rejected the idea. China has argued that the Security Council is not the right place to discuss human rights.Calls for the referral of the North to the ICC surged after the U.N. Commission of Inquiry released a report on the North Korean situation early last year. The report found evidence of torture, executions, arbitrary incarceration, deliberate starvation, enslavement and other appalling practices that the COI said amounted to “crimes against humanity.” In particular, it indicated that high-level Pyongyang officials responsible for the abuses could be referred to the ICC. Amid the absence of any sincere actions by Pyongyang to improve its human rights conditions, activists highlighted the need to continuously shed a light on the regime’s rights violations. “The only way to ensure that justice is done some day is to keep the spotlight on the North Korea’s government and keep collecting evidence of their crimes,” said John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","thursday adopted resolution denouncing north ,thursday adopted resolution denouncing ,on thursday adopted resolution denouncing ,resolution denouncing north korea woeful ,assembly on thursday adopted resolution","['the U.N.

However, Speaker Chung Ui-hwa reiterated that he would use his authority to call a vote on a bill that would determine new rules for next year’s general election unless the rival parties’ lawmakers reached an agreement by the end of this year. His remark came as President Park and the ruling Saenuri Party ratcheted up pressure on the speaker to bypass the deadlocked parliamentary committees and put to a plenary vote the overdue bills that aim to relax regulations on businesses and reform the labor market. It was considered a setback to the presidential office’s accelerating attempts to pressure the Assembly into legislating Park’s economic policies, a move that Chung and main opposition party said would violate the democratic rule of separation of power. “(If I propose the bill myself), it would be an act of constitutional violation. (My proposal) would bring more chaos to the nation and more harm to our economy,” the former Saenuri Party lawmaker said. By custom, the speaker leaves his or her party when assuming the position. President Park Geun-hye on Tuesday denounced the Assembly for “failing to do its job,” highlighting that the pending bills are crucial to revitalize oversupplied industries and create jobs for young people. Her remark was widely seen as a pressure on Chung to greenlight the bills. But the fifth term lawmaker refused to cite the economic situation as a reason for him to exercise his authority, disputing the argument that the nation’s economy is bad enough to constitute an “emergency situation” where the speaker could independently put the bills to a vote in a plenary session.According to Clause 85 of the Assembly’s law, the speaker can bring bills to the floor without undergoing the committee’s review when the nation faces natural disaster or contingencies like wars, or when the Assembly’s political parties with more than 20 parliamentary seats agree to do so.  Rep. Chung Ui-hwa. YonhapThe main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy chimed in. NPAD leader Rep. Moon Jae-in blasted President Park for compromising democratic rule by intervening in the legislative body’s affair. “Korea democracy is hurting. The president is ignoring the opposition parties and treating the speaker and the ruling party’s leader as if they are her subordinates. I think what the Park administration is doing is nothing but another version of dictatorship,” said Moon.  Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, an independent who left the NPAD over a power struggle with Moon, echoed the criticism. He said on Twitter that the president is blaming the Assembly for her administration’s own failure and putting undue pressure on the head of the National Assembly. While Cheong Wa Dae did not directly comment on Chung’s refusal, it repeated that it was up to the speaker to move things along at the Assembly.Presidential secretary Hyun Ki-hwan had visited Chung’s office on Tuesday to urge him to exercise his power, and later criticized the lack of progress by saying the Assembly was “only looking out for the lawmakers’ interests.” Chung denounced Hynun’s remark as “crude and absurd.” Saenuri Party members visited Chung’s office after his remark on Wednesday and urged Chung to accept the presidential office’s demand to propose the pending bills. The speaker reportedly refused once again, and the atmosphere grew tense as he yelled at the visiting lawmakers, according to insiders.Saenuri leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung told reporters the same day that he is thinking of suggesting Park to exercise her presidential power to order an emergency legislation of economy-related bills without waiting for the Assembly endorsement. The authority was last used by late President Kim Young-sam in 1993 when he adopted policies to achieve transparency in financial transactions. Meanwhile, the speaker reiterated that he would put to a vote the bill that aims to redraw electoral maps for the 2016 general election. Although prospective candidates began to register for the ballot Tuesday, the lawmakers have remained deadlocked over the rezoning scheme, meaning the candidates don’t yet know what their potential constituency will be. “The right to vote is the most important fundamental right. We will face serious consequences unless we resolve the issue by the end of this year. I have to make a judgement call before parliamentary contingencies occur,” said Chung. His remark came a day after the rival parties’ leadership failed to reach an agreement on the rules that determine the number of seats for lawmakers elected via vote by local constituencies and the seats for those who obtain their parliamentary seats through proportional representation.The Saenuri Party has favored a plan to reduce the number of proportional representation seats, but the NPAD and another minor opposition party insist the 54 seats given to the proportional representation scheme remain the same. By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","assembly speaker wednesday rejected cheong ,the ballot tuesday the lawmakers ,president park for compromising democratic ,national assembly speaker wednesday rejected ,vote for contentious pending bills","['the National Assembly ’s', 'Cheong', 'Park Geun', 'Chung Ui - hwa', 'Park', 'Saenuri Party', 'Assembly', 'Park ’s', 'Chung', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun', 'Assembly', 'Chung', 'Assembly', 'Assembly', 'Chung Ui - hwa', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'npad', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Park', 'Korea', 'Moon', 'Ahn Cheol', 'NPAD', 'Moon', 'Assembly', 'the National Assembly', 'Chung ’s', 'Assembly', 'Hyun Ki - hwan', 'Chung ’s', 'Assembly', 'Chung', 'Hynun ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'Chung ’s', 'Chung', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Assembly', 'Kim Young - sam', 'Chung', 'the Saenuri Party', 'NPAD', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",17,"[ 1.          2.          0.         ... -0.21155736  0.24454381

The sentence is seen as an effort by the judiciary to break away from the long practice of giving light punishment to owners of family-run conglomerates, or chaebol, citing their importance to the national economy.  The judge further said it was his intention to clearly make sure that ""even chaebol who commit corporate crimes or evade tax for personal benefits or ignore law and order will be severely punished.""    The tycoon was sentenced to four years in jail and fined 26 billion won by a local court in 2013. In June 2014, an appeals court commuted the jail term to three years. The Supreme Court, however, returned the case to the Seoul High Court in September this year, asking it to reconsider its heavy ruling on Lee's breach of trust charges.  The top court said he should not be judged with the aggravated charges as the amount of losses caused by Lee's breach of trust cannot be calculated specifically.  Lee, however, was not immediately detained following the sentencing as the appeals court again accepted his request last month to suspend his three-year imprisonment until March 21 for hospital treatment. He has been in the hospital while awaiting sentencing in the retrial.  Lee, who has undergone a kidney transplant, claims that he suffers from multiple illnesses such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and kidney disease.  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is an inherited neurological disease characterized by the slow, progressive degeneration of the muscles in the feet, lower legs and hands.

They have been charged with copyright infringement and disrupting public duty.

The original author condones the process in order to maintain an amicable relationship with the publishers for future book deals, who in turn get to sell their inventory as new books.As local universities have policies against rehiring faculty members who have been fined 3 million won or more, it is likely that they will be banned from returning to their teaching posts.Prosecutors have notified the list of the indicted professors to their respective universities, and plan to expand the investigation by launching a special team dealing specifically with illegal activities related to research and studies.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","prosecutors indicted thursday 179 professors ,move korean prosecutors indicted thursday ,korean prosecutors indicted thursday 179 ,korean prosecutors indicted thursday ,charged the professors who stole","['korean', 'Uijeongbu District Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Yoon Min - sik']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ...  0.08053029  0.60108232

Ahn Cheol-soo appeared to leave the party’s dissenting lawmakers with a tough choice: join him or wait for the public reaction to his departure in the opinion polls.The chaotic power struggle within the New Politics Alliance for Democracy was also seen as a reason for the delay in inter-party negotiations over how to draw up next year’s constituencies. The registration of preliminary candidates is set to begin on Tuesday without a clear agreement on the electoral map.While some NPAD dissenters were set to announce their defection early this week, others, who have demanded the resignation of chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in, reserved their decision on whether to leave.The division between the NPAD dissenters came after Ahn vowed to form his own opposition group on Sunday. Comparing his defection to Steve Jobs being kicked out of Apple in 1985, he pledged on Monday to transform the “old-fashioned” liberal parties in a way that can rival the conservative bloc in the 2016 general election.  “Steve Jobs was the founder of Apple, but he was kicked out by John Sculley. Now what happens next is up to Steve Jobs,” said Ahn, comparing himself to the late innovator. Ahn on Monday submitted documents to finalize his defection from the NPAD. NPAD former cochairman Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo. YonhapAhn’s close confidant Rep. Moon Byeong-ho announced that he and Reps. Yoo Sung-yup and Hwang Ju-hong would leave the party either Tuesday or Wednesday. He expected that up to 30 NPAD lawmakers would leave the party by the end of this year. Reps. Yoo and Hwang, whose constituencies are in the NPAD stronghold of South Jeolla Province, have hinted at their departure since they refused to undergo the party’s assessment to determine underachieving lawmakers ahead of the election nominations.But a majority of NPAD dissenters remained more cautious about their possible defection. While continuing to pressure Moon to step down, the nonmainstream factions were seen as closely watching the voters’ mood in their constituencies to determine whether the voters will tilt toward Ahn or remain supportive of Moon. “Moon should be held accountable (for Ahn’s departure) and help us bring the party back on track … but whether or not to defect is up to individual lawmakers. We are not planning on a mass defection,” said Rep. Choi Won-sik, who leads one of the biggest NPAD nonmainstream factions. Many of the constituencies at stake are in the NPAD stronghold of South Jeolla Province, where Ahn and Moon Jae-in have competed for approval ratings. According to the local pollster Realmeter, the voters have alternated between the two for their preferred NPAD presidential candidate. Other dissenting NPAD bigwigs such as Rep. Joo Seung-yong also took a cautious approach. The third-term lawmaker, who represents a district in South Jeolla Province, wrote on Facebook, “I have constantly insisted that we should prevent further NPAD division.” National Assembly Speaker Chung Ui-hwa, meanwhile, urged the floor leaders of the ruling Saenuri Party and the NPAD to come up with the new electoral map as soon as possible.“It could create a legislative emergency,” he said, indicating he may choose to exercise his power to put other relevant bills submitted by the National Election Commission for a vote unless the parties come up with a compromise by the end of this month.If the lawmakers fail to come up with new constituency maps by Dec. 31, when the efficacy of the current zones expires, the country will be on course to head into the general election without any constituencies in place.“Without the rival parties’ consensus, all your constituencies will become void from the 31st and all preliminary candidates will be forced to suspend their campaigns,” Chung said.The parties, which are required to agree on constituency boundaries ahead of every parliamentary general election, have not met a single legal deadline.The lawmakers have clashed over the rules that will determine the number of seats for the lawmakers elected through votes at local constituencies and the seats for those who obtain their parliamentary seats through proportional representation. The Saenuri Party has favored a plan to reduce the number of proportional representation seats, but the NPAD and another minor opposition party insist the 54 seats given to the proportional representation scheme remain the same. Despite the constant standoff over how to redraw electoral maps, the rival parties made a breakthrough on Monday by agreeing to pass revised bills related to election rules. Among them are a bill that authorizes the use of phone calls to survey the selected voters who will determine the parties’ nomination for the elections.

Security Council held a meeting on North Korea's human rights situation on Thursday, the second time the issue has been discussed at the top global security body after the first such meeting last year.The meeting took place after a proposal for the meeting was passed in a 9-4 vote with two abstentions.Last year, the Security Council held its first-ever meeting on the North's human rights issue after the adoption of a landmark U.N. General Assembly resolution calling for referring the communist nation to the International Criminal Court.A similar resolution has been proposed this year, passed the Third Committee last month and is expected to be formally adopted at the General Assembly later this month. This year's measure also calls for referring the issue to the ICC.The resolution and Thursday's Security Council meeting underscored the seriousness the international community attaches to the problem, and is expected to increase pressure on Pyongyang. The United States presided over Thursday's meeting as it has the presidency of the Council for December. ""Once again this year, the General Assembly may call on the Security Council to take action by referring the situation in the DPRK to the International Criminal Court, which I believe to be essential given the scale and extreme gravity of the allegations,"" Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, U.N. high commissioner for human rights, told the meeting.Zeid also said that any call for accountability must ""go hand-in-hand with an open dialogue"" with the North.China, the North's last-remaining major ally and a permanent member of the Council, had opposed convening Thursday's meeting, forcing Council President and U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power to hold a vote. Beijing claimed that it is not appropriate for the Council to discuss the human rights situation of a specific country.Despite calls for the North's referral to the ICC, however, it is unlikely that the Security Council will actually be able to refer the matter to the ICC because China and Russia, which have friendlier ties with North Korea than any other countries, are expected to veto such a move.North Korea has long been labeled as one of the worst human rights violators. The communist regime does not tolerate dissent, holds hundreds of thousands of people in political prison camps and keeps tight control over outside information.But the North has bristled at such criticism, calling it a U.S.-led attempt to topple its regime.In June, the State Department said in its annual human rights report that the North's human rights record ""remained among the worst in the world"" last year with public executions, political prison camps, torture and other abuses.

He is accused of disrupting traffic, obstructing the execution of police duties, damaging police equipment and assaulting police officers throughout nine rallies held this year. Police are also considering additionally charging him with inciting violence during the Nov. 14 antigovernment protest, which carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison and a financial penalty of up to 15 million won ($12,700). (Yonhap)Police said they will seek a warrant to take him into custody on Friday. An arrest warrant was issued for him on June 23 after he refused to appear for questioning. In response, the KCTU renewed its pledge to stage an all-out strike on Dec. 16. The KCTU, along with farmers and civic groups, led the Nov. 14 rally that saw clashes between the police firing water cannons mixed with tear gas and protestors trying to pull down police bus barricades to march forward. While concerns remain over the use of excessive police force against public assemblies, the police claim that Han violated traffic laws by occupying major roads, illegally marching toward the presidential office and disobeying the police order to break up the rally held to commemorate the Sewol ferry sinking on April 16.  (Yonhap)Han has refused to face the police arrest, saying that he should continue to fight against the government’s push for labor market reform. The relevant bills are currently being debated at the National Assembly. After emerging from his hiding place at around 10:20 a.m., he paid respects at the main temple and held a press briefing in front of hundreds of labor activists, reporters, monks and Buddhist followers before being taken by the police. “The government made me the most wanted man in this country for fighting against labor market reform bills that enable (businesses) to fire workers more easily,” Han said, wearing a headband with the slogan, “Abolish the temporary workers’ system.”“The labor reforms (pushed by the government) crush the dreams of irregular workers,” he said. “Though I am detained today, I will continue to fight in prison and in court until labor market reform is stopped.”  (Yonhap)Some 30 labor union members gathered around the union chief Han holding up placards reading “Opposition to labor market reform, please protect 20 million workers’ lives.” The workers’ union has fiercely opposed the government’s push for labor policies that they said will give business more leeway to dismiss workers, extend hiring of irregular workers and cap the salaries of senior employees. The government pushed for the measures in the hope to boost economy and create jobs for the young. Han also expressed gratitude to the Jogyesa Temple that provided him with protection.“I decided to voluntarily leave the temple as I could not sit back and see the police forcing their way into the holy, religious place,” he said, lamenting the police’s attempt to raid the temple. Stepping up pressure on the indecisive main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, Han said the party should declare its stance to halt the labor market reform bill rather than weigh pros and cons at the negotiating table. In the Buddhist temple that is kept peaceful and quiet in most other times, some 2,000 uniformed police officers surrounded the religious venue to prevent possible clashes.As Han finished his speech, scores of temple officials formed a human chain to lead him into the waiting police van, while labor activists chanted “We are all Han Sang-kyun,” “President Park Geun-hye, step down,” and “Let’s resist labor market reform.” “I am okay. Why do you cry?” Han told a union member shedding tears. Walking down the road, he hugged some of the unionists that lined the way.  (Yonhap)The arrest came a day after the police suspended its operation to force their way into the temple to arrest him in response to monks’ repeated calls for a cease-fire at the height of intensifying tension on Wednesday evening. The monks said a raid would be considered an act of religious persecution.Several civic groups voiced opposition to Han’s detainment, lashing out at the government for cracking down on workers and thus undermining democracy.On the other hand, a separate crowd, mostly in their 50s to 80s, gathered inside the temple and condemned monks for protecting Han, who they accused of attempting to overthrow the nation. At Han’s request, the Jogye Order ― the nation’s largest Buddhist sect with several million followers ― has played a mediating role between the labor activist and the government since he took refuge there. The temple, along with Myeongdong Cathedral in central Seoul, has served as a shelter for political and student activists seeking refuge from police crackdowns in times of authoritarian rule, notably under the military-backed governments of the 1980s. As the Cathedral’s role as a shelter has since diminished, the temple remains virtually the sole haven for labor activists.But the temple has appeared reluctant to provoke the police, asking the labor chief to voluntarily leave the temple to end “the vicious cycle of violence.” The police were also seen hesitant in raiding the temple to arrest fugitives in the fear that it could trigger a public backlash. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","occupying major roads illegally marching ,the police officers immediately handcuffed ,raiding the temple to arrest ,police officers immediately handcuffed him ,friday an arrest warrant","['Han Sang - kyun', 'Jogyesa Temple', 'the Korea Confederation of Trade Unions', 'Seoul', 'kctu', 'Han', 'the National Assembly', 'buddhist', 'Han', 'Han', 'Han', 'the Jogyesa Temple', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Han', 'buddhist', 'Han', 'Han Sang - kyun', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Han', 'Han', 'Han', 'Han ’s', 'buddhist', 'Myeongdong Cathedral', 'Seoul', 'Cathedral ’s']",14,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.41689736  0.20670533

Vincent Brooks made the remark during a meeting with defense reporters Tuesday, saying the Army is pushing to have the THAAD unit deployed on the Pacific island of Guam remain there on a permanent basis, instead of the current rotational deployment.A permanent station on Guam ""will make it possible for us to have more options for commitment of THAAD in other places if asked,"" Brooks said, according to the defense news outlet Military.com. One of those other possible places was South Korea, though ""we haven't been asked to do that,"" he was quoted as saying.The website also reported that political sensitivities have thus far limited negotiations between Washington and Seoul on putting a THAAD system on the peninsula out of concern that China would see the placement in South Korea as a threat to its own security interests and the interests of its North Korean ally.The U.S. Army deployed the THAAD battery to Guam in 2013 to cope with war threats from North Korea.It is no secret that the U.S. also wants to deploy a THAAD unit to South Korea, where some 28,500 American troops are stationed, to better defend against ever-growing threats from North Korea's ballistic missile and nuclear programs.But the issue has become one of the most sensitive for South Korea because China sees a potential THAAD deployment as a threat to their security interests and have increased pressure on Seoul to reject such a deployment.Seoul and Washington have maintained they have never held any formal consultations on the issue.""No decisions have been made on upcoming deployments of THAAD,"" Cmdr. Bill Urban, a U.S. Defense Department spokesman, told Yonhap News Agency.Last week, Japan's defense minister reportedly said during a visit to Hawaii that the country is considering deploying a THAAD unit to defend against North Korea's missile threats.The Pentagon spokesman declined comment on the possible impact of a THAAD deployment to Japan.""We won't speculate on the impact of future decisions,"" he said.

""It is imperative that we address every vulnerability that might allow terrorists to carry out another attack on U.S. soil -- including vulnerabilities with our Visa Waiver Program.""The legislation calls for requiring visa waiver countries to continually share terrorism and foreign traveler data with the U.S., utilize Interpol's criminal and law enforcement databases, report lost and stolen passports within 24 hours and screen all passengers against all Interpol databases and notices.The bill also calls for requiring visa waiver travelers to use electronic passports with biometric enabled chips by April 1.Failure to meet these requirements would result in the loss of the visa-free status, according to the bill.The legislation is expected to pass the House as Democrats are also in support of it.

Soldiers' salaries will also be hiked starting next year.   The military, however, sustained hefty budget cuts in many of its procurement projects aimed at defense against North Korea's missile and other threats.  The ministry had initially proposed a 64.3 billion-won budget for next year to launch its project to acquire five surveillance satellites by 2022.  The budget was reduced to 10 billion won in the government-wide budget planning before the National Assembly further cut it to 2 billion won earlier in the day.   The satellite project is intended to secure the local military's own capacity to monitor North Korea's missile sites and other key military facilities, for which it has been relying on the U.S. surveillance assets.   The military had also wanted 24.8 billion won for its project to purchase unmanned aerial vehicles to boost surveillance over North Korea's military activities, but the National Assembly approved only 11.6 billion won.   ""These are core assets our military should acquire before retrieving the wartime operational control of South Korean troops in the mid-2020s (from the U.S.), but the budget cuts may inevitably deal blows to them,"" a ministry official said.

This year was no exception.On Thursday, the National Assembly passed the government's 2016 budget bill during a plenary session and failed to meet the legal deadline by just 48 minutes.The bill calls for increasing the government budget by 2.9 percent to 386.4 trillion won ($332 billion) next year from 375.4 trillion won this year. It falls 300 billion won short of the amount requested by the government in September.The Constitution obliges the parliament to pass its annual budget bill by Dec. 2 to allow 30 days of preparation for the bill's implementation.For more than a decade before 2014, the parliament had always failed to meet the deadline for endorsing a budget bill for the new year.Rival parties often clashed over items on the bill, sometimes leading to physical fights as well as sit-ins inside Parliament.In 2013, the National Assembly passed the government's 2013 budget bill after the beginning of fiscal year, marking the first time in the country's history. The parliament again approved 2014's budget bill on Jan. 1, narrowly avoiding the risk of the government formulating a tentative budget for the first time in history.As public criticism mounted, the Assembly revised relevant parliamentary laws in 2014 to have the budget bill automatically referred to a plenary session if the parties fail to complete deliberation of the budget by Nov. 30.With the new laws on the advancement of the National Assembly, the National Assembly passed the government's 2015 budget bill on Dec. 2, 2014, meeting the legal deadline for the first time in 12 years.The ruling Saenuri Party and main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, however, again, failed to keep their promises this year.President Park Geun-hye earlier met with leaders of rival parties and asked cooperation on next year's budget and a set of bills to improve people's livelihoods.She has repeatedly asked the rival parties to make a compromise on contentious issues and pass the budget as soon as possible.Legislators, themselves, voiced concerns and said the parliament should not be locked in bitter political wrangling.National Assembly Speaker Chung Ui-hwa said, ""All of us should have self-reflection and feel a sense of responsibility (for failing to meet the deadline).""Chung, who invoked his power as speaker to put some contentious bills to a vote, said the parliament should stand to its promise.""I do not understand why the two parties negotiated like this,"" Rep. Kang Ki-jeong of the NPAD told reporters just before the session. ""The budget bill is a mess.""The Saenuri Party also said it is regrettable that the parliament had failed to meet the deadline, noting it is time to take care a set of economic bills aimed at improving the livelihoods of the people.""Politicians should accept the fact that they should take time for self-examination in running the parliament,"" Kim Young-yoo, spokesman of the party, said in a press release, adding that the parliament should not repeat this year's mistake again.

The Gwangju District Court handed down on Nov. 30 a fine of 12 million won ($10,300) in consideration that a jail sentence could “heighten his chances of getting expelled” from his school, Chosun University.The case was thrust into the media spotlight this week and soon went viral on social media after the ruling that critics said showcased the justice system’s lack of recognition of the seriousness of domestic and dating violence. 123RFThe student, whose name was withheld, was released with the fine after physically abusing and choking his ex-girlfriend, who is also a medical student at the same university, while holding her captive in her own apartment for four hours on March 28. According to court documents, he broke into the victim’s place at 3 a.m., while drunk, accused her of taking his phone calls with “no manners” and slapped and hit her repeatedly.  The victim suffered two broken ribs in the incident, and had to receive three weeks of medical treatment. In an audio file recorded by the victim during the abuse and broadcast by a local TV network, the perpetrator threatens to kill her while the victim begs him stop beating her. Prosecutors had initially sought a two-year prison sentence, but the court only gave him a fine, saying the perpetrator “deeply regrets his wrongdoings” and “if he gets sentenced to any penalty heavier than probation, the medical student may face expulsion from his school.”Chosun University, meanwhile, held a committee meeting Tuesday -- more than eight months after the incident took place -- after receiving fierce public criticism when the case was reported in the media. The school announced Wednesday that it would expel the convicted student. “We are deeply sorry for all the trouble we’ve caused,” the school said on its Facebook account.Suffering from depression and anxiety disorder, the victim shared in a public online post in October that she had asked her school to arrange her classes so she and her attacker didn’t have to be in the same classroom. But her requests were rejected. When the perpetrator gave her a settlement offer, the victim asked him to leave the school temporarily until she graduated instead. He refused and eventually was indicted.“We want to ask the court,” said women’s rights group Korea Women’s Hot Line. “What is more important? Social justice or the perpetrator’s future as a medical doctor? A victim’s life or the perpetrator’s career opportunities?”Because the attacker did not receive a jail term from the Gwangju District Court while Chosun University did not expel him until recently, the victim was faced with a situation where she had to leave the school in order to avoid running into the attacker again. “Why should someone like him be allowed to become a doctor?” the victim wrote in her online post. “I’m the victim and I’m still the one who has to be scared and feel unsafe at school.”In the post, the victim also shared that although he had abused her frequently prior to the particular incident on March 28, she couldn’t break up with him because the attacker threatened to release privately recorded video footage of them.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","and beating his then girlfriend ,and choking his ex girlfriend ,dating abuse perpetrator medical student ,beating his then girlfriend ,beating his then girlfriend in","['the Gwangju District Court', 'Chosun University', 'Korea Women ’s Hot Line', 'Chosun University', 'Claire Lee']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52267581  0.43706128

Law firm Barun said it will ask West Virginia University to examine if the defeat device software was used in Volkswagen cars equipped with the new EA 288 engine. Researchers from the school had initially studied the emissions rigging that led U.S. environmental authorities to launch a probe.“We are requesting the examination from the U.S. school because the Korean authorities failed to find (the defeat device software in the new engine cars). The law firm will cooperate with the college in terms of technology and finding the software,” Barun said. The law firm is currently leading the class-action lawsuit for about 2,000 local Volkswagen customers against the German carmaker to nullify the purchase contracts and receive refunds. The details of the examination plan will be released next week, it added. Earlier last week, the Ministry of Environment confirmed that Volkswagen cars with the old EA 189 engine used the defeat device software to fake the emissions in order to pass the local emissions test. It ordered a recall for some 125,000 vehicles here and fined the carmaker a penalty of 14.1 billion won ($12.2 million). The ministry, however, said that it has not found evidence of the problematic device being used in the new EA288 engine-equipped vehicles, adding that a further probe is underway. The ministry launched a test in October on six models of diesel-engine Volkswagen vehicles -- two Euro 5 cars and four Euro 6 vehicles. Based on the Environment Ministry’s test result, the Transport Ministry will conduct three rounds of probes to look into whether the emissions rigging affected the fuel efficiency and safety of passengers, officials said.

The deal is expected to take effect by year-end if the government completes necessary administrative steps that will take at least 20 days. Upon the implementation, the two nations will enjoy tariffs cuts starting from the first round in December. According to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Commerce, the FTA will immediately eliminate tariffs on Korean exports to China worth around $8.7 billion annually.Before passing the motion, the rival parties had agreed to implement measures to compensate sectors expected to take a hit from the FTA. They vowed to build funds of some 1 trillion won ($870 million) over the next 10 years to provide financial assistance to agriculture and fishery businesses.They also agreed to increase the amount of direct subsidies to the affected industries such as by having the farmers receive about 600,000 won per hectare of land by 2020, up from 350,000 won in 2015. The fishermen would be awarded with 700,000 won by 2020.South Korea's lawmakers gather on Monday to agree on the ratification of Korea-China Free Trade Agreeemnt. YonhapThe deal came after the partisan standoff persisted close to the legislative deadline for the agreement. The Saenuri Party had asserted that the Nov. 30 would be the last opportunity to approve the FTA, a scheme that it said would allow Korean companies to maximize benefit from the FTA’s tariff cuts.The New Politics Alliance for Democracy refused to budge unless the government prepared steps to make up for the anticipated economic loss among the hard-hit sectors. The rival parties eventually reached a compromise Monday after overnight meetings.  Despite the bipartisan breakthrough, some lawmakers voiced their concerns over the deal, saying that the partisan agreement fell short of their expectations because the lawmakers were pressed for time to pass the deal in the 19th Assembly, which ends Dec. 9. “(The agreement) has room for improvement,” said NPAD whip Rep. Lee Jong-kul. “I think we have failed to fully address China’s yellow dust and food safety. We apologize to the people for leaving those issues unresolved.” Rep. Kim Jong-hoon, the Saenuri Party lawmaker who served as the Korean government’s chief negotiator of the Korea-U.S. FTA agreement during the Lee Myung-bak administration, opposed the agreement. He denounced the government’s attempt to raise funds as a plan to “extort” money from private companies.Separately, lawmakers also agreed to ratify the FTAs with Vietnam and New Zealand that were signed in March and May, respectively, and the agreement to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a Chinese-led financial institution of which South Korea’s is one of the 57 prospective founding members. The FTA with Vietnam is expected to foster Korean companies’ investment in Korea’s third-largest export market and investment venue. The pact includes stronger measures to protect investors’ rights and to tear down trade barriers that prevent Korean companies from entering the market. The FTA with New Zealand is expected to bring complimentary benefits to both nations as South Korea has comparative advantage in industrial products and New Zealand has the advantage in agricultural and dairy products.Meanwhile, the parliamentary approval for the AIIB allows Korea to become an official founding member of the international institution. Korea holds a 3.81 percent share in the fund, its largest share in any international financial institution.

Ahn Cheol-soo Sunday rejected the incumbent chairman Moon Jae-in’s request to build a coalition leadership, dealing a blow to Moon’s attempt to unite the embattled party ahead of next year’s general election. Instead, the entrepreneur-turned-politician proposed a plan to select new leadership by holding a party caucus next January and merge with the People’s Reform Party, a newly created opposition party founded by Rep. Chun Jung-bae who defected from the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy in March.“I believe the coalition will not be enough to bring substantial change to the party and give voters the impression the party is truly harmonized,” said Ahn. “My proposal will serve as a good opportunity for Moon to jump-start (the efforts to overhaul the party).” Former NPAD Chairman Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo. YonhapOn Nov. 18, Moon proposed to build a tentative triumvirate with Ahn and Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon in the run-up to the 2016 general election. Moon had proposed to share the leadership position with the NPAD bigwigs during the period. Ahn had reserved judgement.  Ahn reiterated the NPAD should overhaul the party’s “archaic structure” he claims to be out of touch with the general public and build a broad opposition force against the Park Geun-hye administration’s “unilateral governance.” With refusing to give a direct answer for Ahn’s suggestion, Moon expressed regret over Ahn’s rejection, saying that his coalition scheme aimed to end the party’s factional feud and to unite the party. He noted that he would continue to gather party members’ opinions.   Mayor Park, for his part, vowed to bridge the gap between Ahn and Moon. Park had partly agreed to Moon’s proposal, saying that he would help Moon on the condition that his support does not clash with his position as mayor.   The three-way coalition came amid escalating infighting among the NPAD rival factions over Moon’s push to overhaul the party. It is widely expected that Ahn's rejection would challenge Moon’s leadership and throw the embattled party into a deeper chaos.  Some NPAD nonmainstream members have been lashing out at Moon for steering the party in favor of those in the mainstream loyal to Moon and his political mentor, late President Roh Moo-hyun. Moon dismissed their criticism, saying they were merely trying to have more say over the party’s nomination for the upcoming general elections. Taking sides with Ahn on Sunday, nonmaintreamers urged Moon to quickly accept Ahn’s proposal.“(Accepting the offer) is the only way to bring us to victory in the 2016 general election and 2017 presidential election. I sincerely urged Moon to recognize the significance of his decision,” NPAD lawmaker Rep. Park Jie-won said via Facebook. Park was defeated by Moon in the party’s leadership contest in February. During Moon’s tenure, the NPAD has suffered from low popularity among voters. According to a Nov. 26 survey from local pollster Realmeter, the party’s approval rating stood at 26.7 percent, while the ruling Saenuri Party recorded 43.5 percent. Moon himself struggled to appeal to voters, particularly those from the NPAD’s stronghold of South Jeolla Province. According to pollster Gallup’s October survey, Moon’s popularity rating as next president stood at 8 percent, 1 percent lower than ruling Saenuri Party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","sunday rejected the incumbent chairman ,entrepreneur turned politician proposed plan ,political mentor late president ,party leadership contest in february ,rejected the incumbent chairman moon","['Ahn Cheol', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Moon ’s', 'the People ’s Reform Party', 'Chun Jung - bae', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Ahn', 'Moon', 'Ahn Cheol', 'YonhapOn', 'Moon', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Moon', 'NPAD', 'Ahn', 'NPAD', 'Ahn ’s', 'Moon', 'Ahn ’s', 'Moon', 'Moon ’s', 'Moon', 'NPAD', 'Moon ’s', 'Ahn', 'Moon ’s', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Ahn ’s', 'Moon', 'Park Jie - won', 'Moon', 'NPAD', 'realmeter', 'Saenuri Party', 'Moon', 'South Jeolla Province', 'Gallup', 'Moon ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.83483285  0.62658989

(Kang Yong-suk’s blog)The “right to advertise,” despite the powerful support of the right to free speech, is now facing a new challenge. Kang Yong-suk, a TV personality and lawyer at Next Law, recently triggered the controversy with a poster of himself roaring “I sue you!” What was meant to be a witty ad was taken down shortly after concerns emerged that the ad could degrade the image of legal practice as simply a means of quick vengeance and moneymaking. “This is more about doctors and lawyers being seen as businessmen -- although the South Korean Supreme Court may disagree,” Kang wrote in his blog, adding that he would let Seoul Bar Association decide whether the poster -- allegedly drafted by his secretary and not himself -- breaches lawyers’ code of professional conduct. Kang’s office said it was preparing a second advertisement to replace the “I sue you” ad, “drafted with moderation.” The office acknowledged that the controversial advertisement reaped tangible effects, such as weeks of full booking of billable hours from new clients.  Kang Yong-suk, an outspoken television persona and partner of law firm Next Law, signs autographs on 100 of his controversial “I sue you” advertisement posters. (Kang Yong-suk’s blog)Kang’s case sheds a new light on the tactical part of the ethical standards for a responsible advertisement.Since 1998, the Supreme Court confirmed that the freedom to free expression applied to commercial advertisements, yet with restrictions. “The special characteristics of a commercial expression has stronger ramifications on viewers than a non-commercial expression, and therefore is subject to stronger regulation,” says Kwon Hyung-doon, professor of law at Kongju National University, in his lecture at the Korean Society for Media Law, Ethics and Policy Research in August. While the level of restrictions on commercial advertisements vary according to different cultures and government regimes, the most broadly accepted rules of responsible advertisement are those suggested by the U.S. Fair Trade Commission Act: truth in advertising, protection of minors, and refraining from overly provocative tactics and promoting harmful products. Advertisements should be truthful and have evidence to back up their claims. The U.S. authorities defines deceitful statements as those that are likely to mislead consumers who act reasonably under normal circumstances and that are likely to affect consumers’ purchase decisions. Even truthful advertisements can negatively affect children, by causing them to believe exaggerated statements or images, to develop negative self-images or to become attracted to products that can impede social development.The most subtle part of the advertising ethics these days, indeed, is advertising tactics. Subliminal advertising, emotional appeal and taking advantage of less educated audiences are strictly monitored by the Korean authorities. Despite the good-willed goals of the media post-monitoring regulations, mainstream media law experts suggest that the Korean advertising regulations need more clarification. Under the current broadcasting law, television commercials should not include “inappropriate,” or “excessive” expressions, leaving gray areas that are subject to interpretation.

(Yonhap)The agreement was made as the plenary session Friday was postponed, with the floor leaders of the two parties meeting for breakfast along with Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan. With the NPAD set on opposing the pact unless the government implements stronger measures to compensate the agriculture and fisheries sectors, the Saenuri Party has said it would still go ahead with the vote using its majority status.The pact must pass through the foreign affairs and trade committee before being put to a plenary vote. With the ruling party lawmakers accounting for 60 percent of the 23-member committee, they can unilaterally pass the bill. The FTA with China was signed on June 1.The Saenuri Party also said along with the trade pact with China, they will move to complete the legislative process for other pending FTA-related bills involving Vietnam, New Zealand and Turkey. Cheong Wa Dae urged lawmakers to keep to the schedule. “It is regretful that the plenary session slated to open today was canceled. Although it is already late, we earnestly urge the National Assembly to ratify the FTA on Nov. 30 that would greatly contribute to the public livelihood and economy,” presidential spokesman Jeong Yeon-guk said.The Saenuri Party has been asserting that the Friday session would be the last opportunity to have the agreement take effect within this year, as officials from Seoul and Beijing need time to prepare the administrative steps for implementation. The party has so far pledged to provide subsidies worth 1 trillion won ($870 million) to sectors such as the agriculture industry. The government has also highlighted that early implementation of the pact would allow Korean companies to enjoy the full benefits of the pact’s tariff cut scheme.The NPAD has urged the government to increase subsidies and prepare measures to protect the suffering agricultural, fishing and dairy industries likely to suffer further setbacks from the trade pact.

South Korea’s top court upheld a ruling by a lower court that said GM Korea should include its monthly paid bonus and family allowance as part of the regular wages, which forms the basis for calculating each employees‘ additional allowances. The ruling marked the first time the Supreme Court reached a decision specifically on the performance-based salaries in relation to regular wages. The court had ruled in December 2013 that regularly paid bonuses should be regarded as regular wages. Korean law stipulates that regular wages are hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or contracted fees paid to a worker routinely, but there has been consistent dispute over whether it should also include regularly paid bonuses and allowances.Debate over the scope of regular pay was ignited in 2013 when GM chief Daniel Akerson requested President Park Geun-hye address the regular wages issue before the company invested an additional $8 billion into the country.The ruling Saenuri Party has been revising the labor law as part of labor reforms. The revised version excludes additional payments based on each employee‘s circumstance or performance. The Federation of Korea Trade Unions welcomed the court’s decision and called on the government and the ruling party to “immediately stop their push to expand the scope of excluded categories from the regular wages.”Thursday’s ruling is likely to have rippling effects throughout the industry, which has complained over possible surges in personnel expenses if the regular wages encompass the bonuses and allowances.The 2013 ruling, meanwhile, had said that an employee’s right to receive the unpaid wages may be restricted if the company’s operations would be greatly disrupted by the payment, leaving room for different interpretations over how to measure a company‘s anticipated hardship.Since 2006, GM Korea has been paying what is referred to in Korea as “accomplishment salaries,” a form of bonus based on the respective workers’ performance evaluation the year before. The bonus is set as high as seven times the amount of each employee‘s monthly base pay, and is handed out on a monthly basis.But when GM Korea excluded the accomplishment salary and other allowances when setting regular wages, employees filed a lawsuit against the company in 2007. GM Korea has said the bonus should be excluded, as it differs for each employee, but the workers said it is regularly paid and has a fixed rate.“Since the amount of accomplishment salary is already fixed in the year that they are paid, it should be included in the regular wages,” the court said in its ruling. It stipulated the criteria for regular wages as regularity, fixed rate and uniformity, and pointed out the bonus is paid to even first-year workers with no previous performance record.But the court remanded the case of including other allowances ― such as for insurance fees and vacations ― as part of the regular salary to the Seoul High Court. In a separate case on Nov. 2, Seoul High Court turned down five GM Korea workers’ lawsuit against the company to pay them extra fees that would have incurred if their past regular wages included regularly paid bonuses.It pointed out that paying the extra wages would cause great difficulties to the company, which had already suffered from an annual loss of 60 billion won ($52.3 million) from 2008 to 2010. But the court handed victory to 933 workers of Korea Southern Power Co. Ltd. on a similar request, pointing out that paying the additional wages would not force the company into hardships.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","the regular wages thursday ruling ,wages are hourly daily weekly ,025 employees of gm korea ,regular wages thursday ruling ,regular wages thursday ruling is","['the Supreme Court', 'GM Korea', 'South Korea ’s', 'GM Korea', 'the Supreme Court', 'korean', 'GM', 'Daniel Akerson', 'Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Federation of Korea Trade Unions', 'GM Korea', 'Korea', 'GM Korea', 'GM Korea', 'the Seoul High Court', 'Seoul High Court', 'Korea Southern Power Co.

Newly retired Adm. Choi Yoon-hee, 62, appeared for questioning at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office on Tuesday morning, saying on his way in that he would sincerely answer the questions during the investigation. Choi Yoon-hee appears at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office on Tuesday. (Yonhap)Choi, who ended his 42-year military career in October, is suspected of receiving bribes in return for selecting the AW159 Lynx Wildcat as the country’s new maritime helicopter in 2012, according to prosecutors. The prosecution is investigating whether Choi, who was then Chief of Naval Operations, was involved in the decision to purchase the AW159 Wildcat, which does not meet the required operational capabilities. After the purchase of the helicopter, it was revealed that Navy fabricated the documents on the AW159’s operational capabilities to help the Anglo-Italian company win the deal in exchange for kickbacks. So far, seven military officials were indicted on charges of forging documents on the helicopter’s capabilities. The summons came months after a rear admiral, surnamed Park, who was arrested for fabricating the assessment reports, accused Choi of having instructed him to do so. The investigators also suspect Choi of taking kickbacks from an arms broker, surnamed Ham. He allegedly gave 20 million won ($17,200) to Choi’s son, who was preparing to open his own business. The son, however, denied the involvement of his father in the transaction, according to prosecutors. The joint investigation team, comprised of government, military and prosecution officials, was launched in November last year as part of efforts to root out prevalent corruption in the defense industry, as a string of corruption cases came to light over the last year.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","prosecutors office on tuesday morning ,district prosecutors office on tuesday ,prosecutors office on tuesday yonhap ,prosecutors office on tuesday ,office on tuesday yonhap choi","['the Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'anglo', 'italian', 'Choi Yoon - hee', 'Choi Yoon - hee', 'yonhap)choi', 'Choi', 'Navy', 'anglo', 'italian', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Choi ’s', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42340064  0.61877835

On Monday, the Sewol Special Investigation Committee said it would look into how Cheong Wa Dae reacted to the emergency and what Park was doing for seven hours after the doomed ferry began to sink off the nation’s southwestern coast on April 16, 2014. The president will be subject to the investigation if it is relevant to the case, the committee said.The decision brings a heated political debate back on the president who has been countering allegations that she had been away from the presidential compound when the tragedy occurred.Cheong Wa Dae has said that Park was in her office on April 16 last year while she received multiple reports on the accident.In one of the worst maritime disasters in South Korean history, the sinking of the ferry left 304 people dead or missing. Most of its victims were high students headed toward the resort island of Jejudo. The Sewol Special Investigation Committee holds a meeting on Monday, after members picked by the ruling Saenuri Party walked out in boycott of the panel`s decision to probe President Park`s whereabouts on the day the ferry Sewol sank off last year. (Yonhap)Calling it an “unconstitutional idea,” the presidential office blasted the committee for having the president on the investigation list. The Constitution stipulates that the incumbent president is exempt from being accused of criminal activities, unless he or she instigates a rebellion or external disturbances.“The special investigative committee should be faithful to its duty, and stop politicizing the issue away from its unconstitutional viewpoint,” said Park’s spokesman Jeong Yeon-kuk.The ruling Saenuri Party demanded all members of the special investigative committee to step down, accusing them of crossing the line. “The committee, showing no interest in investigating the cause of the accident and instead focusing on Cheong Wa Dae, appears to have an ulterior motive aimed at politicizing the Sewol issue, rather than working on ways to improve institutional measures to build a safer society,” said Saenuri floor leader Won Yoo-chul.Other ruling party lawmakers refused to attend a parliamentary committee meeting on agriculture and maritime affairs where the special panel was to brief on the developments, and threatened that they would consider dissolving the Sewol committee. The 17-member committee consists of 10 members picked by the ruling and the main opposition party, three family members of the victims and four legal experts recommended by the Supreme Court and the Korean Bar Association. The decision on Monday came after the members close to the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy pressed to include probe into Park’s whereabouts on that day. Of the 13 members attending, nine members approved, including five members recommended by the NPAD, while four members close to the ruling party boycotted the meeting. The members recommended by the opposition said the plan of tracing Park’s whereabouts does not infringe upon the Constitution because it is not aimed at filing a criminal charge against the president.The ruling party members, meanwhile, vehemently opposed the idea, saying it would eventually lead to a criminal investigation against her.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","controversy escalated tuesday over an ,presidential compound when the tragedy ,hours after the doomed ferry ,controversy escalated tuesday over ,ferry sewol sank last year","['Park Geun', 'the Sewol Special Investigation Committee', 'Park', 'south korean', 'the Sewol Special Investigation Committee', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park ’s', 'Jeong Yeon - kuk', 'Saenuri Party', 'Sewol', 'Saenuri', 'Won Yoo', 'Sewol', 'the Supreme Court', 'the Korean Bar Association', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Park', 'Park ’s', 'Cho Chung - un']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38421351  0.48596615

General Assembly on Thursday passed a resolution on North Korea's human rights situation that calls for referring the communist regime to the International Criminal Court.The resolution passed in a 112-19 vote, with 50 abstentions.The overwhelming passage almost guarantees its formal adoption at the General Assembly expected for mid-December as the General Assembly process is seen largely as a formality.The resolution, which was introduced by the European Union and Japan on Oct. 30, is largely similar to a landmark resolution that was adopted at last year's General Assembly with a call for referring the North's human rights situation to the ICC for the first time. ""The General Assembly ... encourages the Security Council to continue its consideration of the relevant conclusions and recommendations of the commission of inquiry and take appropriate action to ensure accountability, including through consideration of the referral of the situation in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the International Criminal Court,"" the resolution said.The resolution also calls for ""effective targeted sanctions against those who appear to be most responsible for acts that the commission has said may constitute crimes against humanity"" and encourages the Security Council to continue discussions and active engagement on the issue.The resolution reflects the seriousness the international community attaches to the problem, and is expected to increase pressure on Pyongyang. After the adoption of last year's resolution, the Security Council held its first meeting on the North's human rights issue. The council could do the same once the new resolution is adopted.""For now, it's hard to say whether (the Security Council) will convene a meeting in December just as it did last year or take more time"" before convening a meeting, South Korea's U.N. Ambassador Oh Joon told Yonhap News Agency.But many observers believe there is a high chance for the council to take up the issue in December as the United States will be holding the council's rotating presidency for the month.During Thursday's committe meeting, the North's deputy chief of its mission to the U.N., Choe Myong-nam, denounced the resolution as a U.S.-led plot to topple the regime. China, Russia, Syria, Cuba and other countries with friendly ties with Pyongyang also opposed the resolution, calling it politically motivated.Despite calls for the North's referral to the ICC, chances are not high for the Security Council to actually refer the issue to the ICC because China and Russia, which have friendlier ties with North Korea than any other countries, are expected to veto such a move. Still, such resolutions play a great role in drawing international attention to the issue.North Korea has long been labeled one of the worst human rights violators. The communist regime does not tolerate dissent, holds hundreds of thousands of people in political prison camps and keeps tight control over outside information.But the North has bristled at such criticism, calling it a U.S.-led attempt to topple its regime.In June, the State Department said in its annual human rights report that the North's human rights record ""remained among the worst in the world"" last year, with public executions, political prison camps, torture and other abuses taking place in the country.

This is the first time that a third party -- other than the automaker’s customers -- has launched a lawsuit against Volkswagen. “Due to Volkswagen’s trickery, (we) have been defenselessly exposed to category-1-carcinogen-designated diesel emissions nearly every day from its vehicles, which has increased the probability of getting respiratory diseases,” the plaintiffs said in the statement. “Although there may have not been any direct physical damage for now, (the company) must at least financially compensate for the psychological shock, anxiety and concerns about the potential health impact.” Separately, 44 members of the group filed a suit against a local car distributor for polluting the environment, seeking compensation of 300,000 won ($260) each, the organization said. Volkswagen drew global criticism in September after the carmaker admitted that it had cheated on its emissions standards compliance by installing software in some diesel-powered vehicles to pass the emission tests. Volkswagen Korea apologized to Korean customers and vowed to recall the problematic cars. Over 120,000 concerned vehicles have been sold in Korea, the German company said. The Korean branch of the global carmaker has faced a class-action lawsuit from nearly 2,000 customers who seek to nullify the purchase contracts and get a refund, according to law firm Barun, which is leading the lawsuit. The law firm has been filing a lawsuit every week upon requests from customers since late September. More are to join the collective legal battle, it added. The Environment Ministry launched its own test last month over whether the diesel engine Volkswagen vehicles here meet the emissions standard compliance under two tests -- outdoor driving test and indoor driving test. In an indoor driving test last month, the emissions of all the concerned vehicles recorded below the standard limit of 0.08 gram per kilometer, the ministry said.The outdoor driving test currently underway will last for more than a month. The results will be released next week, it added. Based on the result of the Environment Ministry’s test, the Transport Ministry will probe the association between the emissions and fuel efficiency, officials said. If the emission rigging is confirmed here, the carmaker will likely face a penalty along with compensation lawsuits.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","lawsuit against volkswagen korea ceo ,sued german carmaker volkswagen over ,against volkswagen korea ceo ,against volkswagen korea ceo thomas ,volkswagen due to volkswagen trickery","['korean', 'german', 'Volkswagen', 'Countermeasure Committee for Public Livelihood', 'Volkswagen Korea', 'Thomas Kuehl', 'Volkswagen', 'Volkswagen', 'volkswagen', 'Volkswagen Korea', 'korean', 'Korea', 'german', 'korean', 'Barun', 'the Environment Ministry', 'Volkswagen', 'the Environment Ministry ’s', 'the Transport Ministry', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.04892445  0.15289557

The amount asked will increase if government spending on the incident increases, the ministry said. The indemnity claim follows the recent decision by the nation's top court to uphold a life sentence for the captain of the sunken ferry for murdering 304 passengers aboard, mostly high school students on a school trip.Prior to filing the suit, the ministry has taken measures for preservation of the company's property so that the company cannot siphon off the funds. So far, some 160 billion won of company assets has been seized provisionally, the ministry said.The ministry is planning to file separate suits against the heirs of Yoo Byung-eun, former chairman of Semo Group, as well as to other partner companies who also held liable in causing the accident.

The Supreme Court said it would launch a special “one-stop” center under the Patent Court where the international intellectual property conflicts can be negotiated and resolved. “Mediation is crucial in patent cases, as they mostly deal with highly professional knowledge and sensitive issues involving confidential information of the concerned businesses,” the authorities said.The court will contemplate expanding the center as an international organ that encompasses Asian countries upon mutual negotiation in the future, they added. This is part of the top court’s efforts to improve the specialty of the Patent Court. In June, the top court launched a special task force called the “Intellectual Property Hub Court” committee to discuss plans to boost the Patent Court’s professionalism. Public voices have raised concern over improving the Patent Court’s professionalism as it frequently covers sensitive interest issues of global industries, especially the information technology sector and pharmaceutical businesses. Along with the mediation center, the top court vowed to lengthen the maximum work term of the patent court judges to six years to improve their expertise, up from the current two to four years. To better support judges’ technical deliberation, more than a dozen doctorate-degree patent experts will be recruited, the authorities said. Starting from January, the Patent Court will cover a wider range of intellectual property litigations, such as compensation suits and sales bans, as the patent lawsuit-related rule is modified. The court currently only deals with lawsuits over annulling the trial decision. Starting as early as February next year, the patent court’s trials will also be available in English, including testimony and pleas. Currently, all legal processes are conducted only in Korean. Foreign-language documents must also be submitted in Korean after translation. Earlier this year, the committee said it would establish an “international justice department” in order better support the legal accessibility of foreigners. English trials will be held only upon the agreement of the plaintiffs and defendants. Once introduced, Korea will be the first East Asian country to adopt an English-language patent lawsuit system.

However, he received a “not guilty” verdict for taking a total of 16 photographs containing women’s entire bodies, rather than specific body parts such as legs.From April to May, the man sneakily took pictures of body parts of women, mostly wearing revealing clothing, such as miniskirts or shorts, at the subway station almost every day. The police found a total of 58 photographs on his phone. Among them, 16 of the photos were of the women’s entire bodies, while the rest were of the bare legs of the women. According to Article 13 of South Korea’s Act on Special Cases Concerning the Punishment of Sexual Crimes, a person “who takes pictures of another person’s body, which may cause any sexual stimulus or shame, against the latter’s will by using a camera or other similar mechanism, or who distributes, sells, leases or openly exhibits or screens such pictures so taken shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than five years or by a fine not exceeding 10 million won ($8,520).” A subway station in Seoul. YonhapIn explaining its decision to only punish the criminal for taking pictures of specific body parts but not entire bodies, the Seoul Northern District Court said it was illogical to interpret a woman in her summer clothes in the summer months as being a “body that may cause any sexual stimulus or shame,” as more women choose to dress casually and less conservatively. They said taking such pictures of a woman’s body as a whole is a matter related to portrait rights. However, Lee Soo-yeon from the Korean Women’s Development Institute said sneakily taking pictures of women, regardless of which body part, is problematic and should be banned. “Regardless of what it is -- the entire body or particular body parts -- secretly taking photographs of women is voyeuristic,” she said. “The government should do more to prevent such practices, by educating the public on why it is wrong to take pictures of someone else without that person’s consent.”Meanwhile, the Ministry of Gender Equality was criticized during the National Assembly inspection last month for its campaign ad against sexual harassment using smart devices in public transportation. The ad encouraged women not to wear miniskirts, or to cover their legs if they do, when riding the subway, but failed to denounce taking photographs of someone in secret, said Rep. Lim Su-kyung from the New Politics Alliance for Democracy. “Such ads are based on a notion that when a woman gets sexually harassed, she must have done something to deserve it. Now this is very problematic,” she said during the audit last month.

The officials said some 90 students who were below the cutoff grade were admitted to the school as a result.The SMOE decided to file charges with the prosecution against the school officials ― including the school’s chairman of the board Kim Seung-yu, a former chairman of Hana Financial Group ― in violation of the law on private education institutes.The special probe also found HAS guilty of violating the law in its hiring process, along with attempting to cover up a case of school violence that occurred in 2011. The academy also allegedly inked several illegal deals with an enterprise established by Hana Group officials.Korean law states that a deal worth 50 million won or more commissioned by a private education institute must go through a public bidding process, a rule the SMOE says the school violated multiple times.HAS is an autonomous private high school founded by Hana Financial Group in 2010. Autonomous private high schools are elite schools granted more leeway in admissions and curriculum in exchange for lower government subsidies. The school came under fire after a revelation by one of its teachers in August that it conducted admissions fraud under the direction of its principal. The SMOE launched a special investigation the following month into this claim. HAS, however, denied all charges and said it is pursuing legal action against the SMOE on what it claimed was “a biased probe.”By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","academy rigged the admissions tests ,2011 the academy also allegedly ,prosecution against the school officials ,allegedly inked several illegal deals ,fraud by hana academy seoul","['Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education', 'Hana Academy Seoul', 'SMOE', 'SMOE', 'Kim Seung - yu', 'Hana Financial Group', 'Hana Group', 'korean', 'SMOE', 'Hana Financial Group', 'SMOE', 'SMOE']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.2352515  -0.0574228

He expressed regret that despite concerted efforts to alleviate safety concerns, there are still those that have reservations about the project as a whole.""The government plans to listen to concerns expressed and redouble efforts to communicate with the people of Yeongdeok,"" the policymaker stressed.The statement was made the morning after a local committee opposing the construction of the reactors held a countywide vote on Wednesday and Thursday. Of the 34,432 registered voters in Yeongdeok, 11,201 cast their ballots resulting in a voter turnout of 32.5 percent, which is just shy of the minimum one-third needed to make any local elections binding. Organizers, however, plan to release the results of the vote. The government has persistently said the vote did not meet existing rules regarding a referendum and discounted it as nothing more than some groups trying to drum up opposition for a national project.  The government already designated areas in Yeongdeok as the construction site of its new Cheongji nuclear power facility in September 2012.

Separate from the failed talks, the National Assembly passed a package of pending bills including a ban against large retailers doing business near traditional markets to jumpstart the parliamentary session, which has been stalled over the government’s push to reinstate state-authored textbooks.While the ruling Saenuri Party and the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy passed a motion to extend the operation of a committee dealing with electoral rules, they were required to vote their new electoral map by the Friday plenary session.If the lawmakers fail to come up with new constituency maps by year-end, the country is to head to general elections without any electoral zones, as the efficacy of the current zones expire on Dec. 31. The parties, however, have not met a single legal deadline for rezoning electorates since early 2000s.The lawmakers have clashed over the rules that would determine the number of seats for the lawmakers elected through votes at local constituencies and the seats for those who obtain their parliamentary seats through proportional representation system. The Saenuri Party has favored a plan to reduce the number of proportional representation seats, but the NPAD and another minor opposition party insist the 54 seats given to the proportional representation scheme remain the same as the current level.The parties are to continue the negotiation at the extended electoral rules committee.In a 188-14 vote, with 23 abstaining, the rival parties agreed to extend the committee’s operation -- which was set to end on Nov. 15 -- until Dec. 15. The Saenuri Party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung(left) and the NPAD leader Rep. Moon Jae-in. YonhapAmong the approved bills are a ban against large-scale grocery chains from opening up branches near small and local supermarkets and vendors.The revised environment law would also give the government the right to demand and order adjustment to automobiles’ gas emission in case of flaws.Meanwhile, the parties remain at odds over the bills that would overhaul rules in the labor market and business sectors.The rival lawmakers have also clashed over how to fund the government’s child care program and whether to implement a policy to impose caps on skyrocketing housing prices. They have also remained split over the parliamentary approval of the ratification of the Korea-China Free Trade Agreement. The legislative meeting came amid Cheong Wa Dae’s repeated calls for the lawmakers to take legislative action to jump-start the nation’s faltering economy. The presidential office highlighted that the pending contentious bills and the approval of the Korea-China FTA are “urgent.” Dismissing speculation that a Cabinet shake-up is imminent, Cheong Wa Dae pressed lawmakers into passing the pending bills. Several Cabinet members are expected to be replaced, as some have already resigned and more are expected to leave their post to prepare for the 2016 general elections.“The 19th Assembly is now in session. Among the parliamentary agenda items are bills related to reforming labor markets and boosting the economy, as well as the Korea-China FTA agreement. We sincerely hope the bills will be passed during the current parliamentary session,” Kim Sung-woo, senior presidential secretary of public affairs, said Thursday.

As the oldest of some 630,000 students who took the annual college entrance exam Thursday morning, Jo stood outside the gates of Hongik University Girls’ High School, recounting her journey as youngsters chanted cheers and parents hugged their children in the background.“I want to go to college. As long as there’s still time, I will do as much as I can,” the elderly student of Ilsung Women’s High School told local media. After she was forced to drop out of middle school in 1950 as the war broke out, she said she is finally ready to see her dream come true.Jo’s determination was echoed at some 1,212 venues across the country that hosted the state-commissioned exam, called the Suneung, which is considered the most crucial step for students seeking to enter college. Students get a last-minute read before the college entrance exam at a school in Seoul on Thursday. ( Park Hyun-koo/The Korea Herald)The key subjects for the exam are math, Korean language ― of which students can choose between the easier A type and more difficult B type ― and English. Students also choose two subjects related to social studies, history and philosophy while choosing another subject related to a foreign language that is not English. Test-takers are graded on a nine-level curved scale.As the test is held only once a year, authorities usually take extensive measures to make sure that students do not miss the exams, including extra police officers, special traffic control and grounding planes during the English listening section.For Hyun, an 18-year-old student from Seoul, not even a bone fracture from a truck accident was enough to thwart her will to take the crucial exam. On her insistence to take the Suneung, Severance Hospital offered her a VIP room to take the test in while the Seoul education office sent four officials to oversee her exam.She was not the only test taker who overcame obstacles. Seventy-five surviving students from last year’s ferry sinking ― which left 304 dead or missing and the country’s spirit shattered ― also took the Suneung.“You have endured a period which no other high school senior can possibly comprehend. Good luck with the exam. You have worked hard for it,” wrote Yoo Kyung-keun, who lost his daughter in the fatal accident, on his Facebook page. The focal point of this year’s exam was its difficulty. The government’s guidelines of an “easy Suneung,” which was established over concern for rising private education costs, have come under criticism for failing to distinguish each student’s academic competence.In the government-commissioned mock test in September, the last one held nationwide before this year’s exam, students had to get a perfect score to receive the top grade for Korean language A, math B and English. “This year’s Suneung questions were similar in difficulty to the last two mock tests,” said Lee Jun-shik, the head of the Suneung question committee at the Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation, fueling concerns that authorities have failed yet again managing the difficulty levels. The KICE is in charge of making the Suneung questions.Lee stressed that the KICE placed extra effort to prevent errors by adding more members to the committee. Last year, the state-run organization was forced to admit faults in two Suneung questions, in the aftermath of which its former head was pressured to resign. The Education Ministry also launched a reform committee for Suneung.Seoul’s education superintendent Cho Hee-yeon said the Suneung, and the competition-based education it represents, needs to be overhauled. “Suneung is a system that classifies (students) into ratings. The exam should instead offer a way (for students) to prove what he or she has learned in various methods,” he said while visiting Yongsan High School in central Seoul to cheer on the test-takers.The KICE will take complaints on Suneung questions until 6:00 p.m. Monday on its website, and the results will be reflected on the final answers for the Suneung that will be posted on Nov. 23. The applicants will be notified of their scores on Dec. 2.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","annual college entrance exam thursday ,girls high school recounting her ,college entrance exam thursday morning ,college students get last minute ,annual college entrance exam","['Jo Myeong - ja', 'Jo', 'Hongik University', 'Ilsung Women ’s High School', 'Jo ’s', 'Suneung', 'Seoul', 'Park Hyun - koo', 'korean', 'Hyun', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Yoo Kyung - keun', 'korean', 'Lee Jun - shik', 'Suneung', 'the Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation', 'KICE', 'Suneung', 'Lee', 'KICE', 'Suneung', 'the Education Ministry', 'Suneung', 'Seoul', 'Cho Hee - yeon', 'Suneung', 'Yongsan High School', 'Seoul', 'KICE', 'Suneung']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3749176   0.16261092

Upholding the lower court’s ruling, the nation’s top court ruled Rep. Song Kwang-ho of the ruling Saenuri Party to four years in jail for taking bribes worth 65 million won from the railway parts supplier AVT to help the company win contracts with the state-run Korea Rail Network Authority. The court also ordered him to pay a fine of 70 million won ($61,000) and forfeit another 65 million won. The court said that testimonies that he received the bribe were trustworthy and the original verdict that he abused his power in return of the kickback was appropriate. Company officials asked Song to help them win government contracts related to the construction of high-speed railways in the Jeolla provinces, in return for the kickbacks. The four-term lawmaker was the chairman of the parliamentary committee on land, infrastructure and transport from 2010-2012. The committee oversees the railway management agency. It also reaffirmed the lower court’s decision that even if the bribe was given in smaller portions and was delivered several times, it still remains subject to additional punishment. Under the law, a suspect accused of receiving a bribe worth more than 30 million won faces additional punishment. Last year, the parliament voted down the prosecution’s request to arrest Song, but the lawmaker was arrested after he was sentenced to four years in prison at his first trial. He later appealed the ruling, which an appeals court rejected.The appeals court, rejecting Song’s plea, said that he had committed a serious crime abusing his power as a four-term lawmaker and had abandoned his integrity as a legislator.On the same day, another four-year prison term was upheld by the top court for Rep. Kim Jae-yun of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy convicted of taking 54 million won from a head of Seoul Art College. Rep. Lee is one of three NPAD lawmakers charged with the bribery case. The three lawmakers pushed a law that allowed the school to be recognized as a “training school” and eliminate its previous name “vocational institute.” The prosecution has pressed seven- and five-year jail terms to Reps. Shin Geh-ryeun and Shin Hak-yong, respectively. They are waiting for their first trial to proceed.Another Saenuri lawmaker, Rep. Cho Hyun-ryong, is also in an appellate trial over charges he received kickbacks from the railway part supplier. He was sentenced with five years in prisons from the lower courts.With Song and Lee losing their parliamentary memberships, the National Assembly now has 295 seats in total, with the ruling Saenuri Party holding 158 and the NPAD, 127.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","sentenced two lawmakers to four ,thursday sentenced two lawmakers ,on thursday sentenced two lawmakers ,thursday sentenced two lawmakers to ,taking bribes worth 65 million","['the Supreme Court', 'Song Kwang - ho', 'Saenuri Party', 'Korea Rail Network Authority', 'Song', 'Jeolla', 'Song', 'Song ’s', 'Kim Jae - yun', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Seoul Art College', 'Lee', 'NPAD', 'Shin Geh - ryeun', 'Shin Hak - yong', 'Saenuri', 'Cho Hyun - ryong', 'Song', 'Lee', 'the National Assembly', 'Saenuri Party', 'NPAD', 'Cho Chung - un']",0,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.51838893  0.53869671

So, we have more than just Russia,"" he said of China.In August, Trump said the North's leader is either ""mad"" or ""a genius,"" and much more ""unstable"" and difficult to deal with than his late father.North Korea has conducted three underground nuclear tests so far, in 2006, 2009 and 2013. The country has also conducted a series of long-range missile and rocket launches since 1998. In its most recent launch in late 2012, the North succeeded in putting a satellite into orbit.Analysts have warned that it is only a matter of time until the North develops nuclear-tipped missiles. Some experts have recently warned that the communist nation's nuclear arsenal could expand to as many as 100 bombs by 2020.The six-party talks aimed at resolving the North Korean standoff have been stalled since late 2008. North Korea demands the unconditional resumption of negotiations, while the U.S. says that Pyongyang must first take concrete steps demonstrating its denuclearization commitments.Trump has drawn keen attention from South Korean media for his repeated, unfounded criticism of the Asian ally for relying on the U.S. for its defense without giving the U.S. anything in return while making a lot of money.About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea to help defend the Asian ally from the communist North, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War that ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, which left the divided peninsula still technically at war.Seoul has long shared the cost of stationing U.S. forces.

The test started at 8:40 a.m. and was to run through 5 p.m., including lunch and breaks, the ministry said.As in previous years, the government imposed various traffic control and anti-noise measures as part of efforts to ensure that the significant test was executed without any glitches.Buses and subway trains extended their rush hour services by two hours to help all exam-takers arrive at the test sites on time, the ministry said. The stock markets opened for trade one hour late, while government offices and enterprises in nearby areas also opened an hour later than usual to keep the roads clear for students on their way to the test centers, it said. Police operated a temporary call center for students in need of a ride offering to transport them to the test centers by patrol car or on the back of a motorcycle.Test applicants were banned from having electronic devices, including mobile phones, digital cameras, MP3 players, electronic calculators and smart watches, at their desks on concerns they might be used to cheat, the ministry said. Second-year high school students gathered in front of testing sites in the pre-dawn hours to lend support to seniors taking the tests, waving placards reading ""Jackpot!"" and ""Strength for You!""""I arrived here at around 11 p.m. yesterday to get a good spot for cheering,"" said 17-year-old high school student Lee Seng-geun, singing a song for seniors with dozens of his friends.Parents were seen waiting outside test centers or praying in Buddhist temples. ""I packed my daughter's favorite lunch,"" a 48-year-old mother of a test taker in Seoul said, adding that she will visit a temple later in the day to pray for her daughter. Right after the beginning of the test, the government said it made the questions easier or similar to the previous year.""This year's exam was similar to last year's,"" said Lee Jun-sik, head of the test development committee and a Chinese language and literature professor at Seoul's Sungkyunkwan University.The education ministry will announce the answers to the questions on Nov. 23, and the applicants will be individually notified of their test results by Dec. 2.

Na Seong-lin of the Saenuri Party, after the government-ruling party consultation meeting. Ruling Saenuri Party lawmakers Reps. Kim Jung-hoon (left), Kim Sung-tae (center) and Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs Lee Dong-phil attend the drought response meeting in Seoul on Wednesday. YonhapMore than 700 million tons of water are stored in the 16 newly built dams along the four rivers ― the Hangang, Nakdonggang, Geumgang and Yeongsangang. The water is not being utilized because the dams are located far from the affected areas, officials said.The measures were devised as the country has been experiencing the worst drought in more than a century.Officials fear that the problem, if left unsolved, would severely affect agricultural production and quickly raise food and other consumer prices. The national weather agency forecasts that the current drought is likely to last until next April. Officials stressed that the plan was devised to utilize water from the four rivers and is not aimed at refurbishing them ― a controversial project undertaken by the previous administration. “This proposal is not related to the four-river project and we need to devise logical and objective ideas to overcome the drought,” said Kim Jung-hoon, policy committee chairman of the ruling party.The Four Major Rivers Restoration Project was a mega state plan pushed by the former Lee Myung-bak administration. The project has remained stalled amid concerns over causing massive environmental damage.An internal probe conducted right before President Park Geun-hye took office in early 2013 said the project was seriously flawed and had caused environmental damage such as lowering the water quality in the rivers.The state project was halted as the ruling party overturned its earlier position and urged the government to reassess it, which invited fresh criticism from Lee’s loyalists that the party was trying to protect the then-incoming leader Park from inheriting the financial and political burden.The drought measure is also expected to face resistance from the main opposition party. The New Politics Alliance for Democracy has been opposing the idea, calling it a waste of taxpayers’ money. Some experts also raised concerns that the plan lacks feasibility, saying the distance from the weirs to drought-stricken areas is too far.

The Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office filed charges against the 67-year-old Chung for taking bribes and breaching his duties by causing financial losses to the nation’s biggest steelmaker, it said in a press briefing Wednesday morning. Chung Joon-yang (Yonhap)The prosecution also indicted other key figures -- former POSCO vice chairman Chung Dong-hwa, 63, and Dongyang Construction chairman Bae Sung-ro, 60 -- without detention for their involvement in embezzlement, bribery and breach of trust. The move came seven months after the prosecution launched a probe in March into POSCO’s alleged corruption upon a tip-off the steel giant had dubious deals with subcontractors, affiliates and high-profile politicians. Chung is suspected of masterminding dubious mergers and acquisitions deals during his term as chairman between 2009 and 2014, allegedly causing 159 billion won ($137.5 million) in losses to POSCO. In one example from 2011, he led the acquisition of a stake in plant equipment firm Sungin Geotec, owned by a close friend, for well over market value.  Chung also allegedly exerted undue influence in getting a family member a job as a high-level official at Kosteel, a partner company of POSCO. Kosteel has been suspected of helping POSCO evade taxes by doctoring transaction records and creating slush funds. Lee Sang-deuk (Yonhap) The prosecution additionally accused him of offering deals worth 1.2 billion won to small maintenance company TM Tech, run by a close aid of former President Lee Myung-bak’s elder brother Lee Sang-deuk.In return, the 79-year-old former ruling Saenuri Party lawmaker allegedly exerted influence on government officials to appoint Chung as POSCO chairman and to lift planning restrictions so the company could resume its construction of a new steel factory in 2011. He was indicted without detention on influence peddling charges. The prosecution indicted former POSCO vice chairman Dong-hwa for creating a slush fund worth $5 million in Vietnam during his term in the office and embezzling a total of 1 billion won. He allegedly took kickbacks including cash and golf trips from the subcontractor in return for granting it business deals. He also gave an executive position at POSCO to a high-ranking government official’s high school friend in early 2011.Bae Sung-ro, another key figure at the center of the corruption scandal, was indicted on charges of fraud. The former chairman of Dongyang Construction allegedly covered up his company’s financial records to win construction bids and loans from state-run banks. He allegedly received preferential treatment from POSCO leaders in exchange for kickbacks and creating slush funds for POSCO and its affiliates.As a result of the probe, the prosecution shed light on widespread corruption cases stemming from the formerly state-run POSCO’s heavy reliance on the government, its leadership’s cozy relations with politicians and lax management. POSCO, which was established under the rule of former President Park Chung-hee and run by the government since then, began its privatization process in 1998 in the face of the Asian financial crisis. Though POSCO was completely privatized in 2000, its operation and appointment of the chief executives have been greatly swayed by the government.“As POSCO doesn’t have a family owner, there were cases in which company executives with only a limited term colluded with politicians and gave favors to certain subcontractors (in connection with them),” an official from the prosecution said. But prosecutors came under fire for dragging out the probe over months without a visible outcome, possibly taking a toll on the steel giant’s business. Their multiple requests for detention warrants for Chung and Bae were rejected in the process due to a lack of evidence. The prosecution indicted a total of 32 people, mostly from POSCO and its subcontractors. Among them, 17 were detained. It plans to continue probing the six-term lawmaker Lee Byung-suk of the ruling Saenuri Party to see whether he was involved in the corruption case.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","wednesday with the prosecution indicting ,prosecution indicting former posco chairman ,widespread corruption cases stemming ,the corruption scandal was indicted ,the office and embezzling total","['POSCO', 'Chung Joon - yang', 'the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Chung', 'Chung Joon - yang', 'posco', 'Chung Dong - hwa', 'Dongyang Construction', 'Bae Sung - ro', 'POSCO', 'Chung', 'POSCO', 'Sungin Geotec', 'Chung', 'Kosteel', 'POSCO', 'posco', 'Lee Sang - deuk', 'TM Tech', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Lee Sang - deuk', 'Saenuri Party', 'Chung', 'POSCO', 'POSCO', 'Dong - hwa', 'Vietnam', 'POSCO', 'Sung - ro', 'Dongyang Construction', 'posco', 'POSCO', 'POSCO', 'POSCO', 'Park Chung - hee', 'asian', 'POSCO', 'Chung', 'Bae', 'POSCO', 'Lee Byung - suk', 'Saenuri Party', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60242105  0.72989577

Kim had said she is coming out of the closet in hopes that “people can accept themselves for whoever they are, and live positively.”“Her statement surprised all of us. We assume that people are not sexual minorities unless they say it out loud. To say one is gay takes courage to deny such an unspoken assumption,” the QIS said in its statement. It added that the group is not backing her campaign, but merely complimenting her on coming out of the closet. Kim said that it is worth forfeiting her privacy for “a chance to change all our lives.”“What I want the SNU to become is a society where an individual can exist as themselves, where all lives are beautiful just the way they are,” she said during her campaign Thursday.Kim, who is the sole candidate for the university’s 58th student council president, is currently the vice president of the council and a member of a committee for the rights of student sexual minorities at SNU. She was also involved in the student movement to resolve a recent sexual violence case against an SNU professor.If she wins, Kim will become the first public sexual minority to head the student council for the most prestigious university in Korea.

Kim Man-bok (Yonhap)The two join a host of other former Cabinet and Cheong Wa Dae officials who have stepped down from their seats in the past several weeks to prepare for the elections.Their resignations are also speeding up talks within the ruling party over their nomination strategy, as factional tensions loom between those loyal to President Park Geun-hye and those outside the mainstream of the party.Kim’s bid, in particular, raised eyebrows, as he is already in hot waters over his conduct after joining the Saenuri Party via facsimile in August.In a “letter to the public,” Kim said that while he served as the spy agency chief during the progressive Roh Moo-hyun administration, Kim said he was joining the conservative Saenuri Party for his personal beliefs.“As I have served in the NIS, I tend to think in the realm of conservativeness. And therefore a lot of the policies of the Saenuri Party are in sync with what I believe,” he said.He added that if he was to earn the party nomination, he was confident of his win in Busan, as there are already gatherings supporting him as a lawmaker candidate.Kim’s letter was considered a refusal to leave the party in light of controversy that he had publicly supported an opposition party candidate in the Oct. 28 by-election after he joined the Saenuri Party in August.The Saenuri Party was discussing whether to expel him. They said they will take due measures after an internal investigation of him is completed.Kim explained in the letter that he had shown support as a favor and that he had not known his application to join the Saenuri Party had already been accepted.Kim was put in the media spotlight by saying in an interview with a local newspaper that there was a permanent hotline between the leaders of the two Koreas during the progressive governments.The NIS moved to file a complaint with the prosecution against its former chief as he appears to have revealed confidential information he obtained during his leadership from 2006-2008.The NIS believes that Kim broke the law banning former and current NIS employees from revealing state secrets they learned while performing official duties. The law also bans an NIS employee from publishing a book concerning his or her NIS duties without the permission from the incumbent NIS chief.

Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon (left) and lawyer Kang Yong-seok YonhapAccording to legal sources, Park filed for indemnification for damages worth 110 million won ($95,400) with the Seoul Central District Court. Park reportedly claimed that Kang “was consistently distributing false facts that myself and my son committed irregularities pertaining to the military service or that we have evaded conscription through illegal means.”He went on to say that such allegations have been confirmed false by the prosecution, the court and other state organizations and that he was seeking compensation for defamation and violation of personal rights.Park Ju-sin’s military service has been a constant subject of debate between the senior Park and conservative critics, leading to scores of legal suits and reexamination of the junior Park’s medical records.Park Ju-sin joined the Air Force in 2011, but was sent home four days later after suffering pain in his legs. The son was released from active duty after the Military Manpower Administration found him unfit due to a herniated disc.Park was specifically taking issue with comments made by Kang since June on several cable television programs that “suspicions surrounding Joo-sin remain unsolved.”In 2012, Kang claimed Park’s son fabricated his medical records to evade military service and publicly demanded another physical examination. Kang later resigned from his lawmaker’s seat when the Severance Hospital confirmed the same year that Park Ju-sin had the herniated disc and that it was a valid reason for his exemption.Park has filed defamation suits against 16 Internet users who raised draft-dodging rumors, some of whom Kang is defending as an attorney.A medical expert in radiology who had raised similar suspicions against Park Ju-sin is currently on trial.From news reports","son alleged military draft dodging ,park has filed defamation suits ,defamation suits against 16 internet ,soon filed defamation suit against ,park won soon filed defamation","['Seoul City', 'Park Won - soon', 'Kang Yong - seok', 'Park Ju - sin', 'Kang', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Kang Yong - seok', 'yonhapaccording', 'Park', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'Park', 'Kang', 'Park Ju - sin ’s', 'Park', 'Park Ju - sin', 'the Air Force', 'the Military Manpower Administration', 'Kang', 'Joo - sin', 'Kang', 'Kang', 'Severance Hospital', 'Park Ju - sin', 'Kang', 'Park Ju - sin']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.0811711   0.04957056

Even after his appointment, the KIC chairman drew flak for making controversial deals. Ahn, in particular, drew criticism for his decision to invest more than 400 billion won (US$351.6 million) of the KIC's money into the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team that some critics argued may lead to considerable losses down the line. Besides the opposition party, which called on the Board of Audit and Inspection (BAI) to start an investigation in the first place, some members of the ruling Saenuri Party have been asking for his dismissal.Related to the resignation, the finance ministry said that since he has stepped down, the BAI will halt its three-monthlong probe.The ministry said a steering committee of eight people will be set up to pick an eligible person to manage the sovereign fund.

(Yonhap)The police arrested 371 foreign nationals, of whom 27 were physically detained, for involvement in gambling and phishing scams during the two-month crackdown that started in September. In most cases, foreigners gambled for fun with their friends, without being aware it was illegal. But this time, police caught a professional criminal ring luring foreigners into large-scale gambling, according to the police.“Gambling or voice phishing with falsified bankbooks are not classified as severe crimes, but we decided to crack down on the crimes as illegal money can sneak out of Korea through these crimes,” an official from the National Police Agency said. Of the remaining 337 foreign nationals arrested, 194 were nabbed for severe violence, followed by 70 for gang violence, 61 for drug use and 12 for sex crimes, the police said. Most of the gangs form groups with friends or colleagues to collectively use violence for minor issues and are not unified enough to be called organized crime rings, the police said. The National Police Agency clamped down on foreign gangs in the first half of the year, either deporting or leading them to leave the country, according to the police. Out of 121 cases of robbery and assaults, 96 were committed against people of the same nationality. As those from the same country tend to gather together, they have more chances to argue or clash, the police said. Of the remaining 25 cases, 13 were committed against South Koreans, mostly in relation to delayed payments, and 10 percent were committed against foreigners of different nationalities, according to police. Most were unplanned, they added. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heralcrop.com)","police arrested 371 foreign nationals ,the police arrested 371 foreign ,caught professional criminal ring luring ,arrested total of 708 foreigners ,thursday they had arrested total","['Korea', 'the National Police Agency', 'Korea', 'the National Police Agency', 'the National Police Agency', 'South Koreans']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37156162  0.50304514

He died on the way to a hospital.Lee was initially indicted on a murder charge in 1997 and sentenced to 20-year jail term, but later was cleared of the charge for lack of evidence. Prosecutors indicted Patterson on lesser charges, including elimination of evidence and possession of a dangerous weapon. He received an 18-month prison term, but was freed in an annual amnesty in 1998. During the questioning, Lee found it difficult to recall the situation in which the murder took place in April 1997, but the Korean-American said in the courtroom that he saw Patterson suddenly turning to the victim and stabbing him. “When the murder took place, I went to the bathroom to wash my hands,” he said. “Patterson suddenly started to stab him. I turned around and I was shocked.“Cho was trying to hit the accused with his right hand, but Patterson stabbed him and kept stabbing him.” He admitted that there were only three people including Patterson, Cho and himself at the crime scene. But he continued to accuse Patterson of murdering Cho.He also took issue with the credibility of the past investigation records and how he was treated during the questioning by the police and prosecutors. “I have consistently asked for an interpreter, but they didn’t provide me with one,” he said. “I was interrogated without an interpreter, coerced and threated during the first investigation for 17 hours. They didn’t let me go to sleep.” Lee has actively sought his rights at the court, refusing to answer personal questions, pointing out the prosecution’s evidence is wrong, demanding more pieces of paper to take notes, and asking for explanations when he did not understand the questions. While Lee was giving his testimonies, Patterson, who appeared in a sky-blue prisoner uniform, calmly yet sternly stared at Lee and the translator in turns. The mother of the victim Cho also took the witness stand and asked the court to heavily punish her son’s murderer at the hearing.“Judges and prosecutors, please slap our son’s murderer with the heaviest punishment for our son who unfairly died,” Lee Bok-soo, 73, said in the courtroom.“I don’t know what to say in front of the man who killed my son as I am too furious,” Cho’s mother said with her voice trembling with rage. “They (Patterson and Lee) are just sitting there shifting blame and denying their crime, which made me think that it is exactly the same as the trial 18 years ago,” she said. “If they have a conscience, they should come forward and apologize. They are only human beings in disguise.”As the prosecution began showing pictures of Cho’s blood from the crime scene at the hearing, Cho’s mother expressed her discomfort and left the courtroom in the middle of it. The next hearing is scheduled for Nov. 19.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","killing south korean college student ,murder case testified wednesday that ,stabbing him when the murder ,murder case testified wednesday ,stood trial as murder suspect","['korean - American', 'south korean', 'Arthur John Patterson', 'Edward Lee', 'Seoul Central District Court', 'Patterson', 'Cho Choong - pil', 'Burger King', 'Itaewon', 'Seoul', 'Patterson', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'Cho', 'Lee', 'Patterson', 'Lee', 'korean', 'Patterson', 'Patterson', 'Patterson', 'Patterson', 'Cho', 'Patterson', 'Cho', 'Lee', 'Patterson', 'Lee', 'Cho', 'Lee Bok - soo', 'Patterson', 'Lee', 'Cho ’s', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.08688432  0.33869439

Some will be personally invited by the NIKH and others will submit their applications at the HIKH homepage from Wednesday to Monday. “The focal point of the textbook dispute was related to modern and contemporary history. ... We will invite legal and military experts as well to provide a multidimensional view of history,” Kim said. According to the provisional plans, there will be 36 authors led by six main authors who will head each part of Korean history; prehistoric times, ancient history, unified Korean kingdoms of the Goryeo Dynasty (918-1392), Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910), modern Korea and contemporary Korea. Accompanying Kim at the briefing was Shin Hyong-sik, a professor emeritus of Ewha Womans University and an expert in Korea’s ancient history, who will lead the ancient history section. “I felt that the current textbooks have many problems. I took the job because I felt fact-based and clear content (in the new textbook) would allow people to approach history more easily,” Shin said. The other confirmed main author was Choi Mong-lyong, an anthropologist and professor emeritus at Seoul National University. Choi was slated to attend the briefing, but was not present because his students were concerned about his “safety” due to unspecified reasons. The remaining details will be set by the end of the month. The writing and screening process will continue from December to November 2016, and the books will be tested by educators in the field in December 2016. They will be printed and distributed in 2017.Despite Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea’s pledge that everything related to textbook publication would be transparent and fully disclosed at Wednesday’s briefing, many aspects were left unanswered.The NIKH was vague on whether or not it would reveal the names of all the authors.“We should let the authors feel relaxed (while working), at least until the copies are finished,” said Kim, indicating it was possible that the authors’ names would not be revealed at all until the publication was nearly complete.“It is possible that disclosing their identities will hinder their work,” said Jin Jae-gwan, the head of the NIKH’s division of history compilation. Hwang had also vowed to place more emphasis on ancient history, but Jin said that it was “not appropriate to discuss the content beforehand,” and said that sensitive topics would be discussed with the authors. The state-run body was also unclear on how it would address the parts that government leaders had pinpointed as “biased,” such as descriptions of North Korea and the communist state’s 2010 torpedo attack on the South Korean warship Cheonan. Jin said the concerns raised by the government “will be reflected” and it will invite “the best experts” and conduct a screening process via several committees within the organization. While NIKH head Kim vowed to exclude the far-right or far-left individuals as authors, the organization did not elaborate on how to distinguish which scholars fell into those categories.“This is a difficult question. ... It is something we have to consider after the authors are confirmed,” said Jin. By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","history textbooks we will create ,for secondary school history textbooks ,ministry on tuesday to retake ,school history textbooks we will ,planned state issued history textbooks","['National Institute of korean History', 'the Education Ministry', 'NIKH', 'Kim Jung - bae', 'Kim', 'NIKH', 'Kim', 'korean', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Kim', 'Shin Hyong - sik', 'Ewha Womans University', 'Korea', 'Shin', 'Choi Mong - lyong', 'Seoul National University', 'Choi', 'Hwang Woo - yea ’s', 'NIKH', 'Kim', 'Jin Jae - gwan', 'NIKH', 'Hwang', 'Jin', 'North Korea', 'south korean', 'Jin', 'NIKH', 'Kim', 'Jin']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47933111  0.43164262

He died on the way to a hospital.At the crime scene, there were only two other people apart from the victim -- Cho, Patterson and a Korean-American Edward Lee. Lee was initially indicted on a murder charge in 1997 and sentenced to 20-year-jail term, but later was cleared of the charge for lack of evidence. Prosecutors indicted Patterson on lesser charges, including elimination of evidence and possession of a dangerous weapon. He received an 18-month prison term, but was freed in an annual amnesty in 1998. “I don’t know what to say in front of the guy who killed my son as I am too furious,” Cho’s mother said with her voice trembling with rage. “They (Patterson and Lee) are just sitting there shifting blame and denying their crime, which made me think that it is exactly the same as the trial 18 years ago,” she said. “If they have conscience, they should come forward and apologize.

I could have a meal with my son, look at his face and hold him, but I can’t,” she said, asking the judge to reveal who the real murderer was to ease her son’s pain. In the hearing, the prosecution pointed out that Patterson could face a jail term of up to 20 years as he is now an adult. When the murder took place, he was 18 years old. But Patterson’s lawyer refuted the claims, saying the prosecution misinterpreted Patterson’s testimonies and wrongly assessed the crime situation. Lee appeared at the court as a witness later in the day.

Overturning a lower court's ruling, the appellate court at Seoul Family Court last month granted a divorce to the man, whose identity was withheld, who was blamed for their shattered marriage, court officials said Sunday. The couple tied the knot 45 years ago but agreed to end the marriage 10 years later. Three years later, they reunited, but the husband soon cheated on the wife and had a baby out of wedlock.After 25 years of living apart from his family without any contact or exchanges, the husband initiated the divorce proceedings against his wife in 2013, but it was dismissed in the original trial.But the appellate court found no sufficient reason for them to maintain their legal relationship.""While being separated for the 25 years, their marriage has effectively ended,"" presiding Judge Min Yu-suk said in a ruling last month. ""The plaintiff has also financially supported his children with the wife, and she now is financially stable.""It is the first ruling after the Supreme Court allowed more exceptions in September while maintaining the country's ""fault divorce"" system, in which the spouse responsible for the breakdown of the marriage is not allowed to file a divorce lawsuit.In a 7-6 ruling, the top court said it is too premature to change the law in consideration of the country's social and economic conditions. But it expanded the scope of grounds for exceptive cases: when the spouse at fault is taking care of his/her partner and children enough to make up for the fault and when enough time has passed to make it meaningless to place the blame.

Mike Trotsky, vice president of air and missile defense at the U.S. defense giant, said at a news conference in Washington on Thursday that the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system ― which the company manufactures ― is a subject of “ongoing policy discussions” between the two countries. The event came days ahead of U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter’s trip to Seoul for annual ministerial security talks. Speaking at a parliamentary session, Defense Minister Han Min-koo brushed off the assertion as “groundless.” “The two governments have never talked about it,” he said. A Defense Ministry official also said Seoul’s position remained unchanged: That it will look into the issue after the U.S. makes a decision and requests consultations. “There is no discussion between the sides, whether formal or informal,” he said, adding that THAAD is not on the agenda for the Security Consultative Meeting scheduled for Monday. The Pentagon also echoed the ministry’s remarks, saying it has not reached a decision and thus no official talks have taken place between the allies. “We have made no final decision regarding the deployment of a U.S. THAAD unit to the Republic of Korea, nor have we had any formal consultations with the ROK government on this issue,” Cmdr. Bill Urban, a U.S. Defense Department spokesman, told Yonhap news agency. The unabated controversy over THAAD reflects Seoul’s dilemma deepened by North Korea’s growing missile threats and the stiff opposition of China and Russia, which view its deployment here as de facto participation in the U.S.-led global missile defense program that they say is directed at them.Trotsky stressed the defensive nature of the system, saying it would equip South Korea with multilayer defense and help counter North Korea’s threats. “Having those layers makes it extremely difficult for the enemy to deploy any one technique that would defeat all three systems,” he said.“It can’t be used in an offensive way. The entire system, from the hardware to the software, must have an incoming ballistic missile to launch an interceptor.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","to seoul for annual ministerial ,ministry on friday dismissed lockheed ,conference in washington on thursday ,on friday dismissed lockheed martin ,defense ministry on friday dismissed","['South Korea ’s', 'Defense Ministry', 'Lockheed Martin ’s', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'Mike Trotsky', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'Ash Carter ’s', 'Seoul', 'Defense', 'Han Min - koo', 'Defense Ministry', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Pentagon', 'U.S.', 'the Republic of Korea', 'ROK', 'Cmdr', 'Bill Urban', 'U.S. Defense Department', 'Yonhap news agency', 'Seoul', 'North Korea ’s', 'China', 'Russia', 'Trotsky', 'South Korea', 'North Korea ’s', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28464463  0.54867864

But he must go through a National Assembly hearing before he can take over the post. “Kim has gained insight and experience in the prosecution by leading probes into large-scale corruption cases,” Cheong Wae Dae spokesperson Jeong Yeon-guk said of the reason for Kim’s appointment in a news briefing. “As Kim has a firm belief in the rule of law and constitutionalism, we believe he is the right person to correct our society’s unproductive, deeply-rooted evils,” he added.  Kim Soo-nam (Yonhap)Kim, a graduate of Seoul National University’s law school, has held various positions in the prosecution and the Justice Ministry after he passed the bar exam in 1984 and began his career as a judge in 1987. He moved to Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office in 1990.He is known for leading the investigation into former left-wing lawmaker Lee Seok-ki in 2013, when prosecutors arrested him for plotting an armed revolt to overthrow the Seoul government in case of the outbreak of the inter-Korean war. The politically-sensitive probe, however, created a stir, with pro-democracy activists accusing the prosecution of leaning towards the conservative Park administration.Some civic organizations expressed their objection to the appointment, citing his background. They argued that Kim had “abused” the prosecutorial authority to silence the criticism of the government.“The top prosecutor’s position should go to someone who is willing to be independent from the politics, so Kim is not the right person for the post,” the lawyers’ group Lawyers for a Democratic Society said in a press release. Kim was born in the so-called “TK” region, referring to Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province, a stronghold of President Park. He went to the same high school in Daegu as Kang Shin-myeong, the head of the National Police Agency.“I feel a great responsibility to be nominated as prosecutor general at a time when the public has great interest in and expectations of the prosecution. I will calmly and humbly prepare for the confirmation hearing,” Kim said after his appointment. The confirmation hearing is scheduled sometime in the middle of next month, government officials said. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","the next prosecutor general friday ,next prosecutor general friday ,prosecutor general friday the presidential ,next prosecutor general friday the ,prosecutors arrested him for plotting","['Park Geun', 'Kim Soo - nam', 'the Supreme Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Kim', 'Kim Jin - tae', 'National Assembly', 'Kim', 'Jeong Yeon - guk', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim Soo - nam', 'Seoul National University ’s', 'the Justice Ministry', 'Seoul Central District Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Lee Seok - ki', 'Seoul', 'inter - korean', 'Park', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Democratic', 'Society', 'Kim', 'Daegu', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'Daegu', 'Kang Shin - myeong', 'the National Police Agency', 'Kim']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47910279  0.50154299

General Assembly adopted a landmark resolution that calls for the U.N. Security Council to refer North's human rights abuses to the ICC. The resolution led to the Security Council adopting the issue as an official agenda item for the first time.The new proposed resolution, which has been drafted jointly by South Korea, the United States, the European Union and Japan since early this month, was submitted to the Third Committee of the U.N. General Assembly on the eve of the deadline for new resolutions, the source said.The draft was not made public but includes the ICC referral part just like last year's resolution, sources said.The new resolution is also expected to include calls for punishing those responsible for human rights violations and resolving abductions and kidnappings, while voicing concerns about torture, public executions and other types of human rights abuses in the North, according to the sources.It is also expected to include a sentence welcoming the Security Council's adoption of the issue as an official agenda item while calling for the council to hold discussions on it.The move to adopt a new resolution is expected to anger North Korea.But chances are not high for the Security Council to actually refer the issue to the ICC because China and Russia, which have friendlier ties with North Korea than any other countries, are expected to veto such a move. Still the resolution played a great role in drawing international attention to the issue.North Korea has long been labeled one of the worst human rights violators. The communist regime does not tolerate dissent, holds hundreds of thousands of people in political prison camps and keeps tight control over outside information.But the North has bristled at such criticism, calling it a U.S.-led attempt to topple its regime.In June, the State Department said in its annual human rights report that the North's human rights record ""remained among the worst in the world"" last year, with public executions, political prison camps, torture and other abuses taking place in the country.

It also took into account that the three abused Yoon to lesser degrees and tried to save him when the junior solider collapsed.Last year, the lower court sentenced Lee to 35 years for murdering Yoon, while other sergeants and corporals involved received between 10 and 12 years in jail for killing him as accomplices. Yoon died in April 2014 after allegedly being hit in the chest by fellow enlisted soldiers at their barracks while eating snacks. The military says the assault caused a piece of food to obstruct his airway, leading him to die of asphyxiation.The accused reportedly constantly bullied and beat Yoon in the month before his death, making him lick their spittle off the floor or eat toothpaste. They also forcefully prevented him from sleeping. The case shed light on the problems of bullying in the military and its abusive culture in the country where all able-bodied man must serve about two years as conscripts to deter aggressions from North Korea. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","corporals for beating junior soldier ,years in jail for killing ,beating junior soldier to death ,35 years for murdering yoon ,ruling that jailed four sergeants","['South Korea ’s', 'Lee', 'Yoon Seung - joo', 'Yoon', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Yoon', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Yoon', 'Yoon', 'North Korea']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.03691537  0.32931143

In order to put the bill to a vote at a plenary session, the bill has to be approved by related subparliamentary committees.The bill, however, is expected to face a tough road ahead with the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy vowing an all-out war against Park’s plan to issue textbooks written by state-designated writers, including a plan to boycott a proposed talk with the ruling Saenuri Party to resolve pending issues. The NPAD also plans to hold outdoor rallies against Park’s state-authored textbook drive.The plan itself does not require the legislature’s approval. But the government must seek parliamentary endorsement to spend taxpayers’ money to implement the plan. The government has already allocated 4.4 billion won of reserve funds toward the estimated cost of 10 billion won to publish the controversial textbooks. The NPAD, however, has already pledged to disapprove the plan and also plans to request the government to cut the annual budget of the National History Compilation Committee, in an apparent tit for tat.Rival parties are also expected to lock horns over the special allowance allocated to the spy agency, with the NPAD threatening to cut the budget on the National Intelligence Service and instead increase the welfare budget. The NPAD has been demanding imposing stricter monitoring on the government’s spending on special activities, including the money spent by the NIS. The ruling Saenuri Party has been rejecting the demand, citing confidentiality concerns of the spy agency’s activities.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","off monday foreshadowing fierce battle ,government budget kicked off monday ,to deliver her annual speech ,next year government budget kicked ,monday foreshadowing fierce battle","['Seoul', 'Washington', 'the National Assembly ’s', 'the Planning and Finance Committee', 'the National Defense Commission', 'Park', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Park ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'NPAD', 'Park ’s', 'the National History Compilation Committee', 'NPAD', 'the National Intelligence Service', 'NPAD', 'NIS', 'Saenuri Party', 'Cho Chung - un']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.2751292  -0.00769271

YonhapPark also appointed Yook Dong-in, another former journalist and a spokesman of the Financial Services Commission, as the new head of the presidential office’s press center. The job had been vacant for 33 days since the former head Jung Kwang-sam left office last month. Jung had also announced his intention to run in April’s general election. The reshuffle followed a series of resignations from high-profile Cheong Wa Dae officials who are believed to run for the next general election. Aside from Min and Jung, Park Jong-joon, the deputy head of the presidential security service, stepped down earlier this month. Other two presidential special advisers, Yoon Sang-hyun and Kim Jae-won, also resigned last week.

Defense Minister Han Min-koo speaks during a parliamentary session on Monday. (Yonhap)As the reform measures under the act include a plan to decrease the active-duty troop level to 522,000 from the current 633,000 by 2022, the revision has given more time for the Defense Ministry to complete the troop reduction.But the ministry claims that its original plan for the troop drawdown remains unchanged, as criticism surged that the ministry has changed its long-term reform plans too frequently because it has set “unrealistic” goals.A ministry official said that the revision was made as other reform measures are unlikely to be completed by the previous target year of 2020. “The revision came as it would be difficult to complete all the other reform measures by 2020 as stipulated in the act,” the official told The Korea Herald on condition of anonymity. “But the troop reduction plan will remain intact. In fact, given the demographic changes, maintaining even 522,000 troops by 2022 will be difficult.”The South’s troop reduction plan, which is being pushed due to the country’s demographic challenges and technological advancements, has triggered concerns that it could weaken readiness to cope with North Korea’s evolving military threats. The U.S.’ ongoing moves to scale down its ground force have also added to the concerns, as they raised the possibility that Washington might not be able to send sufficient ground troops to the peninsula in case of a contingency.After the end of ground warfare in Afghanistan and Iraq, the U.S. Army has been reducing its forces. It plans to reduce the number to 450,000 from 490,000 by 2017. It is also reportedly considering reducing the figure to 420,000 by 2019. “Currently, the U.S.’ way of conducting military operations overseas is that it minimizes the use of ground forces while bolstering the roles of the air force and navy,” said Park Won-gon, security expert at Handong Global University.“That means the role of South Korea’s ground forces will increase in the event of a conflict.”Maintaining the adequate level of ground forces are crucial not only for combat missions, but also to cope with the possible collapse of the regime in Pyongyang and postwar stabilization operations, experts said, noting Washington might want Seoul to strengthen its group troops.According to a report by the U.S.-based think tank RAND Corp., the U.S. might need at least 150,000 American troops from outside the Asia-Pacific region, in addition to 38,000 troops already in the region including Korea and Japan, to eliminate weapons of mass destruction in the North in case of a contingency.For other military operations, there should be more ground forces, analysts said.“The (RAND) report is trying to explain minimum U.S. ground force requirements. It recognizes that some U.S. security experts feel that Korea ought to do more to provide for Korea’s own defense and objectives (for example unification),” Bruce Bennett, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corp., told The Korea Herald.“But U.S. interests in Korea must look at the elimination of the North Korean WMD threat because WMD that gets to third parties will likely be targeted at the U.S., and because within a few years North Korea may have an ICBM that could be fired at the United States.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","2020 at cabinet meeting tuesday ,cabinet meeting tuesday defense minister ,at cabinet meeting tuesday defense ,meeting tuesday defense minister ,cabinet meeting tuesday defense","['South Korea ’s', 'Cabinet', 'Han Min - koo', 'Yonhap)As', 'the Defense Ministry', 'the Korea Herald', 'North Korea ’s', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'Afghanistan', 'Iraq', 'the U.S. Army', 'U.S.', 'Park Won - gon', 'Handong Global University', 'South Korea ’s', 'Pyongyang', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'RAND Corp.', 'U.S.', 'american', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'RAND', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Bruce Bennett', 'the RAND Corp.', 'the Korea Herald', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'North Korea', 'the United States', 'Song Sang - ho']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60031348  0.29111809

I feel very gloomy,” said NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in after returning from the talks. President Park Geun-hye greets Saenuri Party leader Kim Moo-sung (left) and New Politics Alliance for Democracy leader Moon Jae-in at Cheong Wa Dae on Thursday. YonhapMoon said that the president remained steadfast to the notion that most of the textbook authors and historians were leftists and that they were denying the legitimacy of South Korea and should be ashamed of it.“All in all, I really don’t know why she even called for this meeting,” Moon added.Also attending were Saenuri Party leader Kim Moo-sung, floor leader Won Yoo-chul and NPAD floor leader Lee Jong-kul.Floor leaders of the two parties separately explained later that the participants, mainly Kim and Moon, had heated arguments over the textbook issue, and that Park offered her view from time to time.They said Park mostly agreed to what Kim had to say and said, “We should not be teaching (our children) defeatism. (The plan) is to get this right.” Park reportedly said the plan was aimed at ensuring the “correct” recognition of Korean history for future generations. She also expressed regret over the opposition leader’s allegations that her efforts had become increasingly politicized.“For national unity, we need a correct and proud history textbook,” Park was quoted as saying by her senior press secretary Kim Sung-woo. The opposition party has been adamantly opposing her drive to issue the state-designated history textbooks that could be used to whitewash pro-Japan activities during the colonial era and the military dictatorships decades ago.The Park administration, meanwhile, has been pushing for the plan, stressing the need to provide a balanced view of history through a single set of history books authored by government-designated writers.Ruling party chairman Kim, for his part, supported Park, asserting that the claims of the planned textbooks’ bias were “nonsense.” He also said that the history textbook issue had to be handled by historians and experts and urged the opposition leadership to focus on the swift passage of bills aimed at reviving the economy.Although there was little hope that the rival camps would reach a political breakthrough, the five-way talks ending with no agreement and is likely to further aggravate the political and ideological standoff as the country heads toward the general elections next year.At the meeting, Park relayed the diplomatic achievements made during her trip to Washington last week and called for bipartisan support on her labor reforms and economic-related bills, saying they were crucial for revitalizing the nation’s sluggish economy. The president also requested the party leaders to ratify Korea’s free trade agreements with China, Vietnam and New Zealand as soon as possible, and focus on creating jobs for the youth.Moon, meanwhile, asked Park to push ahead with an inter-Korean summit and a dialogue between Pyongyang and Washington. He expressed concerns over a failed transfer of U.S. fighter technology, saying that a parliamentary probe should be launched. Lee, at his side, said that an audit was needed along with a reprimand of those responsible.Moon also urged Park to clarify her position on recent remarks by Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn that South Korea could permit the entry of Japan’s self-defense forces to the Korean Peninsula. “The prime minister’s remarks are highly inappropriate and also trample on our people’s pride,” he said. “I want the president to make it clear that it is impossible to have Japanese troops in our country under any circumstances.”In response, Park reportedly said that what Hwang believed was irrelevant to what she was thinking, according to Rep. Lee.Prospects of progress was bleak even before they met in the afternoon as Cheong Wa Dae and NPAD locked horns over the format and the scope of the meeting. The opposition party insisted on having its spokesman attend the meeting to record the entire conversation between the leaders, while the presidential office wanted to keep the gathering confidential, stressing the president wanted to have in-depth, heart-to-heart talks.The NPAD pushed Cheong Wa Dae to accept its request by threatening to call off the meeting, but later yielded, blasting the office for being stingy with its request.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","heated arguments over the textbook ,sluggish economy the president also ,scrap the textbook plan president ,nation sluggish economy the president ,thursday expressing frustration after the","['the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Park', 'NPAD', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Moon Jae - in', 'YonhapMoon', 'South Korea', 'Moon', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'Won Yoo', 'NPAD', 'Lee Jong - kul', 'Kim', 'Moon', 'Park', 'Kim', 'Park', 'korean', 'Kim Sung - woo', 'Kim', 'Park', 'Park', 'Washington', 'Korea', 'China', 'Vietnam', 'New Zealand', 'Moon', 'Park', 'inter - korean', 'Pyongyang', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'Lee', 'Moon', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'Park', 'Hwang', 'Lee', 'Cho Chung - un']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.71009237  0.63297451

(Yonhap)But critics have raised suspicion over the effectiveness of centralized history education. Former Vice Minister of Education Kim Jae-choon ― who was one of the henchmen for Park’s contentious policy ― had claimed in a research paper six years ago that state history textbooks are “a system only used in underdeveloped or dictatorial states.” He was sacked earlier this week, after opponents of the state textbook launched a myriad of attacks over his apparent flip-flop.Reports suggest state-prepared textbooks have been subject to negative perceptions in countries like Turkey. According to a 2011 article by Hurriyet Daily News, an English daily in Turkey, Turkish textbooks have been frequently been subject to criticism over “Sexism, discriminatory attitudes and a lack of objectivity.”Citing local scholars including Kenan Cayir, a sociology professor at Istanbul Bilgi University, the article pointed out that nationalistic attitudes and stereotypical descriptions had been common in the textbooks, although their appearance had been less frequent over the years. Some of the cited examples were “fearless Turk,” “enemy Greek” and “housewife mother.”The daily mentioned an excerpt from a 2007 literature textbook, which said: “Although the Turkish nation established great civilizations and served humanity in many ways, in the last centuries it fell behind the West due to some social and political reasons, which were not its fault.”Similar to criticism that Korean education is often subject to, the daily also said that Turkish education has been under fire for focusing on rote memorization.Citing Athens historian Anna Frangoudaki, Hurriyet Daily News also pointed out that most of the history topics in the Greek textbook ― another of Hwang’s examples of countries using state textbook ― are “ethnocentric.”South Korea’s push to centralize education by emphasizing a “unified version of history that can end social conflicts,” has also been likened to Russia’s move following its leader Vladimir Putin’s instructions to historians to produce a “unified history” that is free from internal contradictions and ambiguities. Reports from various news sources, including Reuters, said the government guidelines contained no criticism of the president, any reference of movements against him in 2011 and 2012 or mention of his political foes.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","sing the national anthem thursday ,education history textbooks from local ,told local university chiefs tuesday ,for secondary education history textbooks ,state authored textbooks the park","['Hwang Woo - yea', 'Turkey', 'Greece', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Saenuri Party', 'Yongsan - gu ,', 'Seoul', 'Kim Jae - choon', 'Turkey', 'Hurriyet Daily News', 'Turkey', 'turkish', 'Kenan Cayir', 'Istanbul Bilgi University', 'Turk', 'turkish', 'korean', 'turkish', 'Anna Frangoudaki', 'Hurriyet Daily News', 'Russia', 'Vladimir Putin ’s', 'Reuters']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27909046  0.60931855

The deal has also yet to be ratified by the Chinese legislature.It remains unclear how Moon reacted to Park's planned request for cooperation due to the dispute over history textbooks.The opposition party has voiced its opposition to the government's plan to reintroduce state history textbooks for secondary school students to address what it calls the predominantly left-leaning contents in current books.Park has called for a ""correct"" recognition of history, noting history education should never divide the people and students over political strife or ideological confrontation.The Ministry of Education said earlier this month history textbooks for middle and high school students will be authored by the government starting in the 2017 school year.Currently, history textbooks are published by eight private publishing companies after being approved by an independent textbook review committee of experts. Schools choose from any of the eight textbooks, while primary schools have a single set of state-authored history textbooks.

""As a result of the operations of this alliance, the so-called Islamic State and al-Nusra Front and other terrorist groups have only expanded their influence and territory.""Russia's intervention, four years after the Syrian civil war broke out, was a legitimate response to a call for help from the Syrian government, which was based on Russian laws, the U.N. charter and relevant international laws, he added.""The purpose of our air strikes in Syria is to prevent the collapse of Syria's state system and to liquidate the source of terrorism there,"" the envoy said. ""Claims by U.S. leaders that the Russian air force is intentionally striking rebel forces backed by the West are a pure fabrication.""Timonin accused Washington of failing to respond to Moscow's request to share any information that could help Russia strike the necessary positions and avoid those that should be avoided. Russia and the U.S. share an understanding on the need to fight international terrorism, he said.He also stressed that Moscow does not support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad personally but believes that Syria's defeat to terrorist groups would not help establish democracy in the Middle East.""That is why Russia's approach is to first destroy the Islamic State and then to let the Syrian people choose their president through their free expression of will.""Assad made a surprise visit to Moscow on Tuesday and held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""If Volkswagen Group did not cheat on its emission tests, consumers would not have paid a large sum of money to buy the cars that failed to pass the tests,"" the plaintiffs said.Among the cars owned by the plaintiffs are the A4, the A5, the A6 2.0 TDI, the Q3 and the Q5 2.0 TDI equipped with EA 189 diesel engines, which are embroiled in the fake test scandal. Some Audi owners have joined Volkswagen users to sue the German automaker following the scandal, but it is the first time that Audi drivers have filed their own suit at home and abroad.  Last month, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said that Volkswagen used software that activates emission controls only when the car is going through official testing to fake test results and pass strict emissions standards. The world's No. 1 carmaker admitted to the accusation and decided to recall about 500,000 vehicles in the United States alone. It also admitted that more than 10 million cars sold globally might be equipped with the ""defeat device.""Since the scandal surfaced, 266 people have filed lawsuits against Volkswagen Group, Audi Volkswagen Korea and local dealers with the Seoul Central District Court.Market experts presume that about 120,000 Volkswagen and Audi vehicles might have been manipulated in South Korea by the same software found by the U.S. environment regulators and be subject to a recall.

The rear admiral, surnamed Kim, rose to fame for leading the Cheonghae Unit during its operation in late 2012 to rescue the sailors of the MT Gemini, a tanker owned by a Singaporean shipping company that had been taken captive by Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden. He reportedly faces accusations of overestimating food expenses to purchase liquor and pocketing some fuel outlays. Kim’s apprehension followed a raid at his office at the Navy headquarters in Gyeryong, South Chungcheong Province. “The military prosecutors are carrying out an investigation after arresting him in the afternoon on charges of embezzling food costs and other public money while serving in the Cheonghae Unit,” the ministry said in a statement. In recent months, the Navy has been reeling from a series of graft scandals involving former and incumbent senior officials, triggering public criticism and calls for sweeping reform amid North Korea’s continued maritime threats.A pangovernmental panel in March indicted a retired rear admiral and a retired commander on charges of manipulating documents regarding the evaluation of a substandard part of a naval salvage ship, named Tongyeong, to help a foreign defense contractor win a procurement deal. Former Chief of Naval Operations Hwang Ki-chul, who served from 2013-15, was also arrested that month on charges of peddling influence to allow the firm to secure a contract to supply a part of the same vessel.

Park and leaderships from the ruling Saenuri Party and the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy will hold a meeting Thursday to discuss pending issues, including the controversial adoption of the state textbooks that the NPAD had criticized as biased. Attending the meeting will be Saenuri Party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung and NPAD chairman Moon Jae-in along with both parties’ whips, Rep. Won Yoo-chul of the Saenuri Party and Rep. Lee Jong-kul of the NPAD. The meeting will also cover the government’s policy to overhaul the labor market and business sectors, and inter-Korean relations. “Chairman Moon and floor leader Lee will meet with President Park and the Saenuri Party leadership to have a broad discussion over the issues that are related to the government management. Particularly, the meeting will be an in-depth discussion over textbooks, the economy, inter-Korea relations and labor reform,” said the NPAD spokesperson Kim Sung-soo. South Korea`s President Park Geun-hye. YonhapThe agreement came after Cheong Wa Dae and the NPAD disagreed over the size and nature of the meeting — reportedly proposed Monday by Hyun Ki-hwan, senior presidential secretary, during his meeting with leaders of the rival parties. The NPAD agreed to the presidential office’s proposal to include both parties’ leaders and their whips to focus on labor reforms and the passage of economic-related bills, an issue that Park had urged lawmakers to take on and sign into law. The NPAD had demanded a more concise setup — of Park, the ruling Saenuri Party Rep. Kim Moo-sung and Rep. NPAD leader Moon Jae-in — to address the president about her attempt to adopt state-authored textbooks. In response to the NPAD’s request, Cheong Wa Dae reiterated its version of the meeting.Meeting with the chairmen of major parties has been customary protocol for the president upon returning from overseas trips. Park returned from her U.S. visit on Sunday.Park has often used the occasions to navigate through political impasses. In 2013, Park held her first meeting with the major party leaders as president when she was embroiled in an election scandal following allegations that the former National Intelligence Service chief ordered his staff to smear Moon, then her liberal opponent, as a North Korean sympathizer during her campaign.Most recently, she invited Kim and Moon to the presidential office this March after Moon took over as NPAD chairman. Then, there were allegation that her close aide illegally interfered with the presidential office’s decision-making process. The ruling Saenuri Party, for its part, criticized the NPAD’s demand for a three-way meeting, saying that the NPAD might divert the people’s attentions away from important economic issues and use the forum for political bickering. “Currently, the controversy over the textbooks is so intense. I am afraid the (trilateral) meeting would be more about partisan standoff, not improving the people’s livelihoods,” said Saenuri Party whip Rep. Won Yoo-chul. Meanwhile, rival parties on Tuesday also agreed to hold a meeting between their leaders after the Saenuri Party’s request earlier in the day that the two sides find ways to resolve the political deadlock that it claimed was preventing the lawmakers from dealing with pressing issues such as the passage of pending bills. The Saenuri Party has been skeptical of the meeting out of concern that the NPAD, consumed with textbook issues, would use the forum for their political attacks. NPAD whip Rep. Lee Jong-kul had requested a similar bilateral meeting the day before. “Regardless of the agenda and format, we are more than willing to accept any proposal to bring the National Assembly back on track and improve the people’s livelihood,” said Rep. Lee Choon-Suak, the NPAD vice floor leader.  By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","hold meeting thursday to discuss ,rival parties on tuesday also ,democracy will hold meeting thursday ,meeting thursday to discuss pending ,the rival parties agreed tuesday","['Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'NPAD', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'NPAD', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Won Yoo', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Lee Jong - kul', 'inter - korean', 'Moon', 'Lee', 'Park', 'Saenuri Party', 'inter - korea', 'NPAD', 'Kim Sung - soo', 'Park Geun', 'NPAD', 'Hyun Ki - hwan', 'NPAD', 'Park', 'Park', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'NPAD', 'Moon Jae - in', 'NPAD ’s', 'U.S.', 'Park', 'National Intelligence Service', 'Moon', 'north korean', 'Kim', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'NPAD', 'Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri Party', 'Won Yoo', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Lee Jong - kul', 'the National Assembly', 'Lee Choon - Suak', 'NPAD', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",17,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.60680091  0.41656438

During the week, the ratings rose the most Thursday to reach 49.7 percent on the day Park paid a visit to the U.S. Pentagon in a move to hail the Seoul-Washington alliance.Realmeter said the rise in the ratings appears to be due to consolidation of conservative voters upon the country’s sharply divided views on the reinstatement of state-authored history textbooks, and the diplomatic event that usually serves in favor of the leader.Support ratings per political party all showed a steady rise as the textbook debate reinforced each side of the ideological spectrum.The ruling Saenuri Party enjoyed an increase of 1.1 percentage points to 42.8 percent, while the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy showed a 0.6 percentage points rise to 26.3 percent.“The ratings for the Saenuri Party notched up as the conservatives gathered upon the state history textbook controversy, not to mention the electoral fraud claim by NPAD lawmaker Rep. Kang Dong-won,” said Realmeter. Rep. Kang’s remarks suggesting rigged election in 2012 prompted backlash from the Saenuri Party as well as his own for stepping out of line.“The NPAD, for its part, saw its ratings rebound due to the history textbook debate and the controversy over Korea’s fighter jet project KF-X,” the polling agency said. Washington turned down, once again during Park’s U.S. visit, Seoul’s request for transfer of some of the key technologies in tandem with its choice of U.S.-based Lockheed Martin to deliver next-generation warplanes. Of the potential contenders for the next presidential election, Saenuri chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung, recorded 19.9 percent, followed by NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in at 18.6 percent. Both saw a slight rise. Seoul Mayor Park Won-soo’s ratings fell 1.3 percentage points to 12.4 percent, maintaining third place, but marking the lowest since the first week of May.From news reports","ratings rose the most thursday ,reach 48 percent last week ,her visit polls showed monday ,rose the most thursday ,thursday to reach 49 percent","['Park Geun - hye', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Pentagon', 'Seoul', 'Saenuri Party', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'the Saenuri Party', 'NPAD', 'Kang Dong - won', 'Kang', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Korea', 'KF - X', 'Washington', 'Park', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Lockheed Martin', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'NPAD', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soo']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35554311  0.61823422

The National Assembly’s relevant committees held meetings to review the 2016 budget plans proposed by the government. According to parliamentary law, the lawmakers must complete the review by Nov. 30 and put the budget plan to a vote no later than Dec. 2. But the prospect for smooth legislation looks grim as rival parties are expected to engage in an escalating tit-for-tat over the budget bills that are likely to determine the political landscape in the run-up to next year’s general elections.The ruling Saenuri Party increased its pressure on rival lawmakers to approve the bill in time to jump-start the economy, while the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy vowed to prevent the legislation unless the Saenuri Party withdrew the plan to issue state history textbooks that the NPAD view as a move to inject biased historic views into students. “Considering the budget plan is the last one that the 19th National Assembly can process, we must pass the budget bill no later than Dec. 2,” said Saenuri Party whip Rep. Won Yoo-chul. “(The NPAD) should cooperate in approving the budget bills that are related to peoples’ livelihood,” he added. Won also highlighted that the government’s move to adopt the government-issued history textbooks should be separated from the Assembly’s mandate to enact economy-related legislation the party had claimed would overhaul the rigid market and boost the nation’s sluggish economy. The bill aims to revise employment rules and regulations in the medical and tourism industry.Since adopting the book itself does not require parliamentary approval, the Saenuri Party reportedly would seek to use other government money for publishing the textbook if the NPAD rejected the plan. The publishing would cost about 10 billion won ($8.9 million).The NPAD held an emergency meeting Monday to discuss their course of action. While the NPAD pledged to thwart the move, they agreed to refrain from boycotting the parliamentary sessions altogether.“Given that (the adoption of) the textbook is not up to the Assembly, we have no parliamentary leverage to prevent (the legislation). We have no choice but to work with the people and win the next election to solve the problem and sign a new law,” said NPAD floor spokesperson Rep. Lee Un-ju. The NAPD also proposed on Monday a meeting between the rival parties’ leadership to discuss the textbook issue. The Saenuri Party rejected the meeting, saying that adopting and publishing the textbook is the job of historians and experts, not lawmakers. Meanwhile, NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in met on Monday with leaders from other opposition blocs ― Rep. Shim Sang-jeung of Justice Party and Rep. Chun Jung-bae, an independent lawmaker who had defected from the NPAD ― to coordinate their protest against the government’s move. The three opposition leaders announced that they would launch a civil campaign to reject state-authored textbooks. Naming the campaign as “civil defiance,” they said they will seek to gather signatures of endorsement from more than 10 million people.

Kim replaces Ju Chul-ki, who had reportedly offered to resign to take responsibility for Washington’s refusal to transfer fighter tech to Seoul last week.Ju Chul-ki (Yonhap)During a meeting held on the sidelines of Park’s trip, U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, once again, rejected a request by South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-koo to transfer key technologies for building next-generation fighter jets. The delivery of the technology was never guaranteed in the contract when U.S.-based Lockheed Martin was chosen to deliver the next-generation warplanes, although the Seoul government had not publicized the fact until recently.Calling it a “humiliating” case, some ruling party officials blamed Park’s foreign affairs team including Ju, saying he failed to set a proper strategy before Han brought up the case in Washington. Pressure mounted on Ju after reports that he even dragged his feet to report the case to the president in June, after he learned from Seoul’s arms buyer, the Defense Acquisition Program Administration, that Washington had already rejected its call two months earlier.The case was left unresolved until an opposition lawmaker brought it up during a parliamentary audit session. It was later found that the president was not informed. As Park’s discipline team initiated an internal probe prior to her trip to Washington, Ju was said to have offered to step down to take responsibility.Speculations have also been growing that Park was considering replacing her entire foreign affairs team including Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and Defense Minister Han.Han came under criticism for revealing his intention to request the tech transfer to Washington before accompanying Park on her U.S. trip. Yun, Park’s first foreign minister, is also facing attacks that he failed to coordinate her foreign policies with related ministries and offices. Despite the growing criticism, Park’s reshuffle excluded Han and Yun.Ju has been leading Park’s foreign affairs team since she took office in early 2013. Starting his career as a diplomat since 1972, he served key posts in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs before he joined Park’s presidential campaign in 2012. Before taking the top senior secretary post, he served as South Korean ambassador to Morocco and France.The former career diplomat is one of the longest-serving senior secretaries who stood by Park for nearly three years. But he has been under constant pressure to resign from opponents questioning his role and capacity in tactfully mediating Park’s bold policies on North Korea and regional security.Known as a man of mild temper, Ju has been considered feeble-minded to question or suggest diplomatic alternatives to the president at times of tension on the Korean Peninsula and tangled relationship with neighboring countries.Kim Kyou-hyun is a career diplomat with expertise on the U.S. Known for his quiet demeanor and being a strategist, he has also been dispatched to the Defense Ministry. He was chosen as the first vice foreign minister upon Park’s inauguration and moved to the NSO in February last year, dealing with North Korean matters.Cho Tae-yong is known for his gentle and balanced delivery and has served in key posts in the Foreign Ministry dealing with the U.S. and North Korea’s nuclear program.He was deputy representative when the historical Sept. 19 Joint Statement was adopted in 2005 and has served as the chief six-party talks negotiator from 2013 to last year when he was promoted to the first vice minister.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","fighter tech to seoul last ,her new senior presidential secretary ,tech to seoul last week ,reprimand her foreign affairs team ,foreign minister upon park inauguration","['Park Geun - hye', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'Park', 'Kim Kyou - hyun', 'the National Security Council', 'Kim', 'Ju Chul - ki', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'Ju Chul - ki', 'Park ’s', 'U.S.', 'Ashton Carter', 'south Korean', 'Han Min - koo', 'Lockheed Martin', 'Seoul', 'Park ’s', 'Ju', 'Han', 'Washington', 'Ju', 'Seoul', 'the Defense Acquisition Program Administration', 'Washington', 'Park ’s', 'Washington', 'Ju', 'Park', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Defense', 'Han', 'Han', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'Park ’s', 'Han', 'Park ’s', 'the Ministry of Foreign Affairs', 'Park ’s', 'south korean', 'Morocco', 'France', 'Park ’s', 'North Korea', 'Ju', 'Kim Kyou - hyun', 'the U.S. know', 'the Defense Ministry', 'NSO', 'north korean', 'Cho Tae - yong', 'the Foreign Ministry', 'U.S.', 'North Korea ’s', 'Joint Statement', 'Cho Chung - un']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38344634  0.62555236

Nakatani is expected to attend a welcome dinner for the six-day fair later in the day and return home Thursday. They are predicted to assess North Korea’s evolving nuclear and missile threats and other regional and bilateral issues, including Tokyo’s envisioned exercise of its right to collective self-defense in the wake of its recent upturn of the pacifist constitution. “During the talks, the ministers will discuss the regional security situation, each country’s defense policy and bilateral exchanges and cooperation and other issues of mutual interest, while holding a briefing and consultations over Japan’s security law that passed its parliament last month,” the ministry said in a statement.Nakatani’s three-day trip came as Seoul unstiffens its line against the Shinzo Abe administration despite its revisionist drive and move to reinforce three-way security cooperation involving the U.S. President Park Geun-hye, who is visiting Washington this week, also signaled her willingness for a one-on-one meeting with the Japanese prime minister when they gather here next month for a trilateral summit with China.Early this month, Tokyo’s Parliamentary Vice Defense Minister Kenji Harada came to Seoul chiefly for the Military World Games in Mungyeong, North Gyeongsang Province, and conferred on his minister’s visit with officials here.

Kang Dong-won of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy for suggesting that the vote count for the presidential race was rigged. Rep. Kang Dong-won of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy speaks during a parliamentary interpellation session at the National Assembly on Tuesday. (Yonhap)“This is a defamation against the president and the people,” Kim said, demanding Kang’s apology and follow-up measures from the NPAD.“While it has only been several hours since President Park has embarked on an overseas trip for national interests, there was an accusation by the opposition lawmaker back home that the presidential election could have been corrupted. This is a very serious issue,” he said.The previous day, Kang had claimed during a parliamentary interpellation session that the previous presidential race “will be recorded as a disorderly election more vicious than the rigged election of former president Syngman Rhee.” He was referring to alleged political interference by the National Intelligence Service during the campaign. Some NPAD members have often compared the 2012 election to the rigged election carried out under the Rhee administration in 1960 to extend his presidency.Their tit-for-tat came on the heels of an intensifying ideological battle back home following the government’s decision to reinstate state-authored history textbooks for secondary education.The National Election Commission also joined the fray by refuting Kang’s argument by detailing how the vote was counted and claimed such allegations seriously harmed the organization’s dignity.The ruling Saenuri Party immediately followed suit and reported Kang to the National Assembly’s ethics committee.NPAD leader Rep. Moon Jae-in refused to comment further, saying, “The party has made its position clear by stating the day before that it was the opinion of an individual.”By Cho Chung-un, Korea Herald correspondent(christory@heraldcorp.com)","opposition lawmaker tuesday for alleging ,presidential election chief presidential press ,an opposition lawmaker tuesday for ,lawmaker tuesday for alleging fraud ,rigged election of former president","['WASHINGTON', 'Washington', 'Kim Sung - woo', 'Park Geun', 'U.S.', 'Kang Dong - won', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Kang Dong - won', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'the National Assembly', 'Kim', 'Kang ’s', 'Park', 'Kang', 'Syngman Rhee', 'the National Intelligence Service', 'NPAD', 'Rhee', 'the National Election Commission', 'Kang', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kang', 'the National Assembly ’s', 'NPAD', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Cho Chung - un', 'Korea Herald correspondent(christory@heraldcorp.com']",0,"[ 1.          0.          1.         ... -0.35243422  0.02386037

I just wanted to make it known that (Trump's claims) are wrong,"" said Joseph Choi, 20, a Harvard University student majoring in economics, told Yonhap News Agency.Choi, whose Korean name is Choi Min-woo, drew media attention when he confronted Trump with a question pointing out that he has made wrong accusations that South Korea relies on the U.S. for its defense without paying anything in return, even though the Asian ally makes a lot of money.Trump has repeatedly made such criticism, even though South Korea has shouldered part of the money needed for the upkeep of 28,500 American troops stationed in South Korea to deter aggression from the communist North.""You said that South Korea takes advantage of the United States in terms of the defense spending on the Korean Peninsula. You said that they don't pay anything ...

Kang Tae-yong, Cho’s No. 2 man in the pyramid scheme, was caught by the Chinese police at his apartment in Jiangsu Province on Saturday, seven years after he fled to China to avoid the police probe.“We expect Kang, who is a key suspect, to give us decisive clues in investigating the fraud case,” an official from the Daegu District Prosecutor’s Office said.  Kang Tae-yong (Yonhap)Kang is known to be the right-hand man of Cho, the mastermind behind the pyramid scheme who allegedly died of a heart attack in China. Kang took charge of finances and lobbying prosecutors, police officers and political tycoons, asking them for leniency in the probe. He is also suspected of embezzling tens of billions of won in company assets. Kang fled to China, along with Cho, in 2008 as the police began investigating the company’s fraud scheme. The International Criminal Police Organization issued red notices for both of them, marking them among the internationally most-wanted. Cho Hee-pal (Yonhap)Cho allegedly conned up to 50,000 people out of an estimated 4 trillion won ($3.5 billion) by running 10 leasing companies to lure potential investors with false promises of high returns on their capital. Korean victims claim the total damages amount to 8 trillion won. The fraud case, which has dragged on after the key suspects escaped to China and Cho was reported as dead, will likely gather momentum as Kang is expected to be extradited to Korea as early as this weekend. With Kang’s return, prosecutors plan to look into whether Cho died as reported, possible bribery involved in the scam, and alleged embezzlement. Victims believe that Cho is still alive, living a life of luxury under a fake identity in China. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","korea largest ever fraud case ,arrested in china three days ,caught by the chinese police ,weekend with kang return prosecutors ,trillion won the fraud case","['South Korea ’s', 'Cho Hee - pal', 'China', 'Kang Tae - yong', 'chinese', 'Jiangsu Province', 'China', 'Kang', 'Daegu District Prosecutor ’s Office', 'Kang Tae - yong', 'yonhap)kang', 'Cho', 'China', 'Kang', 'China', 'Cho', 'the International Criminal Police Organization', 'Cho Hee - pal', 'korean', 'China', 'Cho', 'Kang', 'Korea', 'Kang ’s', 'Cho', 'victim', 'Cho', 'China']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.239209    0.34461275

Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea (left) speaks during a parliamentary audit of his ministry on Thursday. (Yonhap)But the ruling Saenuri Party countered that the state textbook was essential to ensure unity of the people.NPAD Rep. Bae Jae-jung accused President Park of conducting a “historical coup” just as her father rose to power through a military coup.The comment sparked an exchange of incendiary remarks among lawmakers during the audit. Rep. Rhee Chong-hoon demanded that the parliament’s education committee chair Park Joo-sun ban comments unrelated to the audit. Saenuri Rep. Han Sun-kyo argued that the NPAD’s attacks were politically motivated.“Some say state textbooks destroy variety and force a monolithic point of view on history. But a closer look at our education shows that variety and creativity face bigger threats under the current system,” he said during a party meeting before the audit.Saenuri Party leader Kim had said that the textbooks were self-depreciative about Korean history and that the private publication system could not work because “90 percent of historians are leftists.”Both the Education Ministry and Saenuri Party have criticized current history textbooks for excessive errors and ideological bias, even saying some parts “looked like a North Korean textbook.” Minister Hwang Woo-yea remained mum on his stance over the state history textbooks and reiterated that the ministry would announce its plans “soon after” the parliamentary audit wraps up. Prior to the audit, the ministry submitted two possible options for history textbook publication. Option one is having the state-run National Institute of Korean History author the textbooks under commission run by the ministry. The second option is to retain the current private-authoring of textbooks but reinforcing the authorization process.If the ministry decides on the former, the changes will be applied in 2017. If the government goes with option No. 2, it will be applied in 2018.The ministry is expected to unveil its decision next week. By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","history textbooks for excessive errors ,thursday over the government impending ,contentious state published history textbooks ,criticized current history textbooks ,current history textbooks for excessive","['the Education Ministry', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Park Geun - hye ’s', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'Saenuri Party', 'Bae Jae - jung', 'Park', 'Rhee Chong - hoon', 'Park Joo - sun', 'Saenuri', 'Han Sun - kyo', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim', 'korean', 'the Education Ministry', 'Saenuri Party', 'north korean', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'National Institute of korean History', 'Yoon Min - sik']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.255229    0.24935776

Lee, 36, who recently returned to Korea, will accept the prosecution’s request to testify as a witness in the trial set to begin Thursday, his father said in an interview with a local news outlet. The father said Lee is willing to take the stand to get “the wrong path” set straight. Patterson, 35, was extradited to Korea on Sept. 23 to face a new trial on charges of stabbing Cho Joong-pil to death in 1997 at a Burger King restaurant in Itaewon, a multicultural district frequented by expats residing in Seoul.  (Yonhap)Lee and Patterson, both teenagers at the time, accused each other of murdering Cho, who was found on the restroom floor with several wounds to his neck. Cho died on the way to a hospital. Patterson was in Seoul as his father was a civilian worker for the U.S. military, which has maintained a large presence in South Korea to deter North Korean aggression since the 1950-53 Korean War. In what many see as a botched probe, the prosecution initially indicted Lee on a murder charge, with an appeals court sentencing him to 20 years in jail. But Lee was later acquitted of the murder for lack of evidence in the retrial ordered by the highest court. Patterson, on the other hand, was indicted on lesser charges including elimination of evidence and possession of a dangerous weapon. He was handed down 18 months in jail, but freed in a special amnesty move before finishing his term in 1998. A year later, prosecutors launched a new probe into the murder case, viewing Patterson as the prime suspect. But Patterson fled to the U.S. as the government failed to renew his travel ban. The long-forgotten case was brought back to the spotlight with the release of a 2009 film on the murder. Amid mounting public calls to extradite Patterson, prosecutors indicted him on a murder charge in 2011 after the 35-year-old man was caught in the U.S. Patterson had attempted to delay extradition by submitting multiple habeas corpus petitions to U.S. courts until his petition was finally rejected and he was extradited to Korea. Now, eyes are on the Patterson case amid the public furor as South Koreans remain largely sour toward crimes committed by foreigners, especially those involving the U.S. military. In accordance with the Status of Forces Agreement signed between South Korea and the U.S. in 1966, American soldiers and those working for them here are not subjected to Korean jurisdiction.The case also rekindled a debate over what many see as the incompetence of the police and prosecutors who accused the wrong person for the murder in the first place. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","trial of new murder suspect ,murdering south korean college student ,fresh trial of new murder ,new murder suspect arthur john ,cleared of murdering south korean","['Seoul', 'korean - American', 'Edward Lee', 'south korean', 'Arthur John Patterson', 'Lee', 'Korea', 'Lee', 'Patterson', 'Korea', 'Cho Joong - pil', 'Burger King', 'Itaewon', 'Seoul', 'Patterson', 'Cho', 'Cho', 'Patterson', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'north korean', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Patterson', 'Patterson', 'Patterson', 'U.S.', 'Patterson', 'U.S.', 'Patterson', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'Patterson', 'South Koreans', 'U.S.', 'the Status of Forces Agreement', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'american', 'korean']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.08912244  0.45937946

The ministry has mulled whether or not to bestow itself with exclusive rights to publish history textbooks, which has caused rifts in the National Assembly and in education circles. Korea currently allows local publishers to author the textbooks for secondary education, which are certified by the government for public use.A ministry official said the announcement will be made after the parliamentary audit on government organizations wraps up this week, but claimed the ministry is still undecided on the matter.But sources say the government and ruling Saenuri Party are set on bringing back state textbooks ― first implemented in 1974 and then revoked in 2002.Cheong Wa Dae supported such speculation by saying earlier Wednesday: “There is no change in position that the history textbook with a balanced view should be developed,” reminding the press of President Park Geun-hye’s past comments. Park said last year that textbooks in use contained factual errors and ideological bias, and that they should be fixed.The opposition claims that reinstating the system will result in the textbooks being influenced by whoever is in power. Professors from universities across the country ― most recently Hanyang University and Kyung Hee University ― have released statements opposing the state history textbooks.Those who oppose the state textbooks raise concerns that the government may whitewash flaws of controversial figures including Park’s father, former President Park Chung-hee, who is criticized for his dictatorial rule that spanned over two decades.But the proponents of the state history textbooks claim that many of the authors for privately published textbooks are biased in favor of the leftists. Although the ministry has not commented while rival parties exchanged blows, it said in a briefing last week that the textbooks should not be used to express one’s ideological views.“Many citizens are expressing concerns that textbooks, which should unify the people and foster a balanced view of history, are being used as tools for ideological disputes,” a ministry official said, adding that the appeal was “incomprehensible.” The message came as the ministry criticized the authors of high school textbooks for appealing a court order to revise sections of books that were deemed biased and incorrect. The ministry even said that some parts looked like a “North Korean textbook” ― attacking the rival party ― reiterating its claims that the current textbooks are filled with lopsided views and errors. The unusually strong words were widely perceived as a signal of the government’s determination to change the publication system.The ministry’s fierce criticism of the privately published history textbooks was echoed by the Saenuri Party in the National Assembly on Thursday, which labeled them as “antistate” and “leftist.”“It appears that (the textbooks) are biased with leftist viewpoints. ... Even if North Korea is a dictatorial, failed state, the textbooks depict it like it is a normally operated country,” said Saenuri leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung at his party’s Supreme Council meeting.But Rep. Moon Jae-in, leader of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, said that reviving state history textbooks would “turn back the clock to the era of dictatorship.”“Both the government and Saenuri Party should drop their attempts to tame and control the historical views of the people.

Kim Jong-il died of a heart attack in 2011 and was succeeded by his youngest son, Kim Jong-un.Under South Korean law, any employee from the NIS wishing to publish or announce content about the agency's duties should first obtain permission from the head of the agency.The 69-year-old former spy chief co-authored a controversial memoir with Lee Jae-joung and Baek Jong-chun, who served as South Korea's point man on North Korea and presidential security adviser for Roh.The NIS sought an injunction Monday to halt the sales of the book with the Seoul Central District Court.The former spy chief was not immediately available for comment.Kim was also sued in 2011 on suspicions of contributing undisclosed information on the inter-Korean summit to a Japanese monthly magazine, but the indictment was suspended.

We need a stronger, more focused policy on North Korea, and if the Administration is unwilling to provide it, Congress must act,"" Gardner said in a press release.The new sanctions called for under the legislation would apply the ""pressure required to change North Korea's behavior, and would mandate that the United States finally have a unified strategy for dealing with North Korean cyber attacks,"" the senator said.""We can't go any longer without a serious plan to deal with this threat. It's time to get serious,"" he said.In addition to sanctions, the bill also states that it is the policy of the United States to vigorously pursue sanctions against the North Korean government in order to peacefully disarm the North Korean regime, according to the release.The legislation also requires the president to submit a strategy to counter North Korean cyber-related attacks and impose U.S. sanctions on cyber criminals, while codifying two executive orders released earlier this year authorizing sanctions against entities undermining U.S. national and economic security in cyberspace, it said.The bill also calls for the State Department to identify human rights abusers in North Korea and submit a report on the North Korean regimes' political prison camps.""While the world is distracted by other bad actors, the North Korean regime continues to flagrantly conduct illegal arms sales, proliferate sensitive technology, expand its nuclear weapons program, conduct cyber attacks and repress the North Korean people,"" Rubio said.

Lee Sang-deuk, a former six-term lawmaker, appeared at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office at around 10:20 a.m., two years after he completed a 14-month jail term on charges of receiving kickbacks from local savings banks.  (Yonhap)This time, the former ruling Saenuri party member is accused of pressuring a senior official at POSCO to offer business deals to one of its subcontractors, TM Tech, of which one of his close aides is a major shareholder.TM Tech, established in late 2008, reported 17 billion won ($1,450) in yearly sales on average, mostly through these deals with POSCO. A large portion of the dividends Park received from TM Tech, worth 2 billion won, is thought to have been used to fund Lee’s political campaign.In return, the 79-year-old former lawmaker allegedly exerted influence to help POSCO resume its construction of a new steel factory in 2011, which had been suspended in 2009 due to planning restrictions. The prosecution also suspects Lee of peddling influence in appointing Chung Joon-yang as former chairman of POSCO in 2009. Lee, however, has flatly denied all the accusations.“I don’t know why I am even here. I cannot answer your questions,” Lee told the press before entering the prosecutors’ office on Monday morning.The prosecution considers seeking an arrest warrant to detain him on charges of taking bribes if the allegations were confirmed. The summons is the latest in a string of probes into POSCO and its subcontractors and subsidiaries over suspicious deals and creation of slush funds between 2009 and 2014. Investigators have focused on investigating whether the steelmaker was granted favors during the previous Lee administration as part of his drive for “energy diplomacy.” By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","elder brother of former president ,prosecutors office on monday morning ,year old former lawmaker allegedly ,deuk former six term lawmaker ,brother of former president lee","['Lee Myung - bak', 'POSCO', 'Lee Sang - deuk', 'Saenuri', 'posco', 'TM Tech', 'TM Tech', 'POSCO', 'Park', 'TM Tech', 'Lee', 'POSCO', 'Lee', 'Chung Joon - yang', 'POSCO', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'POSCO', 'Lee']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39280248  0.45821357

They are threatening the state universities by saying they will not provide financial subsidies,” student bodies of 15 universities said in their statement.There has been dispute among the education circles over how a college head should be elected. The now-nearly extinct direct voting system lets professors select the president, while the ministry-encouraged indirect system runs through an election committee ― a randomly-selected committee of students, teaching assistants, faculty and other employees of the university. Graffiti that says, “Abolish the direct election system (of university president)” is scribbled on a placard supporting the direct voting system at the Pusan National University campus Thursday. (Yonhap)Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea said in last month’s parliamentary audit that he would review the pros and cons of both systems, although he stopped short of giving a definitive answer.The focal point of the controversy is whether or not the ministry’s pressure to abolish the direct system intrudes upon universities’ autonomy, and which of the two systems is more effective.It was former President Lee Myung-bak who set the wheels in motion in 2010 with his plan to “advance the operations of state universities,” which included abolishing the direct election system. The Lee administration pointed out that direct election sparked numerous side effects, such as overheated campaigning that leads to excessive pledges and factions on the campus. The Park administration subsequently announced that national universities that do not adopt the indirect system would be penalized in the “University for Creative Korea” government funding, or the CK program.Too much government intervention?South Korea grants partial autonomy for higher education institutes. While the general operations of respective universities ― including personnel decisions ― are left to respective institutes, the government sets the overall agenda for the admission process while stepping in for cases like banning sex offenders from teaching at universities.While the school boards of private universities choose the method to use for the election of the president, state-run universities are more vulnerable to the ministry’s influence as the appointment has to be confirmed by President Park Geun-hye. Even private universities are not free from governmental influence, as refusing to follow government decisions can deprive them of state subsidies, which account for a significant portion of the schools’ budgets.Proponents of the direct election system says “coercing” national universities to follow the ministry’s measure by threatening to cut support violates their autonomy.Rep. Bae Jae-jeung of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy accused the ministry of “taming the universities” with threats of subsidy cuts. She also bashed the ministry for saying that it could pull some of the Creative Korea funds paid to Pusan National University, which recently decided to switch back to the direct election system after one of its professors committed suicide in protest of the opposing system.The incident, which occurred in August amid a mass protest by PNU faculty members, uprooted the university’s original decision to abolish direct voting.A survey by Rep. Cho Jeong-sik of the NPAD showed that many of state-run universities’ chiefs opposed linking the voting system to government subsidies.“Penalizing the universities in government programs unless they follow the ministry’s guidelines is inadvisable. If there are problems during the university-selected election process, then the government should penalize them,” said PNU chief Kim.Choi Sung-eul, head of Incheon National University, also said it is ideal to let universities choose the voting system based on their respective circumstances. Pros and cons of the two systemProponents of the indirect election system point out that direct voting has many flaws. “Excessive campaigning led to the candidates making all kinds of pledges, which had side effects such as tuition hikes, factionalism and hindering the colleges’ long-term plans. The nepotism that resulted has also led to inefficient personnel decisions,” said an official from the Education Ministry.In addition, there has been criticism that the “direct” election only applies to professors and not regular employees or students. Despite its flaws, however, opponents of the indirect system say that it is not an appropriate alternative. Jeong, Yong-gil, a professor of Chungnam National University, took issue with the random selection process of the committee. In his recent column, he pointed out that the lottery-type selection process is completely based on chance, meaning a newly appointed faculty member who knows very little about the school can be a member.“In order for an election to work, the voter has to have sufficient information about the candidates. The indirect system eliminates the possibility of an informed choice because it is based on luck,” he said. Jeong claimed that the ministry’s insistence on the indirect system is just an excuse to tighten the grasp around the universities, pointing out that the ministry has refused to approve the elected presidents for Kyungpook National University, Kongju National University and Korea National Open University, who were selected via an indirect voting system.These universities are currently locked in legal battles with the ministry, which have shown mixed results. Seoul High Court ruled in favor of the ministry for the KNOU case, while the appellate court for the KNU case ruled against it. Seoul Administrative Court in August ruled in favor of the university, leaving the burden on the Supreme Court.Jeong’s CNU is expected to hold a vote on its presidential election system later this week. Regardless of whether or not the Education Ministry is guilty of attempting to become a “Big Brother,” the university president’s selection process is likely to continue to rattle education circles.Rep. Shin Sung-bum of the ruling Saenuri Pary said while there have been many side effects of the direct election system, he is unsure which is better. Cheonnam National University president Jee Byung-moon said although the ministry is pushing to abolish the direct voting system, he is “skeptical” that indirect elections are an ideal appropriate alternative. “We need to work on creating a system that can assure both the universities’ autonomy and a fair selection process,” he said.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","government subsidies penalizing the universities ,professors committed suicide in protest ,mass protest by pnu faculty ,penalizing the universities in government ,banning sex offenders from teaching","['South Korea', 'the Education Ministry ’s', 'Graffiti', 'the Pusan National University', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Lee', 'Park', 'the "" University for Creative Korea', 'CK', 'Korea', 'Park Geun', 'Bae Jae - jeung', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Creative Korea', 'Pusan National University', 'Cho Jeong - sik', 'PNU', 'Kim', 'Choi Sung - eul', 'Incheon National University', 'pro', 'the Education Ministry', 'Jeong', 'Chungnam National University', 'Jeong', 'Kyungpook National University', 'Kongju National University', 'Korea National Open University', 'Seoul High Court', 'KNOU', 'KNU', 'Seoul Administrative Court', 'the Supreme Court', 'Jeong ’s', 'CNU', 'the Education Ministry', 'Shin Sung - bum', 'Saenuri Pary', 'Cheonnam National University', 'Jee Byung - moon']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.21558978  0.04714363

Of them, 58 were found have to been infected with a malicious code, resulting in the leak of 12 work documents.The NIS concluded that the hacking was conducted by the Advanced Persistent Threat, the same attack method used in the hacking of major broadcasters and banks in Seoul in March 2013. Pyongyang was suspected to have been the culprit then. The NIS, however, said it could not find the first point of hacking and the source of the code, citing insufficient log files, officials said.Seoul Metro said the leaked documents were not security-sensitive but related to human resources and internal management of the state-owned company. Seoul Metro is in charge of running Subway Line Nos. 1-4.Seoul Metro also stressed that the hacking did not affect subway safety as the central control system is run separately in an enclosed type of network server. As part of the efforts to improve the server safety, Seoul Metro formatted all PCs last year and strengthened the security measures.Seoul Metro has seen a rise in cyberattacks in recent years.

Kim also said that the hotline was first installed during the former Kim Dae-jung government.The NIS believes that Kim apparently broke the law banning former and current NIS employees from revealing state secrets that they got informed of while performing their official duties. The law also bans an NIS employee from publishing a book concerning his or her NIS duties without the permission from the incumbent NIS chief. Kim recently published his memoirs regarding the 2007 inter-Korean summit, but he reportedly did not get NIS permission.In 2011, Kim faced an indictment for revealing state secrets in his contribution to a Japanese monthly. The indictment was suspended later. As the controversy escalated, Kim reversed himself, saying that Roh and the former North Korean leader did not have any telephone talks.“I just meant that there was a hotline through which the leaders of the two Koreas were able to exchange their views promptly. But they did not ever hold any direct talks over the phone,” he said during a symposium hosted last Friday by the Roh Moo-hyun Foundation.Park Jie-won, a lawmaker of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, called on Kim to show “restraint,” saying that he would step in should Kim continue to make “unnecessary” remarks. Park served as the chief of staff for former President Kim Dae-jung.“He (Kim) should have behaved as (former) NIS chief if he had really led the organization,” Kim said in his Twitter posting. “He should repeatedly exert restraint.” The former NIS chief’s revelation about the inter-Korean hotline during the liberal Kim and Roh administrations highlighted the current lack of top-level communication.With the former Lee Myung-bak government adopting a strictly reciprocal policy toward the North, bilateral relations chilled. The cross-border tensions further deteriorated as Pyongyang launched a set of deadly attacks including the sinking of the corvette Cheonan in 2010.Since the Park administration was launched in early 2013, high-level exchanges have rarely occurred. The two sides are now seeking to arrange and institutionalize cross-border talks, but uncertainties for the talks have increased as Pyongyang is expected to launch provocations such as a long-range rocket launch this month.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","administration disclosed in media interview ,kim recently published his memoirs ,phone he said during symposium ,director said in the interview ,his memoirs regarding the 2007","['NIS', 'Kim Man - bok', 'Kim Man - bok', 'the National Intelligence Service', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Roh', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - il', 'NIS', 'Kim', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'NIS', 'Kim', 'NIS', 'NIS', 'NIS', 'NIS', 'Kim', 'inter - korean', 'NIS', 'Kim', 'japanese', 'Kim', 'Roh', 'north korean', 'Koreas', 'Roh Moo - hyun Foundation', 'Park Jie - won', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'Kim', 'NIS', 'Kim', 'NIS', 'inter - korean', 'Kim', 'Roh', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Pyongyang', 'Park', 'Pyongyang', 'Song Sang - ho']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23065601  0.47821611

Yonhap Lee had been accused of accepting illegal campaign funds worth 30 million won ($28,000) from the late businessman Sung Woan-jong for the 2013 by-elections, on April 4 that year, at his campaign office in Buyeo, South Chungcheong Province. He was indicted without detention in July, about three months after his resignation. Sung, a construction mogul and former lawmaker, was found dead on April 9 in an apparent suicide at a mountain in northern Seoul.

Kim Moo-sung hit back at Cheong Wa Dae’s criticism of the party nomination scheme he agreed with the opposition. The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy also hit out at the presidential office, accusing it of attempting to meddle in electoral affairs as part of its internal power struggle.Kim, who skipped party meetings and canceled public schedules earlier in the day, made an unexpected visit to the National Assembly to rebut the accusation that he had not fully communicated with Cheong Wa Dae and his party members when he pushed for a new party nomination procedure for elections.Kim also told reporters that he had notified the presidential office of his plan to hammer out an agreement with NPAD leader Rep. Moon Jae-in. The two had agreed Monday on a survey-like nomination system via secure phone lines after an impromptu meeting in Busan at Kim’s suggestion.                                                   The ruling Saenuri Party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sug. YonhapThe nomination deal exposed and exacerbated the heavy power struggle between those loyal to President Park and the others in the Saenuri Party, with Cheong Wa Dae jumping into the fray Wednesday with remarks seemingly intended to undermine Kim’s leadership.The presidential office criticized the new nomination system, saying it could damage the fairness of nominations. Kim, however, waved off the concerns and shot back that a Cheong Wa Dae official should not insult a ruling party leader.“I didn’t get to hear whether they (Cheong Wa Dae) agreed or not, I just told them about how I would steer the discussion. (After the meeting) I took a photo of agreement and sent it (to the presidential office),” said Kim. “The reason why I reveal this is because I feel so frustrated. It seems that I have been depicted as someone who orchestrated the whole thing. If they continue to create something out of thin air, the party would be divided and find itself cornered in elections,” said Kim. Choeng Wa Dae clarified Thursday that Kim had notified Hyun Ki-hwan, senior presidential secretary for political affairs, on Sept. 26 of his meeting with Moon. It said that Hyun relayed his concern over Kim’s push for the new nomination procedure. The office also denied that their opposition to the procedure amounted to political interference.The presidential office said that Hyun did not report the matter immediately to President Park as she was on her U.N. trip at the time.The NPAD, meanwhile, denounced the tit-for-tat between Kim and Cheong Wa Dae and dismissed it as an attempt by Park allies to infringe upon political parties’ authority to nominate their own candidates. The NPAD also rejected the call from the Saenuri Party to hold a special meeting for an election system between the two parties’ leaderships. The NPAD labeled it as a move to nullify the effect of the agreement between the leaders of the two parties.  “It seems the demise of Rep. Yoo Seong-min all over again,” said Rep. Lee Jong-gul, referring to the former whip who stepped down under the pressure, having been accused of giving in to an NPAD demand despite Park’s strong objections. “The National Assembly is not an elementary school. Lawmakers are not supposed to sit and write what the president said. It seems to me that President Park wants to interfere with nominating candidates and election processes as a whole. I urge Cheong Wa Dae to mind its own business,” said NPAD whip Rep. Lee Jong-gul.Meanwhile, the latest poll showed that the ruling Saenuri Party had taken a hit from escalating in-house scuffles over the controversial nomination system. According to the survey on Thursday conducted by Realmeter, the Saenuri Party’s approval rating recorded at 37.4 percent, 3.9 percent point drop from last week.

The case will be handled at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. The National Tax Service said William Park is well-qualified and has extensive experience in handling investor state disputes at the ICSID.Besides selecting the 68-year-old scholar, the government has picked local law firm Kim & Chang, as well as New York-based Debevoise & Plimpton LLP, to represent its position.

""The government is committed to actively countering arguments made by Hanocal,"" it stressed. Hanocal maintains that slapping taxes on the sale of shares violates the ban on the double taxation convention agreement between South Korea and the Netherlands. The government views Hanocal as a mere ""front company"" with no real authority, it said.""Because IPIC is the real beneficiary of the sale, it is the government's belief that all actions regarding taxes must follow bilateral rules in place between South Korea and the UAE,"" said a source, who declined to be identified.

Officials said 388 other cases are being investigated at the moment.“There has been a steady increase in child abuse cases and legal actions taken against offenders on the heels of growing social awareness and intolerance for such actions,” an agency official said.In 2001, there were 2,105 cases of child abuse confirmed by authorities, but this rose to 5,581 cases in 2007 before reaching 6,791 in 2013 and spiking to 10,027 last year.At the present pace, there is a chance that the total number of child abuse cases in 2015 will surpass last year’s total.According to the report, 47.6 percent of child abuse cases involved the father of the child, followed by 29.8 percent for the mother, with stepparents or both biological parents accounting for the rest. Slightly over 6 percent of the abusers were teachers and day care workers, including those hired by kindergartens. Of the kind of abuse endured by children, physical abuse ranked No. 1, followed by mental abuse, neglect and sexual abuse.Of the all cases involving child abuse, legal action was taken against 27 percent of the offenders, up 12 percentage points compared to all of last year, it said.From news reports","child abuse the seoul government ,child abuse claimed 12 lives ,including those hired by kindergartens ,child abuse cases in 2015 ,10 cases of child abuse","['Seoul', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare', 'Cabinet', 'the National Child Protection Agency']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48976821  0.08542446

First off, whether or not it can accurately reflect the public’s opinion,” a high-ranking official from Cheong Wa Dae told reporters.Kim Moo-sung and Moon Jae-in ― leaders of ruling Saenuri Party and main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy ― had agreed Monday to introduce the “secure number” public nomination system, a variation of open primary that is designed to avert vote-rigging. An open primary allows voters not affiliated with a political party to participate but its critics say it has many side effects such as voters backing weak candidates for parties they are against.  Saenuri leader Kim Moo-sung (right) speaks with Rep. Won Yoo-chul during the ruling party`s general assembly held at the National Assembly on Wednesday. (Yonhap)The new system will have telecom operators create disposable phone numbers for voters, which are distributed for the parties. The parties would contact the voters on the phone, ask which party they back to eliminate supporters of opposing parties, and collect their vote.Speaking on the condition of anonymity, the Cheong Wa Dae official said the presidential office felt the need to voice concerns over the system that has been sugar-coated as an advisable alternative.“We already know from experience that the results of opinion polls via phone are fundamentally different from the actual results,” he said, pointing out that the average response rate for the phone polls is south of 2 percent. The official added that using “the secure numbers” would not be sufficient to protect the identity of the voter in smaller constituencies.The point-by-point criticism came after Kim told reporters that the introduction of this new system does not require the approval of the presidential office since it is a mere technicality. While presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook declined to formally comment on the matter, other Cheong Wa Dae officials have criticized Kim for touching off the politically sensitive issue during President Park Geun-hye’s visit to New York for the U.N. General Assembly.The move came amid speculation that Cheong Wa Dae is keeping a check on Kim, who has been enjoying high approval rating as the potential next presidential candidate until a recent scandal involving his son-in-law’s conviction for drug abuse.Kim made an equally strong rebuttal against the Blue House, saying a presidential official “should not insult a party leader” and told the pro-Park faction not to attack him, saying he “has limits.”Kim reacted to Cheong Wa Dae’s criticism during his party’s general assembly later in the day, saying that all but one of its claims ― the part about average response rate for the phone polls being low ― were incorrect. He reportedly said the standoff was caused by a “misunderstanding” over technical aspects of the new system. The general assembly adjourned without reaching a decision on the issue.Kim, considered a “non-Park” member, had often butted heads with the pro-Park faction, but has also worked in cooperation with Park, particularly during her presidential campaign as the director of her campaign headquarters in 2012. Park and Kim have generally maintained rigid yet polite relations, especially after the summer carnage that ultimately reinstated the president’s presence in the ruling party. Park had lashed out against the party leadership for dillydallying on her reform initiatives, leading to the resignation of then-floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min.Implementing open primaries has been one of Kim’s major political platforms, but the pro-Park faction has been claiming Kim’s true aim is to widen his political clout. They upped the attack after the bipartisan agreement by accusing the Saenuri leader of “giving in” to NPAD demands. Park loyalists and Kim reportedly collided head on during a closed-door meeting of Saenuri lawmakers Wednesday morning.“Put aside the factional dispute. How can an agreement with an opposition leader without any discussion or consultation with party members be considered democratic?” Rep. Lee Jung-hyun said, adding that each party should decide on which system to adopt for its nomination process.Kim has denied accusations that he caved in to the NPAD’s demands and claimed that the new plan is a “completely different one” from what the opposition had proposed. He did vow to hold additional talks within the party, saying that the agreement with Moon was not a final decision.The Kim-Moon agreement was a contentious issue among the opposition lawmakers as well, with the nonmainstream NPAD members questioning its effectiveness.Senior lawmaker Park Jie-won tweeted that he agreed with involving the public in the primary but was against using the “secure numbers.” Rep. Song Ho-chang said using an opinion poll to nominate candidates for the election “defies the basic principles of democracy.”By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","presidential candidate until recent scandal ,lawmakers wednesday morning put aside ,vote rigging an open primary ,during her presidential campaign ,parliamentary race would distort public","['Cheong', 'Dae', 'Cheong', 'Dae', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'Moon Jae -', 'Saenuri Party', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Won Yoo', 'the National Assembly', 'Kim', 'Min Kyung - wook', 'Kim', 'Park Geun - hye', 'New York', 'the U.N.

Now comes the tough part: Drumming up support and money to achieve the goals and transform the world.Pope Francis gave his backing to the new development agenda in an address to the U.N. General Assembly before the summit to adopt the 17-point plan opened, calling it ""an important sign of hope"" at a very troubled time in the Middle East and Africa. When General Assembly President Mogens Lykketoft struck his gavel to approve the development road map, leaders and diplomats from the 193 U.N. member states stood and applauded loudly.Then, the summit immediately turned to the real business of the three-day meeting -- implementation of the goals, which is expected to cost $3.5 trillion to $5 trillion every year until 2030.U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon set the stage, saying the agenda ""embodies the aspirations of people everywhere for lives of peace, security and dignity on a healthy planet."" The goals ""are a to-do list for people and planet, and a blueprint for success,"" Ban said.  The document, titled ""Transforming our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,"" not only outlines 17 broad goals but sets 169 specific targets. The non-binding goals succeed the eight Millennium Development Goals adopted by world leaders 15 years ago. Only one of those has been achieved: halving the number of people living in extreme poverty, due primarily to economic growth in China. At least one other is close -- cutting in half the proportion of people without access to clean water -- and there are still three months until the goals expire.The new goals include ensuring ""healthy lives"" and quality education for all, clean water, sanitation and reliable modern energy, as well as making cities safe, reducing inequality within and among countries, and promoting economic growth and good governance. Critics say they are too broad, lack accountability and will lead to disenchantment among those most in need of hope.Supporters say there is no choice but to go big in a world of expanding population, growing inequality, dwindling resources and the existential threat from global warming. They note that while the millennium goals were developed by then secretary-general Kofi Annan and his staff, the new goals are the result of years of negotiations by all 193 member states, which means they should all have a stake in their achievement.Sweden announced that a group of nine leaders from different regions will work to ensure implementation of the goals. It includes German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the presidents of Brazil, Colombia, Liberia, South Africa, Tanzania and Tunisia and the prime ministers of Sweden and East Timor.  Speaker after speaker pointed to the spread of extremist groups as barriers to development, perhaps none more eloquently than Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousefzai, who was shot in the head by the Taliban in Pakistan in 2012 for campaigning for girls' education.Standing in the assembly chamber's balcony surrounded by 193 young people representing every country, Malala told the leaders: ""The future generation is raising their voice."" Each teen held a lantern, which she said symbolized their hope that the new global goals will be achieved.Millions of children are suffering from ""terrorism, displacement and denial of education,"" Malala said, noting the heartbreaking photo of 3-year-old Syrian refugee Aylan Kurdi lying drowned on a Turkish sea shore and the tearful parents of girls abducted from their school in northern Nigeria by Boko Haram.""Promise peace to all children in Pakistan, in India, in Syria and in every corner of the world,"" Malala implored the leaders.""Promise that every child will have the right to safe, free and quality primary and secondary education,"" she said. ""Education is hope. Education is peace.""Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi said the international community has to deal with global challenges that hinder development --""especially terrorism"" which isn't confined to Arab nations but has spread worldwide.In pursuing development, he said, the Egyptian people are facing ""the most dangerous extremist terrorist ideology.""  Egypt has been fighting an insurgency by Sinai militants allied to the Islamic State group. At the same time, security forces have cracked down on Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamists since the military _ then led by el-Sissi _ ousted President Mohammed Morsi, a senior Brotherhood figure, in 2013 after massive protests against Morsi's rule. Hundreds of Islamists have been killed and thousands arrested.El-Sissi also expressed concern that ""the tools"" to achieve the goals are insufficient, and stressed that richer nations have a responsibility to help poorer ones.Afghan leader Abdullah Abdullah, whose country is one of the world's poorest, urged ""political commitment and revitalized partnership"" to achieve the goals.The head of Amnesty International used his speech to make an impassioned critique of mass surveillance, the arms trade, income inequality and human rights abuses.""You cannot launch these goals and in parallel deny a safe and legal route to refugees, a life with dignity,"" Amnesty's Salil Shetty added.Merkel told fellow leaders there is no quick solution to the migrant crisis that has seen hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war, poverty and persecution flood into Europe and safe havens closer to home.India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi said eliminating poverty is the top priority in his country, which has the world's largest number of people living in extreme poverty.Modi confirmed plans for a fivefold boost in renewable energy but added two years to the time frame, saying it will take seven years instead of five.As for finding the trillions needed to implement the goals, Kenya's U.N. Ambassador Macharia Kamau has insisted it can be done. But Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates said Thursday ""we'd be doing very well to have anywhere near that amount of money available by 2030.""

The passage of the highly contested resolution was a remarkable feat, and living proof that San Francisco has heart. Lee Yong-soo (in hanbok) sits in the San Francisco Board of Supervisors chamber, where a memorial to the “comfort women” was approved unanimously Tuesday.The happiest person in the chamber was Lee Yong-soo, who first broke her silence about her enslavement almost 50 years after the ungodly tortures she experienced at the hands of the imperial Japanese army during WWII. She has been speaking out for the voiceless women ever since, demanding an apology from the Japanese government. She came all the way from Korea to support the San Francisco memorial.Supervisor Eric Mar put it succinctly in a public hearing on Sept. 17: “We are here to honor those who break the silence.” There were those who opposed the memorial, arguing that the memorial would split the Asian community in San Francisco, as well as expose Japanese-Americans to racial harassment. The biggest problem I had was with the deniers, who came to the chambers to discredit Lee, virtually calling her a liar with her sitting right there. They argued that she and all the “comfort women” were prostitutes who were conducting business with the soldiers, not conscripted and kidnapped. Their arguments were pathetic and crass. I can’t imagine what went through Lee’s mind when she heard these speakers one after another. She remained poised throughout until, at one point, she shouted back at one of the deniers, “You were not there!” Supervisor Jane Kim, in seconding Eric Mar’s motion, said that she had grown up hearing about these horrible stories from her parents and that these women were raped 20, 30 times a day. Notwithstanding the inhumane behavior on the part of the deniers, I feel sympathy for those Japanese-Americans who endured the horrors of the internment and concentration camps during WWII. They are victims of racial profiling and their struggle is symptomatic of the racism that is rooted in the American consciousness. They see that the fight against sex slavery would somehow harm them. I totally understand that sentiment. All my life, when Korea did something stupid ― and there were many incidences ― people looked at me as if there was something wrong with me.The San Francisco Board of Supervisors is correct in passing the resolution and to use the memorial for healing and educational purposes. At the same time, they are being sensitive to the victims of racial profiling in America. In voting for the resolution, Supervisor David Campos thanked Lee for bringing her “gift of truth” to San Francisco.At bottom, what moved the people of San Francisco was summed up by a number of leaders from women’s groups, who chorused, “If we let this go without calling it out, we are complicit to the crimes that happened 70 years ago,” noting that violence against women and girls still persists. “This memorial helps break the cycle,” they said. For Lee, 88 years old, her favorite song for her remaining days would be “I Left My Heart in San Francisco.” I look forward to seeing her again in a year, when I hope she will participate in dedicating the memorial. By John H.

Arthur John Patterson. (Yonhap)“It’s not right that they (the family of the victim) have to keep going through the pain over and over and over, but it’s not right that I’m here either. I still shocked that I’m even here,” the 36-year-old suspect told the swarm of journalists staked out at Incheon International Airport.In 1997, prosecutors indicted Lee on charges of stabbing the victim to death, while accusing Patterson of carrying a weapon and eliminating the evidence by getting rid of the knife and burning his bloodstained clothes. Patterson, 18 years old at the time, was staying in Seoul as the dependent of a civilian worker with the U.S. military. The Supreme Court, however, acquitted Lee in 1999, citing a lack of evidence. Patterson was sentenced to a 1 1/2-year prison term in 1998, but was granted a special pardon on the Liberation Day of the same year. Patterson left the country the following year when prosecutors failed to extend his travel ban on time.The investigation was heavily criticized as prosecutors reportedly failed to properly question the suspects despite key evidence, due to a language barrier, while the Status of Forces Agreement prevented widespread questioning of other relevant witnesses including their friends.The case was resurrected when a film, “The Case of Itaewon Homicide,” based on the murder was released in 2009, stoking widespread public furor. The prosecutors relaunched the probe and this time pointed to Patterson as the real suspect.Lee, who left for the U.S. after his acquittal, reportedly returned to Seoul several years back and vowed to support the reinvestigation. His current whereabouts are as of yet unconfirmed.In December 2011, the prosecution indicted Patterson for murder and set into motion the extradition process. While the U.S. law authorities allowed the extradition in October 2012 after the suspect was caught in collaboration with American investigators, Patterson submitted multiple habeas corpus petitions. He also requested the suspension of the extradition measure. The U.S. appeals court, however, ruled that his extradition to Korea was valid in May this year. His retrial request was also dismissed in July. Patterson did not request an additional suspension for extradition, which enabled Korean investigators to persuade the U.S. authorities to extradite him last month. An extradition suspension measure has to be applied for within two months of the court’s latest decision. Five Korean officers of the Justice Ministry flew to the U.S. on Monday to bring him to Korea. Patterson was immediately taken to the Seoul Detention Center upon arrival. He is expected to stand trial no later than next month, officials said. A public defender has been assigned to Patterson, they said.

Scheduled to return to the Assembly on Oct. 1 after a recess during the Chuseok holiday, lawmakers have faced mounting criticism for engaging more in political bickering than in professional debates over policies.Observers said the lawmakers also failed to address the dysfunctional nature of the audit, despite their initial commitment to overhaul the system.“Despite the fact that the lawmakers have summoned 708 government agencies and 4,175 witnesses, they only indulged in embarrassing those being summoned and yelling at them. Some lawmakers didn’t even ask questions. We gave a D-grade to this year’s superficial audit session,” a nongovernmental organization monitoring the parliamentary audit said in a statement. Lawmakers storm out of a meeting room after they clashed over the witness list for parliamentary probe. YonhapFor example, the chiefs of staff from the Army, Navy and Air Force were summoned Monday to the judiciary committee’s inspection into the military tribunal. These top military commanders received one question each during the four-hour session.  Similar scenes took place during the Trade Industry and Energy Committee. Among the eight governmental agencies that were brought to the stand Monday, only three of the agencies’ chiefs managed to receive questions from lawmakers.  Some lawmakers became targets of public mockery for their questions. Rep. You Dae-woon of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy demanded the nation’s police chief “demonstrate” how to shoot a gun before lawmakers in his questioning about gun accidents.

In a luncheon with representatives of a trilateral panel of the government, labor union and the business representatives, the president thanked them for reaching a landmark deal on labor reform last week, vowing that the government would reflect “the spirit of the grand compromise” demonstrated during the marathon talks. Calling it a difficult task, however, the president raised concerns over the prospect of the labor reform as it faces a bumpy road ahead with the opposition parties remaining reluctant on legislative negotiations with the governing Saenuri Party and a trade union threatening to stage a nationwide walkout.  President Park Geun-hye and representatives of the tripartite panel on labor reform attend a launcheon at Cheong Wa Dae. (Yonhap)“We have reached the beginning of the labor reform after much difficulties, but I believe that the reform process planned ahead will also be very difficult, but important, too,” said Park. “Every reform is a hard task to achieve, but it will be completed only when we all share the pain and the burden we may face in the course of the (reform) process.” Responding to Park’s remarks, Kim Dae-hwan, the chairman of the trilateral committee, said the panel will start a follow-up discussion in early October and launch a separate team to check whether the agreements are fully reflected in the legislation process. The chairman also said he would report the process to the president, citing her “profound interests” in the labor reform. President Park has set labor market reform as the top priority on her policy agenda in the second half of the year, viewing increased market flexibility as key to generating jobs for the young and reviving the slowing economy.In a separate meeting last week, the government, the ruling party and the presidential office agreed to unilaterally devise details of measures including the ways of easing restriction on layoffs ― the matter of which was left open for further discussion between labor and business.Kim had been expressing concerns over the ruling party and the government speeding up the legislation process without workers’ approval when the tripartite committee’s negotiations were being bogged down.After an intense scuffle, the Federation of Korean Trade Unions’ executives approved the deal on Sept. 14, despite persistent opposition from some of its members. The Korea Confederation of Trade Unions, the second-largest and more radical trade union in the country that had been left out of the negotiation, meanwhile, vowed all-out protests against the compromise. The South Korean business circle, for their part, said it doesn’t hold a negative view of the recent agreement on labor reform.“The tripartite agreement is meaningful because government, business and labor leaders reached a broad consensus. It is a great leap forward,” said Park Yong-man, chairman of the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Major businesses had been saying the deal fell far short of expectations and called on lawmakers to adopt more sweeping labor reforms.In the landmark deal, the panel agreed on highly contentious issues, including easing restriction on layoffs and extending the maximum employment period for temporary workers. Opposition parties and the KCTU blasted the panel’s agreement, calling it an outcome of collusion among the tripartite members. They have been claiming that the measures were biased in favor of businesses for easier employment conditions.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","to stage nationwide walkout president ,bills in luncheon with representatives ,on labor reform attend launcheon ,labor reform last week vowing ,labor reform attend launcheon at","['Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun', 'Kim Dae - hwan', 'Park', 'Kim', 'the Federation of Korean Trade Unions ’', 'the Korea Confederation of Trade Unions', 'south korean', 'Park Yong - man', 'the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry', 'kctu', 'Cho Chung - un']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52751559  0.64129508

Park Joo-sun bolted from the main opposition party to create a new one Tuesday, claiming the New Political Alliance for Democracy had run its course under the current leadership.The prosecutor-turned-politician said at a press conference that he would move to reorganize the opposition bloc and build an alternative political force, dealing yet another blow to NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in. Rep. Park Joo-sun answers reporters` questions at the National Assembly on Tuesday. YonhapPark joins a couple of other opposition politicians who have pledged to launch new parties, including independent Rep. Chun Jung-bae and former South Jeolla Gov. Park Joon-young.While all three have for the time being vowed to focus on their individual activities, there is speculation that they may seek to team up against the NPAD ahead of next year’s general election.“I plan to meet with (Chun and Park) in the near future,” the lawmaker said. All three hail from or represent Jeolla Province, the opposition’s political home turf.His move follows Moon’s decision a day before to cancel a vote of confidence that was seen as an attempt to temporarily silence his dissenters.Park’s defection had been widely anticipated as he was one of the party’s most vocal dissenters.“Although I have waited a long time for the NPAD to change through innovation, I have grown very skeptical whether the party will be able to seize the next administration,” Park said.Park entered politics in 2000 by winning in the South Jeolla Province constituency after serving as a legal affairs secretary in the Kim Dae-jung administration. Earlier, he served in various key posts as a prosecutor. He currently represents Dong-gu of Gwangju.Since the election of Moon as party chairman in February this year, Park has openly said that he would leave the party unless the factional hegemony led by the forces loyal to former President Roh Moo-hyun was discarded.He becomes the first NPAD lawmaker to have discarded his party membership voluntarily.This is not the first time that he has left the party. In the past, he left and rejoined the party repeatedly in the course of his arrest and acquittal on corruption charges through the years.Views were split on whether Park’s move would prompt an exodus of other disgruntled NPAD members.“When the party stabilizes around chairman Moon, we will be able to recover our momentum. No one from the nonmainstream faction has announced they will actually defect,” a two-term lawmaker said on condition of anonymity.Rep. Cho Kyoung-tae, meanwhile, said, “Wouldn’t such a decision be inevitable as no amount of efforts seem to be working to win back the Jeolla Province voters under Moon’s leadership.”From news reports","tuesday claiming the new political ,on tuesday yonhappark joins couple ,national assembly on tuesday yonhappark ,assembly on tuesday yonhappark joins ,one tuesday claiming the new","['Park Joo', 'the New Political Alliance for Democracy', 'NPAD', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Park Joo', 'the National Assembly', 'YonhapPark', 'Chun Jung - bae', 'South Jeolla', 'Park Joon - young', 'Chun', 'Park', 'Jeolla Province', 'Moon ’s', 'Park ’s', 'Park', 'South Jeolla Province', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'Dong - gu of', 'Moon', 'Park', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'NPAD', 'view', 'Park ’s', 'NPAD', 'Moon', 'Cho Kyoung - tae', 'Jeolla Province', 'Moon ’s']",17,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.60294461  0.23941982

The government has raised the need to forge a common understanding of history in a country where many people are deeply divided along political, regional and ideological fault lines.  Currently, eight private publishing companies print history textbooks after winning approval from the government. Middle and high schools then can choose any of the eight publishers' textbooks.   ""The textbooks being circulated right now are based on common viewpoints of the academic circle, and they have already been approved by the government,"" they said in the statement. ""If the state-authored system is implemented, it would deny the knowledge and perspectives shared by the majority of people in the field and impose the interpretation of those holding power.  ""Political authority and history should keep a certain distance,"" they said. ""A sound leader of a democratic society should focus on policies to improve the reality and future of the people for their happiness instead of engaging in the interpretation of history.""  They also said imposing a standardized view of history infringes upon the neutrality and autonomy in education guaranteed in the constitution.   About 160 professors from Korea University and some 1,100 liberal scholars and researchers of history and history education, as well as over 15,000 teachers in the field have voiced their opposition to the government's plan.  Meanwhile, conservative civic groups support the plan, arguing that most textbooks being circulated are left-leaning.  ""They all describe the country's history in a negative light,"" a group consisting of retired principals said in a statement released last Thursday. About a thousand retired principals participated in releasing the statement.   ""As the future is made from history, having a negative view of it and being self-abusive over it should be avoided,"" Kim Moo-sung, chairman of the ruling Saenuri Party, said. ""State-authored history textbooks written based on corroborated facts and a neutral perspective should be introduced.""  Rep. Kang Eun-hee of the ruling party also said while the current system seems to respect diversity, it does not, as schools only choose one among the eight options and students learn with the one chosen. She said the proposed system could contribute to establishing a more balanced concept of history.  ""To keep the nation from being split in the classrooms, we need to teach a common history,"" Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea said.  The Ministry of Education plans to make a decision on the issue by the end of the month.

APThe upper house’s approval makes the legislation into law, reinterpreting Japan’s constitution and fundamentally changing the way it uses its military. Opponents say it violates Japan‘s constitution and puts the country at risk of becoming embroiled in U.S.-led wars.The legislation has sparked sizeable protests and debate about whether Japan should shift away from its pacifist ways to face growing security challenges. Rallies have spread across the nation especially after the ruling parties approved the bills in July in the more powerful lower house.Japan’s military can now defend its allies even when the country isn’t under attack — for the first time since the end of the World War II — and work more closely with the U.S. and other nations. Japan will also be able to participate more fully in international peacekeeping, compared to its previous, mostly humanitarian, missions.“The legislation is necessary in order to protect the people’s lives and their peaceful livelihood, and it is to prevent a war,” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters after the passage of a total of 11 bills — one related to international peacekeeping and a package of 10 others designed to allow Japan‘s military to defend its allies in an action called “collective self-defense.”Dozens of constitutional scholars, lawyers and other legal experts have joined protests, saying the legislation allowing Japan to use force to settle international disputes violates its U.S.-drafted postwar constitution that renounces a right to wage war.China said it and other Asian neighbors are closely watching the vote because of Japan’s wartime aggression.“We demand that Japan genuinely listen to just appeals from both at home and abroad, learning from historical lessons and adhering to the path of peaceful development,” said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei.Previous postwar governments had all made the notion of collective self-defense unconstitutional. But Abe’s Cabinet last year decided to allow it by unilaterally adopting a new interpretation of the constitution, instead of formally revising the charter, saying it must be adapted to today’s increasingly challenging security environment. The constitutional reinterpretation triggered public criticism that Abe‘s government undermined democracy. Opponents also say the change would cause Japan to do more in the bilateral alliance with the U.S.In Washington, leaders of Senate committees overseeing U.S. defense and foreign policy welcomed the legislation’s passage, saying it would contribute to international peace and security and strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance.“We welcome a larger role for Japan in regional and global security affairs and look forward to our country working with Japan to implement these new measures,” the Republican and Democratic committee leaders said in a joint statement Friday.

Moon Jae-in walks up to a podium Wednesday to deliver a speech at the party’s central committee meeting on a proposed reform package at the National Assembly. (Yonhap)With the initiatives getting the official nod from the party, Moon appears to have seized a chance to consolidate his powerbase ahead of the elections. However, prospects remain unpromising as the approval was seen to sweep the burgeoning discord under the carpet, instead of turning around the party’s divisive mood.Moon’s call for a vote of confidence also stands after he proposed it earlier this month to confront mounting pressure for him to resign.If the measures were approved by the central committee, Moon had said he would have his leadership tested by holding a vote before the Chuseok holiday in late September.Calling it a new beginning, Moon said he would start implementing fresh measures to fundamentally reform the party and urged the party to end the ongoing factional fight for a shared goal of winning the elections next year.“The passage of the reform proposal is not the end but only the beginning,” said Moon after the meeting.“We will unite our party and become a winning political party through adopting fundamental and cultural changes apart from institutional innovation,” he said.The meeting was held a day after Moon met with former party cochairman Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo in a closed-door meeting to seek common ground for the party’s future and put an end to their public fissures. The meeting ended in failure only to confirm each other’s differences. Ahn boycotted the Wednesday meeting, claiming that he was deprived of a right to freely express his opposition to the reform measures.“If chairman Moon didn’t risk his leadership with the fate of the reform measures, I could have attended the central committee meeting and started a debate there to explain why I was opposing it,” said Ahn in a message texted to reporters. “But unfortunately, the meeting today has turned into (an event) to make a decision on the chairman’s fate.”The two have been engaged in a war of words as to whether or not to put the reform measures to a vote at Wednesday’s executive meeting, each accusing the other of driving the party into another catastrophe in pursuit of political gain. The NPAD central meeting was expected to be critical for both, as Moon wanted to reestablish his leadership and silence nonmainstream members who vehemently opposed reform measures. Ahn sought to stop Moon’s drive, which could hold back his ambition to be the liberal contender for the next presidential election. Despite the result, the chairman is likely to face pressure continuously from nonmainstream members to resign from his post. “After the vote, Moon, is expected to seek a political alliance with Rep. Ahn and Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon, who both hold a strong image as innovative figures in the party,” said Yoon Hee-woong, a senior researcher at Opinion Live. It is crucial for Moon to work with Ahn and Park in order to win the general election next year, as they hold a strong support base among younger voters, particularly in Seoul and neighboring cities, he added. Moon has risked his leadership in line with the fate of the reform measures aimed at adopting new nomination rules. If the party disapproved the measures, the chairman said he would leave his post.His surprise announcement, aimed at silencing objectors, sparked a backlash, as the nonmainstream members escalated their demand that the vote on the reform proposals be delayed.Nonmainstream members had demanded that the vote be put off until after Oct. 8 when the parliamentary audit ends. They have remained skeptical of the plans, suspecting that the group of mainstreamers, led by Moon, would abuse the reform proposals to pursue their own political agendas.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","vote at wednesday executive meeting ,applause at the new politics ,initiatives on wednesday despite opposition ,podium wednesday to deliver speech ,wednesday executive meeting each accusing","['Moon Jae - in', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy ’s', 'Moon ’s', 'Moon Jae -', 'the National Assembly', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Moon', 'Ahn', 'NPAD', 'Moon', 'Moon ’s', 'Moon', 'Ahn', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Yoon Hee - woong', 'Moon', 'Ahn and Park', 'Seoul', 'Moon', 'Cho Chung - un']",17,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.36180151  0.42149824

226,226,[News Focus] Saenuri pushes forward with labor bills,"The ruling Saenuri Party on Wednesday decided to push ahead with five labor law amendments -- including measures to ease restriction on layoffs and extending the maximum employment period for temporary workers -- as its party platform, showing its resolve to see through the key elements of the labor reform drive within this year.

The tripartite committee of labor, management and the government on Sunday struck a deal on reforming the labor market. The deal was endorsed by the Federation of Korea Trade Unions -- the largest umbrella union in the country -- the next day.Saenuri chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung said that a bipartisan agreement for the revisions must be reached by Sept. 19, as the National Assembly’s final regular session closes in December. “This agreement was reached by the leaders of the related sectors and experts through over 120 meetings in the past year. Both the ruling and the opposition parties have a duty to respect the objectives and the content of the compromise,” Kim said. But the five-point labor law revision encompasses thorny issues flagrantly opposed by both the opposition lawmakers and many of the labor unions, heralding a grim prospect for the reform bill. The Korea Confederation of Trade Unions, the second-largest trade union in the country and widely perceived as more belligerent than the FKTU, vowed an “all-out war” against what it defined as “collusion” of the tripartite members.The focal points of the dispute are revisions on the dispatched workers’ act and temporary agency workers’ act. The former expands the scope of dispatched workers by including specialized workers with annual income of over 56 million won ($48,000) and workers aged 55 or older, while allowing more sectors to employ them. The latter extends the maximum employment period for temporary workers from two years to four for workers aged 35 or older.The Saenuri Party and the Labor Ministry say the revision will protect temporary workers from being laid off, but the opposition argues that it will only prolong the nonguaranteed period for most workers.“(The bill for temporary workers) potentially can be a disaster. Right now we have the largest number of short-period workers among OECD members. I think increasing the number of temporary workers can be catastrophic for young people,” Rep. Eun Soo-mi of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy said in a radio interview. She added that the dispatched workers bill can deteriorate the quality of jobs, particularly for elderly workers. Eun called the compromise a “half-baked deal” as the FKTU only represents about 5 percent of workers.The parties have similar opinions on the other three revisions. The revision for the Employment Insurance Act will increase unemployment benefits, and changes made to the Industrial Accident Compensation Insurance Act will expand the range of accidents occurring during commute that are covered by companies. The Labor Standards Act will be revised to decrease working hours and clarify the standards for base payment.But the bipartisan discord is even more pronounced in the government’s plan to establish administrative guidelines that will make it easier for companies to lay off underperforming workers and revise company policies without the union’s approval.NPAD floor leader Lee Jong-kul said he cannot accept what his party had defined as a tool for “easy layoffs,” and said the party would agree on a legislative discussion for the layoff plans. By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","government on sunday struck deal ,ruling saenuri party on wednesday ,saenuri party on wednesday decided ,with five labor law amendments ,national assembly final regular session","['Saenuri Party', 'the Federation of Korea Trade Unions', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'the National Assembly ’s', 'Kim', 'the Korea Confederation of Trade Unions', 'the Saenuri Party', 'the Labor Ministry', 'OECD', 'Eun Soo - mi', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Eun', 'the Employment Insurance Act', 'the Industrial Accident Compensation Insurance Act', 'Lee Jong - kul']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63126093  0.10804792

About 180 workers were also fired, many of whom filed a lawsuit against the automaker, demanding they be reinstated. A lower court, however, did not recognize the legitimacy of the strikes and ordered the union to take responsibility for 60 percent of the loss incurred by them, estimated to be 5.5 billion won.Kim Deuk-jung, head of the Ssangyong Motor union, claimed the ruling seems to unfairly represent the company's interest. ""Considering a series of conservative rulings recently made by the country's judiciary, we are skeptical that an appeal would make the situation any better,"" Kim said.Ssangyong said it will first analyze the ruling before taking any further action.The automaker based in Pyeongtaek, south of Seoul, was purchased by India's Mahindra & Mahindra in 2011.

Middle and high schools then can choose any of the eight publishers' textbooks.""It is not a simple question of history but of diversity, a crucial value in a democratic society,"" professor Kim Eon-jong said in a press conference at the university in Seoul.He was explaining why professors from all across the university, including those from the business administration department to the literature department, participated in releasing the statement. They argued the proposed system is an iconic child of the country's past military-backed regimes. ""What they call common understanding of history could be shaped by those holding the power,"" they added in the statement.  ""It is very regretful that the government did not discuss the issue with the experts in the field before pushing the plan,"" professor Kwon Nae-hyun said. ""They are just following some politicians' words that suit their taste, ignoring the voices from civil society and academic circles.""Over the last month, a series of statements either supporting or opposing the plan have been released.Last Wednesday, some 1,100 liberal scholars and researchers of history and history education released a press statement opposing the plan.It followed similar statements from professors of history education at Seoul National University, history teachers at schools around the country, and educational superintendents of 14 cities and provinces earlier in the month.Yet, conservative civic groups support the plan arguing that most textbooks circulated right now are left-leaning.""To avoid students from being confused ideologically, government should publish a standardized history textbook,"" one of the groups said in a press conference Wednesday in central Seoul.The Ministry of Education plans to make a decision on the issue by the end of the month.

He had an affair with another woman and had a child with her in 1998. The man left his marriage home in 2000, started living with the other woman and eventually filed for divorce in 2011.Seven of the 13 sitting judges said that it was premature to introduce no-fault divorce that acknowledges a divorce requested by the person at fault. The court explained that Korean laws already enable the spouse at fault to be able to seek divorce through a divorce settlement, the most common form of divorce in the country. In 2014, 77.7 percent of all divorce cases were finalized through settlement.The court said that such leeway provides the spouse at fault the ability to seek divorce for the sake of his or her right to pursue happiness. Consequently, winning divorce through a no-fault system is not required.It added that while countries that have introduced the no-fault divorce system have a set of legal tools to protect the counterpart and their offspring from facing harsh situations after divorce, Korea has yet to secure such protection.

Moon Jae-in (Yonhap)The former and incumbent chairman of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy had been engaging in a fight as to whether or not to put the reform measures to a vote at Wednesday’s executive meeting, each accusing the other of driving the party into another catastrophe in pursuit of political gain. The NPAD meeting on Wednesday was expected to be critical for both, as Moon wants to consolidate his leadership and silence nonmainstream members who vehemently oppose reform measures. Ahn seeks to stop Moon’s drive, which could hold back his ambitions to be liberal contender for the next presidential election.  Ahn Cheol-soo (Yonhap)The prospects for their precarious relationship remain dim despite their meeting Tuesday, observers say. “It could defuse mounting tension between the mainstream members and the non-mainstreamers for the time being, but the infighting is likely to continue for a considerable time,” said Yoon Hee-woong, a senior researcher at Opinion Live.In the latest in a series of verbal battles, Rep. Moon sent a handwritten letter to Ahn on Monday afternoon rebuking Ahn, saying that his demand to delay the party vote on the reform initiatives was “totally incomprehensible.” In the letter, which Moon posted on his Twitter later in the evening, the chairman stressed that he was pushing ahead with the matter because he believed that it was time for the party to move forward and put an end to the intensifying factional feud by adopting the new nomination rules. “I don’t understand at all, then, what are you suggesting me to do?” he wrote. “There have been growing voices (within the party) demanding me to resign from the chairmanship for a long time, and the division and the conflict that followed have put our party on hold, making it difficult for all of us to go forward. Then what would be solution to that?” In apparent retaliation, Ahn held a news conference early Tuesday blasting Moon once again, saying he was missing the fundamental point of the party reform. “If he pushes ahead with the measures, many people will cast doubts over him and his purpose,” he said. The entrepreneur-turned-lawmaker also said he would meet Moon face to face to settle the matter completely. The lawmaker has been boycotting Moon’s proposal to hold a vote of confidence on his leadership and urged the central committee to indefinitely postpone the Wednesday meeting.The sour relationship between the two goes back to the 2012 presidential election when they first held negotiations over merging candidacies to fight against then-ruling party candidate Park Geun-hye. After a series of lengthy talks, Ahn gave up his candidacy in the 2012 presidential election to support Moon, the then-presidential candidate for the Democratic United Party, the precursor to the NPAD. Ahn’s “support” however was lukewarm. Though he accompanied Moon on the campaign trail, he mostly remained reserved. After Moon’s defeat, the two remained at odds. Speculation was rampant that Ahn had demanded Moon join him in founding a new party and give him sole authority in political reform in return for merging the two campaigns.In early 2014, while Moon was still out of the spotlight suffering his election defeat, Ahn agreed to establish a new political party with then-Democratic Party chairman Rep. Kim Han-gil, thus the party’s new name, its third in as many years. After a short honeymoon period, Ahn offered to resign from his post as cochairman, taking responsibility for the NPAD’s crushing defeat in the following by-election. Moon remained out of the political spotlight until he seized the NPAD leadership earlier this year.Geum Tae-seop, a lawyer who worked as Ahn’s spokesman during the presidential race, said that despite the dramatic alliance the two sought during the presidential election, Ahn and Moon had remained poles apart.“Park Kyung-cheol (Ahn’s confidant) had said Ahn and Moon shared a deep connection that other people wouldn’t notice. They also met several times in unofficial settings (offering an impression) that they would work things out,” wrote Geum in a recent book.“Unlike what Park had said, there was no chemistry between the two candidates,” he wrote.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","spotlight suffering his election defeat ,the two former presidential candidates ,two former presidential candidates moon ,dim despite their meeting tuesday ,fight over the party withering","['Moon Jae - in', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'NPAD', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Yoon Hee - woong', 'Moon', 'Ahn', 'Moon', 'Ahn', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Moon ’s', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Ahn', 'Moon', 'the Democratic United Party', 'Moon', 'Moon ’s', 'Ahn', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Democratic Party', 'Kim Han - gil', 'Moon', 'geum Tae - seop', 'Ahn ’s', 'Moon', 'Kyung - cheol', 'Ahn ’s', 'Ahn', 'Moon', 'geum', 'Cho Chung - un']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39030254  0.68111461

Choi Yoon-hee, whose two-year stint ends in October.If he wins presidential approval on Tuesday and the ensuing parliamentary hearing, Lee will become the first Army Academy alumnus to take up South Korea’s highest-ranking officer post on active duty, which has traditionally been occupied by those from the elite Military Academy. Since the JCS’ 1954 inception, only Army generals have assumed the chairmanship except in two cases ― the incumbent Choi and former Air Force Chief of Staff Lee Yang-ho who served from 1993-94. A native of Daegu, Lee Sun-jin entered the academy in 1977. He also undertook key Army positions including head of the Aviation Operations Command, Capital Corps and the 2nd Infantry Division. He gained fame for a pacific disposition and strong communication skills with not only colleagues but also rank-and-file servicemen, while helping advance joint rear area operational capabilities with U.S. forces here, officials said. “The selection was based on whether the nominees embraced the commander-in-chief’s administrative philosophy and embody a reforming mind, expertise and leadership, as well as a comprehensive assessment of their ability, personality and command capability that are essential to overseeing our national security and the military,” said Lee Hwang-gyu, director-general for personnel planning at the Defense Ministry. As part of the shake-up, the ministry also nominated 1st Army commander Gen. Jang Jun-gyu as the new Army Chief of Staff, the JCS' chief of strategic planning Lt. Gen. Jeong Kyeong-doo as the Air Force Chief of Staff, and 3rd Army commander Gen. Kim Hyun-jip as the deputy commander of the Combined Forces Command.

Moon Jae-in’s leadership became increasingly questionable after his ultimatum last week was seen to further escalate the in-house scuffle.NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in leaves his office at the National Assembly on Monday. YonhapMoon was absent from the party’s Supreme Council meeting for first time since he seized the chairmanship of the New Political Alliance for Democracy early this year, reflecting a severe disunity within the party and the top man’s weakening leadership.Moon’s boycott of the meeting reflected his deepening quagmire as he was seen to be left with little alternative to break through the standoff further bogged down by declining approval ratings. The former presidential candidate of the party had been facing mounting pressure to resign from some party members, mostly members considered outside of the mainstream.On Wednesday, a central committee of the NPAD is set to decide the fate of the reform measures aimed at adopting a new nomination process ahead of the general elections next year. Amid controversy over the measures, Moon said last week that he would leave his post if the party disapproved the plan. He, however, agreed to put off his initial plan to push for a vote of confidence until the Chuseok holiday next week. His surprise announcement, aimed at silencing objections, was seen to cause greater backlash, as the nonmainstream members escalated their demand that the vote on the reform proposals be delayed.The vote should be put off until after Oct. 8 when the parliamentary audit ends,” said Rep. Moon Byeong-ho, a member of the nonmainstream faction.“If chairman Moon does not delay it, we will demand a secret ballot, and if that demand is also not met, we will reconsider participating in the vote altogether,” he added.Rep. Lee Jong-kul, the floor leader of the party, meanwhile, denounced Moon’s plan to hold a vote of confidence saying it reminded him of the Yushin Constitution that gave former President Park Chung-hee dictatorial power. Through the revision of the constitution, Park was able to extend his presidency without seeking reelection. Lee’s remark likening Moon’s plan with the Yushin Constitution enraged the NPAD chairman, a former human rights lawyer who fought against the Park administration, according to sources. Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, former cochairman of the party, also blasted Moon, saying that his plan has nothing to do with reforming the NPAD and rather has thrown the party into another in a series of power struggles. He also demanded the central committee indefinitely postpone the meeting scheduled to put the reform measure for a vote on Wednesday.Meanwhile, Cho Guk, Seoul National University professor and a member of the Innovation Committee of the party, said that any party member who objects to the party’s rules should either defect or launch a new party, in an apparent rebuke aimed at Ahn.“A party member should respect the party constitution and its justifiable process,” he tweeted, adding that every politician seeks political gains by denouncing others.“Moon Jae-in could tighten the grip on the party by supporting the reform measure while Ahn Cheol-soo could prevent Moon from taking control of the party by opposing the initiative. Lawmakers will be given another (parliamentary) term if they abort the plan,” he said.The remark came amid growing suspicion that Ahn may launch a new party by forming an alliance with Rep. Chun Jung-bae, who defected from the party in apparent opposition to Moon’s leadership. Observers say that Moon could have made the surprising announcement Wednesday, risking his political career in line with the party reform initiatives, to water down the significance of a private meeting between Chun and Ahn on the same day last week.Chun, who recently won a parliamentary seat in a by-election as an independent candidate, has reportedly asked Ahn to join a new party, a plan which would strike a serious blow to Moon, who wants to gather progressive forces to make head against the conservative bloc ahead of the general elections next year and the 2017 presidential election.If Moon renews confidence in his chairmanship, chances are high that nonmainstreamers will defect from the party and join a new one, according to insiders. But if he fails to retain his post, Moon could split himself from the party and launch a new one along with the members of the Pro-Roh Moo-hyun faction regarded as mainstreamers, they added.Han Sang-jin, professor emeritus at Seoul National University, who served as a member of an advisory committee of the party, however, offered a grim picture in a radio interview Monday, saying even if Moon keeps his job, the division within the NPAD would intensify anyway.The NPAD’s reform proposals call for an electoral committee of nonparty members to nominate candidates for the next parliamentary elections in April. The list also includes offering extra points to fresh figures, women and the handicapped in the nomination process. Nonmainstream members, however, have remained skeptical of the plans, suspecting that the group of mainstreamers, led by Moon, would abuse the reform proposals to pursue their own political agendas.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","announcement wednesday risking his political ,elections next year amid controversy ,top man weakening leadership moon ,after his ultimatum last week ,wednesday risking his political career","['Moon Jae - in', 'npad', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the National Assembly', 'YonhapMoon', 'Supreme Council', 'the New Political Alliance for Democracy', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Chuseok', 'Moon Byeong - ho', 'Moon', 'Lee Jong - kul', 'Moon', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Park', 'Lee ’s', 'Moon', 'NPAD', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Moon', 'Cho Guk', 'Seoul National University', 'the Innovation Committee of the party', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Moon', 'Chun Jung - bae', 'Moon ’s', 'Moon', 'Chun', 'Chun', 'Ahn', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'roh Moo - hyun', 'Han Sang - jin', 'Seoul National University', 'Moon', 'NPAD', 'Moon', 'Cho Chung - un']",17,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.56434876  0.32851139

Organized by the Chinese Institute of International Studies, the two-day seminar, starting Friday, will mark the 10th anniversary of a deal in which North Korea agreed to abandon its nuclear program in exchange for aid and security assurances. The agreement was announced on Sept. 19, 2005 after the six-party talks involving South Korea, North Korea, the United States, China, Russia and Japan. However, follow-up negotiations on implementing the deal stalled because of North Korea's boycott of the talks.The six-party talks have not been held since late 2008 and North Korea has conducted three nuclear tests so far.An official at the Chinese institute confirmed that the seminar will be held on Friday, but declined to give details. North Korea is unlikely to send its chief nuclear envoy, Ri Yong-ho, to this week's seminar, the diplomatic source in Beijing said on the condition of anonymity. South Korea has no plans to dispatch a government delegation to the event, officials in Seoul said.It is a ""civilian seminar"" hosted by a Chinese think tank and South Korean scholars and experts will largely attend it, a Foreign Ministry official said.""On the government's part, Kim Gunn, director general for North Korean nuclear affairs at the Foreign Ministry, plans to participate in the forum in his personal capacity,"" he added.Kim is Seoul's deputy chief delegate to the six-party talks on the North's nuclear program.It remains unclear whether the U.S., Russia and Japan will send their government officials to the seminar, according to the source.

Ahn Cheol-soo, former cochairman of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, on Sunday urged the incumbent party leader to withdraw his plan to conduct a vote of confidence, saying that he was only turning the ongoing dispute over the party’s reform initiative into another in a series of power struggles. (Yonhap)In a statement titled “A Letter to NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in,” Ahn also called on the party’s executive council to delay a meeting scheduled for Wednesday to vote on the reform measures that would only highlight the party’s intensifying factional feud and further aggravate confusion within the party.The remark came a day after Moon accepted another demand by key party members to postpone a revote on his job, backtracking from his announcement last week. In a surprise announcement, Moon said he would leave his post if the party voted down the package of party reform measures. The former presidential candidate for the party had been facing mounting pressure to resign from some party members, mostly outside of the mainstream, who remained skeptical of the reform proposal and the leadership.Moon’s decision last week was seen as a move aimed to silence objections to the party’s reform initiatives and consolidate his position as the party leader amid a deepening rift between the pro-Roh Moo-hyun faction, regarded as mainstreamers, and nonmainstream members. But his decision was met with vehement opposition from most members of the Supreme Council, who condemned it as an ultimatum against nonmainstreamers.With Moon reaching the agreement with key party members Saturday, the dispute over the vote of confidence appeared to have started to settle down. But Ahn’s opposition Sunday seemed to have effectively reignited controversy over Moon’s leadership and the reform packages. The proposal, drawn by the party’s special innovation committee, calls for the party to form an electoral committee of nonparty members to nominate candidates for the general elections in April. The panel also suggested offering extra points to fresh figures, including women and the handicapped, in the nomination process. Members of minority factions, including Rep. Ahn, however, remained skeptical of the plan, suspecting that the group of mainstreamers, led by Moon, would abuse the reform proposals to pursue their own political agendas.“The proposal is far from the fundamentals of party innovation and we have already experienced a disastrous outcome,” said Ahn, referring to the party’s nomination rule that reflected popularity scores garnered from mobile users when selecting its presidential candidate in 2012.Ahn urged Moon to instead select the party candidates through an open primary system, which the ruling Saenuri has already adopted. Proponents believe that such a system would allow more rank-and-file party members and ordinary voters to participate in the process of nominating candidates.Ahn has repeatedly made comments blasting Moon and the NPAD reform committee, saying their attempts to overhaul the party have failed. The reform committee was set after the party went through a crushing defeat in a by-election in April to better prepare for the upcoming general elections and also for the presidential election in late 2017.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","job backtracking from his announcement ,incumbent party leader to withdraw ,delay meeting scheduled for wednesday ,party members to postpone revote ,party voted down the package","['Ahn Cheol', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Yonhap)In', 'NPAD', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Moon ’s', 'roh Moo - hyun', 'the Supreme Council', 'Moon', 'Ahn ’s', 'Moon ’s', 'Ahn', 'Moon', 'Ahn', 'Moon', 'Saenuri', 'Moon', 'NPAD', 'Cho Chung - un']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26305398  0.02586195

But the court acquitted him of those charges, saying it is difficult to recognize Kim posed threats to the country's existence or liberal democracy.   Prosecutors said they would appeal the acquittal.

Moon Jae-in on Friday decided to go ahead with a vote of confidence from this weekend despite key members’ vehement opposition. The move, aimed to silence objections to the party’s reform initiatives, appeared to set off more infighting as most members of the Supreme Council condemned it as an ultimatum against nonmainstreamers.New Politics Alliance for Democracy spokesman Kim Seong-su said during a press briefing that the vote of confidence will be held for three days on Sept. 13-15, and the results would be announced at the party’s executive council meeting Wednesday, when the party is slated to vote on the reform measures.Moon had made a surprise announcement on Wednesday that he would leave his chairmanship if the party votes down the package of reform measures. Moon had been facing mounting pressure to resign from some party members who remained skeptical of the reform proposals and the leadership. NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in attends an audit session at the National Assembly on Friday. YonhapMoon’s vote will be conducted in two ways -- one by ARS poll among the party’s ordinary members and another by collecting approval ratings. Moon would step down if either of the votes fails to endorse him, or if the central committee turns down the reform packages.Kim explained that a decision to hold a vote of confidence does not require approval by the Supreme Council according to the party’s regulations.Earlier in the day, all members of the Supreme Council except for Rep. Jun Byung-hun opposed holding the confidence vote.“The best way possible for the time being to host the nationwide convention (to replace the leadership) as it is an opportunity to consolidate the people and the party,” floor leader Rep.

""Under such circumstances, the government cannot wait forever, so it will take charge and push for changes that can create more job opportunities for young people and fuel economic growth,"" he said in a statement.The government will work with the ruling Saenuri Party starting next week to iron out the bill, so it can be passed in parliament within the year, he said.""Headway made so far at the tripartite negotiations will be reflected in the bill, and outdated and inflexible rules in the labor market needs to be overhauled,"" he said. ""At the same time, every effort will be made to give greater stability to workers and more attention paid to helping those that are laid off.""Choi, who doubles as deputy prime minister in charge of economic affairs, said the government-Saenuri bill will include creating a fair screening system that will make it easier to dismiss under-performing workers, allow companies to change rules of employment and make it possible to introduce the wage peak system.Existing labor laws make it very difficult to dismiss workers and any changes to the employment rules need to be approved by employees.The wage peak system advocated by the government calls for people nearing retirement age to receive less pay, with the money saved to be used to hire new employees. This work sharing arrangement is critical because South Korea's retirement age will be pushed back to 60 starting in 2016, raising employment-related costs for companies. As of August, the unemployment rate of young people stood at 8 percent, much higher than the 3.4 percent for the entire country. He also said that there is a need for greater cooperation between management and labor, and unions must put an end to engaging in disruptive walkouts for wage hikes.Choi cited moves by labor unions at Hyundai Motor Co. and leading shipyards to engage in strikes as prime examples of unreasonable labor practices that need to be changed.The minister said that while the government engages in talks with Saenuri, it will accept any future agreements made at the tripartite talks set to resume on Saturday.The government, meanwhile, said that companies too have been asked to make compromises such as pledging to hire a large number of new employees in the coming years as well as revising the way they deal with smaller business partners and small and medium enterprises.""Such measures are costly, yet they can promote mutual growth between big companies and smaller companies that can help the economy,"" said Labor Minister Lee Ki-kweon.He also said that besides these issues, the government will take steps to raise unemployment wages and reform the way fixed-term employment workers and temporary agency workers are treated to help resolve inequality and discrimination issues between the two.

At the audit session on Sept. 17, lawmakers are expected to question Lotte‘s governance structure. Lotte has been embroiled in an infamous family feud between Shin and his brother over the control of South Korea’s retail giant. In a statement on Thursday, Lotte confirmed Shin’s attendance to the audit, saying he would fully cooperate with the audit and prepare for the session with “due diligence.”“Lotte, which has vowed to implement the reform to the governance structure, should take (the audit) as an opportunity to dispel the public’s anger and distrust over the company,” said Rep. Kang Gi-jung of the NPAD. Lotte Group chairman Shin Dong-bin responds to reporters' questionBoth parties also agreed to summon the chiefs of Naver and Daum, South Korea’s major Internet portals, to question whether they have violated the rule of political neutrality in political affairs by arbitrarily changing headlines or arranging news to sway voters in favor of opposition parties.Meanwhile, lawmakers clashed over the witness list for an upcoming parliamentary inquiry into the government’s response to the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak that claimed dozens of lives and caused public fear over the nation’s disease quarantine system.The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy demanded that the list include those high-profile government officials who were tasked with handling the MERS outbreak, while the ruling Saenuri Party rejected the offer and claimed the officials already explained themselves during the previous hearings. NPAD lawmakers urged former Health and Welfare Minister Moon Hyung-pyo and senior presidential advisers to attend the special probe and testify before lawmakers about the government’s poor response in the early stages of the outbreak. The probe will take place on Sept. 22.“Considering the magnitude of the MERS outbreak that has fueled public fears, Cheong Wa Dae should come forward and tell (the lawmakers) exactly what measures they took during the outbreak,” said NPAD lawmaker Rep. Rhee Mok-hee. But the ruling Saenuri Party dismissed the call as an unnecessary attempt to grill government officials.“The previous parliamentary committee has already got to the bottom of (the MERS outbreak).

The NIKH is slated to hold a public hearing Friday.There has been a debate in South Korea over whether the government should be given exclusive right to publish history textbooks for middle and high schools. Rival parties have been wrangling over the issue for months while high-ranking education officials and progressives across the country have raised objections to the prospect. The country currently allows publishers to write their own secondary education textbooks, but some of these books are accused of being substandard. Elementary school-level history textbooks are already published by the state.“The issue of state history textbooks can be confirmed after a series of procedure following the public hearing (by the NIKH). It is not right for me to preemptively tell you the conclusions,” Hwang said at the audit held in Sejong Government Complex.Hwang did reiterate his stance that having a single version of history taught in schools can help students avoid confusion, and that he “did not rule out” state-published history textbooks. But opposition members said that it was very unlikely that the ministry was oblivious to the prospect of a new textbook publishing system, given that Hwang vowed to announce the ministry’s position in late September and the procedure to develop the new textbook would begin around October.“Your schedule implies that the administrative notification for the new textbooks should start soon. The ministry should at the very least announce which direction it is headed in,” said Rep. Youn Kwan-suk of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy.Earlier in the day, Rep. Do Jong-hwan of the NPAD revealed an official document created by the Education Ministry which showed that “improvement of the history textbook system” was a presidential directive. The document was dated February 2014, which was around the time that a textbook by Kyohak Publishing Co. was accused of conservative bias and a general lack of quality.NPAD’s Rep. Kim Tae-nyeon accused the ministry of sabotaging the audit, and urged the ministry to provide all related data on the suspicion that Park had directly ordered the reinstatement of state history textbooks, which were initially introduced by her father, former President Park Chung-hee before being abolished in the 2000s.While Hwang claimed that opinions of “various experts related to history” were taken into account in the ministry’s decision, he did not elaborate on exactly who participated in the procedure. Rep. Jeong Jin-hoo of the minor opposition party pointed out that the latest survey results stated by the ministry -- which showed that 48.6 percent of the people were for state textbooks opposed to 48.1 percent against -- was dated October 2014. He asked Hwang to provide results of more recent surveys and a list of those who participated in the public hearing and research. Members of the ruling Saenuri Party, on the other hand, said that textbooks published under the current system have many errors.Rep. Kang Eun-hee of Saenuri pointed out that eight high school history textbooks that currently exist are inconsistent on facts. When describing the dawn of the Stone Age on the Korean peninsula for example, the textbooks range from B.C. 300,000 to B.C. 1 million. She also pointed out that the textbooks have different interpretations about the Vietnam War, Korea’s modern history and the country’s first president, Rhee Syng-man.“Because the standards for (the ministry’s) certification are low, publishers are basically left to freely author textbooks,” she said.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","opposition lawmakers thursday blasted the ,lawmakers thursday blasted the education ,published history textbooks but opposition ,opposition lawmakers thursday blasted ,opposition lawmakers thursday","['Hwang Woo - yea', 'the National Institute of korean history', 'NIKH', 'South Korea', 'NIKH', 'Hwang', 'Hwang', 'Youn Kwan - suk', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Jong - hwan', 'NPAD', 'the Education Ministry', 'Kyohak Publishing Co.', 'NPAD ’s', 'Kim Tae - nyeon', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Hwang', 'Jeong Jin - hoo', 'Hwang', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kang Eun - hee', 'Saenuri', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Rhee Syng']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.04094625  0.62309414

The highest court sent the case back to the lower court, taking issue with the amount of the money Lee misappropriated and the ordinance applied to his crime – the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes. The prosecution charged him in accordance with the aggravated punishment law, accusing Lee of having forced CJ Group’s Japanese branch to give a joint guarantee in a dubious real estate deal with a property manager, Pan Japan, in 2007. Lee was suspected of having purchased property in Tokyo, Japan, under a false name using secret overseas funds funneled through Pan Japan, causing more than 30 billion won in financial losses to the company.But the court said that his crime should be subjected to the Criminal Act, rather than the aggravated punishment law on economic crimes, as the exact profits from the shady real estate deal cannot be calculated.When the Criminal Act applies to his crime, Lee could face a sentence of up to five years and a fine of up to 15 million won. But the aggravated punishment law could hand him down a life imprisonment or jail term of more than five years. As the court accepted Lee’s request to suspend the imprisonment for hospital treatment, he will stand trial without physical detention. Lee underwent a kidney transplant last July, but allegedly suffered from multiple side effects. He is currently staying at the Seoul National University Hospital.Following the ruling, CJ Group expressed relief, saying that it hopes to see the prison sentence for Lee reduced or suspended in the upcoming retrial. “Given Lee’s frail health, we are relieved that the chairman secured a chance to lower his prison term,” a spokesperson for CJ said. “We expect the lower court to make a verdict in line with the highest court’s intention.”Lee, a nephew of Samsung Group chairman Lee Kun-hee, took the helm of Cheiljedang, the precursor to CJ Group, in 2002.

The annual questioning will be run separately from Thursday to Sept. 23 and from Oct. 1 to Oct. 8.Lotte had been embroiled in a bitter family fight over control of the sprawling business empire, which has reignited sentiment against family-controlled conglomerates, known as chaebol, and prompted an all-out government investigation into the group.In 2013, Shin was ordered to pay 10 million won ($8,870) in fines for refusing to comply with the call to appear at the annual audit held a year earlier, citing overseas business trips.

ReutersThe 89-year-old, rarely seen without her signature hat and handbag, has met most of the major figures of recent decades, from India’s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru to Japanese emperor Hirohito.South Africa‘s anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela called her “my friend,” while her reign also spanned the construction and the destruction of the Berlin Wall.The sprawling British empire of the Victorian era, on which it was said that the sun never set, has shrunk to a few remnants during her reign. Most recently, Hong Kong was handed over to China in 1997.Yet even in far-flung parts of the world, “when people refer to the queen they almost always mean our queen,” said John Major, one of the 12 prime ministers to have held office while she has been on the throne.Britain’s slender republican movement condemns a system based on inherited privilege. But for many, the queen is a mainstay in a multi-ethnic country increasingly riven by regional divisions, including in Scotland, which voted against independence last year.Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor‘s birth on April 21 1926 was a relatively minor event for a world teetering between two world wars and just three years away from the Great Depression.The curly-haired “Lilibet” was destined for marriage, not the throne.But after reigning for just 325 days, her childless uncle Edward VIII abdicated in 1936 to marry Wallis Simpson, a twice-divorced American.Princess Elizabeth’s father inherited the crown as George VI and she suddenly became heir to the throne.When the young Elizabeth and her sister Margaret had to move to Buckingham Palace, she asked her nanny: “What -- you mean forever?”On her 21st birthday, she vowed to spend her life serving her country.On November 20, 1947 she married Philip -- a distant cousin who renounced his titles as prince of Greece and Denmark and his career in the Royal Navy to be with her. She has described him as “my strength and stay.”When George VI died at the age of 56 in 1952 she became queen aged just 25 and with two young children: Charles (born in 1948) and Anne (1950). Two others came later -- Andrew (1960) and Edward (1964).Her role is highly ceremonial and she remains above the fray of politics.Every year, she reads out the program of the government of the day at the State Opening of Parliament.Her voice remains neutral and high-pitched, even when the proposals include measures she is suspected of opposing, such as banning the traditional sport of fox-hunting.“Ma‘am” as her subjects address her, also presides over the Commonwealth composed of 53 members, including 15 former colonies where she is still the sovereign, such as Australia and Canada.“The primary role of the monarchy is to sell the British brand and the queen is very good at it,” said royal biographer Robert Jobson.Despite the widespread respect she now commands, her reign has had plenty of ups and downs.In 1981, her son and heir Charles married Diana in a fairytale wedding that quickly turned sour despite the birth of their two sons William and Harry.She called 1992 her “annus horribilis” when the marriages of three of her children -- Charles, Anne and Andrew -- fell apart and her castle in Windsor was badly burnt in a fire.In 1997, the queen was accused of being out of touch as her subjects wept for the death of Diana in a Paris car crash while she remained at her country estate in Scotland for days before coming to acknowledge the crowds of mourners in London.In the two decades since, though, there has been a remarkable turnaround for the monarchy -- helped along by a powerful communications machine.The queen has cut palace budgets and William’s marriage to Kate Middleton, a commoner, has helped create the image of a more modern monarchy.Charles, 66, is increasingly taking her place at public engagements but experts agree that she will most likely hold on to the end and not follow her Dutch and Spanish royal peers by abdicating.She has visited 132 countries, posed for 139 portraits and given thousands of speeches, though never an interview. Her private life is largely a mystery.The monarchy‘s official website says she still goes horse riding and has 30 Corgi dogs in her palaces.Rare indiscretions from palace insiders have revealed her love of the Racing Post newspaper’s horse racing tips, a Dubonnet and gin before lunch, and crossword puzzles.

Their estimated prices range from 3.5 million won ($2,901) to 5.5 million won per piece.They were part of art pieces that the Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation seized from Kim Min-young, a former chief of the now-bankrupt Busan Savings Bank.The paintings on silk, symbolizing the Big Dipper and several other stars in the sky, were created in 1861 at Pyochung Temple in Miryang, South Gyeongsang Province, before being enshrined at Beomeo Temple in Busan.They are presumed to have been smuggled out of the country during the chaos of the Korean society in the 1950s and 1960s.The Overseas Korean Cultural Heritage Foundation and the temple acquired three of the paintings at the Koller Auktionen in Switzerland for 78,500 Swiss francs (94 million won) in June. The paintings were enshrined the next month at a museum of the Beomeo Temple in a ceremony to mark their return after nearly 50 years.The Chilseong paintings that will be in next week's auction have the same letters that appear to be the name of a donor in a red square box at the bottom center of each painting for inscribing the archival record as the two paintings from Switzerland.""The paintings on sale are identical to the ones that returned from Switzerland in terms of the overall composition of a picture and style,"" said Jeong Woo-taek, an expert of Buddhist paintings who works for Seoul's Dongguk University.

Both parties remained adamantly against the other’s plan, while observers doubted whether the business leaders would actually appear for questioning even if included on the list. According to law, the listed witness will be jailed or fined for refusing to appear without due reasons, but most chaebol owners have defied past orders, citing business trips. The witnesses need to be notified a week before they take to the stand.The National Assembly. YonhapThe Saenuri Party plans to grill the portal giants’ chiefs -- Kim Beom-su of Daum Kakao and Lee Hae-jin of Naver. This comes after the party’s research institute published a big-data analysis on the two major portals’ newsstand. The findings suggested that the portals news sites are more in favor of the opposition than the ruling party. “Considering the influence of Internet portals on the general public, particularly the young people, it would be wrong if the portals provide people with biased information. We need to address the wrongdoings and give people accurate information,” said Saenuri chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung. The move has been met with intense criticism from the NPAD, which denounced the Saenuri Party for attempting to “tame” the Internet portals in the run-up to next year’s general election. The portals are considered to have played a significant role in swaying voters during the past elections. “It is laughable that (the Saenuri Party) thinks the portals are biased because the users come across NPAD leader Moon Jae-in’s name more often than Kim’s. Considering President Park Geun-hye’s mishandling of government affairs, it is natural that Moon’s opposition will appear more frequently,” said NPAD spokesman Kim Sung-soo. The NPAD, for its part, upped the ante against conglomerates and pledged to question them under the slogan of the party’s initiative to reform their governing structure. The Saenuri Party, however, said summoning the conglomerate owners too often was an outdated practice of parliamentary inspections. “It would be fine if the lawmakers want to hear from experts who are familiar with business operations. But it is a wrong practice to grill the conglomerate owners who know few details,” said Kim. NPAD lawmakers condemned the Saenuri Party for raising excessive and groundless objections.But Kim left open the possibility that the party would push to question Lotte Group chairman Shin Dong-bin, whose infamous succession battle with his brother caused a public uproar over the company’s management system. While Shin’s attendance at the parliamentary audit has yet to be determined, Samsung C&T; president Choi Chi-hun, SK Holdings CEO Cho Dae-sik and Hyosung Corp. president Cho Hyun-joon are on the list of those set to testify before lawmakers.By Yeo Jun suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","to grill the conglomerate owners ,audit session kicking off thursday ,business leaders in trial ,bin whose infamous succession battle ,his brother caused public uproar","['Saenuri Party', 'Naver', 'Daum Kakao', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Korea', 'the National Assembly', 'YonhapThe Saenuri Party', 'Kim Beom - su', 'Daum Kakao', 'Lee Hae - jin', 'Naver', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'the Saenuri Party', 'the Saenuri Party', 'NPAD', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Moon ’s', 'NPAD', 'Kim Sung - soo', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Kim', 'NPAD', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Kim', 'Lotte Group', 'Shin Dong - bin', 'Shin ’s', 'Choi Chi - hun', 'SK Holdings', 'Cho Dae - sik', 'Hyosung Corp.', 'Cho Hyun - joon', 'Yeo Jun']",0,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.47286978  0.5089581

Moon Jae-in (left), the leader of the opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, and ruling Saenuri Party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung sit next to each other in Jangchoong Stadium in Seoul on Wednesday. (Yonhap)The standoff over the potential reinstatement of state-published textbooks for secondary education history is expected to headline Thursday’s parliamentary audit of the Education Ministry, as the government’s self-imposed deadline to reach a decision will expire by the end of September.The debate as to whether only the government should author history textbooks ― which came up when Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea brought it up last year ― has expanded over the past few months to encompass a bipartisan feud, ideological debate and the basic question about government monopoly over educational content.In a recent interview, Hwang reiterated that students “should learn from one version of history,” which was widely interpreted as meaning state-authored textbooks. “When you look at the textbooks, some versions use different phrases for the Eulsa Treaty (between Korea and Japan), while others don’t teach it at all. How are students supposed to take a college entrance exam based on such textbooks?” he said. The Eulsa Treaty in 1905 deprived Korea of its sovereignty. Since taking office last year, the former leader of the ruling Saenuri Party has been toying with the prospect of the state exclusively authoring history textbooks for middle and high schools. Currently Korea allows eight private publishing companies to print the textbooks and certifies them if their products are up to standard, from which local schools can choose.Questions were raised over the certification system, however, in light of last year’s debacle with a textbook from Kyohak Publishing ― which was bashed for being of low quality and biased in favor of the conservatives ― coupled with the ministry’s accusation that the current textbooks omitted key facts on topics such as the 1950-53 Korean War.The debate escalated into ideological warfare, as both conservative and liberal educators accused the textbooks of depicting history in favor of the opposing side.Proponents of the state history textbooks have claimed that having just one book that is unbiased can eliminate ideological feuds stemming from different interpretations of facts.“We need a state-authored history textbook rooted in the facts that have a neutral view (of history), so that students would not be confused by an education based on lopsided historical viewpoints,” Saenuri Chairman Kim Moo-sung said last week at the National Assembly. He said that “self-depreciative” interpretation of Korea’s modern history “must be eradicated,” and the country needs a positive view.But those opposing the state history textbooks said the system will give the government the power to enforce its own views on students.Rep. Moon Jae-in, leader of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, said that attempts to reinstate the state textbooks is against the very idea of democracy. He said that Kim’s argument about “self-depreciative historical view” is reminiscent of an argument made by the far-right in Japan, who were accused of whitewashing Japan’s crimes during World War II.“Historians oppose state textbooks, because a monolithic point of view cannot induce creative thought. ... Instead of trying to control the people, (the government) should bring them together,” he said. Rep. Youn Kwan-suk of the NPAD likened the process to a dictatorship. “Former President Park Chung-hee’s regime switched the history textbook publishing system from certification to state-authorship to justify his dictatorship,” he said. “We must retain the current system, as state textbooks are highly likely to cater to the demands of those in power.”On Friday, 13 commemorative bodies of Korea’s independence movement from Japan held a joint news conference to oppose the state history textbooks. Descendants of Korean freedom fighters ― including the son of Chang Chun-ha and grandson of Ji Cheong-cheon ― were also present.“The government must cease all efforts to reinstate a state textbook system, unless it seeks to use history education as a tool for its benefit,” they said. Educators across the country released their thoughts as well, although the opposing side is far more vocal on the controversial issue as of now. On Wednesday, the 2,255 members of the Association of Korean History Teachers jointly released a statement against state history textbooks. The AKHT and six other local societies related to history and history education held a joint news conference Monday to denounce the government’s attempt to bring back state-published textbooks. The groups said that they analyzed the history textbook for fifth graders ― elementary school history textbooks are authored by the government ― and found 150 errors, claiming that their discovery demonstrates the problem with the state-published textbooks.“Champions of the state textbooks say that teaching a single version of history is important. Even if we say that is true, who will take responsibility if that single version is proven to be wrong?” said Lee Jun-shik of the Institute for Research in Collaborationist Activities who participated in the analysis. ”The ministry sure won’t, nor will the writing staff. And the harm (from the textbook) is inflicted on the students.”Cho Han-kyung, the leader of the AHKT, said it is hard to motivate the writing staff for the state-authored textbooks to improve the quality of their book when they face no competition from other publishers. “A private publisher whose product has this many errors (as the state textbook) would be forced out of the market,” he said.Last week, 34 professors of history-related departments at Seoul National University visited the Education Ministry decrying the government’s move.“The fundamental problem is that the government will be able to monopolize the contents of history textbooks. ... If the ministry has issues with different terminology in textbooks, they can just mend the guidelines and standards for the certified textbooks,” they said in the statement. The Korea Federation of Teachers’ Association, the nation’s largest right-leaning teachers’ body, has yet to formally comment on the issue, but said it will release a statement later in the month.KFTA spokesman Kim Dong-seok said that the group fundamentally agrees with the ministry’s statement that students need to learn a single version of history, and added that various side effects from having different publishing systems should also be taken into account. “While we cannot say for now whether or not we agree with the state history textbooks, we agree that the ministry should take a bigger role.

264,264,Murders among romantic partners on rise in South Korea,"In May, the discovery of a young woman’s body packed into a suitcase buried under cement in the hills in Jecheon, North Chungcheong Province, left South Korea in shock and horror. 　The 26-year-old, surnamed Kim, was murdered by her 24-year-old boyfriend, who allegedly killed her while drunk after she tried to break up with him.

The 26-year-old, surnamed Kim, was murdered by her 24-year-old boyfriend, who allegedly killed her while drunk after she tried to break up with him. The boyfriend, only identified by his surname Lee, impersonated Kim on social media for two weeks after killing her and disposing of her body.According to Rep. Jeong Yong-ki of the ruling Saenuri Party, the number of murder cases among dating partners has been on the rise in Korea since 2012, from 99 to 108 last year. In the last three years, the number of victims like Kim totaled 313. A research also showed that 40 percent of the Korean women who experienced dating abuse for the first time chose to stay in the relationship, despite the possibility of continuing violence. (123RF)The murder cases accounted for 11.9 percent of all crimes committed by the victims’ romantic partners against them, including stalking, physical violence and rape. The rate is particularly high considering the total number of murder cases in Korea only accounted for 1.69 percent of all violent crimes -- murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault -- in the same period.“This means two people are being killed by their romantic partners every week,” Rep. Jeong said.According to Korea Women’s Hotline, a nongovernmental organization helping female victims of violence, at least 114 Korean women were killed by either their husbands or boyfriends last year, while at least 95 women survived after being seriously attacked by their spouses or romantic partners. Almost 90 percent of women who participated in the NGO’s research last year said they had been either physically or emotionally abused while dating or during courtship. From 2011 to 2013, some 20,500 individuals were arrested for dating violence. According to the police, Kim had also reportedly endured serious dating violence for about a year until she tried to end things with Lee. According to local news reports, Lee would often break into Kim’s house without consent for “not picking up his calls” and physically abuse her. Lee later confessed to the police that he killed Kim “in a fit of rage” when he learned that Kim wanted to break up with him. Kim and Lee had met as teacher and student at a private English institution in Busan, where Kim had been teaching upon returning to Korea after graduating from the State University of New York at Albany.Kim’s story overlaps with experiences of many women who participated in researcher Lee Hwa-young’s study for Korea Women’s Hotline. Many suffered abuse, assault and rape when they tried to end the relationship.One of the victims had been dragged to a motel room against her will and raped there by her enraged boyfriend, right after she told him that she wanted to break up with him. Another victim had been guilt-tripped and emotionally abused after she tried to end things with her boyfriend. “He told me that I’m being a terrible person (by trying to break up with him) to his mother as well, because he already told her that we are getting married and our breakup is going to hurt and disappoint her badly,” the victim told researcher Lee in her study.Another victim was stunned by what a police officer told her after she reported her ex. She also had been stalked and physically abused by her ex after breaking up with him. The officer reportedly told her: “You shouldn’t have been so harsh when you broke up with him.”According to Safe Harbors of the Finger Lakes, an American support organization for victims of violence, there are some characteristics that are common to abusers of dating violence. One of them has to do with gender role expectations. Many individuals who abuse their romantic partners tend to have certain ideas of how men and women should act, largely following the stereotypical ideas of male dominance and female passivity. The abusers also may have difficulty expressing feelings, abuse alcohol and be “protective of their romantic partners to the point of controlling that person,” according to the organization. Local experts say that popular culture and sex education are some of the biggest -- and often negative -- influences in gender role expectations among Koreans, which sometimes cause problematic consequences in relationships.“For example, there are so many Korean TV dramas that show its male protagonist forcing a kiss onto his love interest, while the woman just docilely accepts it,” researcher Lee from Korea Women’s Hotline told The Korea Herald. “Many men, especially teenagers, may think this is normal and acceptable behavior. It does not only apply to men. While men may think it’s acceptable to kiss or touch someone against the person’s will -- or it’s not ‘manly enough’ or ‘cool’ to even ask the woman for consent -- young women may think they should just remain silent even if their dating partner does something they don’t want or like, or keep their wants to themselves and wait until the man makes the move.”Meanwhile, the Education Ministry’s recently issued -- and heavily criticized -- guidelines for sex education famously stated that “date rape can occur in situations where a man spends a lot of money on dates, as it is natural for him to want commensurate compensation from the woman.” Lee’s research also showed that 40 percent of the women who experienced dating abuse for the first time chose to stay in the relationship, despite the possibility of continuing violence. The largest portion of them, 60 percent, said it was because the abuse was not “serious enough” to end the relationship. Rep. Jeong said the government needs to be more involved in combating dating and domestic violence. Introducing heavier penalties for stalking, which often leads to more serious forms of abuse, can be one of the ways to improve the situation, according to civic experts. In Korea, the heaviest penalty a stalker can face is a fine of 100,000 won ($83).Since 2012, two bills have been proposed to introduce heavier punishment for stalking, but are still pending at the National Assembly for approval.

(Yonhap)Seoul High Court on Friday suspended the sentence of Seoul education superintendent Cho Hi-yeon, who was accused of conducting a smear campaign against his rival candidate in last year’s election.The ruling would allow him to retain his post if confirmed. If a person whose sentence has been suspended commits no further offenses for two years, his or her charges are expunged under Korean law.While the appellate court found Cho partially guilty of spreading false rumors against opposing candidate Koh Seung-duk, it said Cho’s actions had little effect on the outcome of the election. “(Cho’s actions) were to verify (Koh’s) qualifications as a public official, and cannot be regarded as malicious propaganda aiming to defame him,” the court said in its ruling.After the ruling, Cho told the reporters that the ruling showed that appropriate accusations concerning a candidate’s qualification should be respected. But he added that his actions should have been more prudent, and offered an apology to Koh. The prosecution, on the other hand, vowed to appeal the case, saying it could not comprehend how the court came to such a decision.Cho had been accused by local prosecutors of spreading false rumors about Koh’s children having U.S. green cards to derail his campaign during their race for the capital’s top educator post. In April, a lower court ruling had fined Cho 5 million won ($4,189) for violating the election law, which would have stripped Cho of his post if upheld. Cho’s legal representatives had claimed that his accusation did not play a crucial part in the election, and that Koh’s own family feud was what made him lose.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","friday suspended the sentence ,seoul high court on friday ,court on friday suspended the ,candidate in last year election ,high court on friday suspended","['Seoul', 'Cho Hi - yeon', 'Seoul High Court', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Cho Hi - yeon', 'korean', 'Cho', 'Koh Seung - duk', 'Cho ’s', 'Cho', 'Koh ’s', 'Cho', 'Koh', 'Cho', 'Koh ’s', 'U.S.', 'Cho', 'Cho ’s', 'Koh ’s']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3001048   0.23501419

Under SOFA, which governs the legal status of some 28,500 U.S. troops stationed across the southern part of the peninsula, South Korea can primarily invoke judicial power when a serviceman is implicated in crimes, except while on duty. But authorities here have frequently not exercised it, opting to hand over the cases to the U.S. The Lawyers for a Democratic Society, better known as Minbyun, raised a suit calling for the Justice Ministry to release all the cases since 2001 that the U.S. requested South Korea to transfer, as well as their results. The ministry has kept the data undisclosed, citing diplomatic relations. A lower administrative court decided in December that a revelation of the information is unlikely to infringe on critical national interests because it concerns “operation and management of an existing system” and many records and statistics are already available. Overturning the verdict, the Seoul High Court said there is a “considerable” possibility that the exposure of all demanded data will affect the relationship with Washington and harm national interests. Yet it allowed the release of information on a 2012 case in which seven U.S. military police officers arrested in handcuffs three South Korean civilians near their base in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, citing that the prosecution had already made most of it public. “With SOFA being an accord that the two countries forged taking into account the distinctiveness of U.S. troops here, as well as diplomatic ties, in the face of the inter-Korean confrontation, the requested information has its implications, even though it may merely mean statistics,” judge Hwang Byung-ha said. “There are also concerns that North Korea or its sympathetic parties could take advantage of the information.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","handcuffs three south korean civilians ,an appeals court ruled tuesday ,seven military police officers arrested ,arrested in handcuffs three south ,appeals court ruled tuesday that","['U.S.', 'South Korea', 'SOFA', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'the U.S.', 'Democratic', 'Minbyun', 'the Justice Ministry', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'the Seoul High Court', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'south korean', 'Pyeongtaek', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'SOFA', 'U.S.', 'inter - korean', 'Hwang Byung - ha', 'North Korea', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",18,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.00572833 0.67639488 0.28058586]

Prosecutors said Monday they are looking at the schedule to call in the 67-year-old chairman for questioning. (Yonhap)The summon comes six months after the prosecution launched its probe into POSCO’s alleged corruption cases including suspicious mergers and acquisitions, tax evasion and setting up slush funds. Chung is suspected of masterminding dubious M&A; deals during his term as chairman between 2009 and 2014, which allegedly caused great financial loss to POSCO. The most controversial case involves Sungin Geotec, from which POSCO purchased shares in 2010 well over market value. Chung will also be questioned whether he played a role in giving Dongyang Construction overseas projects initiated by POSCO during his term. The prosecution suspects the subcontractor of having created slush funds for the steelmaker and its affiliates in return for the deals. Chung also allegedly exerted undue influence in getting his relative a job as a high-level official at Kosteel, a partner company of POSCO. Kosteel has been suspected of helping POSCO evade taxes by doctoring transaction records and creating slush funds. If the allegations are proven to be true, he could face breach-of-duty charges. An official from the prosecution said that Chung could be summoned for one more grilling session given the amount of evidence and testimonies to look into. The probe has dragged on as the court rejected prosecutors’ multiple requests for arrest warrants for former POSCO vice chairman Chung Dong-hwa and Bae Sung-ro, ex-chairman of Dongyang Constructions. The probe into POSCO came in line with the prosecution’s widening investigation into the former Lee Myung-bak administration’s “energy diplomacy,” which encouraged Korean companies to take part in overseas projects to secure energy resources. But the resource drive has faced criticism for allegedly wasting taxpayers’ money, with some funds thought to be lost in corruption.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","six months after the prosecution ,prosecutors multiple requests for arrest ,its affiliates prosecutors said monday ,ongoing probe into alleged corruption ,months after the prosecution launched","['POSCO', 'Chung Joon - yang', 'POSCO', 'Chung', 'POSCO', 'Sungin Geotec', 'posco', 'Chung', 'Dongyang Construction', 'posco', 'Chung', 'Kosteel', 'POSCO', 'posco', 'Chung', 'posco', 'Chung Dong - hwa', 'Bae Sung - ro', 'Dongyang Constructions', 'POSCO', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'korean', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.10728578  0.38606384

The Daegu District Court handed down a six-year jail term to a 28-year-old Lee, who held a managerial position in the group, convicting him of opening call centers in China and South Korea and systematically making random calls to South Korean citizens to swindle money.Two others, surnamed Moon and Won, were also given five years and four years and half behind the bars, respectively, for their roles in managing the syndicate.The three and 32 others involved were indicted on charges of siphoning some 1.34 billion won ($1.1 million) from over 300 victims between February 2012 and September 2013.They fooled the victims by saying they would help them get loans with better credit ratings and demanded cash cards with the account number and password written on them. Then, the group convinced the victims to transfer money to the account, saying it was necessary for the process.The group was found to have delegated different roles based on teams, such as a team in charge of obtaining the cash cards and a team focused on withdrawing money.""Considering the committed crimes were done systematically with hierarchical order within the group, the crime syndicate charge can be applied,"" Judge Yeom Kyung-ho said. The judge pointed out the group members had a common goal to swindle money, didn't have the freedom to leave the group, and had their own punishment system, explaining why it could be deemed a crime syndicate. The ruling is the first of its kind for a phone-based scam group. Previously, only fraud charges were applied.As they are now acknowledged as a crime syndicate, just by joining the group or cooperating with it, a person can receive a criminal penalty.A total of 35,859 voice phishing cases occurred in 2014, compared with 22,351 recorded in 2012, according to the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

The OPLAN 5015 was formulated last June to replace OPLAN 5027 by the chairmen of the two countries’ Joint Chiefs of Staff. The allies have, since 1974, been assessing their joint defense plan every year, primarily to devise better responses to North Korea’s military threats. “It is the first time that the OPLAN has dealt with the concept of a preemptive strike,” a military source said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.The updated scheme, which has already come into force, will allow the allies to consider a preemptive strike aimed at terminating WMDs such as atomic bombs, missiles and biological and chemical weapons when signs of their imminent use are detected from the North. They are believed to have been carrying out the joint Ulchi Guardian Freedom exercise under the scenario, focusing on minimizing damage in case of Pyongyang’s use of a biochemical weapon. “The plan was revised as part of the two countries’ annual efforts to reflect the threats we face, and they usually examine if there is any need to adjust their strategies after the UFG ends every year,” another official told The Korea Herald on condition of anonymity.Seoul’s Defense Ministry declined to confirm the report, citing classified operational strategies. “Any revelation of our military’s operational plan does not contribute to not only our security, but also national interest,” it said in a statement. The discovery came after cross-border tensions flared to the verge of an armed conflict, with the two Koreas trading fire and the North declaring a “quasi-state of war” and putting frontline forces in full combat readiness. But Defense Minister Han Min-koo sought to decouple the latest crisis and the OPLAN update, noting that any change in the war plan could reflect the U.S.’ overall military cutbacks in the face of its budget woes and resulting the sequestration. “The two countries update their joint defense plan every year and maintain close coordination at all times,” he said during parliamentary questioning Tuesday. “There have been calls for an OPLAN review given the changing situation on the U.S. part including the Army scale back and the sequester, but the North’s semi-war state declaration and any immediate OPLAN amendment are separate issues.”By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","formulated last june to replace ,joint defense plan every year ,5015 was formulated last june ,defense plan every year primarily ,last june to replace oplan","['South Korea', 'U.S.', '’ Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'North Korea ’s', 'OPLAN', 'Pyongyang', 'UFG', 'the Korea Herald', 'Seoul ’s Defense Ministry', 'Koreas', 'Defense', 'Han Min - koo', 'OPLAN', 'U.S.', 'OPLAN', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'North ’s', 'OPLAN', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46769282  0.47356483

The Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office indicted the 29-year-old suspect, whose identification was withheld, on charges of allegedly providing fake immigration documents to 12 job-seeking Egyptians and supporting them to enter fraudulently as refugees. He and his Korean accomplice were found to have received up to $10,000 per person in return, they added. Of the 12 illegal entrants, nine applied for the refugee status by falsely stating they were fleeing their country to avoid persecution. The other three disappeared immediately after arriving here, investigators said. This marks the first case in which a refugee broker was caught here.Under the Korean refugee law, refugee status can be granted to foreigners who are likely be persecuted on account of nationality, race, religion, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. After joining the U.N. Refugee Convention in 1992, South Korea became the first Asian country to enact an independent refugee law in July 2013.Since the refugee law went into effect, the number of refugee status requests per year has tripled to about 3,000. By July, the year’s number had already exceeded 2,600, they added.The Korea Immigration Office suspects that over 80 percent of the refugee status-seekers are fake, the authorities said.“The number of Egyptian refugee status applications is on the rise, with the majority seeking jobs here. Many cases are found to be those abusing the refugee law that does not force deportation against their will,” immigration office officials said. Foreigners under fears of persecution are allowed to apply for refugee status at an airport or seaport upon arrival. They are also allowed to work here if the refugee screening takes over six months. Various benefits are also provided, ranging from education and job training to medical services. As the government has tightened the refugee screening, the acceptance rate plummeted from 20 percent to around 4 percent in recent years. This year, only 51 foreigners or 1.9 percent were accepted as refugees, officials said.

Kim Moo-sung (second from right) and floor leader Rep. Won Yoo-chul at Cheong Wa Dae on Wednesday. (Yonhap)Park’s rare invitation was seen as an attempt to restore ties with the party and to bring her reform drive back on track after a breakthrough in inter-Korean ties. This was the second such luncheon to be hosted by Park since her inauguration.Relations between Cheong Wa Dae and the governing party had been sour and climaxed last month when Park rebuked the party for failing to support her policies, effectively demanding the resignation of then-floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min. Yoo stepped down several days later, as the party scurried to mend ties with the president. Yoo was also present at Wednesday’s luncheon. Park wants to reform the nation’s four major sectors -- public service, labor, education and finance -- in a three-year economic plan that began last year. Observers say that she may feel under pressure as she has already passed the midway point of her single, five-year term, which ends in early 2018.The president has been reiterating that the reform plan should be completed within this year as politicians’ attention shifts to next year’s general election. “Now we have a big task called labor reform,” she said. “I ask you to lead the way to solve this issue for the economy and for future generations.”Park said earlier this month that she had put labor reform at the top of her state agenda, and that she would aggressively push for flexibility in the labor market. The Park administration sees the local job market as overprotective of employees and discouraging for companies to hire more.The remark was delivered on the same day that Federation of Korean Trade Unions, a labor umbrella group, announced its return to a tripartite committee. The panel, which consists of three representatives from labor, government and business, is expected to soon resume its stalled negotiations on a compromise on contentious labor issues.As soon as the representatives reach an agreement, rival parties are expected to lock horns over the bill. By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","labor reform initiative at luncheon ,ruling party lawmakers wednesday calling ,luncheon for ruling party lawmakers ,also present at wednesday luncheon ,lawmakers wednesday calling the task","['Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park', 'Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'National Security Office', 'Kim Kwan - jin', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Won Yoo', 'inter - korean', 'Park', 'Park', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Yoo', 'Yoo', 'Park', 'Federation of Korean Trade Unions', 'Cho Chung - un']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38162974  0.08334891

The broadcasts and wartime declaration came to an end at noon, hours after the two sides clinched a six-point agreement in which Pyongyang displayed regret over a recent land mine blasts in the Demilitarized Zone and ensuing wounds on two South Korean soldiers in return for Seoul’s conditional cessation of loudspeaker operations. A soldier turns off the power switch for the loudspeakers installed along the border Tuesday at 12 noon. (Joint Chiefs of Staff)They also agreed to hold formal talks in Seoul or Pyongyang “at an early date” to explore ways to mend their ties and have a working-level meeting in early September to arrange a fresh round of reunions of separated families in time for the Chuseok holidays at the end of the month. The announcement followed 43 hours of negotiations that kicked off Saturday. Kim Kwan-jin, chief of Cheong Wa Dae’s National Security Office, and Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo sat face-to-face with Hwang Pyong-so, vice chairman of the North’s National Defense Commission and director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People’s Army, and Kim Yang-gon, director of the North’s United Front Department and a secretary of the ruling Workers’ Party’s Central Committee, in the border village of Panmunjeom until early Tuesday. “We focused on extracting an apology for the land mine provocation and other recent incidents by North Korea as the subject (of the talks), and a promise to prevent a recurrence, which in fact resulted in protracted negotiations,” Kim Kwan-jin said at a news conference at Cheong Wa Dae. “But the reason why we ceaselessly called for preventive steps was that otherwise, there would be one provocation threatening public safety after another -- we would not have been able to break the vicious circle.” But criticism lingers over Seoul’s failure to include in the accord a clear articulation of apology and preventive measures, as well as who is to blame for the mine explosions. Seoul officials defended themselves by saying that the word “regret” had never been stipulated in any past inter-Korean statements, while the caveat attached -- “unless any abnormal situation takes place” -- ensured that the propaganda broadcasts could be resumed at any time if the communist country staged a provocation in the future. In an apparent attempt to play down the show of regret, the North’s Hwang Pyong-so later in the day repeated Pyongyang’s denial of responsibility for the recent series of its provocations, saying that Seoul fabricated “groundless incidents” and only escalated tensions that could induce an armed clash.“Through the urgent talks, the South Korean authorities should have realized that its fabrication of groundless incidents and unilateral judgment and behavior would only heighten tensions and could give rise to a military confrontation,” he said in an interview with the North’s Korean Central TV as he assessed the outcome of the talks.“But we think that it is a relief that our joint efforts set the mood for the improvement of inter-Korean relations,” he was quoted as adding.The delegates of the two Koreas pose after their marathon talks at the border village of Panmunjeom on Tuesday. From left are Seoul's Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo; Kim Kwan-jin, chief of Cheong Wa Dae’s National Security Office; Hwang Pyong-so, vice chairman of the North’s National Defense Commission and director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People’s Army; and Kim Yang-gon, director of the North’s United Front Department and a secretary of the ruling Workers’ Party’s Central Committee. (Unification Ministry)Following an 11-year break, the broadcasts were restarted on Aug. 11 along the Military Demarcation Line in retaliation for the Aug. 4 explosion of three mines suspected to have been buried by North Korean soldiers who illegally crossed the border. The blast inflicted serious injuries on the legs of two South Korean Army staff sergeants. After North Korean leader Kim Jong-un declared a “quasi-state of war” last Thursday, his military put frontline troops in full combat readiness, sharply beefed up artillery forces and forward-deployed a majority of its submarines and other offensive assets. Signs of de-escalation showed soon after the deal, as some of the submarines that had left their bases appeared to have returned, Defense Ministry spokesperson Kim Min-seok said. Seoul’s military officials had expressed concerns on Sunday that they were unable to locate about 50 undersea vehicles, or 70 percent of the North’s submarine fleet. While welcoming the breakthrough, the South Korean military remained cautious, saying it was maintaining maximum readiness, which it would adjust according to the North’s movements. U.S. Forces Korea are likely to take similar steps before lowering their Watch Condition level. Defense Minister Han Min-koo convened two separate meetings Tuesday to discuss follow-up measures with top military commanders and ministry and Joint Chiefs of Staff executives. “Even if the North does rescind the semi-war state, it will take a considerable amount of time and effort to bring the already deployed frontline artillery and other military forces back to normal,” Kim said at a news briefing. “Our military will flexibly downgrade its readiness, taking into account the level of threat from North Korea.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","koreas pose after their marathon ,taking steps tuesday to defuse ,over recent land mine blasts ,negotiations that kicked off saturday ,koreas began taking steps tuesday","['Koreas', 'anti - pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'south korean', 'Seoul', 'Joint Chiefs of staff)they', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Kim Kwan - jin', 'Cheong', 'National Security Office', 'Unification', 'Hong Yong - pyo', 'Hwang Pyong - so', 'the North ’s National Defense Commission', 'the General Political Bureau', 'the Korean People ’s Army', 'Kim Yang - gon', 'the North ’s United Front Department', 'Workers ’ Party ’s Central Committee', 'North Korea', 'Kim Kwan - jin', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'inter - korean', 'Hwang Pyong - so', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'the North ’s Korean Central TV', 'inter - korean', 'Koreas', 'Panmunjeom', 'Seoul', 'Hong Yong - pyo', 'Kim Kwan - jin', 'Cheong', 'National Security Office', 'Hwang Pyong - so', 'the North ’s National Defense Commission', 'the General Political Bureau', 'the Korean People ’s Army', 'Kim Yang - gon', 'the North ’s United Front Department', 'Workers ’ Party ’s Central Committee', 'the Military Demarcation Line', 'north korean', 'south korean Army', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Defense Ministry', 'Kim Min -', 'Seoul', 'North ’s', 'south korean', 'North ’s', 'U.S. Forces Korea', 'Watch Condition', 'Han Min - koo', 'Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'Kim', 'North Korea', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4924494   0.66701049

Seoul Central District Court ruled the 45-year-old was innocent based on a unanimous jury decision. Under the law, the jury’s decision is not legally binding but the court is required to respect it. Jeon was suspected of attempting to rape her lover after he ended the relationship by drugging him and tying up his legs and arms last year. She was the first woman to be charged with attempted rape after the criminal law was expanded to apply not only male offenders but also female attackers in June 2013. She was also accused of hitting him with a hammer when he woke up. While Jeon, who reportedly suffers from a mild intellectual disability, admitted that she had given the defendant a sleeping pill, tied him up and hit him with a hammer, she claimed that she did not attempt to rape him. She added that hitting him with the hammer was an act of self-defense, claiming that he had habitually abused her.The nine jury members made a unanimous decision in Jeon’s favor, saying that her accuser’s testimony was not credible enough. Her accuser, for instance, gave detailed testimonies of the situation despite claiming to have been drugged. The court also took into account that it would be difficult for Jeon, weighing 44 kilograms, to have lifted the drugged defendant upright as he had claimed.Prosecutors will decide soon whether to appeal, the authorities said.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","female attackers in june 2013 ,female attackers in june ,woman charged with attempted rape ,also female attackers in june ,first woman to be charged","['Korea', 'Seoul Central District Court', 'Jeon', 'Jeon ’s', 'Jeon', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44951585  0.08788981

Han Myeong-sook of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy for bribery, effectively concluding a five-year-long legal battle between the nation’s first female prime minister and the prosecution.The 71-year-old Han, who served as the nation’s second-in-command from 2006 to 2007, was indicted in 2010 for allegedly receiving some 900 million won ($760,000) in illicit political funds from a 53-year-old man who ran a local construction company.Han Myeong-sook (Yonhap)She was cleared of the charges in a preliminary trial in 2011 after the witness reversed his testimony about giving the kickback, which was the key evidence behind Han’s indictment. But the Seoul High Court in 2013 overturned the decision and sentenced her to two years imprisonment in addition to paying 880 million won in restitution, saying despite the apparent flip-flop testimony, circumstantial evidence points to Han being guilty. Han appealed the verdict.In its ruling, the Supreme Court said it was reasonable to believe that Han had received the money, given that her sister had used part of the funds -- a 100 million won check -- to lease an apartment. The ruling will strip Han of her seat in the National Assembly, as well as bar her from running for a parliamentary seat for the next 10 years. She will also become the first South Korean former premier to be put behind bars. “I will comply with the ruling, but regrettably cannot accept it. The law, which should be fair, is being swayed by those in power,” Han said in a news conference at the National Assembly. Han and other members of the opposition have accused President Park Geun-hye’s administration of gunning down her political rivals, particularly those who had been in the inner circles of former President Roh Moo-hyun.“I hope the political retribution that started with President Roh will end with Han Myeong-sook,” she said. NPAD leader Moon Jae-in expressed his regret about the ruling and added the party is certain that Han is innocent. “There is no one who gave the money, or received the money, yet the court concluded (she was) guilty. This is very far from the justice and common sense widely accepted by the people,” he said at the news conference.He said most of the ruling party politicians accused of receiving bribes from deceased businessman Sung Woan-jong were cleared of charges, saying that both the prosecution and the court is being pressured by those in power. Moon also vowed that his party would go all-out to reform the legal system to make it free from outside influence. Current law stipulates that justices of the Supreme Court are pointed by the president with parliamentary consent. Han’s downfall is likely to be a major setback to the already-wavering NPAD. Including her, 10 of its incumbent lawmakers are being probed, indicted, or under trial. Earlier this month, former NPAD floor leader Park Ki-choon was arrested for allegedly receiving illegal political funds. Kim Han-gil, former chairman of the party, is also set to be summoned by the prosecution for his supposed connection to a corruption case.Reiterating that the administration was using the legal system to bring down Park’s political rivals, Rep. Lee Jong-kul, the floor leader for the NPAD, said that the recent corruption probe is “a suppression of the opposition” by the government, vowing that his party would fight on.The ruling Saenuri Party, however, said that the prosecution and the court are acting solely based on law and principle, and that the opposition’s claims of an oppression are merely excuses for its wrongdoing. Han, formerly a prominent women’s rights activist, was named the country’s premier by former President Roh Moo-hyun in 2006. She also served as the leader of the Democratic United Party, a forerunner of the NPAD, in 2012.

Kim Tae-won of the ruling Saenuri Party and Rep. Yoon Hu-duk of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy came under fire for allegedly using their parliamentary clout to give their kids job opportunities at Korean Government Legal Service and the nation’s top display-maker LG Display, respectivelyDespite their plea of innocence and attempt to downplay their behavior, the public has criticized them amid the country’s surging youth unemployment rate and declining job security.Kim, denying the allegation, said he would resign from his seat if it was found true. Yoon said he merely made a phone call to “check on” her own daughter’s resume. Rep. Kim Tae-won of the ruling Saenuri Party. (Yonhap)The rival parties’ websites soon became inundated with criticisms against the politicians working under the slogan of creating more jobs for the youth, while giving back-door access to their own kids.Some comments even associated the case with “eum-seo,” an ancient hiring system of government officials during the Goryeo and Joseon kingdoms of pre-modern Korea. Under the system, aristocrats’ offspring were allowed to become public servants without going through the excruciating exams that average citizens had to take. The system has been used to give extra benefits to the children of aristocrats. Faced with the public uproar, the two parties have set out to address the issue and prepare measures. Saenuri Party Rep. Hong Il-pyo urged the National Assembly to pass a law that allows for swift punishment of lawmakers who are involved with such irregularities. NPAD Rep. Lee Sang-min, chair of the Assembly’s Legislation and Judiciary Committee, said in an interview with local media outlets that lawmakers should revise the anti-graft bill, also known as the Kim Young-ran bill, to prevent conflict of interest among high-profile officials.Critics, however, said that signing new legislation or strongly enforcing relevant laws would be a temporary fix and not enough to prevent the occurrence of similar political scandals that have been prevalent and commonplace in Korea through the decades. “I think the scandal is more of a moral case, rather than a legal one,” said Seol Dong-hoon, sociology professor at Chonnam National University. “If we try to apply laws to the scandal, the lawmakers could be proven not guilty and get away with it,” Seol said. “Considering the lack of governing rules that can apply to these kinds of scandals, the most efficient way to prevent them from happening again is to relay the case to the voters and tell them not to vote for those lawmakers,” said Seol.Other experts attributed the scandal to the lack of political progress that lags behinds the nation’s economic development. Kim Joong-baeck, sociology professor at KyungHee University, pointed out that politicians should come up with strategy and leadership corresponding to Korea’s post-democratization era.“In Korea’s political landscape, I am not sure how many politicians would be immune to the all-out enforcement of the antigraft bill. What is worse, no matter how effective the bill is, some politicians would remain unscathed and come back to the political scene as long as they are elected,” said Kim. “I believe the issue is what we face after achieving economic development and rudimentary democracy. Compared to our remarkable economic success, we lack solid and sophisticated democratic rules. Politicians should develop specific policies and proactive leadership to address such a delicate issue,” said Kim. By Yeo Jun-suk (jasnoyeo@heraldcorp.com)","criticisms against the politicians working ,to the scandal the lawmakers ,with criticisms against the politicians ,excruciating exams that average citizens ,public uproar the two parties","['Kim Tae - won', 'Saenuri Party', 'Yoon Hu - duk', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Korean Government Legal Service', 'LG Display', 'Kim', 'Yoon', 'Kim Tae - won', 'Saenuri Party', 'Korea', 'Saenuri Party', 'Hong Il - pyo', 'the National Assembly', 'Lee Sang - min', 'the Assembly ’s Legislation and Judiciary Committee', 'Kim Young - ran', 'Korea', 'Seol Dong - hoon', 'Chonnam National University', 'Seol', 'Seol', 'Kim Joong - baeck', 'KyungHee University', 'Korea ’s', 'Korea', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",1,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.74961513  0.5261693

""The government is closely watching to see what might have happened to him.""An official at Seoul's spy agency said he cannot confirm the speculation.If confirmed, the case adds to a series of high-profile execution of North Korean ranking military and other officials, including the North's former defense chief Hyon Yong-chol.Hyon is believed to have been executed with an anti-aircraft gun in April for his disloyalty toward Kim as he dozed off during a military event.In late 2013, Kim Jong-un ordered the execution of Jang Song-thaek, the husband of Kim's aunt and once the country's second most powerful figure, on charges of treason.The National Intelligence Service earlier said that the North Korean leader has tightened the grip on his power base in a brutal way, including the execution of about 70 senior officials.Choe, who has served as the vice premier since June 2014, represented the North's delegation in inter-Korean economic talks in Seoul in 2005.

She added that she would seek to annul the city’s plan to use the revenue for a project encompassing areas outside Gangnam-gu without “due process of gathering opinions of the autonomous district.”In June, Hyundai Motor Group offered the city 1.7 trillion won ($1.1 billion) as a public contribution fee after it bought the 79,345-square-meter site in Gangnam-gu from Korea Electronic Power Corp. for 10.55 trillion won. The stakeholder must pay the public contribution fee to change the legal use of the land. Hyundai has requested the city to change the purpose of the land use from “general residential” to “commercial.”Hyundai has proposed to build a 115-story headquarters and a 62-story hotel and convention, in line with Seoul City’s pledge to turn the neighborhood into a MICE zone, referring to meetings, incentive tours, conventions and exhibitions.To further develop the project, the city has said it would expand the plan by developing the adjacent Jamsil Sports Complex area in Songpa-gu. Gangnam-gu Office has opposed it, claiming that the use of contribution fee should be prioritized on Gangnam-gu, as the land comes from the district.The city argues that the MICE project included both districts from the start regardless of the Hyundai’s contribution fee, and that the plan is not finalized.Seoul City also stressed that the amount of the public contribution fee had not been settled as the talks underway with Hyundai are to be concluded by year-end.

The Daegu High Court found the 49-year-old not guilty of robbery and rape charges, citing lack of evidence, in the case investigated 13 years after the crime was committed. “The testimonies made by eyewitnesses have many contradictory points, making them not valuable as evidence,” the court said.  The Sri Lankan man charged with robbing and raping an 18-year-old South Korean girl enters the Daegu High Court on Tuesday. (Yonhap)The court did not rule out the possibility that the Sri Lankan raped her alone or with accomplices, given that the man’s sperm was found on the underwear of the victim, named Chung Eun-hye. But even if the Sri Lankan committed the crime, he cannot be punished due to the expiration of the 10-year statute of limitations, the court added. The Sri Lankan was suspected of taking Chung, who was intoxicated and on her way home from university, to an expressway overpass in Daegu to rape and rob her there with two others in October 1998.The two suspected Sri Lankan accomplices to the crime returned to their country in 2001 and 2005, respectively. Chung died after being hit by a 25-ton truck. At the time, the police had obtained her underwear some 30 meters away from the scene, but concluded the case as only a death by car accident. The police reopened the probe in 2011 after it found that the Sri Lankan’s DNA matched the semen found on Chung’s underwear. The DNA result came after the Sri Lankan was arrested in a separate prostitution-related case. The prosecution set up a task force and focused on proving his guilt, securing testimony on how the Sri Lankan first met Chung and what happened right before the victim died in a car crash.The lower court acquitted him of the charges, citing insufficient evidence. The prosecution had sought life imprisonment. The victim’s family, meanwhile, expressed outrage over the verdict and the direction of the probe that ruled out the possibility of a third suspect.The family has claimed the prosecution had unreasonably pushed for the investigation to “justify” its accusations against the Sri Lankan despite uncertainty over who committed the crime. “We don’t even have the energy anymore to protest the way the investigation was conducted,” a family member told local news media.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","overpass in daegu to rape ,old korean girl in 1998 ,lankan man charged with robbing ,guilty of robbery and rape ,south korean appeals court tuesday","['south korean', 'Sri Lankan', 'korean', 'Daegu High Court', 'Sri Lankan', 'south korean', 'Daegu High Court', 'Sri Lankan', 'Chung Eun - hye', 'Sri Lankan', 'Sri Lankan', 'Chung', 'Daegu', 'Sri Lankan', 'Chung', 'the Sri Lankan ’s', 'Chung', 'Sri Lankan', 'Chung', 'Sri Lankan', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",9,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.25104669 0.22131301 0.52365667]

The events include an art exhibition, a chorus performance, a peace-themed concert and a program in which overseas Koreans can learn about unification issues.“We will not be able to hold any joint events on Liberation Day itself as the North has been passive in making progress in the discussions to arrange the events, even as we’ve tried hard to forge conditions to enhance bilateral relations,” a senior official at Seoul’s Unification Ministry told reporters on condition of anonymity.Late last month, the North rejected the South’s call for dialogue to discuss the holding of the joint Aug. 15 events, while unilaterally demanding that South Korean civic groups join Pyongyang’s separate events.South Korean civic groups have been pushing to hold with North Korean partners a soccer match, a youth walkathon, joint prayer services, joint heritage exhibitions and academic forums on Korean liberation movements. But these events have been shelved with the North refusing to further discuss them.The North has also continued to spurn Seoul’s overtures for talks including the latest one last Wednesday, while demanding that Seoul scrap its plan to hold the forthcoming joint military drills with the U.S. and remove the so-called May 24 economic sanctions, which were put in place after the North killed 46 South Korean sailors in a torpedo attack in March 2010.Analysts said that after all, both sides were to blame for the failure to arrange joint events given that both lacked political will to push for the events.“Stuck in a war of nerves, both lacked the true will to push ahead with those events, particularly when there has been a deep distrust between them,” Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies, told The Korea Herald.“Unless the highest political leaders in both nations take special steps, it would be difficult to restore cross-border relations.”Despite the Seoul government’s “trustpolitik” approach toward Pyongyang, inter-Korean distrust has been deepening with peninsular security uncertainties growing. The Park Geun-hye government has continued to focus on applying pressure on the communist regime to renounce its nuclear ambitions and stop provocations, while its efforts for cross-border dialogue have been dismissed by the North as insincere.North Korea leader Kim Jong-un’s seemingly clumsy, unpredictable diplomacy has exacerbated inter-Korean tensions. His diplomatic ineptitude was highlighted as Pyongyang rejected the request by Lee Hee-ho, the widow of former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, to meet with him during her visit to Pyongyang last week, and abruptly canceled U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s planned visit to the North in May.

(Yonhap)Labeling the package as a step to reviving the nation’s sluggish economy, the ruling Saenuri Party has been pushing for the swift passage of the bills, arguing that the legislation would create job opportunities for the youth whose unemployment rate has worsened.“No matter how hard it is, we will push for the passage. Our party will play a leading role in realizing the president’s initiative to jump-start economy,” said Saenuri chairman Kim Moo-sung, echoing President Park Geun-hye’s speech last Friday urging lawmakers to promptly sign the bills into legislation.But the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy called the bills a “false” promise and dismissed them as favors to those who already have vested interests in medical and tourism industry. The NPAD argued that the move would widen disparity between the haves and have-nots. “(The Saenuri Party) seems to be telling us that passing the bills would revive the economy. It is not the case. We believe it would worsen disparity in the medical industry and run the risk of leading to the privatization of public health care,” NPAD floor spokesman Rep. Park Soo-hyun said. Meanwhile, other conventional issues will continue to dominate already jam-packed August extraordinary parliamentary session agenda. Lawmakers will hold parliamentary committees this Monday and Wednesday to continue their debate over the spy agency’s hacking scandal.Having failed to hold a meeting at the National Intelligence Service last Thursday, rival parties will question the government officials about the allegation that the NIS had used hacking program to wiretap the public and engage in civil surveillance. While the Saenuri Party urges the opponent to stop inflating ungrounded allegation that might compromise national security, the NPAD accuses the NIS of denying access to “critical” information that they believe sheds lights on escalating scandal. On other political fronts, rival parties are expected to butt heads over the rules on the upcoming 2016 general election. With the NPAD proposing to change the current parliamentary representation, the ruling Saenuri Party rejected the plan, citing it would inevitably increase the number of lawmakers. With the deadline for the rule set for Thursday, rival parties agreed to discuss the issue in the relevant committee. But considering that the issue would impact the next election, it is widely expected that rival parties will fail to reach a compromise unless both parties’ leaders agree.

(Yonhap)The South Korean government said Friday that teachers who knowingly conceal sexual violence in schools can face expulsion from their posts, in response to a recent sexual harassment case at a Seoul high school involving five teachers and over 100 victims.In an unscheduled meeting presided over by Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, the officials agreed to revise the law on education civil servants ― referring to teachers at primary and secondary education ― to beef up the punishment against sexual abuse. The revision will also include immediately removing a teacher accused of sexual abuse from his or her post, and mandating the school committee reach a decision on the punishment within 30 days, shortened from the current regulation of 60 days.Under current law, the school officials can remove a suspected sex offender from the teaching post only after he or she has been indicted by the authorities. The law was revised earlier in the year ― to become effective November ― to remove the supposed offender after a police investigation had commenced. But the nationwide furor that has sparked in light of the recent scandal pushed the government to further revise the law.“The reoccurring sex crimes at schools raised concerns among the public, especially parents, and we need to look into countermeasures that are thought to be too lenient,” said Hwang at the meeting. The government also will disqualify those convicted of sexual crime from applying to become public officials, teachers or soldiers. They can also be fired immediately upon being fined for sex crimes. The current law stipulates one has to receive a prison term to be fired.Officials said they are pushing for a particularly strict punishment against teachers, including ex post facto punishment. For example, if a certified teacher ― who received his or her license after the law revision is passed ― has been found to have committed sex crime in the past, he or she will have his or her license revoked.Sex offenders will also be banned from returning to a teaching post. Seoul police and education office are currently conducting an investigation into claims that five teachers at a Seoul-based high school were involved in multiple sexual crimes on female teachers and students at their school for over a year. Over two dozen teachers and students were reported to have been molested, while over 100 students were said to have been harassed. The school’s principal is among the five being probed by the officials, although he has repeatedly denied charges and claimed this is a set-up by those opposing him within the school.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","reoccurring sex crimes at schools ,government said friday that teachers ,five teachers at seoul ,friday during meeting with government ,south korean government said friday","['Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'the Sejong Government Complex', 'south korean', 'Seoul', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Hwang', 'Seoul', 'Seoul']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23639908  0.36896378

Moon Jae-in said Wednesday that he is willing to take the Saenuri Party’s proposal to hold open primaries to select candidates for the next general election on the condition that the ruling party agrees to change the current nationwide proportional representation voting system. Moon’s proposal involves dividing the country into multiple proportional representation zones to allocate parliamentary seats according to the percentage of votes obtained by parties in each constituency. It is considered to be similar to Germany’s mixed-member proportional representation system. NPAD Chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in(center) made remarks during the meeting at the National Assembly on Wednesday. (Yonhap)“If the Saenuri Party accepts our proportional representation, our party could endorse an open primary system,” said Moon. “I am fine with any platform by which we discuss this. It could be a meeting between the leaders of both parties or among the National Assembly’s relevant committee members,” said Moon. But Saenuri Party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung virtually denied Moon’s proposal. He told reporters that proportional representation and open primaries were two “separate issues,” and the move is not “conducive” to political development. But he left room for discussion, saying “I will take time and give it consideration.” Moon’s proposal was in line with the National Election Commission’s suggestion to amend the current single nationwide proportional representation system. Last February, the election watchdog asked the National Assembly to consider redrawing constituency lines for proportional representation. According to the NEC’s plan, the current single nationwide constituency for proportional representation would be divided into six blocks, with each bloc assigned a number of proportional lawmakers based on its population. These proportional seats would then be distributed according to the rate of votes earned by the party. It suggested 300 parliamentary seats should be allocated for.  Mindful of the impact Moon’s proposal would bring in the next 2016 general election, the parties have clashed over the issue of whether the revised voting system would fit Korea’s political landscape, where two major parties enjoy supremacy and rely on regional biases to muster their votes. The NPAD asserts that the new system would help break the decades-old regional antagonism by giving each lawmaker a chance to be elected in a region where they are treated as underdogs through the new proportional seats that would be represented regionally rather than nationally. The Saenuri Party, on the other hand, refuted, saying the system would inevitably bring about an increase in the number of lawmakers, which many Koreans consider unnecessary, because the plan involves getting more lawmakers elected through proportional representation by different constituencies.  Critics were also split over Moon’s proposal. Lee Nae-young, professor of comparative politics at Korea University, said that the move would contribute to easing regional bias and breaking the two-party dominance in Korean politics.  “Moon’s plan is a step in the right direction,” said Lee. “If Moon’s plan refers to Germany’s mixed-member proportional representation system, it will ease regional bias among Koreans and bring political diversity to Korea’s polarized political landscape,” said Lee. “But, if we want to see Moon’s plan work well, we should increase the number of lawmakers elected through proportional representation. Certainly, it is unlikely to happen now, but we should push for it bit by bit. If not, we wouldn’t be maximizing the benefits of the German model,” said Lee.  Shin Yul, a politics professor at Myongji University, accused the NPAD of failing to make their case for the new voting system. He criticized the party for lacking a strategy to pitch the plan to the public, who may struggle to understand the complexity of the voting system.  “If NPAD’s plan is similar to Germany’s mixed-member proportional representation system, they have to spell out exactly what type of German system they are talking about. There are different categories under Germany’s system,” said Shin. “What is worse, I don’t think they have ever considered how to explain such a complicated system to the public. Back when I was studying in Germany, even their political professors took more than two hours to fully explain it. They have to figure out a plan on how to communicate with the public,” said Shin.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","on open primaries new politics ,national assembly on wednesday yonhap ,involves getting more lawmakers elected ,party suggestion on open primaries ,primaries new politics alliance for","['Saenuri Party', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'Moon', 'Germany', 'Moon Jae - in(center', 'the National Assembly', 'Saenuri Party', 'Moon', 'the National Assembly ’s', 'Moon', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Moon ’s', 'Moon ’s', 'the National Election Commission ’s', 'the National Assembly', 'NEC', 'Moon', 'Korea', 'NPAD', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Koreans', 'Moon ’s', 'Lee Nae - young', 'Korea University', 'korean', 'Moon', 'Lee', 'Moon', 'Germany', 'Koreans', 'Korea', 'Lee', 'Moon', 'german', 'Lee', 'Shin Yul', 'Myongji University', 'NPAD ’s', 'Germany', 'german', 'Germany', 'Shin', 'Germany', 'Shin', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",17,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.32704416  0.19900012

Kim Tae-ho’s surprise announcement Monday to withdraw his bid for the 2016 general election, lawmakers from the New Politics Alliance for Democracy took a veiled swipe at “privileged” NPAD lawmakers who have served multiple terms in the National Assembly. “We are already losing the game,” Lee Dong-hak, a member of NPAD reform committee, tweeted. “Even if (Kim’s move) is nothing but a political show, we are losing on the show as well. We are frustrated, people are frustrated and Korea is frustrated.” Echoing Lee’s remarks, Cho Guk, who also serves as a reform committee member, said in a media interview that NPAD bigwigs should make a “wise” decision over whether or not to run for the election. The law professor has urged four-term NPAD lawmakers and above to drop their parliamentary election bids to pave the way for fresh faces. NPAD members hold a rally calling for a new proportional representation system in front of the main National Assembly hall on Tuesday. (Yonhap)With four incumbent lawmakers now having bowed out of the race for the election, the Saenuri Party was deemed to take the lead in political reforms aimed at discarding the vested rights, largely held on to by multiple-term heavyweights. Besides Kim, four-time lawmaker Rep. Lee Han-koo, six-time lawmaker Rep. Kang Chang-hee and Rep. Sohn In-chun have decided not to run. Meanwhile, none of the NPAD bigwigs has made similar moves except for the party’s chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in, who dropped his bid for the 2016 general election as he ran for NPAD chairmanship in 2014. NPAD lawmakers were, on the contrary, criticized recently for proposing an increase in the number of parliamentary seats as part of their reform plans.Considering Kim and other politician’s high-profile posts, it was widely expected that Kim’s decision would have significant political impact in the run-up to the general election that is set to take place about nine months from now. Critics, however, remained cautious on whether the decision would bring sweeping changes in the local political scene, saying that it is more an “isolated case” of a politician who needs to take time off to prepare for his next political moves. “It is hard to see a unified pattern among those politicians who have decided not to run,” said Lee Jung-hee, a politics professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. “I believe it is exaggerating to say that (Kim’s decision) is a starting point for the ruling bloc’s reform. I think it is a bit of personal decision,” said Lee.Kim said in the statement he could not help recognize that he became “hallow” and “weak” as he began to lose touch with the public. Last July, Kim had infamously traded barbs with the party’s chief Rep. Kim Moo-sung over the resignation of the former whip Rep. Yoo Seung-min.“He has built a bad reputation for slipping his tongue at the party meetings. I believe that Kim’s decision has something to do with his next political move. He may want to take time off to self-reflect before considering his next political career move such as premiership and the presidency,” Lee said.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","his reelection bid sparked debate ,bid sparked debate on tuesday ,drop their parliamentary election bids ,reelection bid sparked debate ,forgo his reelection bid sparked","['Saenuri Party', 'Kim Tae - ho', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'NPAD', 'the National Assembly', 'Lee Dong - hak', 'NPAD', 'Kim', 'Korea', 'echo Lee ’s', 'Cho Guk', 'NPAD', 'NPAD', 'npad', 'National Assembly', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Kim', 'Lee Han - koo', 'Kang Chang - hee', 'Sohn In - chun', 'Moon Jae - in', 'NPAD', 'npad', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Lee Jung - hee', 'Hankuk University of Foreign Studies', 'Kim', 'Lee', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'Yoo Seung - min', 'Kim', 'Lee', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",7,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.38077703  0.50141716

Sim Hag-bong in a statement. “I will faithfully cooperate with the police investigation to resolve all suspicions,” he said.The remark came a day after he denied an allegation that he raped a woman in her 40s at a hotel in Daegu last month. The woman, whose name was withheld, claimed that the lawmaker took her clothes off against her will and sexually assaulted her. She was nearly threatened to come to the hotel, where the lawmaker had already checked in, through constant phone calls he made, and told the police. The police were looking into the case, securing phone records between the two and the footage of surveillance cameras showing the two entering the hotel on June 13.The woman, however, has stoked the flames of controversy as she suddenly changed her statement. She said was not forced to have sex, and she doesn’t want him to be prosecuted. Shim, 54, is a first-term lawmaker representing Gumi-A Constituency in North Gyeongsang Province.Investigators said they would summon Rep. Sim as a suspect and question him as to whether he had attempted to threaten or cajole her into having sex.The case is the latest in a series of sexual scandals involving the ruling party lawmakers.In 2006, Choi Yeon-hee, former lawmaker of Grand National Party, the predecessor of the ruling Saenuri, stepped down from his post as party secretary-general after he was accused of sexually harassing a female reporter. Another former GNP lawmaker Kang Yong-seok also defected from the party for his raw sexual remarks of TV announcers. Earlier this year, former National Assembly Speaker Park Hee-tae was sentenced to a six-month jail term suspended for one year for sexually harassing a female caddie during a round of golf last year. “The Park Geun-hye government, (headed by) the first female president in the constitutional history, has been pushing to eradicate four major evils including sexual and domestic violence,” said main opposition lawmaker Rep. Yoo Seung-hee, reciting the list of former and incumbent Saenuri lawmakers who were implicated for sexual harassments. “It is pathetic to watch the governing party failing to keep its internal figures under discipline.”The Saenuri Party also vowed to sternly punish Rep. Sim and urged lawmakers not to defend him.“The Saenuri Party will take clear action to the lawmaker involved in the case. There’s no reason to defend him,” said Rep. Hwang Jin-ha, secretary-general of the party.

Kim Moo-sung, appeared to be having a heyday in his stay in the U.S. over the past week, making comments that would have immediately caused backlash back home, but that nonetheless galvanized his conservative support base. The height of such remarks was his announcement Saturday when he said his party would push for reinstating a system of all schools using government-published textbooks to address what they consider to be a “biased view” imposed by some private publishers’ progressive textbooks. “I think that left-wing flanks have a wrong sense of history and they are trying to instill their biased view in the young people who will lead our country,” Kim said in a meeting with Koreans who reside in Los Angeles, U.S. “We are trying to bring back a state-authorized textbook system to prevent this trend,” said Kim. Saenuri Party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung reviews a speech he is set to give at Columbia University on a train for New York last Wednesday. (Yonhap)His remark came amid his first visit to the U.S. since he became the leader of the Saenuri Party. During the eight-day visit, he has made similar moves that were deemed to consolidate his support base, mostly right-wing voters who value the Korea-U.S. alliance and conservative policies such as state-authorized history textbooks. Not only did he point out that Korea’s alliance with the U.S. outweighs Korea-China relations, he also pulled out all stops to highlight the importance of the ruling conservative party holding on to power. He said he would even sacrifice “his life” for achieving the goal.Critics accused his move of being “outdated” and “inappropriate” as a leader of the ruling party. Chu Chin-oh, history professor at Sangmyung University, compared his move to the rhetoric used by right-wing Japanese politicians in their attempts to whitewash history by revising its textbooks. “A state-authorized textbook system clashes with democratic values,” Chu said. “The reason we teach history is we want (our students) to reflect on what was wrong and learn from it. I think state textbooks could serve as a tool that only serves the values of one side,” Chu said.Other critics, such as Yoon Pyung-joong, political philosophy professor at Hanshin University, said that Kim went “overboard” with his controversial remarks in the U.S. and his lopsided focus on conservative voters would backfire on him in the upcoming 2017 presidential election. Kim continues to enjoy a lead in the latest survey for likely candidates. “(Some of Kim’s remarks) are clearly uncalled for,” said Yoon. “Kowtowing to the U.S. veterans and, most importantly, his comments about China are too much. I believe the second one is big mistake in particular, considering his off-the-cuff speech style,” Yoon said. “Things will be quite different in the 2017 presidential election from the 2012 election where then-presidential candidate Park Geun-hye won. Back then, Park was considered to be an epitome of conservative values and faced arguably the weakest contender from liberal parties. But she won the presidency by a narrow margin,“ said Yoon.  “Thus, moderate voters are going to be critical of Kim who doesn’t have the same political assets as Park. If Kim continues to seek conservative political gains by alienating himself from moderate voters, it would be a dangerous move,” said Yoon.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","upcoming 2017 presidential election kim ,some private publishers progressive textbooks ,goal critics accused his move ,the upcoming 2017 presidential election ,publishers progressive textbooks think that","['Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'U.S.', 'Kim', 'Koreans', 'Los Angeles', 'U.S.', 'Kim', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'Columbia University', 'New York', 'U.S.', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'Chu Chin - oh', 'Sangmyung University', 'japanese', 'Chu', 'Chu', 'Yoon Pyung - joong', 'Hanshin University', 'Kim', 'U.S.', 'Kim', 'Yoon', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Yoon', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Park', 'Yoon', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Yoon', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.71536404  0.51768756

The practice, carried out in the 2005-2013 period, has been cited for directly impacting profits of existing special agent stores. The antitrust watchdog said such actions constituted an abuse of superior position enjoyed by AmorePacific vis-a-vis its special agent. The FTC ordered administrative corrections, slapped a 500 million won ($428,000) fine and referred the company and a key executive to the state prosecutors' office.Special agent stores, which only sell AmorePacific products under contract, account for some 20 percent of the cosmetic company's domestic sales and use its sales personnel to sell high end products such as Sulwhasoo.Sources said the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office is looking into possible wrongdoing by AmorePacific and one of its former directing managers, who has only been identified by his surname Lee.The FTC claimed that Lee was directly involved in the reallocation of sale personnel and even called for the replacement of special agent stores that were underperforming.""We are carefully looking into all allegations made and records provided by the FTC,"" said an insider at the prosecutors' office.He said that Lee will be summoned for questioning in due course.The FTC said taking firm stance against unfair trade practices will send a clear signal to the business community that the government will clamp down on big companies that abuse their power to hurt its agents and dealers.

The new deal still bans Seoul from reprocessing and enrichment, but it opens the way for the Asian ally to begin research into a new technology for spent nuclear fuel recycling, known as pyroprocessing, and to make low-level enriched uranium with U.S. consent.President Barack Obama sent the deal to Congress last month for approval.Since then, the agreement has been under review for 90 congressional days. Should there be no opposition raised during the process, the pact will go into effect. Widespread views are that no objections will be raised, and this week's resolutions reinforced such views.No legislative approval is necessary in South Korea.

He added that the NIS had shown interest in the process of tapping phone calls.Lee went on to criticize the NIS for refusing to submit RCS’s log files, which record every event in the hacking software. The NIS denied access to the files, citing they contain sensitive information that could compromise the nation’s cybersecurity.But the ruling Saenuri Party labeled the NPAD allegation as an attempt at “self-hypnosis” to disrupt the due process of the NIS investigation, urging the NPAD to stop throwing around unverified allegations that “sabotage” national cybersecurity amid the persistent cyber threat from North Korea. “(The NPAD) should stop raising ungrounded allegation to sabotage our national security system,” said Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Won Yoo-chul. “I am afraid that Korea is going down the wrong path, while other countries are seeking to beef up intelligence capability,” said Won.Won added, “(The NPAD) needs to get the facts right and face the truth, whether it involves on-site inspection or meetings with officials. NPAD should stop hypnotizing itself.” Lawmakers agreed Wednesday to visit the NIS and hold meetings with its officials to address the hacking scandal.

Kwon Eun-hee of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy was a police officer on a team that in 2013 investigated the National Intelligence Service's alleged online smear campaign to sway public opinion in favor of then ruling party candidate Park Geun-hye in the 2012 presidential election.In April 2013, Kwon claimed she had been barred by her superiors, including Kim Yong-pan, then chief of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, from pursuing the case as far as she believed was appropriate, a comment that sent ripples through political circles and the state intelligence agency.The Supreme Court, however, acquitted Kim of charges of abusing his authority to influence the police investigation earlier this year, citing a lack of evidence and lack of credibility in Kwon's testimony.Some conservative organizations including Young's Liberty Union filed a lawsuit against Kwon in January 2014 for allegedly giving false testimony.""There is no change in the fact that there was suppression to hinder further investigation,"" Kwon told reporters before entering the prosecutors' office in southern Seoul.

(Yonhap)According to the prosecution, Yeom offered to arrange for special care of Cho during her stay in jail after the lowest court sentenced her to one year in prison in February in the so-called “nut rage” case. The prosecution is probing whether Yeom bribed officials in prison, in return for treating Cho favorably. It is also looking into whether she really enjoyed special privileges while in prison. Cho, who was in charge of in-flight services of the nation's biggest airlines, served a jail term until May for violating plane safety after she ordered the taxiing flight bound for Incheon, with more than 200 passengers on board, back to the gate at John F. Kennedy Airport last December, taking issue with what she viewed as “poor cabin service.” Unsatisfied with the way a first-class flight attendant served macadamia nuts, Cho assaulted the plane’s chief steward, made him kneel and struck his hand with a folder.An appeals court freed her in May, handing down a reduced sentence of 10 months, suspended for two years. In relation to the brokerage case, investigators raided Yeom’s residence and the office of a high-ranking Hanjin Group official surnamed Seo, who allegedly introduced Yeom to Cho. Seo and Yeom have allegedly been in a close relationship since they first met in the aftermath of the Korean Air crash in Guam in 1997 that killed 228 people on board. Yeom was a representative for victims’ families back then.The now infamous “nut rage” case continues to persist despite Cho’s release, with the chief steward and the first-class flight attendant having filed separate lawsuits in the U.S. to seek financial compensation.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","prosecutors on wednesday detained man ,biggest airlines served jail term ,wednesday detained man for allegedly ,yeom bribed officials in prison ,prosecutors on wednesday detained","['Cho Hyun - ah', 'Korean Air', 'the Seoul Southern Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Yeom', 'Hanjin', 'Cho', 'Heather Cho', 'hanjin', 'Hanjin Group', 'Cho ’s', 'Korean Air', 'Cho Yang - ho', 'Yeom', 'Cho', 'Yeom', 'Cho', 'Cho', 'Incheon', 'John F.

Lee Jong-kul. (Yonhap)The partisan showdown came a day after the NIS chief Lee Byung-ho testified before a parliamentary closed-door session. Lee reportedly said the NIS had found no evidence of civilian surveillance after its internal investigation into files deleted by the deceased NIS official who purchased and used the hacking device. “The NIS conducted the investigation on its own and was exonerated by the ruling Saenuri Party,” said NPAD floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul. “As opposed to telling the truth, the NIS claimed innocence. It will be nothing but an insult to the National Assembly if the NIS continues to refuse to submit evidence,” said Lee.NPAD accused the NIS of denying access to key evidence such as log files that contain every event of the usage of the hacking software purchased by the NIS. The opponent believes that the files will prove whether the hacking device targeted civilians.  But the ruling Saenuri Party dismissed the NPAD’s call as an attempt to compromise the nation’s capability to conduct cyberwarfare with North Korea. The Saenuri Party condemned the NPAD for relying on “ungrounded evidence” in seeking political gains at the cost of national security. “NPAD continues to request information that might reveal every detail of NIS cybersecurity capability,” said Saenuri Party floor leader Won Yoo-chul. “Although the NIS chief made abundantly clear that it had never spied on its own people, the NPAD continues to raise doubts over the allegation of civilian surveillance,” said Won.

The Supreme Court upheld a lower court’s ruling last Thursday that results-based financial incentives for lawyers in criminal cases are illegal, invalidating contingency fee arrangements in the nation and going into effect immediately.“It goes against morality and social order to connect contingency fees for criminal cases with the results of an investigation or trial for a financial compensation,” the bench said. Judges deliver a ruling outlawing contingency fees for lawyers in criminal cases at the Supreme Court in southern Seoul on July 23. (Yonhap)The decision came amid efforts to stamp out shady practices in which former judges and prosecutor-turned-lawyers are said to make underhand deals with sitting judicial officers to draw favorable results for their clients. Since South Korea established its judiciary system in 1948, it has been the norm for clients to pay lawyers “success fees” based on the results, a practice lawyers’ organizations viewed as motivating the lawyers to do their best until the close of a case.The contingency fees for former judges and prosecutors have been especially high, propped by those facing a criminal investigation or trial in a desperate move to sway the ruling in their favor. But such a practice has been subject to criticism for what some see as encouraging former judges and prosecutors to meddle in the legal process, increasing the possibility of corruption.The nation’s highest court also said in its ruling that such practices undermined the rule of law and deepened Koreans’ distrust in the nation’s judiciary system.“We cannot deny that contingency fee contracts have created misunderstanding and distrust for Korea’s criminal justice system in a climate where many people still believe that money can solve everything,” the court said.The Supreme Court still allowed contingency fee contracts for civil cases, saying it does not violate the legal principles of private autonomy and liberty of contract. The court also stressed the public role of lawyers, saying their mission is to advocate social justice and human rights to uphold the rule of law in society. The ruling, however, enraged lawyers who argue that the court is falsely accusing even “innocent” lawyers of receiving “excessive” contingency fees. “The public distrust in the legal system is created by only a handful of ex-judges and prosecutors who are overpaid for their services,” the Korean Bar Association said in a statement.“The ruling will not only deal a blow to most of the lawyers having difficulties in finding work without the success fee system, but also to clients who will end up paying more overall, such as before a trial or when an investigation begins,” it added. On Monday, the organization asked the Constitutional Court to review the ruling, though the Korean law stipulates that it cannot reconsider rulings made by lower courts. “For the public good, the Constitutional Court should be able to revisit the controversial rulings,” Kim Hyo-eun, a spokesperson for Korean Bar Association, told The Korea Herald. “The ban on contingency fees has unconstitutional aspects that infringe on people’s rights.”The Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court have been at loggerheads over the scope of their judiciary discretion recently. The Supreme Court supports current regulations, saying the Constitutional Court cannot make decisions on the lower court’s legal interpretations. The Constitutional Court, however, has submitted a request for law revision to the National Assembly.Kim said that given such a situation, the association’s request for a review may not be taken up for the time being.Kim Bum-hoon, a lawyer who specializes in criminal cases, lamented that the Supreme Court made the ruling without knowing “the reality” in the legal industry at all. “Our clients demand the success fee system as they can pay us depending on the result they achieve from trials,” Kim told The Korea Herald. “It is reasonable for them, too.” “To be honest, I am not sure whether I can put as much effort now without financial incentives,” he said. “I am also a human being, you know?”With the ban on contingency fees in effect, change seems inevitable in the remuneration of lawyers as monetary incentives have been a major source of their income. “Lawyers will likely charge clients more for initial fees before a trial begins and receive money based on the amount of time they put in for the case,” Kim said, adding that he has already started charging his clients higher initial fees since the ruling was made. But The Good Law, a civic organization campaigning for Koreans’ legal rights, welcomed the ruling. “The decision came too late, but we believe that it will help promote the judicial order in the long term,” Hong Kum-ae, an official from the civic group, told The Korea Herald.“Some ex-judges and prosecutors make a few phone calls in the office without doing much and charge clients a huge amount of money as contingency fees,” Hong said.“It is obviously against the rule of law if one’s release from the prison can be determined by a lawyer’s influence,” Hong said. “To protect clients’ rights and uphold the rule of law, sentencing guidelines should be clear and predictable.” Still, the ruling is unlikely to root out the prevalent practice of former judges and prosecutors using personal connections to influence the probes and trials, lawyer Kim pointed out.“Behind Koreans seeking judges- and prosecutor-turned-lawyers is the expectation that ex-judicial officers can wield influence on serving judges and prosecutors for their interest,” Kim said. “Under the current legal system, people will continue to have such expectations and find other ways to get a favorable result.” Lee Heon-uk, a Seoul-based lawyer and member of the People’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy organization, agreed that the ban on contingency fees can hardly restore the public trust in the nation’s judicial system, let alone change the practice of preferring former judges and prosecutors. “The public distrust in the judiciary arises from the nation’s legal structure that gives excessive power to judges and prosecutors,” Lee told The Korea Herald. Under the current legal structure, judges and prosecutors who previously held high positions in the court and prosecution’s office often open a law practice after retirement. They are then often assigned to criminal cases in which they can exert influence.“Unless Korea puts in place rules that outlaw ex-judges and prosecutors from practicing law, it will never be able to overcome the public distrust in the judiciary system,” Lee said, calling for changes to the current judiciary structure. But Lee hailed the court ruling as a “stepping-stone” for broader reforms in the legal industry. “Despite drawbacks, it is meaningful that the Supreme Court attempted to put an end to the lawyers’ excessive profit-making practice and underlined their public role in society,” he said.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","highest court last week banned ,outlawing contingency fees for lawyers ,court last week banned the ,court last week banned ,lower court ruling last thursday","['South Korea ’s', 'the Supreme Court', 'the Supreme Court', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'Koreans', 'Korea', 'the Supreme Court', 'the Korean Bar Association', 'the Constitutional Court', 'korean', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Kim Hyo - eun', 'Korean Bar Association', 'the Korea Herald', 'Constitutional Court', 'the Supreme Court', 'the Supreme Court', 'the Constitutional Court', 'the Constitutional Court', 'the National Assembly', 'Kim', 'Kim bum - hoon', 'the Supreme Court', 'Kim', 'the Korea Herald', 'Kim', 'Koreans', 'Hong Kum - ae', 'the Korea Herald', 'Hong', 'Hong', 'Kim', 'Koreans', 'Kim', 'Lee Heon - uk', 'Seoul', 'the People ’s Solidarity', 'Lee', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'the Supreme Court', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",19,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.29909596  0.12773874

The proposal prompted different reactions and interpretations from main and minor parties, cautiously tiptoeing around a potential rise in the number of parliamentary seats and the negative public opinion over lawmakers’ prerogatives.Kim Sang-kon, head of the reform committee of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, Sunday unveiled a package of restructuring measures to increase the number of legislators elected through the proportional representation system, which could, in turn, raise the total number of parliamentary members from the current 300 to 369. “I urge the party to begin an in-depth discussion on increasing the number of lawmakers,” he said at a news conference. The rationale behind the drastic reform measure is aimed at breaking down the existing political regionalism and to ensure the election results better reflect the proportion of support gained by each competing group, Kim said.  NPAD floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul speaks at a party meeting on Monday. (Yonhap)The proposal is highly sensitive as it could prompt a drastic change in the political landscape here. But some observers say it would be difficult for the opposition party to get the public’s consent, as the measure is widely viewed as allowing more politicians to seek vested interests by acquiring a parliamentary seat.Kim proposed to keep the current number of lawmakers elected through the first-past-the-post system at 246 to represent the constituencies, but sharply raise the number of lawmakers elected through proportional representation to 123. The NPAD at first appeared divided by this proposal. Even NPAD chairman Moon Jae-in put the brakes, saying it is “inappropriate” to discuss the matter now. But the floor leader of the main opposition party voluntarily entered the debate, vowing the NPAD would set the proposal as a plank in its party platform.“This is important for political reforms,” he said. “If it is inevitable to increase the number of lawmakers, then it would be a realistic way to accept that idea,” he added. The ruling Saenuri Party, for the time being, blasted the opposition party, saying it is turning a blind eye to the public’s demand to raise the parliament’s productivity, in terms of legislating laws meant to improve people’s lives. “Quality is more important than quantity,” said Rep. Won Yoo-chul, the floor leader of the ruling party, during a supreme council meeting.“This is the time to push for political reforms by giving the public the right to pick candidates for parliamentary seats,” he said, referring to an open primary system recently proposed by the party.The proposal corresponds to a recent draft revision to laws submitted by the National Election Commission in February. The election watchdog suggested the parliament consider rezoning the electoral constituencies into six zones for the proportional representation seats and mete out the parliamentary seats accordingly with the percentage of votes garnered by parties in each constituency. The proposal was also backed by a Constitutional Court ruling last year that said population discrepancies among some electorates were too high. The nation’s highest court last October ruled that some constituencies were underrepresented in the legislature. Those with populations one-third the size of larger voting districts are granted the same number of lawmakers. The court said the population gaps were unconstitutional.Since then, political parties have geared up for discussion on electoral reforms by creating a parliamentary panel to restructure electorates throughout the country. The two sides, however, have been spinning their wheels instead of making progress, as they have faced widespread public criticism for trying to increase the number of politicians already enjoying exceptional privileges.South Korean legislators are under fire for receiving higher pay and being granted more prerogatives than other elected politicians in advanced countries. The reputation and public trust of legislators have remained low due to a series of corruption scandals involving incumbent lawmakers from both the ruling and opposition parties.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","reignited heated political debate monday ,more politicians to seek vested ,heated political debate monday ,heated political debate monday by ,politics alliance for democracy sunday","['Kim Sang - kon', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Kim', 'NPAD', 'Lee Jong - kul', 'Kim', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Saenuri Party', 'Won Yoo', 'the National Election Commission', 'Constitutional Court', 'south korean', 'Cho Chung - un']",0,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.71080905  0.15254244

She reportedly said she had to endure the pain with ice packages and Tylenol until the plane touched down at its destination. Jang accused the airline of failing to provide appropriate medical help and causing physical and psychological stress.“I had been planning to continue my career in broadcasting, fashion and hair design, using my physical beauty as my strength, but that’s become impossible because of the hideous burns,” Jang said. “I can’t continue work at the bakery either because I have developed an extreme fear of working near 800-degree hot ovens.”Asiana has reportedly offered compensation of some 61 million won to cover Jang’s medical expenses.“(Upon the accident) the crew took appropriate measures such as disinfecting the wounds with the help of a doctor on board. We plan to work for a smooth compromise.

The Assembly also passed nearly 60 bills, including amendments to the Criminal Act abolishing a statute of limitations clause for murder cases.The budget bill allows the government to provide farmers hit by droughts last month with funds for irrigation and obtaining water supplies. The bill will also allow officials to offer loans to hospitals that suffered a drop in customers after treating suspected MERS patients. The National Assembly`s main hall, Friday. (Yonhap)The government will offer subsidies and low-interest loans to small and mid-sized businesses struggling from the depressed consumer spending hit by the MERS outbreak. State-owned banks will also offer emergency funds to struggling export firms. The budget bill’s passage comes after over two weeks of partisan fighting over the extra spending plan, submitted earlier this month by the Park administration.Ruling Saenuri Party officials backed passing it as soon as possible, but the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy objected, saying the budget bill included spending plans on regional infrastructure projects trying to appease voters ahead of next year’s general elections.Saenuri officials accepted the NPAD’s objections, cutting related funds to 1.25 trillion won, from the 1.5 trillion that Park officials had initially suggested.The Saenuri Party also accepted the NPAD demands to cut parts of the bill trying to plug holes in lower-than-expected tax revenues, cutting related funds from 5.6 trillion to 5.4 trillion.But persisting disagreements over the corporate tax rate could spark another partisan fight in the coming week, with the main opposition demanding the Park administration to raise the 22 percent corporate tax rate.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","35 lawmakers abstaining the assembly ,droughts last month with funds ,23 with 35 lawmakers abstaining ,with 35 lawmakers abstaining the ,administration extra budget bill ending","['the National Assembly', 'Assembly', 'Assembly', 'Park', 'Saenuri Party', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'the Saenuri Party', 'NPAD', 'Park', 'Jeong Hunny']",0,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.66418618  0.1887732

The KPIC is believed to have collected some 4.3 billion records from January 2011 to November 2014. Also indicted was the head of a company that supplies a program that organizes information of patients’ medical treatment for insurance purposes. The company allegedly supplied the program to 7,500 hospitals across the country and illegally acquired 720 million records of treatments and prescriptions from March 2008 to December 2014.Each of the two organizations are suspected of selling their data to a U.S.-based statistics company for 1.6 billion won ($1.37 million) and 330 million won, respectively. The U.S. company is believed to have statistically analyzed the information to figure out which medications are most frequently used. It then allegedly sold them to Korean pharmaceutical companies and made 7 billion won in profit.Investigators also found that SK Telecom, the nation’s top mobile carrier, illegally collected 7,802 prescription records from 23,060 hospitals by using its electronic prescription services.

The current criminal procedure law stipulates a 25-year statute of limitation for those accused of committing homicide. The bill awaits approval at the assembly’s plenary session on July 24.“The bill will give us an opportunity to get to the bottom of unsolved murder cases,” said Rep. Seo Young-kyo of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy in a press conference. Seo took the lead in drafting the bill along with fellow lawmakers.  NPAD Rep. Seo Young-kyo holds a press conference about a revision bill that lifts the statute of limitation on homicide cases at the National Assembly, Tuesday. (Yonhap)The revision, however, does not extend to manslaughter or parricide cases. Other relevant bills, such as extending the statute of limitation for those convicts sentenced to more than five years for crimes with scientific evidence, also failed to get approval at the committee meeting.The move came after a mysterious homicide case failed to find the perpetrator as it reached the end of its statute of limitation. In 1999, a 6-year-old boy was killed by an unknown attacker who doused him with sulfuric acid. The statute of limitation for homicide at the time was 15 years. Even though his parents pleaded for the court to review the case until they found the murderer, Korea’s Supreme Court last year dismissed the request. The case’s statute of limitation then expired and the case was classified as cold. “The bill will help prevent yet another tragedy like an innocent 6-year-boy’s death. It will bring those who committed heinous crimes to justice. The murderers might enjoy a time limit for their crimes, but the pain of the victims of the crimes never has a limit,” Seo said. Experts said the bill is a step in the right direction because those who commit homicide should be subject to different legal punishments from other criminals. “I am in favor of the move,” said Choi Cheong-hak, criminal law professor from Korea National Open University. “Some people suggest that the current 25-year statute of limitation is sufficient to bring pains to perpetrators, because they have to live with the fear of getting caught for a long period of time. But I believe those who committed homicide deserve more than that,” said Choi.

Ahn Cheol-soo on Tuesday said he would request extensive information on the hacking software that had sparked public debate as to whether the nation’s intelligence agency used it to spy on its own people.The former CEO of an antivirus software company said in a press conference that he would formally ask the National Intelligence Service to submit some 30 documents, including all log files of the Remote Control System, software that has the capability to tap into mobile phones.“All information will remain in log files, including whether the computer in question hacked the target device and what was hacked,” Ahn said. He added that by analyzing the log files they would be able to find out the owner of the target device, which would shed light on whether any civilians were hacked or not.Ahn’s plans came amid an intensifying scuffle between the rival parties over the scandal.The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy repeated its calls for a parliamentary hearing into the NIS, while the ruling Saenuri Party dismissed the call as a politically-motivated attempt.“Lawmakers have a duty to get to the bottom of the wiretapping allegation,” said NAPD floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul. “The NIS must come out and accept a parliamentary hearing if they think they have never been involved with spying on civilians,” said Lee.  NPAD Rep. Lee Jong-kul (left) and NPAD Rep. Shin Kyoung-min. (Yonhap)But the ruling Saenuri party refused, urging the NAPD to stop inflating allegations, dismissing them as groundless. The ruling party asserted than the NIS had already given a plausible explanation on the wiretapping charges. Last week, NIS issued a rare public statement and denied the allegation that the agency had bugged civilians. In the statement, the agency said it never conducted surveillance operations against civilians and groundless allegations would compromise national security. “The NIS came forward and gave us a full explanation. As I understand, the NPAD should appreciate and acknowledge the agency’s attempt to explain itself. I think it is truly courageous,” said Rep. Cho Won-jin of the Saenuri Party. The wiretapping allegations surfaced when emails between suspected NIS agents and Italian software firm Hacking Team were leaked by unidentified hackers earlier this month. The email showed that the NIS had purchased hacking software with wiretapping capabilities. The NIS asserted that the software was never used for the surveillance of South Korean citizens, though it admitted it bought it in 2012. The agency pointed out that it used the program to enhance cyber warfare capabilities against North Korea.The explanation, however, was met with public skepticism due to the spy agency’s alleged meddling in the 2012 presidential elections. The NIS was accused of conducting a smear campaign against opposition candidate Moon Jae-in. The NPAD claimed that the NIS helped Moon’s rival, now-President Park Geun-hye, win the election. The public distrust only worsened after last week’s apparent suicide of an NIS agent suspected to have been involved in the agency’s deals with Hacking Team.

In 2005, 91 foreign workers who led a sit-in protest in central Seoul from 2003 to 2004 to call for a stop to deportation of people working here illegally, founded the MTU and requested a permit from the government for its establishment.  But the Ministry of Employment and Labor rejected its application, taking issue with the majority of the union members being “illegal” workers.  “How can human beings be illegal?” Rai asked. “We were just unregistered, not illegal, and demanded our fair share of rights.”The MTU filed a lawsuit the same year. The lowest court ruled in favor of the ministry, saying that migrant workers illegally staying in the nation are not entitled to legal protection. But the appeals court overturned the decision in 2007, recognizing their rights as workers stipulated in the Constitution. The ministry appealed, but the case was stalled in the Supreme Court for nearly eight years. During that period, six MTU officials, including two presidents, were deported for their involvement in the labor movement. Last year, Rai officially became president of the MTU, which has some 1,100 members, replacing Michel Caturia, who left Korea for the Philippines in 2012. Now, the MTU has become the voice for some 553,000 migrant workers legally on the EPS visa and 208,778 people who are in the country illegally, mostly from Southeast and Central Asia. “When I started to work in Korea, it was common for foreign workers to suffer overdue payment, punishing working hours, beatings and discrimination,” he said. “It was wrong and I wanted to fight for their rights.” Rai, who used to farm in Nepal, made his way to Korea in 2003 under the Industrial Trainee System in search of a better life for him and his family. But the reality turned out not to be as expected. The Nepalese activist started to work as a trainee at a small manufacturing factory just outside Seoul in 2004, working 11 hours a day, except Sundays. After his Korean colleagues left work, Rai and other migrant laborers were forced to stay longer to clean up, only to receive 500,000 won ($430) four months later.“When I questioned my boss about such unfair treatment, he beat me and verbally abused me,” Rai said. He said that he had to flee several times from workplaces to escape inhumane working conditions. Korea started to receive migrant workers under the Industrial Trainee System in 1993 amid a shortage of low-skilled workers for the so-called “3-D” jobs -- dirty, difficult and dangerous labor -- typically in sectors such as construction, manufacturing and agriculture.But as the workers coming in through the system were managed as “trainees” and not as “workers,” the system was widely criticized both in Korea and overseas for human rights abuses, such as forced labor and confinement, the creation of a black market among agencies and poor working conditions. “As I was a trainee, not a laborer, I was not entitled to any rights to change jobs, join a union or receive compensation for industrial accidents from the government,” Rai said, calling it a “modern form of slavery.”Amid mounting criticism over the system, the liberal Roh Moo-hyun administration introduced a new migrant worker scheme called the Employment Permit System, to reduce the number of foreign laborers who stayed in Korea illegally. Under the EPS, unskilled workers from 15 nations, mostly from Southeast and Central Asian countries, are allowed to enter Korea to work for up to three years if employers cannot find South Korean nationals to fill positions in manual labor. “At least, migrant workers are recognized as laborers in accordance with Korea’s labor law under the new system,” Rai said, referring to workers’ basic rights to strike, organize and collectively bargain.  “But the EPS is still business-friendly, not laborer-friendly, with employers monopolizing all the rights to hire and fire migrant workers.” For starters, the EPS laborers come here without knowing what their job is and who they will work for. Instead, only employers are given a list of job seekers from which they can choose. While EPS employers have the right to dismiss migrants without justification, those employed under the scheme have no right to quit or change jobs without a release form signed by their employers. Foreign workers who quit without permission are labeled “runaways,” facing arrest or deportation. “The employers have no legal duty to sign a release form for workers to change a job or renew their contracts to let them stay longer here,” Rai said, pinpointing the rules in the system that can lead to creating an “abusive” environment.  The EPS laborers, tied to their initial employers for three years, must leave Korea unless they extend their contracts. With little opportunity to make money at home, the migrant workers on the visa are coerced into putting up with exploitive conditions not to be fired, Rai noted.  The Korean government allows the workers to change jobs without approval from employers and receive overdue payment if they report the case to the Labor Ministry. But lack of fluency in Korean, complicated legal processes and fear of losing their jobs make it difficult for them to come forward. While the United Nation’s International Labor Organization hailed Korea’s worker scheme as “a better conceived, funded and implemented foreigner worker program than most in Asia,” Amnesty International slammed the program for making migrant workers vulnerable to “abuse” and “exploitation” in its 2009 report.Another complaint from migrant workers is a revised law, enacted last year, which requires employers to pay them the severance money after they leave Korea. The move is designed to deter migrant workers from overstaying their visas, according to the authorities.The system gave more leeway to the employers to abuse the system and dodge their legal obligation to pay workers severance, according to Rai. “The problem lies in the legal structure that forces migrant workers to keep quiet out of fear, but there is nothing we can do about the law aside from raising awareness of the issue,” Rai said, adding that the government is more responsible than employers for the situation. The migrants’ union has called for a change to the current EPS system, asking the government to issue a “Labor Permit” instead. “The proposed Labor Permit System would enable migrant laborers to choose and change jobs, invite their families and work here for longer than five years so that they can apply for permanent residence,” Rai explained.Currently, the government only allows the EPS laborers to stay for up to four years and 10 months, which Rai views as a ""gimmick"" to stop them from applying for permanent residence. Those who have lived in Korea for at least five years can apply for residency. Rai believes that the highest court’s ruling to legalize the MTU is not an end to its years-long fight, but only a new beginning. Despite the ruling, the Ministry of Employment and Labor is yet to authorize its establishment, demanding several changes to its union rules. The ministry argued that the union’s bylaws included politically-oriented clauses opposing the Employment Permit System and calling for people working here illegally to be given visas.Discrimination against migrant workers is also still rampant in Korean society. Rep. Kweon Seong-dong of the ruling Saenuri Party recently enraged migrant workers by suggesting that foreign workers should not be entitled to the minimum wage. The wage hike will benefit them “excessively,” he said. “I want to question the qualification of the lawmaker,” Rai said, lamenting that a lawmaker from a developed country like Korea could have such a backward perception. Korean public sentiment remains divided over migrant workers, with many accusing them of stealing jobs from low-income Koreans. But the MTU leader said foreign workers were “necessary” to support Korea’s export-driven economy amid the low birthrate and graying population. “There are already many factories that cannot operate without foreign laborers,” he said. Throughout the interview, Rai stressed “solidarity” among Korean and foreign laborers against capitalists who are only after profits. “Koreans and migrant workers are friends, not enemies,” he said. “We should join forces to fight against the employers and the government trying to reform the labor market (to make it flexible) for their sake.” “If we work together, there is nothing we cannot do.” By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","seoul last week the victory ,migrants working in korea illegally ,office in seoul last week ,korean government to win legal ,sundays after his korean colleagues","['South Korea ’s', 'Korea', 'Udaya Rai', 'korean', 'Rai', 'the Korea Herald', 'Seoul', 'Nepali', 'Korean', 'the Supreme Court', 'the Ministry of Employment and Labor ’s', 'Udaya Rai', 'the Seoul - Gyeonggi - Incheon Migrants ’ Trade Union', 'the Korea Herald', 'Seoul', 'Ock Hyun - ju', 'the Korea', 'Seoul', 'the Ministry of Employment', 'Labor', 'the Supreme Court', 'Rai', 'Michel Caturia', 'Korea', 'Philippines', 'EPS', 'Korea', 'Nepal', 'Korea', 'the Industrial Trainee System', 'nepalese', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'Rai', 'Rai', 'Korea', 'the Industrial Trainee System', 'Korea', 'Rai', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'the Employment Permit System', 'Korea', 'EPS', 'central asian', 'Korea', 'south korean', 'Korea', 'Rai', 'EPS', 'EPS', 'EPS', 'Rai', 'EPS', 'Korea', 'Rai', 'korean', 'the Labor Ministry', 'korean', 'the United Nation ’s International Labor Organization', 'Korea', 'Amnesty International', 'Korea', 'Rai', 'Rai', 'EPS', 'Rai', 'EPS', 'Rai', 'Korea', 'Rai', 'the Ministry of Employment and Labor', 'the Employment Permit System', 'korean', 'Kweon Seong - dong', 'Saenuri Party', 'Rai', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Koreans', 'Korea', 'Rai', 'korean', 'Koreans', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67384952  0.4034988

(Yonhap)The move came a week after NPAD approved its reform committee’s draft plans that aim to overhaul the party leadership. The NPAD leadership has been criticized for failing to address the party’s in-house conflicts among different factions. “If power is concentrated in the hands of few people, it will inevitably cause a problem,” said Kim Sang-kon, head of NPAD’s reform committee. “The party’s revised regulation will prevent few party members from dominating the power and give more say to the people and ordinary party members,” said Kim. The revision includes other measures such as holding out the party’s nomination for those NPAD members who lost their post due to corruption charges. Besides, NPAD decided to build a new in-house audit system and remove party members involved in corruption. The party, however, decided to postpone the discussion over other thorny issues such as a plan to abolish the Supreme Council and establish an evaluation committee to assess the performance of its elected officials. “We will discuss other reform measures in the next September session,” said NPAD chairman Moon Jae-in. “If we reach an agreement (on those issues), we will be able to see the party achieve its goal of sharing power with ordinary party officials,” said Moon.

But of course, (Japan) will never renounce its claim to Dokdo. Thus, it will likely maintain the same expression it has used to refer to Dokdo, rather than adopting more provocative terms.”According to the Japanese media, the focal point of this year’s defense white paper will be the security challenges from China that has been increasingly aggressive in its territorial disputes involving the South China Sea.China has been turning numerous rocks and reefs in the Spratly Islands into artificial islands to construct military bases equipped with naval harbors, airstrips, radar facilities and other equipment, and this is regarded by the U.S. and Japan as a move to ultimately alter the regional status quo.Kyodo News reported earlier this month that Tokyo’s defense white paper would mention that China has been continuing with “coercive measures” in the South China Sea. China has asserted its claim to the South China Sea with “the nine-dashed-line” ― a maritime demarcation line that takes in more than 80 percent of the 3.5 million-square-kilometer sea. Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei have engaged in intense maritime territorial squabbles with China.The Japanese media also said the 2015 white paper would touch on North Korea’s push to develop a nuclear-tipped submarine-launched ballistic missile, describing it as a “seriously destabilizing factor” to escalate tensions on the peninsula.Observers say that the content regarding Dokdo in the white paper may not seriously damage Korea-Japan relations given that the claim is expected as it has appeared in the paper for the last decade.Japan incorporated Dokdo as part of its territory in 1905 before colonizing the entire peninsula. Korea has been in effective control of the islets with a small coast guard unit posted there since its liberation in 1945.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","its cabinet on tuesday drawing ,tokyo 2015 defense white paper ,white paper further infuriated koreans ,cabinet on tuesday drawing keen ,cabinet on tuesday drawing","['Tokyo', 'Cabinet', 'South Korea ’s', 'japanese', 'South Korea', 'Koreans', 'korean', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Nam Chang - hee', 'Inha University', 'China', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'China', 'China', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Kyodo News', 'Tokyo', 'China', 'China', 'Vietnam', 'Philippines', 'Malaysia', 'Taiwan', 'Brunei', 'China', 'japanese', 'North Korea ’s', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Song Sang - ho']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.25841138  0.29774463

(Yonhap)The Daegu District Court issued the warrant, viewing the senior as a flight risk and citing the possibility of evidence being destroyed. The 82-year-old woman, only identified by her surname Park, is suspected of poisoning her six neighbors with a soft drink containing pesticide last Tuesday during a community meeting at a small village in Sangju, North Gyeongsang Province.The suspect has flatly denied the police accusations, claiming that someone “viciously” framed her. The suspect was at the scene, but didn’t call the police when she saw her neighbors collapsing after sipping the soda containing insecticide, according to investigators. The North Gyeongsang Provincial Police Agency probing the case Friday afternoon detained her and charged her with murder.Two died and four others fell into critical condition. One woman later regained consciousness. Park became a key suspect after the police found a capless bottle of a health drink containing insecticide, the same substance used in the poisoned soda, at her residence Friday.The 1.5-liter soda bottle shared by the neighbors had a cap from the health drink on it, raising suspicions that Park had put the insecticide in the soda bottle, but mistakenly changed the lid.Police also found other bottles of the same drink inside her residence that had the same expiration date as the health drink containing the toxic substance. Adding to suspicions, Park was the only one who didn’t drink the contaminated soda pop at the time. The pesticide was also detected in her clothes and on the handlebars of her electronic scooter, according to the National Forensic Service.The suspect, however, maintained that she did not know anything about the health drink bottle found near her residence. She also explained that she had the toxic substance on her clothes after wiping froth from the mouth of one of the collapsed neighbors.Investigators tried to give Park a lie detector test, but the suspect refused without understanding what the test was for, according to police.They are currently questioning village residents to gather evidence and ascertain the motive for the crime, the police said. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","pesticide last tuesday during community ,of poisoning her six neighbors ,her neighbors collapsing after sipping ,murder two died and four ,drink containing pesticide last tuesday","['Daegu District Court', 'Park', 'Sangju', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'the North Gyeongsang Provincial Police Agency', 'Park', 'the National Forensic Service', 'Park']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37582269 -0.13370356

The National Intelligence Service agent surnamed Lim, 45, was found dead Saturday in his car on a mountain road in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province. He died of asphyxiation, according to officials in their autopsy report, concluding that he had killed himself. A three-page handwritten will was found on the car’s passenger seat.  A police officer shows s suicide note left by a deceased spy agent at Yongin Dongbu Police Station on Sunday. (Yonhap)“There was no monitoring of civilians or election affairs,” Lim wrote. The agent also wrote that he had “mistakenly” deleted files out of fears that they could cause misunderstandings over NIS’ counterterror operations and further tarnish the spy agency’s reputation. “I deleted the data about counterterrorism activities and secret operations on North Korea, considering that the NIS was more important than the possible impacts that can be caused,” he wrote.“This was my mistake based on bad judgement, but there is nothing to worry about concerning my actions.”Lim’s death added fuel to a deepening controversy that the spy agency used a hacking program bought from Italian firm Hacking Team to bug civilians’ smartphones. The spy agency admitted the purchase of the program but said it was used only to strengthen cyberwarfare capabilities against Pyongyang and to monitor people in foreign territories who had suspicious ties to the North.Lim, who was a veteran cybersecurity expert with more than 20 years’ experience, was the agent who bought and operated the Hacking Team software, according to Rep. Lee Cheol-woo of the ruling Saenuri Party.The note was disclosed as the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy launched an all-out attack on NIS over its alleged illegal spying on civilians.Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, a software mogul-turned-politician, claimed that the investigators should reveal the truth behind the agent’s death, citing that authorities were not clear about why the agent had killed himself.NPAD also raised skepticism that over 130 Korean Internet protocol addresses were contained in the log file that was found in the data leaked from the Italian company. “There were 138 local IPs (in the log file), and the number even reaches 300 when including the overlapping ones. The targets include mobile carrier KT, Seoul National University, the Korea Broadcasting System and even Daum Kakao,” said Rep. Shin Kyoung-min. Later in the afternoon, the NIS countered the opposition party‘s argument, saying the IP addresses had no relation to NIS’ operation but were assumed to be related to that of the Italian firm. The agency also vowed to restore the data by the deceased employee and release them to lawmakers upon their visit to the spy agency. The intelligence body is in the process of verifying what kind of data had been removed, it added. The ruling Saenuri Party, however, remained cautious about possible political strife over the hacking scandal, arguing that fact-checking must be done before reaching any conclusions.“Whenever suspicion is raised over the intelligence body, the political parties often raise skepticism first and pressure the agency. Verifying the facts in patience must be the first step,” said Saenuri Party spokesperson Rep. Kim Young-woo.

Prosecutors are investigating whether Kim received bribery in exchange. In 2010, KORES suffered a loss of 11.6 billion won ($10.3 million) after buying a 1.5 percent stake in the Ambatovy nickel operation in Madagascar for 35 billion won.Under the plan by then-President Lee, KORES and a consortium of seven South Korean companies, including Keangnam Enterprises Inc., signed a deal in 2006 to invest a combined 1.9 trillion won in the Madagascar project for a 27.5 percent stake.Keangnam Enterprises, however, failed to meet the deadline to pay for its stake of 2.75 percent. KORES picked up the tab and paid an additional 17.1 billion won on its behalf in 2008, on the condition that the firm pay it back by mid-2009.But Keangnam Enterprises fell short once again, with KORES taking over 100 percent of its stake in 2010. At the time, speculation swirled that former Keangnam Enterprises Chairman Sung Wang-jong pressured the president of KORES to purchase the stake.""The decisions were made internally without going through any government report or approval,"" Kim told reporters before entering the Seoul High Prosecutors' Office in southern Seoul, adding that he will sincerely respond to prosecutors' questions.The deal between Keangnam and KORES is one of several shady transactions surrounding the so-called energy diplomacy pushed by former President Lee.

The statements came one day after NIS chief Lee Byung-ho told lawmakers that the spy agency had never used the malware to spy on private citizens. Lee said the malware had been used to monitor likely North Korean agents residing in the South. NIS chief Lee Byung-ho (Yonhap)The ruling bloc also remained in support of the NIS. Ruling Saenuri Party legislators called suspicious opposition lawmakers “instigators” seeking to initiate meaningless political fights.But the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy appears equally adamant that it will get to the bottom of the allegations, naming former presidential candidate Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo early Wednesday to head a special panel that aims to investigate the scandal.Ahn, NPAD chair Rep. Moon Jae-in and party whip Rep. Lee Jong-kul early Thursday held a press briefing to demonstrate that hackers could download text messages from a victim’s smartphone in real time.“Even when the camera on a smartphone is not turned on by the phone’s owner, a hacker could use malware to turn the camera on without the owner knowing it,” Ahn said, as he showed the images from a smartphone being downloaded onto a separate computer monitor.Ahn, a former presidential candidate, is a software mogul who made millions of dollars by developing anti-malware.“Smartphones across the country have become instant monitoring tools for NIS agents trying to spy on ordinary citizens,” Moon added.Ahn and Moon are also widely believed to have been victims of an online smear campaign run by the NIS in the days before the 2012 presidential election. The NIS was accused of spreading unconfirmed rumors that Ahn and Moon were pro-North Korea figures, allegedly swaying public opinion in favor of Park Geun-hye, who won the election in December 2012.The public uproar over the ongoing scandal began earlier this week when local reports accused the NIS of wiretapping possibly hundreds of civilians using malware, citing the leaked emails between the intelligence agency and Hacking Team.“I hope that I can calm public fears over this scandal, just by beginning this probe,” Ahn said.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","milan italy based malware surveillance ,malware citing the leaked emails ,legislators called suspicious opposition lawmakers ,malware smartphones across the country ,italy based malware surveillance vendor","['South Koreans', 'the National Intelligence Service', 'italian', 'NIS', 'NIS', 'Hacking Team', 'Milan', 'Italy', 'NIS', 'NIS', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'NIS', 'Lee Byung - ho', 'Lee', 'north korean', 'NIS', 'Lee Byung - ho', 'NIS', 'Saenuri Party', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Ahn Cheol', 'NPAD', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Lee Jong - kul', 'NIS', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'NIS', 'NIS', 'Moon', 'Park Geun - hye', 'NIS', 'Hacking Team', 'Jeong Hunny']",12,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.78704315  0.18322287

The court found the 64-year-old guilty of “willfully” neglecting an online messaging campaign conducted by his agents to sway public opinion in favor of President Park and against her then-rival Moon Jae-in.The court recognized that 274,800 messages were illegally posted by his agents, who are required to refrain from political activities under the nation’s NIS law, after Park was nominated as a presidential candidate on Aug. 20, 2012.In the initial ruling, however, the lowest court sentenced him to two years and six months in prison, suspended for four years, clearing him of the election-meddling charge. It only confirmed his charge of breaching the NIS law by failing to remain politically neutral.The focal point in the verdict was whether to view the attached file on email messages of a NIS agent as evidence to systemically influence the election results. The email listed 269 Twitter accounts of NIS staff members.If the file is recognized as evidence, the number of messages posted to back President Park increases, which disadvantages Won in the ruling.

Is grading one’s character in the admissions process even feasible?Private education institutions, meanwhile, did not shy away from an opportunity to cash in on the plan. On the coattails of the announcement, local institutes started offering classes on how to prepare for character examinations.With the plan seeming to have more negative effects than positive ones, the ministry said in Tuesday’s media briefing that applying the character evaluations in college admissions had officially been shelved.“The character evaluation should not be calibrated for evaluation in college admissions. Although we maintain that character assessment should be an important factor in the admissions process, we are leaving it to the discretion of respective colleges and universities,” said a ministry official.While the ministry continues to stress the importance of character building, it “might as well give up” on including it in the college admissions to avoid problems, he said.The decision sparked criticism toward the ministry’s half-baked plan, and the fallacy of attempting to universally apply such abstract and individual virtues into mass education. The education circle pointed to the lack, or impossibility, of indexing “characters” into education to be applied at all schools, and that stipulating it in the law would only prompt cookie-cutter education.Plans like fostering character-building experts raised questions as well, as it lacked clear criteria. A ministry official explained that virtually anyone could apply to become one, save convicted felons, a standard that hardly appeared sufficient.“Having a law on (character building) makes it easier to enforce it on all schools. But there is also a risk of all schools just copying a system that seems to work,” Yang Jung-ho, a professor of education at Sungkyunkwan University. He explained that the character education process was likely to become standardized and ineffective, becoming just another subject students are forced to study.“It’s not a custom-fit education for each student, but a one-for-all model enforced by the law,” he said. “The best thing right now is to ensure that students receive character-building education through various experiences, not just via books.”By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","education ministry on tuesday rolled ,said in tuesday media briefing ,building education every five years ,ministry on tuesday rolled out ,tuesday media briefing that applying","['the Education Ministry', 'Park Geun', 'Yang Jung - ho', 'Sungkyunkwan University']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.313743    0.71293366

The government’s special joint investigation team said 63 officials, including 38 former and incumbent military officers, would face trials over allegations of fabricating documents or taking kickbacks while they were handling defense projects. The scale of the corruption was nearly 1 trillion won ($870 million), they said. The announcement came about eight months after the state launched a large-scale probe into irregularities in the defense acquisition programs. The joint investigation team was formed with over 100 prosecutors and military investigators, the largest joint probe scale in history. Of the 38 indicted military officers, the navy accounted for the most with 28, followed by the air force and army with six and four, respectively. Ten of the 38 were either former or incumbent generals or admirals, officials said. Document fabrication, property crimes and bribery were the most common charges.  The lack of a monitoring system, the exclusive military culture and moral laxity contributed to the corruption, investigators claimed.“As it has been confirmed that the arm project corruption was a systematic irregularity accumulated over a long period, (the joint probe team) will extend the probe to the end of this year to root out the deep-seated crime,” the investigators said.

Expectations are high on what roles the two middle-grounders would play amid a deepening internal feud between loyalists to President Park Geun-hye and members of the nonmainstream faction within the party.Rep. Won Yoo-chul, new floor leader of the ruling Saenuri Party, speaks at a news conference on Tuesday. (Yonhap)Rep. Won Yoo-chul, a four-term lawmaker known as a well-rounded conservative-centrist, was named the new Saenuri floor leader at an inter-party race, taking on the hefty task of mending ties with the presidential office. Won’s running mate, three-term lawmaker Kim Jung-hoon, will serve as the party’s chief policymaker. Like Won, Kim, a lawyer-turned-lawmaker, is known to be a middle-of-the-road politician who forged amicable relationships not only with pro-Park members but also with those in the nonmainstream faction. Rep. Won, representing Pyeongtaek in Gyeonggi Province, won the election uncontested. He replaces his former running mate and former floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min, who resigned from the post last week after resisting blatant pressure from the presidential office and the pro-Park faction. Won urged the easing of tension between the party and Cheong Wa Dae, stressing that it is a critical time for both to restore ties ahead of general elections next year and the presidential election in 2017.“Without the success of the Park administration, there will be no (bright) future for South Korea, nor also for the Saenuri Party,” Won said in his acceptance speech.Kim also vowed to have a weekly meeting between the party and Cheong Wa Dae to immediately respond to issues closely related to people’s lives. The new whip said he also would sit down at the negotiation table with the main opposition party by keeping basic principles in mind, defying concerns that he would follow Yoo in going against Park’s major policies. Park, in a rare strong tone, singled out Yoo for swapping her reform bill with a parliamentary bill pushed by the opposition party. Park’s sharp criticism sparked a brutal in-party feud between her ardent supporters and those who recently opposed the president and her hierarchical stance in the party.Hoping to move beyond the bitter battle between the party and Cheong Wa Dae, the Saenuri’s new whip and top policymaker are set to meet with President Park on Thursday.The decision was made after Saenuri leader Kim Moo-sung met with Park’s new political aide Hyun Ki-hwan on Tuesday morning.

The allegations come amid increasing public distrust in the spy agency, which is accused of meddling in the 2012 presidential elections.NIS chief Lee Byung-ho confirmed the purchase of the malware, but denied having used them against ordinary citizens, adding that the malware was used to monitor “up to 20 North Korean spies,” according to lawmakers who questioned him at a closed-door parliamentary inquiry Tuesday.NIS chief Lee Byung-ho at the National Assembly, Tuesday. (Yonhap)The NIS agreed to open its facilities to opposition lawmakers still unconvinced by Lee, at a “to be determined” time and date, main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy Rep. Shin Kyoung-min said. “Hopefully before this week ends,” Shin said.“The malware was purchased by 35 governments worldwide and used in 97 law enforcement agencies,” Saenuri Rep. Lee Cheol-woo said. “The information became public because Hacking Team had been hacked themselves.”Local reports earlier Tuesday accused the NIS of obtaining malicious software and using it to hack the smartphones of at least two unnamed local citizens. The reports cited email records between suspected NIS agents and Hacking Team.The NIS allegedly purchased Samsung smartphones, produced and used locally, to send sample devices to Hacking Team in Milan each year. The Italian firm used the phones to provide technical assistance in designing malware that could infecct the phones and KakaoTalk, a popular messaging app.Email records available on WikiLeaks also allege that Hacking Team was in contact with Nanatech, a South Korean firm allegedly subcontracted by the NIS, since at least November 2010, suggesting the alleged illegal wiretapping could have been going on for years.Opposition lawmakers expressed disgust at the allegations.“This is a serious allegation that must be looked into by a parliamentary investigation,” minor opposition Justice Party Rep. Jeong Jin-hoo said.“The media reports that have raised the allegations appear to be highly credible, especially after having looked at the email records cited in the stories,” main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy spokesman Rep. Kim Yung-rok said.Activists hold a rally in front of the National Assembly, Tuesday, urging the NIS to ""reveal the truth."" (Yonhap)The allegations come amid rising public distrust here in the country’s top intelligence agency. Courts convicted senior NIS officials of conducting online smear campaigns, days before the 2012 presidential election, against liberal candidates running against the conservative Park Geun-hye.Authorities found records showing that NIS agents had spread unconfirmed rumors on main opposition Reps.

The Seoul Central District Court ruled that a woman, whose information was withheld, should pay 5 million won ($4,400) to her former junior female staffer as she breached the human dignity of the victim by making sexual jokes. The defendant was accused of sexually harassing the employee by asking “What did you do last night with a guy?” after seeing an atrophic scar on the victim’s neck on her second day of work.  The harasser also asked her victim whether she had ever delivered a baby before, saying, “Your hair looks just like that of a mother who gave birth to a child.”The victim reported the harassment to the company, but no measures were taken. She then quit the job.Four months later, the company punished the superior with a “reprimand” after the victim reported the case again to the company. While the defendant apologized to the junior worker later and the company offered to pay the victim a salary of five months, the victim took legal action against both her former superior and the company last year and sought 30 million won in compensation. The company had claimed that it was not accountable for the case, as it has periodically conducted anti-sexual harassment campaigns for employees. The court, however, held that the company did bear some responsibility, as the case involved a worker who was in charge of supervising other workers.

Earlier in March, Korean Air flight attendant Kim Do-hee filed a suit against her former boss Cho Hyun-ah in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, seeking compensation for damages inflicted on her career and emotional well-being during last year's in-flight commotion widely known as the nut rage incident. ""(The former executive) filed a motion to dismiss the case in New York earlier this morning,"" said one of Cho's legal representatives.  Cho's legal team said the case should be reviewed in South Korea for the sake of efficiency, citing difficulties for a U.S. court to handle the case given that the Asian country is home to both the plaintiff and defendant, and that all related documents are currently written in Korean.  Ex-Korean Air VP Cho Hyun-ah (Yonhap)The latest dismissal request requires the plaintiff to provide a response to the court by July 29.

The party constitution and regulations will also be revised to hold out party nominations for members who have lost their status due to corruption, establish in-house audit system and remove party membership from those involved with corruption.The draft, voted in approval by the administrative committee, will be further dissected at the central committee opening on July 20.The draft, however, excludes testier proposals set by the reform committee, including an option to abolish the Supreme Council and to form an evaluation committee to assess their elected public officials. The reform committee had pointed out that the current Supreme Council made up of the party’s senior members via election has turned into a trench line of factional leaders. But the ideas had been opposed by the so-called non-mainstreamers for allegedly bestowing higher authority to the current party leadership, who will be able to designate members to the newly forming committees.NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in, meanwhile, expressed optimism that the reform drive was finally moving. “The reform plans have been accepted after active discussion.

Kim Moo-sung. (Yonhap)Kim’s statements appeared to be designed to deflect recent criticism from the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy denouncing an ugly in-house fight in the Saenuri Party that peaked last week. President Park Geun-hye had pressured the Saenuri whip Rep. Yoo Seong-min to resign, after Yoo sponsored a bill that Park objected to. Yoo quit last week, saying he had tried to uphold democratic principles. The NPAD said the feud showed how “undemocratic” the ruling party was.Rep. Yoo Seong-min. (Yonhap)“One year ago, when I was elected party chair, I promised you I would make this party fair and democratic,” the Saenuri Party’s Kim said, as dozens of seated party officials and reporters listened on behind flashing news cameras.“If there is one thing I would like to leave behind, it is the creation of a truly democratic candidate-selection system,” Kim added. The current nomination process only worsened factionalism by compelling junior politicians to choose an influential senior to pander to, Kim said.The main opposition party’s spokesman Rep. Kim Yung-rok said the party would “favorably consider the idea,” adding the NPAD had agreed that the nomination process for candidates to major elections had to become fairer.Saenuri Rep. Kim also proposed ditching the 2012 revisions to the National Assembly Act that allowed the minority party to stall bills from going to a plenary vote, saying they hampered the core principle of majority voting. The NPAD disagreed, saying that the revisions had prevented the tyranny of the majority.The Saenuri Party chair also pledged to kick-start the economy, citing recent tallies from the Bank of Korea that lowered this year’s expected growth rate from 3.1 percent to 2.8 percent last week.“I will stick to the ‘three goes’ during the remainder of my term as chair,” Kim said. “I will democratize the candidate selection system, revive the economy, and win in next year’s general elections.”By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","pick candidates before major polls ,year parliamentary elections on monday ,primaries for next year parliamentary ,parliamentary elections on monday ,nationwide open primaries for next","['Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Saenuri', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Park', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'the Saenuri Party ’s Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim Yung - rok', 'NPAD', 'Saenuri', 'Kim', 'the National Assembly Act', 'NPAD', 'the Saenuri Party', 'the Bank of Korea', 'Kim', 'Jeong Hunny']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51496887  0.69165033

Kim Moo-sung. Kim and Hyun, both from Busan, are seen as having built close relations over the years, calling each other “brother.”Citing the amicable relationship between Kim and Hyun, some officials at the ruling party said that his first job at Cheong Wa Dae will be arranging a meeting between the president and the party chief -- a prerequisite for showing the public that they have come to a settlement after the bickering that has roiled the conservative bloc for weeks.  Hyun Ki-hwan (Yonhap)Hyun also faces a pressing issue of reactivating stalled trilateral talks among the presidential office, the government and the ruling party. Park has come under great pressure to support those affected by Middle East respiratory syndrome and revitalize the nation’s economy, which has been hit hard by the public fear over the disease. To do so, she needs to have her bill on a supplementary budget approved by the legislature, and thus the support of the majority Saenuri Party. Cheong Wa Dae and the Saenuri Party have drifted apart since May, when the Saenuri leadership, then headed by the former party whip Rep. Yoo Seong-min, signed a controversial legislative deal with the main opposition party. Under the deal, the Saenuri Party extracted a promise from the New Politics Alliance for Democracy to pass a reform bill on the civil servants’ pension in exchange for accepting the opposition party’s demand to endorse a revision to a National Assembly law. The bill was to enable lawmakers to challenge the government’s administrative power. This 2009 file photo shows President Park Geun-hye, the then chairwoman of Grand National Party, talking to Hyun Ki-hwan who was also a parliamentary member. (Yonhap)Tensions peaked when Park vetoed the National Assembly Act revision on June 25 and lambasted the Saenuri floor leadership for neglecting their role. It led to weeks of heavy in-house feuding and eventually the resignation of floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min last week. Park’s fierce criticism, however, generated strong resistance from her party and bolstered Yoo’s clout.The interparty feud appears to be settled for the time being after Yoo’s resignation. However, questions remain whether Hyun, a steadfast pro-Park politician, can bridge the two factions and initiate smooth cooperation with the new Saenuri floor leadership. Rep. Won Woo-cheol, regarded as a nonmainstream lawmaker, is likely to assume the post of Saenuri floor leader, suggesting the power game between the two factions in the party is only beginning.It is also doubtful whether Hyun will be a versatile enough mediator to resolve the different needs and demands between Park and her party. Upon being named to the position, Hyun described his job as “a mere messenger” to Park, whom he treasures as “a mother-like figure” in his political career.Hyun was elected for the 18th National Assembly, serving 2008 to 2012. He has been an ardent supporter of Park since she ran for the party’s presidential candidacy in 2007. Before entering politics, Hyun worked for the Federation of Korean Trade Union, one of South Korea’s two largest labor umbrella groups.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","new top political aide faces ,the new senior presidential secretary ,hye new top political aide ,new top political aide ,her top political aide","['Park Geun - hye', 'Hyun Ki - hwan', 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'Kim', 'Hyun', 'Busan', 'Kim', 'Hyun', 'Hyun Ki - hwan', 'Yonhap)Hyun', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'the Saenuri Party', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'National Assembly', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Grand National Party', 'Hyun Ki - hwan', 'Park', 'the National Assembly Act', 'Saenuri', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Park ’s', 'Hyun', 'Saenuri', 'Won Woo', 'Saenuri', 'Hyun', 'Park', 'Park', 'National Assembly', 'Park', 'Hyun', 'the Federation of Korean Trade Union', 'South Korea ’s', 'Cho Chung - un']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64711398  0.4744029

The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy backs a smaller budget, saying the proposed bill includes funds unrelated to boosting the economy.But the parties agree the extra budget bill must be passed this month if it is to boost the struggling economy within the year, suggesting a compromise could come before the final vote on the bill scheduled for later this month, as agreed upon by the parties last week. The National Assembly's main hall during last Friday's plenary meeting. Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn can be seen on the screen addressing lawmakers on the proposed supplementary budget. (Yonhap)“The budget bill needs to be passed within the month for it to have any effect on the economy after the MERS outbreak,” NPAD Rep. An Min-suk said. “But that doesn’t mean we should give it a cursory review.”The Bank of Korea last Thursday reported the expected growth rate for this year at 2.8 percent, down from a prediction of 3.1 percent in April. Officials here have cited slumping consumer spending that worsened in the recent Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak and droughts that have mostly affected the northern parts of the country as major sources for the lagging growth.The Park administration announced the supplementary budget bill to provide relief to the affected areas and hospitals. But critics of the government budget bill have asserted the supplementary spending plan includes money irrelevant to the relief plans and equivocal plans that appear to hint that the bill was hastily written by Finance Ministry officials.The National Assembly Budget Office reported Sunday that the 400 million won earmarked in the budget for loans to medical centers that treated MERS patients had “unclear” financing plans. The same report added that 16 spending proposals in the budget bill “seemed difficult to complete this year.”The NPAD also asserts that the ruling party sneaked in spending plans that appear to be aimed at appeasing regional voters ahead of next year’s parliamentary elections. The NPAD pointed out the 1.2 trillion won planned for funding 18 roads and 15 railroad construction projects.The main opposition party charged that 5.6 trillion won, nearly half of the supplementary budget bill, was inserted by Park officials anxious to plug tax revenue shortfalls.NPAD Rep. Kang Gi-jung, the main opposition party’s policy committee chief, said his party would support the government’s budget bill if the Park administration offered an apology for the shortfalls and a raise in corporate taxes. Saenuri Party Rep. Won Yoo-chul (left) meets reporters at the National Assembly, Sunday, after submitting his application to run in Tuesday’s floor leader election.

The reduction of 40,000 will be completed by the end of fiscal year 2018, it said.The troop reduction is driven by automatic spending cuts requirements known as “sequestration.”The Army further warned that unless the budget constraints are addressed, the next round of troop cuts will leave the Army with only 420,000 soldiers by the end of fiscal year 2019.“Troop levels in Korea remain the same for now. However, the next round of cuts (down to 420,000) may impact South Korea,” Lt. Col. Joe Buccino, an Army spokesman, told Yonhap News Agency.Currently, about 28,500 American troops are stationed in South Korea to help deter threats from North Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War that ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, which left the divided peninsula still technically at war.Cdr. Bill Urban, a Pentagon spokesman, said the first round of cuts in the next two years “will not affect troop strength levels in the Republic of Korea.” He said the Army force structure cuts were first announced in February when President Barack Obama submitted the defense budget to Congress.Should the Army troop levels drop to 420,000 by 2019, it would mean “a cumulative loss of 150,000 soldiers from the regular Army, a 26 percent cut over a seven-year period,” the Army warned in the announcement.“The resulting force would be incapable of simultaneously meeting current deployment requirements and responding to the overseas contingency requirements of the combatant commands,” it said.","troop reduction driven by budget ,an army official said thursday ,2019 troop levels in korea ,loss of 150 000 soldiers ,53 korean war that ended","['WASHINGTON', 'the U.S. Army ’s', 'South Korea', 'american', 'asian', 'Army', 'Army', 'Army', 'Army', 'Army', 'Korea', 'South Korea', 'Joe Buccino', 'Army', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'american', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Bill Urban', 'Pentagon', 'the Republic of Korea', 'Army', 'Barack Obama', 'Congress', 'Army', 'Army', 'Army']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46572086  0.22076483

In both 2004 and 2011, the court ruled the law constitutional. A member of a civic group supporting conscientious objectors holds a protest outside the Constitutional Court in Jongno-gu, Seoul, Thursday. (Yonhap)Korean law stipulates that anyone who refuses military duty without justifiable cause is subjectable to imprisonment of up to three years. “As of now, 43 prisons across the country are holding 706 young men who rejected military service based on their beliefs,” said Oh Du-jin, a legal representative of the conscientious objectors who filed a petition against the law. “The freedom of conscientious objection is a basic right that should be respected in all situations, and we believe it is the court’s duty to protect their rights.”Lawyers for the objectors stressed that their clients did not seek to dodge military duties, but simply wanted to substitute them with nonviolent duties. Mandating a more demanding task than military duty for the objectors could be an option, they said. They also emphasized that Article 18 of the International Covenants on Human Rights recognizes the conscientious objection of military duties, while claiming that recognizing that conscientious objection is a global trend. Countries such as Austria, Greece and Switzerland provide options of performing civilian services instead of joining the military. In some countries like Greece, the civilian service period is longer than the corresponding military service.Legal representatives of the Defense Ministry, however, refuted by saying that the unique situation on the Korean Peninsula makes it hard to compare to any other country.“As the world’s only divided country, it is crucial for (Korea) to carry out conscription as fairly as possible to procure sufficient manpower for the military. To do so, we must ensure that military duty is imposed on everyone equally,” said Seo Gyu-yeong, a lawyer for the Defense Ministry.He added that while individuals’ freedom is important, the national security is the indispensable precursor to protect the freedom and rights of all people.As 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, South and North Koreas are still technically at war with each other. South Korean law stipulates that all able-bodied men must serve in the military for at least 21 months between ages 18 and 35. The service period varies according to branches: 21 months for the Army and the Marine Corp., 23 for the Navy and 24 for the Air Force.According to the Military Manpower Administration, 6,090 people from 2004 to 2013 have rejected the mandatary military service due to their religion and various other reasons. Most notable among conscientious objectors in South Korea are Jehovah’s Witnesses, who refuse to use weapons or partake in combat training.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","held public court hearing thursday ,conscription law after three conscientious ,thursday on the conscription law ,public court hearing thursday ,public court hearing thursday on","['the Constitutional Court', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Jongno - gu', 'Seoul', 'Du - jin', 'Austria', 'Greece', 'Switzerland', 'Greece', 'the Defense Ministry', 'Korea', 'Seo Gyu - yeong', 'the Defense Ministry', 'North Koreas', 'south korean', 'Army', 'the Marine Corp.', 'Navy', 'the Air Force', 'the Military Manpower Administration', 'South Korea', 'Jehovah ’s', 'Yoon Min - sik']",16,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.39023796 0.10759044 0.45860893]

Though it marks the highest raise in eight years, labor unions said it was still insufficient to improve low-wage workers’ lives, while employers claimed it put a strain on smaller businesses. Employers’ representatives, labor experts and government officials of the Minimum Wage Council agreed to increase the minimum wage by 8.1 percent next year at the final negotiations that continued into early hours of Thursday.  (Yonhap)The labor bloc boycotted the meeting in opposition to labor experts’ earlier suggestion to put a cap on how much to raise the minimum wage.At a previous round of talks that dragged on until early Wednesday, labor experts proposed that the rate for the minimum wage hike should be between 6.5 percent and 9.7 percent, prompting the workers’ representatives to walk out of the negotiations in protest. The Minimum Wage Act stipulates that at least one-third of representatives from trade unions and employers should participate in a vote to decide the minimum wage. But if one party refuses to attend the negotiations more than once, the vote can go ahead without that party. Out of 27 representatives, the remaining 18, including nine labor experts and seven employers, put the revised proposal to a vote Thursday morning without laborers, where 15 voted in favor, one against and two abstained.The 8.1 percent wage hike marks the biggest jump since President Park Geun-hye took office in 2013. This year’s minimum wage saw a 7.1 percent rise from a year earlier, while last year‘s rate was raised by 7.2 percent from the previous year.  The hourly wage of 6,030 won translates to 48,240 won a day and 1.26 million won a month for those who work eight hours a day. The pay raise will affect an estimated 3.42 million low-income workers, according to the Minimum Wage Council.But the 8.1 percent hike immediately sparked protests from both the labor and business blocs. “The 70 million low-income earners, who have expected a double-digit growth in the minimum wage as proposed by Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan, feel betrayed and disappointed by the decision,” the Federation of Korean Trade Unions, the nation’s largest trade union, said in a press release. Choi has supported a “fast-paced” hike in the minimum wage to spur wage-led economic growth through increased domestic spending. The Korea Employers Federation, for its part, expressed deep regret over what it viewed as a “drastic increase” in the minimum wage. “We regret the decision to drastically raise the minimum wage, defying small and medium-sized employers’ complaints of (the need of help for) survival amid worsening economic conditions,” the employers’ organization said, pointing out that the 8.1 percent increase was far more than the inflation rate of 0.5 percent. Meanwhile, labor and business circles agreed to stipulate both hourly and monthly wages in the employment contract to protect laborers’ right to be paid for 48 hours of labor when working 40 hours a week. Currently, only hourly wages are written in the contract, which labor experts and workers in the council saw as giving leeway for employers to dodge legal obligations.Negotiations among employees, employers and labor experts collapsed several times due to continued clashes over the extent of the hike, failing to meet a June 29 legal deadline. The labor unions initially demanded a 79 percent rise from the current minimum wage at 5,580 won to 10,000 won, while employers campaigned for a freeze.But after the negotiations failed to meet a legal deadline, both sides presented revised proposals to secure a deal through additional discussions. At Wednesday’s meeting, the business leaders suggested that the minimum wage be 5,715 won, while laborers proposed 8,100 won.The Korea Employers Federation has claimed that the minimum wage has risen too rapidly and it needs to be stabilized, voicing concerns over possible job losses and soaring production costs, especially for smaller companies. The nation’s trade unions have maintained that the hike would curb the nation’s income inequality, improve living conditions for low-income workers and revitalize the faltering domestic economy by boosting consumer spending. Since the government adopted the minimum wage in 1989, the Minimum Wage Council, a trilateral committee of employers, employees and labor specialists including labor-related government officials, has set the minimum wage through discussion. This year, the discussion began in early June. There is still room for a change to the rate as the Ministry of Employment and Labor offers a 20-day period for both labor and management to express their objections before making public the agreed minimum wage rate for next year on Aug. 5. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","hour after weeks of debate ,wage hike marks the biggest ,vote thursday morning without laborers ,10 000 won while employers ,highest raise in eight years","['the Minimum Wage Council', 'Park Geun', 'the Minimum Wage Council', 'Finance', 'Choi Kyung - hwan', 'the Federation of Korean Trade Unions', 'Choi', 'the Korea Employers Federation', 'the Korea Employers Federation', 'the Minimum Wage Council', 'the Ministry of Employment']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66864324  0.42082947

Yoo Seong-min leaves with a higher political profile according to local polls, particularly among voters frustrated with the ruling bloc officials who had hoped that Yoo’s departure would end the intraparty feuding between the pro-Park and non-Park forces. Yoo appeared to hint that he would continue to oppose policies of the Park administration that he disagreed with, saying that South Korea was a democratic country that took orders from the people. Rep. Yoo Seong-min announces his resignation as the Saenuri Party`s floor leader at the National Assembly on Wednesday. (Park Hae-mook/The Korea Herald)“The reason I did not step down for the past two weeks, despite the pressure, was that I wanted to uphold our Constitution that declares the Republic of Korea a democratic country, whatever ramification that could have had on my political career,” Yoo said. “I will continue to pursue my belief that our politics can go beyond partisan differences, that I can achieve my dream of becoming a just and warm conservative, always striving to compromise on differences, and stand by the citizens of this country.”The embattled third-term lawmaker had been under pressure to forfeit his post since late last month when President Park Geun-hye called him a “traitor” who should be voted out of office during a nationally televised Cabinet meeting.Park was referring to Yoo’s sponsorship of a bill she vetoed that proposed giving the legislature the power to ask for changes to executive decrees that appeared to undermine existing laws. Park had called the bill unconstitutional as it violated the principle of checks and balances.Park loyalists in the Saenuri Party, widely known as the “pro-Park” faction, thereafter repeatedly demanded Yoo’s resignation for his role in sponsoring the possibly unconstitutional bill.Yoo sympathizers, though, said the president’s followers were trying to kick out anti-Park legislators from key party posts before next year’s parliamentary elections. Yoo sympathizers called Park a bully trying to commandeer the party.The high-profile feud raised Yoo’s popularity according to a weekly poll by Realmeter in the fourth week of June that surveyed 2,500 adults nationwide.Yoo rose to fourth from sixth on the list of possible presidential candidates in the ruling bloc, ahead of former Saenuri Party lawmaker Chung Mong-joon and South Gyeongsang Province governor Hong Joon-pyo.The poll had a 95 percent confidence level and a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percent.The tit-for-tat verbal war between the two factions continued for 13 days before tensions climaxed early Wednesday when the Saenuri Party convened a closed-door party caucus in Seoul’s National Assembly. After a four-hour debate the caucus presented Yoo with a resolution urging him to resign “for the sake of the party and the Park administration.”No confidence vote on Yoo was taken, despite such requests from Yoo sympathizers including second-term Rep. Kim Yong-tae. Pro-Park legislators and party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung cited the absence of party rules that authorized a confidence vote on an incumbent floor leader.Yoo apologized for the recent in-house fight.“I would like to foremost apologize to the ordinary citizens of our country struggling to make ends meet. I have disappointed many.”“But I was also able to ask myself why, for the past 16 years, I have remained in politics,” Yoo said.“I have always believed that in the end, it is politics that brings change, despite the fact that we politicians are consistently criticized, satirized and denounced.”“I am ready to face any criticism of my stubbornness during the last two weeks to uphold justice, the rule of law and principles.”The party is now to decide how to elect the next floor leader, with party rules specifying that the successor must be named within seven days.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","voters frustrated with the ruling ,politicians are consistently criticized satirized ,party whip announced his resignation ,incumbent floor leader yoo apologized ,kick out anti park legislators","['Park Geun', 'Saenuri', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Yoo', 'non - park', 'South Korea', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Saenuri', 'the National Assembly', 'Park Hae - mook', 'the Korea', 'the Republic of Korea', 'Yoo', 'Park Geun', 'Cabinet', 'Yoo', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Yoo', 'anti - park', 'Park', 'Yoo', 'Saenuri Party', 'Chung Mong - joon', 'South Gyeongsang Province', 'Hong Joon - pyo', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Seoul', 'National Assembly', 'Yoo', 'Yoo', 'Kim Yong - tae', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Yoo', '”“I', 'Jeong Hunny']",11,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.326381    0.19979095

Kang, who was later nicknamed “cream bread dad,” died on the spot. (Yonhap)“The victim’s jaywalking should be recognized as wrong, but the accused could have avoided the accident if he had been careful enough while driving, given that there were no major obstacles on the road,” the judge said in the ruling. The accident triggered a wave of public sympathy after it was revealed that Kang called his pregnant wife just before the accident to apologize for buying her a buttercream-stuffed bun, instead of a cake she asked for, because he didn’t have enough money. Kang’s story immediately prompted a nationwide hunt for the hit-and-run driver, which pressured Heo to turn himself in.The court recognized that the defendant had sincerely repented and the victim’s family also asked for leniency. But the judge handed down the prison term, taking into account Heo’s attempt to conceal his crime despite being aware that the police had tracked him.  The defendant claimed that he wasn’t aware of hitting Kang at the time. Heo admitted that he drove after drinking four bottles of soju, but the court cleared him of drunk driving for lack of evidence. The hit-and-run driver gave himself up nearly three weeks after the accident took place, which made it impossible to gather physical evidence of whether he was driving under the influence of alcohol.Last month, prosecutors sought a five-year prison sentence for Heo, accusing him of attempting to destroy evidence and failing to reflect on himself.  Upon the ruling, Heo expressed gratitude to the victim’s family for understanding his circumstances. It is not yet decided whether he will file an appeal, Heo’s lawyer said.

YonhapJapan’s denial of forced labor has dampened the emergent mood for a thaw in the bilateral relationship that was forged as the two countries marked the 50th anniversary last month of the normalization of diplomatic relations.The popup message on the South Korean Foreign Ministry’s website carried the full statements that South Korea’s Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and Japan‘s Ambassador to UNESCO Kuni Sato made at Sunday’s WHC session.In his statement, Cho said the WHC’s decision to note the forced Korean labor marked another important step toward healing historical wounds and reaffirming that the historical truth of the unfortunate past should also be reflected in an objective manner.The message also carried a press release detailing Tokyo’s pledges to take measures to commemorate Korean victims of forced labor during the colonial era including establishing an information center about the victims.Based on Sato’s English statement, the Seoul government believes that Tokyo, for the first time, acknowledged its wartime recruitment of forced laborers from the Korean Peninsula.But Tokyo argues that the expression “forced to work” in its WHC statement is different from the expression “forced labor or compulsory labor,” which is banned by the 1932 Forced Labor Convention to which Japan is also party.It also maintains that bilateral colonial-era issues, including the issue of forced labor and wartime sexual slavery, were settled under a 1965 bilateral treaty that normalized diplomatic relations between the two sides.Media reports in Korea and Japan said that by refusing to accept the facts about forced labor, Tokyo appears to be trying to circumvent public criticism, particularly from conservatives, that it succumbed to Korean pressure to recognize the use of forced labor at some of the sites.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com )","korea foreign ministry on tuesday ,in bonn germany last sunday ,sato made at sunday whc ,germany last sunday that large ,korean victims of forced labor","['South Korea ’s', 'Foreign Ministry', 'Japan', 'korean', 'UNESCO', 'World Heritage', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'the World Heritage Committee', 'Bonn', 'Germany', 'Koreans', 'Tokyo', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Kyodo News', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'YonhapJapan', 'South Korea ’s', 'Cho Tae - yul', 'UNESCO Kuni Sato', 'Cho', 'WHC ’s', 'korean', 'Tokyo', 'korean', 'Sato ’s', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Tokyo', 'WHC', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'korean', 'Song Sang - ho']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.17147681  0.6361509

Yoo Seong-min, who was pegged by President Park Geun-hye last month as the culprit behind government policy delays.The decision was made at an emergency meeting of Supreme Council members Tuesday, a day after the party boycotted a revote of, and thereby discarded, the controversial National Assembly Act revision vetoed by Park.Yoo Seung-min. YonhapSaenuri Party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung told the press that member lawmakers will discuss an item initially titled “A resolution to recommend the resignation of the floor leader for the sake of the Saenuri Party’s future and the Park Geun-hye administration’s success.”Party members continued to scuffle over the name of the discussion item, with the non-Park members saying the title restricts the scope of discussion by assuming Yoo’s resignation. Kim said they decided on the format of officially opening debate to avoid a situation of having to cast a confidence vote of Yoo as demanded by pro-Park members of the party. Yoo, who left the Supreme Council meeting mid-way, told reporters that he will not be attending the assembly but that he will abide by whatever decision is made.Yoo, elected as the party’s floor leader in February by beating out a pro-Park competitor, has refused to step down from the post despite repeated prodding from staunch members of his party over the past week.Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min walks past reporters at the National Assembly on Tuesday. YonhapYoo’s former running mate and chief policymaker Rep. Won Yoo-chul said it was his idea to have the party deliberate on the situation instead of pushing for a vote to allow an opportunity for Yoo to resign voluntarily.Despite the party leadership’s decision, conflict within the party persisted with non-Park members harshly criticizing the pro-Park members having bowed to Cheong Wa Dae pressure.“The decision reached at the Supreme Council meeting is a shameful one that should be discarded immediately,” said senior member Rep. Lee Jae-oh. Lee had vied against Park for the party’s presidential candidacy in 2012.“Since my entry to the party in 1996, there has never been a case more tragic ... It is despicable on political moral standards for the council to have made all decisions to later blame it all on the floor leader as their scapegoat upon a simple remark by Cheong Wa Dae,” he said through his Facebook account.The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, meanwhile, lambasted the ruling rival for sitting out of the National Assembly Act revision, which the majority of the Saenuri Party had also endorsed in the first round of votes on May 29.The NPAD leadership also stepped up their offensive by suspending all standing committee meetings related to the revised supplementary budget.“Today is the day to mourn the National Assembly ... They are nothing more than a mob of rioters,” said NPAD floor leader Lee Jong-kul, referring to the Saenuri Party’s unilateral passage of 61 bills the night before without the attendance of NPAD lawmakers.The Saenuri Party holds a majority 160 seats in the 298-member Assembly. A total of 151 Saenuri lawmakers flocked to the Assembly building late Monday night upon the leadership’s request, just fulfilling the minimum voting quorum of 150.“The ruling party members’ oath of allegiance to the president is an act of betrayal to the people and a self-destructive action forgoing their (right) as legislators,” said NPAD Rep.

(Yonhap)The experienced prosecutor also denied the main opposition’s claims that prosecutors unlawfully neglected to charge top Park administration officials accused of graft in the Sung Woan-jong scandal earlier Tuesday.The Sung scandal had been investigated justly and fairly, Kim said, refuting charges by NPAD officials that the six ruling bloc officials acquitted of taking bribes had been let go for being Park supporters.The NPAD had called investigations into the Sung scandal “cursory” as they appeared to be highly politicized, with known Park allies such as former Cheong Wa Dae chief of staff Kim Ki-choon and Incheon Mayor Yoo Jeong-bok being absolved of bribery charges.Sung allegedly gave illicit political funds to eight ruling bloc officials. Two -- former Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo and South Gyeongsang Province Gov. Hong Joon-pyo -- were indicted. The rest were acquitted for lack of evidence.Kim vowed he would clamp down “without limitations” on corruption and violent crimes once he assumes the reins of the Justice Ministry in the coming days.“I will carry out the duties of my office according to the law to the fullest of my capabilities,” Kim said in the opening minutes of his hearing.“Murder, rape and other violent crimes are still very much existent on our streets.

Choi Doo-yeong, 55-year-old president of the Local Government Officials’ Development Institute, was found dead early Sunday outside his hotel room in what Chinese officials later suspected was a suicide. He was staying in the region to handle affairs after the bus crash in the northeastern Chinese city of Jian last Wednesday that claimed 10 Korean lives.The bodies of the victims arrived in Korea on Monday around 1:05 p.m. via Incheon International Airport. Eight of the public officials’ bodies were sent to local government organizations where they each worked. The respective government bodies will take care of the funeral processes for the victims.The bodies of the two other victims, a public official and the tour agency official, were sent to their respective families on request.Choi’s body will arrive in Korea separately later this week, after his family has identified the body. With regard to Choi’s death, Chinese investigators said they ruled out homicide based on the autopsy results, testimonies of eyewitnesses and surveillance images.They also found his fingerprints on the window of his hotel room. Officials here said they were still baffled over why the government official allegedly chose to plunge to his death.“The Chinese officials cooperated (with Korean government) as best they could in terms of preserving the bodies and sending them back to Korea. There is no particular reason to believe that he was under immense pressure, and it’s far-fetched to connect the conflict (between Chinese officials and victims’ families) to his death,” said the Ministry of Government Administration and Home Affairs.A search of his hotel room did not turn up a suicide note, but a memo with a large question mark, although officials said they were unsure of what it meant.A member of the Korean government team deployed to China told Korean media that Choi appears to have been stressed out by strife between the Chinese authorities -- who wanted the bodies cremated -- and the families of the deceased who wanted the bodies sent back to Korea. China eventually agreed the day before Choi’s death to send the bodies back.In an official briefing Sunday, the Home Affairs Ministry said while the families were unhappy with some aspects of the situation, such as the medical facility, there was no actual conflict.Despite the reports by Chinese authorities, the ministry has not ruled out the possibility that Choi merely lost his footing and fell.

Park Young-sun of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy and nine other party lawmakers presented the bill last Friday to revise the Foreign Investment Promotion Act to authorize a government board to bar foreign investors from buying and selling companies here if the transaction is deemed speculative.The draft law comes as South Korean corporate giant Samsung Group is involved in a lawsuit with Elliot, a U.S.-based hedge fund, over the merger of two of the conglomerate’s affiliates. Elliot owns 7.1 percent of Samsung C&T;, which the group plans to merge with Cheil Industries. Elliot objects to the merger.Rep. Park Young-sun, former floor leader and former acting chair of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy. (Yonhap)The bill’s submission to the legislature also comes amid a multibillion-dollar lawsuit involving the South Korean government and Lone Star, a U.S. private equity firm, over the fund’s purchase and sales of Korea Exchange Bank, a Korean bank. Lone Star asserts Seoul owes it $4.68 billion as officials here had levied unfair taxes and barred the fund from selling its KEB shares at the optimal time. KEB union members, on the other hand, have said Lone Star’s purchase of the company led to unfair layoffs. “The new bill will prohibit the selling of Korean companies if the sale is considered detrimental to the overall Korean economy,” Park said in a press release.Park’s bill will aim to strengthen Seoul’s say over such sales in the future.“The U.S. and Japan have similar corporate laws,” Park added. “Japan authorizes state interference in sales of (Japanese firms) if they are considered ‘detrimental to the overall Japanese economy.’ The U.S. government runs the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.”“We must set up similar laws curbing foreign investment if the investors could affect the welfare of the entire Korean economy,” Park said.The new bill will come into effect six months after receiving approval from the legislature and the Cabinet, if at all.Park is a third-term lawmaker and the former floor leader and acting chair of the NPAD -- the second-most dominant party in Seoul’s 298-seat unicameral parliament with 130 seats.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","nine other party lawmakers ,south korean corporate giant samsung ,group of opposition lawmakers ,unfair layoffs the new bill ,of opposition lawmakers is seeking","['Park Young', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'the Foreign Investment Promotion Act', 'south korean', 'Samsung Group', 'Elliot', 'Elliot', 'Samsung C&T', 'Cheil Industries', 'elliot', 'Park Young', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'south korean', 'Lone Star', 'U.S.', 'Korea Exchange Bank', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'KEB', 'keb', 'Lone Star ’s', 'korean', 'korean', 'Park', 'Park ’s', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'japanese', 'U.S.', 'the Committee on Foreign Investment', 'the United States', 'korean', 'Park', 'Cabinet', 'Seoul', 'Jeong Hunny']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33010778  0.12116832

Yoo Seong-min has been under severe pressure from Cheong Wa Dae and Saenuri lawmakers loyal to the president to resign for not cooperating with Park’s major state agenda. The pro-Park members sent Yoo a verbal ultimatum to step down as soon as the party abandons the vetoed bill during a plenary session Monday. They claimed that it would offer the public an impression of him leaving the post to take responsibility for causing political chaos over the bill. It would be his opportunity to “honorably” resign from the post, they added. Yoo has since refused to step down, backed by a group of nonmainstream lawmakers and his sympathizers who accused pro-Park members’ attempt as a mere political witch hunt. He also refrained to comment on his fate Sunday, but reiterated that the party would not participate in the revote.“We have decided not to vote tomorrow,” he said. “This is what we concluded at a previous general meeting on June 25.”Despite the vehement demands from the pro-Park faction, Yoo may choose to resist and seek a political breakthrough by keeping his position, some party officials said. Yoo has already announced that he would preside over a parliamentary meeting Tuesday, a day after the deadline pronounced by Park’s loyalists.If Yoo resists the demand, the pro-Park members could hold a general meeting to oust him from the Saenuri leadership. Exercising her first veto, Park blasted Yoo for succumbing to the opposition’s demand to pass a revision to National Assembly law, which enables lawmakers to challenge the government’s administrative power.Yoo led a legislative deal with the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy to pass the bill on the condition of agreeing on the passage of a reform bill on civil servants’ pension, a crucial part of Park’s reform drive.By Cho Chung-un(christory@heraldcorp.com)","the president to resign for ,vetoed bill during plenary session ,the president to resign ,to the president to resign ,president to resign for","['Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Cheong', 'Saenuri', 'Park ’s', 'Yoo', 'Yoo', 'Yoo', 'Park ’s', 'Yoo', 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'Yoo', 'National Assembly', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Park ’s', 'Cho Chung-un(christory@heraldcorp.com']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34157261  0.05209911

Diabetic and unemployed, she had been living in a tiny single room at a “goshiwon” -- cheap, dormitory housing mostly utilized by young students -- with her two teenage children.  Her eldest son, now 20, had been the sole breadwinner of the family, including for the monthly rent of 280,000 won. “For Yoon, getting the overdue child support was the only way to help her son and ease his burden,” said Cho Young-jong, a debt collector who helped with her case at the state-run Child Support Agency. Yoon is one of some 390,000 single parents in South Korea who had never received child support from the other parent. The latest government study showed that 83 percent of all single parents in Korea never received any payments in 2012. Of those, only 4.6 percent of them filed a lawsuit. And even among those who won their cases, 77.4 percent said they still did not receive any money, in spite of the court orders.As of 2014, 77.3 percent of all Korean single parents were women. Kwon Yong-hyun, Vice Gender Equality Minister (Center) poses for a photo during a ceremony celebrating the opening of a state-run hotline service specifically for single parents nationwide on Wednesday (Yonhap)To tackle the problem, the Gender Equality Ministry in March launched the Child Support Agency to support child-rearing single parents by enforcing child support payments. Since then, some 14,900 single parents contacted the agency for help, and 81 of them were able to receive their payments. The received payments totaled 226 million won as of last week.“In some cases, the payments brought extra positive changes and mutual understanding. It also brought closure to ongoing conflicts,” said Bae So-young, a lawyer who works at the agency. “One of the single mothers found out that her ex-husband had been refusing to pay the child support because he had been heartbroken about losing his right to see his children when they got divorced. So they made some compromises. He agreed to pay the child support, while his ex-wife agreed that he could gain his right to contact the children again.”Bae also had a client, a single father, who claimed that his ex-wife purposely cut off all contact with him to avoid paying him child support. But when Bae contacted his ex-wife, she told a completely different story.“The ex-wife told me that he had been stalking her all along, showing up at her work and her place. She said he had not been doing it necessarily because of the money, but because he had this unresolved grudge against her,” Bae said. “She claimed that she had to cut contact because she was just so scared of him. So through us they made an agreement. She agreed to wire the money every month, while he agreed to never call or show up at her place again.”Yoon, for her part, received 10 million won from her ex-husband with the help of debt collectors. With the money, she and her children were able to move into underground housing with two rooms and a living room. “Her daughter, who is in high school, is the happiest to get out of that goshiwon,” said the debt collector Cho.Yet Kim Eun-hee, a Daegu-based activist for single parents’ rights, said back in March that laws should be further fortified to impose a criminal penalty for overdue child support payments.The activist said she witnessed a number of unwed, single mothers being threatened by fathers of their babies. One mother, for instance, withdrew her case after her ex-boyfriend’s mother verbally attacked her for “ruining her son’s reputation,” and threatened to take custody of the child.Lawyer Bae also acknowledged that it is harder for unwed mothers to claim their child support payments. In order for an unwed parent to seek child support, they have to legally prove to the court that the other parent and the child are in fact biologically related. Once that has been done, they have to file a separate lawsuit to request for payments. The whole process can be as long as nine to 10 months, and costs about 5 million won if one proceeds with a private lawyer. Meanwhile, the average monthly income of single-parent households was 1.72 million won, which is less than half the average of all households in the country at 3.53 million won, according to government data.The biggest problem is that individuals can easily refuse to cooperate with the court’s request to take a DNA test under the current Korean law, said Bae. “The court currently does not have the authority to forcefully take their hair, blood or saliva samples for a DNA test,” explained Bae. “Doing so would be illegal and a violation of self-ownership.”Jeong Ji-ah, another lawyer who works at the agency, said many unwed mothers don’t know where the other parent lives or works, and this also makes their situation difficult. The state-run agency has access to the database of the National Health Insurance Service when tracking down the debtor’s place of employment. “It’s not that hard when the debtor works for a corporation,” said the lawyer.“But when they are running their own businesses, or works for a private company, it’s very hard for us to track them down. Many times their address or contact information aren’t available anywhere.”Lawyer Bae also explained that the current law also stipulates that a creditor of child support can request for personal information of the debtor at their place of employment. But it does not state that the debtor’s employer must comply with the request.Because of such difficulties, only three unwed mothers have decided to proceed to prove their child’s biological link to their fathers with the agency. The agency offers the legal service for free. “It’s not that many unwed mothers don’t want to do it,” said Bae. “Many times it’s literally impossible to reach the other parent. Law revisions can bring some positive changes to this.”Korea’s lack of late child support payment penalties, as well as enforcement, have been also linked to the country’s high overseas adoption rates, as well as the low income of single-parent households. About 90 percent of Korean adoptees are born to unwed, single mothers who have few resources to raise their children alone and are vulnerable to social stigmatization.Bae said it is also necessary for single parents to work through their unresolved feelings against their ex-spouse. Before joining agency, Bae worked with a female client who filed a suit against her ex-husband for overdue child support. The ex-husband, a medical doctor, moved from one hospital to another to avoid collectors and the court’s letters. “My client was a working pharmacist so that was one of the reasons. Her ex-husband didn’t think she needed his financial assistance,” Bae said. “But another reason was that he still very much resented her, and on top of everything else, did not trust her. He didn’t think the money he gave would be spent on the children. Such cases are pretty common. It’s recommended to have closure to whatever issue a parent might have with the other parent before talking about child support.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","born to unwed single mothers ,difficulties only three unwed mothers ,single mother divorced in 2010 ,three unwed mothers have decided ,year old single mother divorced","['Yoon Ji - hee', 'Yoon', 'Yoon', 'Cho Young - jong', 'Child Support Agency', 'Yoon', 'South Korea', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Kwon Yong - hyun', 'Yonhap)To', 'the Gender Equality Ministry', 'the Child Support Agency', 'Bae so - young', 'Cho', 'Kim Eun - hee', 'Daegu', 'Lawyer Bae', 'korean', 'Bae', 'Bae', 'the National Health Insurance Service', 'Bae', 'korean', 'Bae', 'Bae', 'Claire Lee']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.95698321  0.02698974

Yoo Seong-min, the Saenuri floor leader urged by the president to step down.  The National Assembly's House Steering Committee chamber remains empty early Thursday. (Yonhap)The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy is also expected to question Park’s secretaries over her veto of a bill enabling lawmakers to request changes to government decrees.No easy mediation appeared in the offing, with the ruling party’s in-house feud escalating earlier Thursday when Park loyalists and Yoo sympathizers threw expletives at one another, and with the NPAD renewing its pressure against the ruling bloc to repeal Park’s veto.Park last week vetoed the bill that Yoo had sponsored. Park called it unconstitutional, and demanded voters vote against Yoo in the 2016 general election. Park loyalists approved. Yoo sympathizers branded Park a bully.Park’s comments also sparked criticism in the NPAD. Main opposition officials said the president had violated electoral laws prohibiting officials from meddling in public elections by suggesting voters oust Yoo.  Saenuri Party chair Rep. Kim Moo-sung leaves the party's daily morning meeting, Thursday, in apparent frustration over Rep. Kim Tae-ho. (Yonhap)NPAD officials earlier Thursday requested the electoral commission to check if Park had broken such laws when Park criticized Yoo. Main opposition officials also criticized the ruling bloc’s in-house fight, saying the power struggle between Park and Yoo had strangled the parliament.“We are dumbfounded by the president’s decision to hold hostage the public and the legislature to her fight (with Yoo),” NPAD Rep. Kang Dong-won said. “The Park loyalists in the Saenuri Party seem to me like worker bees trying to protect their queen,” Kang added. “But Park must know that every queen bee eventually dies at the hands of her workers.”The NPAD’s senior lawmakers held impromptu street rallies the same day, to raise awareness about the ruling bloc’s fight and Park’s veto that started it. NPAD officials urged the ruling party to attend next Monday’s plenary session when Park’s veto will be put to a revote. The NPAD is mulling whether to link Park’s veto to a supplementary budget bill that the ruling party motioned if the Saenuri Party does not attend next week’s vote. NPAD chair Rep. Moon Jae-in (second from right) at a street rally protesting President Park Geun-hye's veto, Thursday. (Yonhap)Meanwhile, the ruling party’s Park-Yoo feud worsened. Rep. Kim Tae-ho, a new convert to the Park-loyalist faction, repeated demands that Yoo resign his floor leadership at the party’s morning meeting.Saenuri chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung, widely considered a quiet Yoo sympathizer, exited the room, appearing frustrated, after telling Rep. Kim Tae-ho to “cut it out.”The meeting room erupted in fury, with Yoo sympathizers exiting behind chairman Kim.Saenuri Rep. Kim Hack-yong, another Yoo sympathizer, could be heard cursing at Rep.

Hong Joon-pyo for violating the Political Fund Act by accepting illicit political funds from Sung, the deceased chairman of Keangnam Enterprises, it said in a press briefing Thursday afternoon.The charges were dropped against six other politicians ― ruling Saenuri Party lawmaker Rep. Hong Moon-jong, Incheon Mayor Yoo Jeong-bok, Busan Mayor Suh Byung-soo and incumbent Presidential Chief of Staff Lee Byung-kee and his two predecessors, Huh Tae-yeol and Kim Ki-choon ― who were also suspected of receiving shady money from Sung, due to lack of evidence and the statute of limitations expirations, the prosecution said.Both Gov. Hong and ex-premier Lee expressed regret over the prosecution’s decision. Former Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo (left) and South Gyeongsang Province Gov. Hong Joon-pyo. (Kim Myung-sub/The Korea Herald/Yonhap)“Lee’s truth is more powerful than anything, and he will strive to clear his charge,” Suh Joon-won, a close aide to the former prime minister, said on behalf of Lee. He also questioned the investigation process, which he claimed had not given Lee a right to defend himself. Hong said in a press release that he “deeply regretted” the decision to charge him with receiving illicit political funds. He said he had nothing to do with the late businessman, calling the prosecution’s actions “the result of political decision.” The indictment comes nearly three months after prosecutors launched the investigation into Sung’s claims that he offered illegal campaign money to eight politicians close to President Park. Sung took his life in April, leaving a hand-written note in his pocket that listed the names of the politicians and the bribe sums he claimed to have handed over, which triggered a public backlash against the Park administration. The prosecution said that it obtained circumstantial evidence that Sung offered 100 million won ($89,000) to Hong in June 2011, when the four-term lawmaker was running for the leadership of the Grand National Party, the precursor to the ruling Saenuri Party. Lee is suspected of having received 30 million won from Sung in April 2013 during his bid in the parliamentary by-election. He stepped down as prime minister on April 27 amid the spiraling graft scandal. In the press briefing, investigators said that they secured evidence that Roh Geon-pyeong, an elder brother of late President Roh Moo-hyun, accepted 500 million won in illegal political money from Sung in 2007 in return for granting him a presidential pardon by exerting influence on government officials. Sung was then sentenced to six months in jail, suspended for a year, on charges of embezzlement. But it decided not to indict the former president’s brother as the statute of limitations had expired. As part of the investigation, the prosecution also sent inquiry letters in late May to the six politicians listed in Sung’s memo other than Hong and Lee, requesting information on their affairs with Sung, as well as their roles at the ruling party in the run-up to the 2012 presidential election. Unsatisfied with the reports, prosecutors called in the ruling Saenuri Party’s three-term lawmaker Rep. Hong for questioning in early June over allegations that he took 200 million won in illegal campaign funds from Sung for then-presidential candidate Park in 2012. But the prosecution allegedly could not obtain any evidence. The prosecution expanded its investigation into the opposition bloc in late June, calling in Rep. Kim Han-gil, the ex-chairman of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy party, which the opposition party viewed as “politically motivated” to shield the Park administration. Investigators suspected Kim of accepting illegal funds from Sung, though he was not on Sung’s list. Prosecutors also accused Saenuri Party Rep. Rhee In-je of having taken bribes worth 20 million won from Sung just before the 2012 general election. Both Kim and Rhee have been asked to appear for questioning by prosecutors, but they refused, citing their “busy schedule” and “innocence.” The prosecution said that it would continue to investigate the two politicians for bribery.

The Assembly’s regular session will be postponed for five days, he added. The parliament was to hold a regular session Wednesday.Chung said the decision is in accordance with the relevant laws that require the Assembly to reconsider a bill sent back by the president. Chung’s decision came days after the Saenuri Party lawmakers decided not to put the bill up for a revote in a gesture of reconciliation toward the president who had strongly lambasted the party last week for approving the bill pushed by the opposition. National Assembly Speaker Chung Eui-hwa (Yonhap)Chances appear to be slim for the Assembly to override Park’s veto, as the governing party with a majority 160 seats are likely to boycott the vote. Saenuri chief Kim Moo-sung said the party would attend the regular session to comply with the Assembly speaker’s decision. The party’s floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min later elaborated on Kim’s remark that they didn’t mean that Saenuri Party lawmakers would cast votes on the bill.To override a vetoed bill, more than two-thirds of the vote is required. If the vote fails to meet the quorum of 149 lawmakers, the bill is automatically scrapped.With the Assembly speaker putting the bill to a vote again, the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy withdrew its decision to boycott parliamentary sessions for the last five days. But opposition leader Rep. Moon Jae-in blasted the Saenuri Party for objecting to a revote of the bill, calling the party “a coward.” “Lawmakers are obligated to participate in a vote on a bill that was returned for reconsideration,” Moon told reporters at a party event. “There won’t be other choices.” Moon also slammed the ruling party for rolling back its decision to pass the bill, following President Park’s scathing criticism of lawmakers attempting to challenge the government’s administrative power.“The bill was (previously) approved by the Saenuri Party. They should participate in the vote again fair and square.”The bill, which enables lawmakers to request the government to modify its decree, returned to the parliament Thursday after Park exercised her first veto, citing unconstitutionality. Park criticized both parties, particularly the Saenuri leadership, for passing the bill, saying that they were “betraying the people” in pursuit of their political interests.Her remarks apparently were aimed at Saenuri chief whip Rep. Yoo, who led a legislative deal with the main opposition party to pass the Assembly bill along with a reform bill on civil servants’ pension. The Saenuri Party appears to be rejecting a revote of the Assembly bill in a dire effort to mend ties with Cheong Wa Dae, but also to help the embattled floor leader step down “honorably.” Yoo has been resisting demands from Saenuri lawmakers loyal to President Park, saying that he needs more time to think.

A final meeting of the Minimum Wage Council ended in deadlock, with the business representatives absent to signify opposition to labor experts’ suggestion to stipulate monthly wages in the employment contract.

The business leaders argued that the stipulation of monthly wages in the contract would cause “confusion,” as it fails to represent the unique circumstances of various industries. The council has failed to initiate talks on how much to increase the minimum wage next year as the standoff over the details continued.The labor unions have demanded a 79 percent rise from the current minimum hourly wage at 5,580 won ($4.99) to 10,000 won, while employers have campaigned for a freeze.The Korea Employers Federation has claimed that the minimum wage has risen too rapidly and it needs to be stabilized, voicing concerns over possible job losses and soaring production costs. The nation’s largest trade unions -- the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions and Federation of Korean Trade Unions -- have maintained that the hike would tackle the nation’s income inequality and spur consumer spending.Since the government adopted the minimum wage in 1989, the Minimum Wage Council, a trilateral committee of employers, employees and labor specialists, has set the minimum wage through discussion. This year, the discussion began in early June with an aim to reach a conclusion by June 29. But as the committee failed to reach a consensus within the legal deadline, it will hold extra meetings on July 6 and 7, with plans to put some agenda items to vote Friday. The government will make public the agreed rate for next year’s minimum wage on August 5.

The number dropped slightly from 2,682 on the previous day.  Since the first case, nearly 16,000 people have been subject to isolation for possible infection. So far, 13,354 of them have been released after they showed no symptoms of MERS that included fever, cough and shortness of breath, for more than the known incubation period of 14 days for the disease.  MERS is a viral respiratory disease that is still new to humans with the world's first case reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012.

It can also carry larger amounts of fuel than its rivals.The A330 MRTT is also an already developed tanker while the development of Boeing’s KC-46 is to be completed in 2017. Britain, Australia, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and France have decided to purchase Airbus’ model.Promoting its KC-46 tanker, a military derivative of the 767 aircraft, Boeing has stressed the importance of interoperability with the U.S. Air Force. Considering the U.S. Air Force is to procure 179 KC-46s by 2027, the KC-46 is the most desirable candidate for South Korea to ensure interoperability with its long-standing security ally, the U.S., Boeing argues.The military has been eyeing a purchase of refueling aircraft since the mid-1990s, as its fighters can operate over vulnerable areas such as South Korea’s easternmost islets of Dokdo for only half an hour. With refueling, combat aircraft could operate for another hour, defense officials said.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","day three competitors boeing kc ,korea two tankers in 2018 ,three competitors boeing kc 46 ,trillion won 25 billion project ,program committee on tuesday procurement","['South Korea', 'the National Defense Acquisition Program Committee', 'Seoul ’s Defense Acquisition Program Administration', 'Boeing', 'Airbus', 'Israel Aerospace Industries', 'South Korea', 'Boeing', 'Airbus', 'israeli', 'Boeing', 'Airbus', 'Boeing', 'Britain', 'Australia', 'UAE', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Singapore', 'France', 'Airbus', 'Boeing', 'the U.S. Air Force', 'the U.S. Air Force', 'KC-46s', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Boeing', 'South Korea ’s', 'Song Sang - ho']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.09105149  0.47150582

Yoo Seong-min due to his role in last week’s legislative crisis that is widely viewed as a power struggle between him and the president.President Park Geun-hye last Thursday vetoed a bill, chiefly sponsored by her former chief of staff Yoo, that would have given lawmakers the right to ask for revisions to government decrees. Park said the changes violated the principle of the division of powers and blasted Yoo for causing a political crisis. Yoo apologized, but resisted pressure from Park-loyalist lawmakers to resign.Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min apologizes to President Park Geun-hye last Friday. (Yonhap) The latest friction between Park and Yoo was nothing new, with Park’s veto of the bill only adding another chapter to their love-hate relationship, analysts said, by sparking an in-house feud in the ruling Saenuri Party that pitches Park loyalists against Yoo sympathizers.President Park Geun-hye. (Yonhap)Yoo and Park began their political relationship amicably, when Park in 2005 named Yoo as her chief of staff during her tenure as the chairwoman of the Grand National Party, the forerunner to the Saenuri Party. Yoo later served in Park’s presidential campaign team in 2007.But the relationship soured in late 2011 when Yoo opposed Park’s plans to change the party’s name from the GNP to the Saenuri Party, saying the newly proposed name lacked “identity.”Yoo has also consistently opposed Park’s policies since rising to the ruling party’s floor leadership in February, including his criticism of Park’s “welfare without taxation” approach, which Yoo said was an impossibility.“(President Park’s) 134.5 trillion won ($120 billion) campaign promise has turned out to be false,” Yoo said at a parliamentary speech in April in reference to Park’s welfare pledges. “Politicians must be more honest about our fiscal reality,” Yoo added, citing government tax revenues that had come short of initial expectations.Yoo had also released critical statements against Park’s foreign policy and national security policies and passed downsized versions of Park’s proposed reforms on the public service pension in May, drawing the ire of the president and her followers in the ruling party.Park loyalists threatened to renew requests to hold a confidence vote on Yoo on Monday. Several Saenuri lawmakers traditionally not considered to be in the pro-Park camp also urged Yoo to resign despite his apologies to Park last week.Yoo sympathizers, on the other hand, urged the embattled whip to stand his ground. They also accused the president of trying to commandeer the party for her political agenda, instead of using negotiations to convince dissenters.“Respecting the presidential veto (by not putting the veto to a parliamentary vote) is one thing,” Saenuri Rep. Park Min-shik said. “But using this crisis to worsen strained ties between the party and President Park is something else,” he said, hinting that pressuring Yoo to resign was going too far.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","hye last thursday vetoed bill ,last thursday vetoed bill chiefly ,last thursday vetoed bill ,loyalist lawmakers to resign saenuri ,thursday vetoed bill chiefly","['Yoo Seong - min', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Yoo', 'Park', 'Yoo', 'Saenuri Party', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Park', 'Yoo', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun', 'Yonhap)Yoo', 'Park', 'Park', 'Yoo', 'the Grand National Party', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Park', 'Yoo', 'Park ’s', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Park ’s', 'Park', 'Yoo', 'Yoo', 'Park', 'Yoo', 'Yoo', 'Park ’s', 'Park ’s', 'Yoo', 'Saenuri', 'Yoo', 'Park', 'Saenuri', 'Park Min', 'Park', 'Yoo', 'Jeong Hunny']",11,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34660318  0.40257382

The Supreme Court legalized the Seoul-Gyeonggi-Incheon Migrants’ Trade Union, invalidating the Ministry of Employment and Labor’s ban on its establishment. Members of civic groups hold a press conference to criticize the government for oppressing foreign workers’ human rights and reforming immigration law in front of the government complex in central Seoul on Jan. 4, 2008. (Yonhap)In the ruling, the court said the ministry’s refusal to allow the organization to found a labor union was against the Constitution, upholding a lower court ruling. The court ruled that illegal immigrants are entitled to joining and setting up a trade union though they do not have an official work permit, by recognizing anyone who offers labor and receives payment as a laborer in accordance with Korea’s labor law. The historic ruling, which will protect basic workers’ rights of illegal immigrants from now on, came 10 years after the organization filed a suit in 2005. In 2005, some 91 foreign workers based in Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi Province set up a trade union and requested for a permit from the labor ministry. The ministry demanded the organization turn in its members’ registration numbers or passports to check their legal status in Korea, which was rejected by the MTU. The government then refused to accept the application, prompting the MTU to file a suit. The lowest court ruled in favor of the ministry, but the appeals court overturned the decision by saying that workers’ rights stipulated in the constitution should not be restricted unless they harm the national security and public order. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","thursday upheld ruling that illegal ,that illegal immigrants in korea ,korea highest court on thursday ,court ruled that illegal immigrants ,illegal immigrants in korea","['South Korea ’s', 'Korea', 'the Supreme Court', 'the Ministry of Employment and Labor ’s', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Incheon', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Korea']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50901777  0.16720848

YonhapAdmitting that the government’s early response to the outbreak was “insufficient,” the official said Cheong Wa Dae is not trying to evade its responsibility over the crisis, but concentrating on the ongoing mission to fight against the virus that had killed 27 and infected 179 as of Wednesday. The remark came amid mounting demands from both rival parties for the president to deliver a public apology over the government’s slow initial response.The government has been under fire for concealing information of MERS-infected patients and the hospitals where they were admitted and treated. The health ministry had rejected calls to disclose names of MERS-hit hospitals, stressing that it would paralyze the nation’s medical sector. They had expressed concerns that hospitals could refuse to treat patients suspected of MERS and also suffer huge losses of income if other patients stopped visiting those clinics. More than 90 percent of South Korea’s hospital beds are at for-profit institutions, which the government does not hold absolute control over. Authorities later revealed the names and routes patients traveled. But its belated revelation sparked the public’s anger, with many blasting the government, saying that its slow move aggravated the spread of the disease.A ruling party lawmaker told Yonhap News agency that the president may deliver an apology later over the government’s bungled response, after the disease has come under control.Observers also said that Cheong Wa Dae may mull offering an apology at an appropriate time as it fears the opposition party throwing the issue into a political contest.Park was under massive pressure to apologize for the Sewol ferry crisis last year.

Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn speaks at the National Assembly on Wednesday. YonhapThe revised bill on health care law will obligate general hospitals with more than 200 beds to install infection control facilities, including negative pressure isolation chambers for patients with contagious diseases and have medical staff trained in administering the patients with infectious diseases. The package also stipulates the government strengthen countermeasures against contagious diseases and to toughen quarantine measures at immigration offices to prevent MERS from spreading to neighboring countries.The bills are also expected to go through the legislation and judiciary committee before being delivered to the plenary session for a final vote Thursday.Rival parties are also reportedly working on a separate bill, namely the special MERS bill, to create legal grounds for securing a supplementary budget for people and businesses affected by the MERS outbreak, according to officials.By Cho Chung-un(christory@heraldcorp.com)","respiratory syndrome to vote thursday ,vote thursday the bills also ,session for final vote thursday ,final vote thursday rival parties ,to vote thursday the bills","['the National Assembly', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'the National Assembly', 'Cho Chung-un(christory@heraldcorp.com']",0,"[ 2.00000000e+00  0.00000000e+00  0.00000000e+00 ... -3.30155104e-01

Moon Jae-in’s selection of Rep. Choi Jae-sung as secretary general sparked renewed protest from party whip Rep. Lee Jong-kul and the non-Roh faction. The non-Rohs think the dominant pro-Rohs are monopolizing key party posts. Choi and Moon belong to the pro-Roh group.  Moon Jae-in (Yonhap)“I have repeatedly urged the chairman to open doors to the (non-Rohs),” Lee had said late Tuesday, minutes after Moon had finalized his choice of Choi as the next secretary-general. “But the chairman has closed those doors through this selection.”As the next secretary-general, Choi will hold much clout over the selection of NPAD candidates for the 2016 parliamentary elections. The party will seek to overturn the majority held by the Saenuri Party, which has 160 of the 298 parliamentary seats.But the non-Rohs claim that Moon’s nomination of Choi only reinforces the notion that Moon and the pro-Rohs want to dominate the party. If that alleged trend continues, the non-Rohs may exit the party and create a rival opposition party, party insiders said, asking not to be named. Choi Jae-sung (Yonhap) The latest fight comes after mutual suspicion worsened between the non-Rohs and the pro-Rohs in the wake of the NPAD’s defeats to the ruling Saenuri Party in the April parliamentary by-elections. The non-Rohs had demanded Moon to resign his chairmanship after the losses. The party had failed to win any of the four contested seats, stoking discussion that an alternative opposition political force may be needed.Moon refused, triggering the resignation of Rep. Joo Seung-yong from the party’s Supreme Council. Joo was the sole non-Roh official on the party’s top decision-making panel. That fight was followed by acrimonious tweets by pro-Roh Rep. Kim Kyung-hyub, who called the non-Rohs “unworthy of party membership.”By Jeong Hunny(hj257@heraldcorp.com)","renewed protest from party whip ,protest the chairman controversial selection ,party biggest factions escalated wednesday ,meeting to protest the chairman ,renewed protest from party","['the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Choi Jae - sung', 'Lee Jong - kul', 'non - roh', 'Choi', 'Moon', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Lee', 'Moon', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'NPAD', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Moon', 'Choi', 'Moon', 'Choi Jae - sung', 'Saenuri Party', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Joo Seung - yong', 'Supreme Council', 'Joo', 'pro - Roh', 'Kim Kyung - hyub']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66439104  0.22862649

He is being interrogated in the presence of a lawyer,"" said a prosecutor.The summons came as part of the prosecution's investigation into a suspected ""bribery list"" left behind by Sung, the late chairman of construction firm Keangnam Enterprises Inc., who committed suicide in April.Prosecutors said they have obtained testimony from a former Keangnam Enterprises executive surnamed Kim that he had asked the elder Roh to help swing Sung's pardon.Previous administrations have granted special pardons to imprisoned business executives, politicians and other offenders at the end of a president's term to foster national harmony.The elder Roh, who was previously mired in a number of graft scandals and served a prison term on corruption charges in 2008, is suspected of receiving kickbacks from the late Sung.The memo retrieved from Sung's pocket after he was found dead showed sums of money written next to the names of a number of high-profile politicians, suggesting that they were bribed. The eight politicians in the memo include President Park's former and current chiefs of staff. The prosecution has said it will soon indict former Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo and Hong Joon-pyo, governor of South Gyeongsang Province, on charges of violating the law governing illegal political funds.Sung suggested in the memo that he had given the illegal political funds to six other people, including Hong Moon-jong, a ruling party lawmaker who had been in a key post in the Park camp, as well as Yoo Jeong-bok and Seo Byung-soo, the current mayors of Incheon and Busan.As part of the investigation, prosecutors said they will bring in Rep. Kim Han-gil of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy and Rep. Rhee In-je of the ruling Saenuri Party sometime soon.Kim allegedly took tens of millions of won from Sung while running for the opposition party's top position in May 2013.Rhee is accused of having received bribes from Sung just before the 2012 general elections.Rhee was part of the now-dissolved minor conservative Advancement and Unification Party when Sung served as the party's floor leader.Both Kim and Rhee have denied the allegations.

Kim Han-gil had accepted illegal funds from the late Sung Woan-jong. Kim was the first head of the newly minted New Politics Alliance for Democracy party in 2014, a party formed by combining progressive groups, mainly from the Democratic Party.Prosecutors say Kim accepted illegal funds from Sung days before the DP’s convention in May 2013 when Kim was elected as the party chairman. Kim denied the charges, which he called, “ridiculous,” later Tuesday.Prosecutors also suspect that Geon-pyeong accepted illegal money from Sung in 2007. Sung was given a presidential pardon that year after being convicted of embezzlement. Authorities say Sung may have handed bribes to Geon-pyeong to attain the pardon. Kim Han-gil (Yonhap)But critics accused the prosecution of fabricating charges for political reasons.“A few politically driven prosecutors are embarrassing the thousands of law enforcement officials working hard to make our nation safe,” NPAD whip Rep. Lee Jong-kul said. Lee added that the charges were part of an “authoritarian crackdown” on President Park Geun-hye’s opponents.Sung, the ex-chairman of construction firm Keangnam Enterprises, took his life in April amid mounting bribery charges against him. But hours before his death he revealed a list of ruling bloc officials he had allegedly given bribes to, sparking a public firestorm against the Park administration.The list included former Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo, former Cheong Wa Dae Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon and South Gyeongsang Province Gov. Hong Joon-pyo. Rep. Kim Han-gil and Roh Geon-pyeong were not included in that list.None have been convicted, but Lee resigned in April amid growing public suspicion that he had accepted illegal campaign funds from Sung during the April 2013 parliamentary by-elections.But the scandal quickly turned against the opposition, when allegations arose that officials in the Roh Moo-hyun administration had allegedly received bribes from Sung. Many leading figures of the NPAD began their political careers under the Roh administration.Prosecutors say Sung and Kim were close. Local media reported earlier this week that Kim and Sung had been scheduled to meet privately the night before Sung’s suicide. Prosecutors also accused governing Saenuri Party Rep. Rhee In-je of having received bribes worth 20 million won ($18,000) from Sung just before the 2012 general elections. Rhee was the chair of the now-dissolved minor conservative Advancement and Unification Party when Sung served as the party’s floor leader.

Moon Jeong-gu, a lawyer for the Seoul-based law firm Ahn & Chang, said Sunday that he filed the suit with the Seoul Administrative Court on Friday, accusing the government of failing to carry out a duty to protect its people by keeping key information from the public. “The government has a duty to disclose specific information such as hospitals where MERS confirmed patients stayed and the patients’movement for its people to be cautious for themselves,” Moon said.“The government kept the list of the MERS-affected hospitals confidential for 19 days after the first case was confirmed, exposing the public to the danger of infection,” he added. Saying that the information could contribute to public panic, health authorities declined to name the hospitals after the outbreak of the deadly virus began on May 20. It finally revealed the list on June 7 amid growing public calls for the information.South Korea has grappled with the spread of MERS since the nation reported its first case. The deadly virus has claimed 27 lives, with more than 172 confirmed of the disease as of Monday afternoon, though its spread appeared to show signs of abating. Korea has seen the biggest outbreak of MERS outside Saudi Arabia, where the virus was first discovered in 2012. Moon called the government’s response “belated,” pointing out that the information came when there were already 64 patients confirmed of the virus, five deaths reported and 2,361 people under quarantine. “The government deprived the public of rights to know, as the current law does not include any specific rules on how to share information on the outbreak of infectious disease and how the public can respond to it,” the lawyer claimed. Regarding the suit, Moon said that he is not seeking any financial compensation from the state, but wants to have the judicial branch confirm that the government failed to properly cope with the outbreak at the initial stage. “I wanted to leave the government’s botched response on a national record (to prevent recurrence of such a case),” Moon said.

Hwang officially took the nation’s second-highest post on Thursday after obtaining parliamentary endorsement.“Justice Minister nominee Kim Hyun-woong is the right man to establish the rule of law and to eradicate the corruption widespread throughout society judging by his professionalism and leadership built while serving various posts within the prosecution and the Justice Ministry,” said Park’s spokesman Min Kyung-wook.

The new justice minister does not require parliamentary approval, but will be subject to a confirmation hearing.Kim 56, joined the prosecution in 1990 and served several major posts in the prosecution including director of the special criminal investigation team at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office. He was also named vice justice minister in late 2013 and worked under then-Justice Minister Hwang for more than a year. Park may have tapped Kim, who is younger than the incumbent Prosecutor General Kim Jin-tae, due to limited options, observers say. The president may have wanted to keep the tradition of having the justice minister older than the top prosecutor, but ended up naming Kim to avoid criticism from the main opposition lawmakers questioning ethical misdeeds of other senior candidates hired by major law firms after their retirement from the law enforcement agency.

Shin, who taught mixed marital arts at university, was indicted for taking a 19-year-old female student to a hotel after getting her drunk at dinner and raping her there in January 2014. Shin denied the charge, claiming that he did not have sex with the teenager. He said he had intended to take the drunken girl to a hotel to sleep, but ended up staying longer to brush her teeth as she started to vomit.

Challenging the ruling, Shin filed an appeal, arguing that he was not able to feel sexual desire as he was taking medicine to treat prostatic hypertrophy and hair loss. The treatment came after he was diagnosed with erectile dysfunction, he said. But the upper court rejected his appeals, saying that the teenage victim made consistent statements about the circumstances under which she woke up due to Shin’s attempt to rape her. The court also added in the ruling that his medical situation did not prove it was impossible for him to have sex.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","professor convicted of raping teenage ,university professor convicted of raping ,months against university professor convicted ,convicted of raping teenage student ,professor convicted of raping","['south korean', 'the Seoul High Court', 'Shin', 'Shin', 'Shin ’s', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44805872  0.19778655

Two lawmakers abstained.  (Yonhap)The passage reflects the ruling Saenuri Party's unilateral support for the confirmation, with all of the 156 of its 160 members present in the session presumed to have voted in favor.President Park Geun-hye instantly presented an appointment letter to Hwang, allowing him to spearhead the country's fight against the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus.Hwang chose the National Medical Center, where many MERS patients are being treated in quarantine, as his first destination for anti-epidemic efforts. ""The life and safety of people are the foremost value in a nation's raison d'etre and I am feeling the heavy responsibility for the continuing anxieties over MERS,"" Hwang said in his meeting with the head of the medical center. ""As a control tower, I will stand in the vanguard of the eradication of MERS."" The fight against the virus will be the overriding focus of Hwang's service down the road, officials of the Prime Minister's Office said. Hwang will take over from Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan, who has been acting as prime minister, as the chair of the government's daily anti-MERS meeting while continuing his public outings to quell public jitters about the virus, according to the officials. Other daunting tasks awaiting Hwang include reviving the stagnant economy, further sagged by the outbreak of the MERS virus, as well as Park's reform and anti-corruption drives.In a press conference held right after his nomination last month, Hwang vowed to ""make utmost efforts to reform the country's fundamentals including efforts to reset what is not normal."" Former Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo stepped down in late May amid bribery allegations.The government and the ruling party have called for speedy parliamentary approval of a new prime minister, who takes charge as the control tower in the government efforts against the spread of the MERS virus.Since the outbreak of the first case here May 20, the acute respiratory virus had killed 23 South Koreans as of Thursday. The total number of local MERS cases reached 165.""It is a great relief that the new prime minister won his chance to perform his duty not too belatedly, at a time every second is dearly cherished to end the MERS situation,"" Saenuri spokesman Rhee Chong-hoon said in a briefing. ""The people expect the new prime minister to be accommodating, respectful and to be a well-performing prime minister,"" Rhee noted.Since the three-day confirmation hearing last week, the opposition bloc has objected to the nominee, whom they labeled ""unfit"" citing influence-peddling and draft-dodging allegations.The opposition, however, gave into Saenuri's call for the parliamentary vote after eliciting a promise from Saenuri for a reform of the parliamentary confirmation hearing system, as well as an apology from Hwang over the allegations.""(NPAD's) Stance that he is an unqualified candidate has not changed. But the party will keep a close eye on whether he faithfully carries out his duty as the control tower for MERS,"" NPAD spokesman Park Soo-hyun said.Five lawmakers of the minor opposition Justice Party boycotted the vote. The 58-year-old Hwang is widely known as a champion of the National Security Law, which prohibits sympathizing with or circulating the communist ideology of North Korea.He had been the justice minister ever since Park took office in early 2013, before he offered to resign last week to take the country's second-highest government position.

Hwang will attend as the government representative if the National Assembly approves his nomination Thursday. But hard-liners in the main opposition party could boycott the vote on Hwang’s appointment, to underline their disapproval of Hwang, even though the Saenuri Party’s parliamentary majority likely assures Hwang’s nomination.The NPAD says Hwang is unfit to serve as prime minister, due to his suspected military draft-dodging in 1980 and the millions he made as a lawyer in allegedly illicit profits by taking on cases that his friends served on as judges and prosecutors. Prime Minister-designate Hwang Kyo-ahn (left) leaves his temporary office in Seoul on Wednesday. (Yonhap)The NPAD had initially opposed holding a vote on Hwang at all, citing allegations against him as well as his reluctance to submit his military and income records during his confirmation hearing earlier this month.The NPAD only agreed to hold the vote when the ruling party agreed to create a special parliamentary panel in the House Steering Committee that would work to create stricter penalties against future nominees who refused to submit their military and income records.In his first speech as prime minister, Hwang is also expected to express regret to appease the NPAD hard-liners, ruling party officials said. But key NPAD lawmakers said they would vote against Hwang at Thursday’s full session, hinting that an all-out boycott by the main opposition party could be avoided.“I will try to convince our party’s lawmakers to attend the vote and express their opposition by casting votes against (Hwang),” said NPAD Rep. Lee Choon-suak, the NPAD’s senior deputy floor leader.On top of Hwang’s nomination, the main parties are divided on multiple issues including recent revisions to the National Assembly Act. The changes propose allowing lawmakers to “request” changes to government edicts that appear to violate existing laws.But President Park Geun-hye has threatened to veto the amendments, saying they violated the principle of checks and balances in the government.Pro-Park legislators in the Saenuri Party back the president, saying the president has the authority to veto possibly unconstitutional bills.

Kim Ki-jong, the founder of pro-unification group Woori Madang, was tried in Seoul Central District Court on charges of attempted murder, obstructing business operations and assaulting a foreign envoy. The trial came after the 55-year-old man slashed Lippert in the face with a 24-centimeter knife at a forum discussing Korean unification in central Seoul on March 5. Kim had said that he attacked the American envoy to protest against the joint military drills between Washington and Seoul.Lippert sustained injuries to his cheek and arm, requiring him to undergo two surgeries and 80 stitches to his face. The attempted murder charge does not stipulate a specific jail term, but it is expected that Kim could face a life sentence given the gravity of the crime, according to legal sources. In the preliminary hearings, the prosecution said that Kim’s attack could have killed the American envoy, considering the location of the envoy’s injuries and the knife used. But Kim’s lawyer maintained that he did not mean to kill, citing Kim’s crippled hands. Kim’s lawyer had asked the court to review the CCTV footage that filmed the scene to prove that Kim was not able to freely move his right hand.

The ruling Saenuri Party said it would unilaterally approve Hwang’s confirmation at an upcoming National Assembly plenary session unless the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy accepted the nomination. The Assembly is slated to gather for an interpellation session on Thursday and Friday. But Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Yoo Seung-min said Tuesday that the party may push to expedite the process by pushing to open a separate plenary session on Wednesday.“We must complete Hwang’s confirmation no later than tomorrow,” Yoo said. “In the meantime, we will continue our efforts to beat the NPAD. Even if we fail, we will convince the speaker to put the confirmation to a vote and unilaterally approve it.”Yoo sent out a text message to the fellow lawmakers and urged them to attend the vote -― a move to secure enough votes for Hwang’s confirmation bill, which requires the majority’s approval. The Saenuri Party could unilaterally pass the bill as it holds a majority 160 of 298 parliamentary seats.The NPAD, however, criticized the move and repeated its objection to an “unfit” candidate for the nation’s second-in-command. NPAD asserts that Hwang has failed to give sufficient explanations to the allegations such as influence-peddling and lobbying attempts when he faced the parliamentary hearing.“(The Saenuri Party) is blackmailing us and it is wrong,” said NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in. “I think they are self-conscious about how Cheong Wa Dae would react. Both political parties need to discuss and coordinate on (Hwang’s confirmation),” said Moon. Meanwhile, acting Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan urged the lawmakers to fill the post for his replacement, criticizing them for delaying the confirmation process “without obvious reason” amid the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak that has dampened the nation’s economy.“I don’t understand why the Assembly is dragging its feet (over the confirmation),” he said. “The longer we delay the confirmation, the less likely we will address the MERS outbreak and its economic fallout.

The delivery came after a compromise reached between the ruling and main opposition party in the wording of the revision. The changed wording of a clause in the bill says that the Assembly could “request” the government review its ordinances. The earlier version said that the lawmakers could “demand” a revision of government-enacted ordinances. Park had stood in stern opposition to the bill, pressuring the parliament saying she would use her veto power if no changes were made to the bill before it reaches the stage of her endorsement. She said it clearly violates the constitutional principle that stipulates the division of powers. The bill could also paralyze the function of the executive branch, she said.The ball is now back in President Park’s court, but her spokesman expressed discontent with the latest version, indicating that it still has issues with unconstitutionality. “The bill was sent with (just) one word being fixed. There’s no change in our position,” he said at a daily press briefing.The president can constitutionally exercise a veto within a 15-day period after the parliament sends a bill to receive the president’s signature. If the president returns the bill, the parliament is required to put the bill up for vote again. To override the president‘s veto, the Assembly would require approval from more than two-thirds of attending lawmakers. If it fails to meet the quorum, the bill would automatically be scrapped.Min, however, refrained to answer when the president would exercise her veto.Observers said the matter is likely to be discussed during a weekly Cabinet meeting next week, or even at a later time, as the president is at the moment struggling to resolve growing public resentment toward the government’s bungled responses to the Middle East respiratory syndrome. The president exercising her veto over the bill would further intensify the feud between her and the parliament, particularly with her own party, observers said.Complaints have been growing within the Saenuri Party with Cheong Wa Dae publicly denouncing the ruling party for succumbing to the opposition’s demands to pass the bill.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","monday afternoon to seek president ,changes to government ordinances monday ,her veto over the bill ,discussed during weekly cabinet meeting ,the president returns the bill","['National Assembly', 'National Assembly', 'Chung Ui', 'Park Geun', 'Assembly', 'Park ’s', 'Assembly', 'Cabinet', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Dae', 'Cho Chung - un']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.2834968   0.23937714

The percentage of respondents who disapproved of her state management also surged 7.5 percentage points to 60.8 percent, it said. The poll was conducted from June 8-12 with 2,500 adults. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.0 percentage points with a confidence level of 95 percent.“The growing number of MERS deaths and the confirmed cases of the disease as well as the rising concerns that the virus may have transmitted to the general public appear to have played a part in a steep drop in Park’s ratings,” said Realmeter in a statement.The MERS crisis has also pulled down the popularity of the governing Saenuri Party and its chairman Kim Moo-sung, widely regarded as one of strong contenders for the next presidential race in 2017.The approval rating for the Saenuri Party fell 1.8 percentage points to 36.5 percent, the lowest mark since it won a landslide victory in the April 29 by-elections, while the rating for the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy rebounded 2.3 percentage points to 30.3 percent.Kim was ranked second in the list of the most-favored presidential hopefuls, trailing Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon, who blasted the central government for keeping the information of hospitals and patients confidential.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","syndrome further dragged down president ,party fell percentage points ,presidential hopefuls trailing seoul mayor ,steep drop in park ratings ,week despite her last minute","['Park Geun - hye', 'the United States', 'Seoul', 'Park ’s', 'Park', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'the Saenuri Party', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Kim', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Cho Chung - un']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55352646  0.39894167

Chung Ui-hwa’s mediation over the bill. Chung had proposed to amend contentious words to bridge the partisan gap and prevent potential clashes with the Constitution. “(My proposal’s) whole purpose is to eliminate the bill’s unconstitutionality,” said Chung. “Therefore, I believe there will be no unnecessary clashes between the legislature and the executive branch. I sincerely appreciate both parties’ cooperation,” Chung said. The bill initially stated that the assembly can “demand” the government change an enforcement decree, but Chung had asked the lawmakers to replace the word “demand” with “request” to prevent constitutional violations.The NPAD agreed Monday to accept the speaker’s proposal at a meeting where key NPAD lawmakers attended. The party pointed out that the speaker’s version is “virtually” the same as the original one, arguing it is “merely” the change of a phrase. “We have agreed to accept the speaker’s proposal,” said NPAD floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul. “The change is only limited to the word choice, basically replacing the word ‘demand’ with ‘request.’ We have decided to stop political bickering (over the issue),” said Lee. Lee urged the speaker to ask the president to stop threatening to veto the bill, demanding the speaker’s commitment to bringing the bill to the floor once again for a vote even if the president vetoed the bill. The speaker said it is “unlikely” that the president would veto the bill. The ruling Saenuri Party, however, refused to give the NPAD assurance to bring the bill to the floor in the event of the president’s veto. “I can’t not give my word to the NPAD (on the vote),” Saenuri Party floor leader Yoo Seung-min said Monday. Meanwhile, Cheong Wa Dae has yet to rule out the possibility of vetoing the bill. “(The speaker’s proposal) could still violate the Constitution. The government could veto the bill if it perceives that (the bill) could encroach upon its executive right,” said Rep. Kim Jae-won of Saenuri Party, a senior aide to the president.

Hong Joon-pyo -- without detention on charges of violating the Political Fund Act. The result of the probe into the graft scandal will also follow. The indictment comes nearly two months after investigators launched a probe into the allegations that eight senior officials from the Park administration accepted illicit political donations from Sung, the deceased chairman of Keangnam Enterprises. Sung claimed in a media interview that he offered campaign money to eight politicians close to President Park before committing suicide in April. The police found a handwritten note in his pocket that listed the names of the politicians and the bribe amounts he allegedly handed over. The former premier Lee, who stepped down from the post on April 27, is suspected of having received 30 million won ($27,000) from Sung in April 2013. Sung allegedly offered 100 million won to Gov. Hong in June 2011, when the four-term lawmaker was running for chief of the Grand National Party, the precursor to the ruling Saenuri Party.The prosecution sent inquiry letters late last month to the remaining six politicians listed in Sung’s memo, requesting information on their relations with Sung, as well as their roles at the ruling party in 2012.

They had a phone conversation two days after Park decided to delay her visit, which Cheong Wa Dae said was aimed at focusing on coping with the Middle East respiratory syndrome epidemic here. As the outbreak continued to spiral, controversy erupted over whether she should scrap the trip. Some ranking officials, including top diplomats, opposed a cancellation. But public sentiment appears to have held more sway, prompting senior members of the ruling Saenuri Party to chip in and support calls from opposition lawmakers. During the phone conversation, Obama displayed support for her “decision, judgment and leadership,” relaying his condolences to the MERS victims and their bereaved families, the presidential office said. “President Obama said he has instructed aides to hold consultations at the most convenient and quickest time possible so that her visit to the U.S. can be rearranged,” it said in a press statement. “He also referred to the South Korea-U.S. alliance as Washington’s ‘top priority,’ stressing that reinforcing the partnership on new fronts such as North Korea’s threats, climate change and cybersecurity will greatly help not only the two countries, but also around the world.” Park, for her part, expressed gratitude for his understanding and hopes for an early formal ratification of their bilateral civilian nuclear energy pact that was forecast to be signed by the two leaders during her visit. The allies initialed an amendment to their 1974 accord in April, paving the way for Seoul to pursue reprocessing spent fuel rods through nascent technology called pyroprocessing and enriching uranium to low levels on a limited, consensus-required basis. Obama endorsed the deal Thursday, which he said will promote “common defense and security.” “I have determined that the performance of the proposed agreement will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to, the common defense and security,” Obama said in a memorandum for the secretary of state and the secretary of energy.“I hereby approve the proposed agreement and authorize the secretary of state to arrange for its execution.” After an official signing, the agreement will be sent to the U.S. Congress for a 90-day review, which means it may take up to six months. It will then take effect if it is not opposed.Park has already granted her approval and, unlike in the U.S., no parliamentary authorization is needed here for the pact to come into force.

President Park Geun-hye's office announced earlier Wednesday that Park had postponed her planned U.S. visit to focus on dealing with the outbreak.The outbreak has killed nine people and infected more than 100 in South Korea, but has occurred only at hospitals. MERS spreads through close contact with sick people, not through the air Even so, there have been widespread fears and rumors, and more than 2,700 schools remain closed and about 3,440 people were isolated Wednesday because they have had contact with infected people.``Strong consideration should be given to reopening schools, as schools have not been linked to transmission of'' the MERS virus in South Korea, said a release from the joint WHO-South Korea mission tasked with reviewing the outbreak.Other South Korean doctors have already described the massive school closures as nonsensical because there has been no evidence of the virus' transmission in the community.   It was not immediately known how many schools would follow the recommendation. But South Korean officials hope the outbreak will come under control around Friday, the last day of the virus' maximum two-week incubation period for those infected by a patient considered as the main source of the second round of the MERS outbreak. Officials say the first wave of the outbreak has ended. But critics say the outbreak will continue if infected people evade government quarantine measures and spread the virus.  MERS has mostly been centered in Saudi Arabia. It belongs to the family of coronaviruses that includes the common cold and SARS, and can cause fever, breathing problems, pneumonia and kidney failure.The South Korean outbreak originated from a 68-year-old man who had traveled to the Middle East before being diagnosed as the country's first MERS patient last month.

(Yonhap)Most witnesses repeated what Hwang had offered as explanation to the opposition’s claims or reiterated, “I do not know.”Opposition lawmakers expressed frustration at the answers and threatened to boycott the final vote on Hwang’s appointment.

Hong Moon-jong for questioning on Monday over allegations that he received illicit campaign funds from deceased business tycoon Sung Woan-jong. Hong, 60, is the third political bigwig quizzed by prosecutors in connection with the high-profile graft scandal involving President Park Geun-hye’s top aides. He was suspected of taking 200 million won ($178,000) in illegal campaign funds from Sung, late chairman of Keangnam Enterprises, for then-presidential candidate Park in 2012. Hong was serving as the chief of her election camp. The three-term lawmaker turned up at the Seoul High Prosecutors’ Office at around 12:40 p.m. to respond to the summons. Asked whether he admitted to accepting the bribe, Hong curtly replied “No” and said he wanted the truth to be revealed.  Saenuri Party lawmaker Rep. Hong Moon-jong (center) answers questions from reporters before entering the Seoul High Prosecutors’ Office for questioning on Monday. (Yonhap)Prosecutors said earlier on Sunday that they will focus on interrogating why Hong met Sung on several occasions and whether he took illicit funds from the deceased businessman. The graft scandal surfaced after Sung claimed in a media interview that he offered campaign money to eight politicians close to President Park before committing suicide in April. The police found a hand-written note in his pocket that listed the names of the politicians and the bribe amounts he allegedly handed over. Hong’s name was written next to 200 million won. Investigators have already grilled former Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo and South Gyeongsang Province Gov. Hong Joon-pyo last month over the bribery accusations. The two political heavyweights are set to be indicted soon without detention on charges of violating the Political Fund Act, prosecutors said. The prosecution sent inquiry letters late last month to the remaining six politicians listed on Sung’s memo, requesting information on their relations with Sung, as well as their roles at the ruling party in 2012. The six include Hong, incumbent Presidential Chief of Staff Lee Byung-kee, his two predecessors ― Huh Tae-yeol and Kim Ki-choon and Saenuri-affiliated lawmakers ― Incheon Mayor Yoo Jeong-bok and Busan Mayor Suh Byung-soo.Hong is the first of the remaining six to be physically called in. The summons came after prosecutors found his explanations ― in the written response ― on the money flow and his movements unsatisfactory, prosecutors said. With the investigation process dragging on endlessly and the six politicians being probed only through written transcripts, the opposition bloc has blasted the prosecution for being soft on them to shield President Park’s administration.Two months on since the graft scandal broke, prosecutors announced that they will soon indict the ex-prime minister and governor without detention, with the whole process appearing to lose steam and interest from the public. But sources expect that Hong’s questioning will set the direction for the rest of the probe, and possibly speed up the investigation. Meanwhile, the court rejected the prosecutors’ request for the arrest of former ruling Saenuri Party official, identified only by his surname Kim, on Sunday night citing lack of evidence. Prosecutors had sought for the arrest on Thursday as part of the widening probe into Sung’s memo. He is suspected of receiving 200 million won in 2012 from Sung when he was the chief cospokesperson for President Park’s election camp. The focal point in the investigation on Kim was the timing of the delivery of suspected money. Investigators tried to find when he received the money from the late businessman and whether he delivered it to President Park’s election camp through Hong, who was holding a key post in the campaign office. But they tentatively concluded that Kim took the money in March 2012 ahead of the April parliamentary election and used it for his own campaign, not for the presidential election that took place in December. Kim applied for party nomination in the general election that year.

The man was diagnosed with MERS in China’s Guangdong province after he entered the country via Hong Kong last month.Amid growing fears about MERS in Hong Kong where nearly 300 people died in 2003 due in an outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, media criticism increased over Korea’s inept response to the outbreak of the virus. Indonesian visitors donning masks enter Korea via Incheon International Airport on Sunday, amid escalating fears over MERS. (Yonhap)Taiwan has raised its travel advisory level to yellow from gray. The yellow level is issued when a tourist is advised to take “special caution” and reconsider their trip to a particular area, while the gray level refers to a situation in which a tourist is advised to take a normal level of caution.To assuage public jitters about MERS that killed five of the 64 Koreans infected as of Sunday, Taiwan conducted anti-infection drills in some medical institutions on Saturday. During the drills, health authorities practiced transporting and quarantining a mock patient.The Taiwanese government also maintained close contact with some 300 Korean students within the country. They are also reportedly considering providing anti-infection masks to the Korean students who are to visit Korea for their summer vacation.Alerted by the increasing number of Koreans infected with MERS, Japanese health authorities have decided to conduct thorough medical checkups on all of the people including Japanese who will enter Japan from Korea. As concerns rose over the negative impact of the virus on the national image, the Seoul government vowed to strengthen cooperation with the international community to quickly and more effectively address MERS fears.“It should not been seen as a source of diplomatic tension. Rather, we should view this issue as a transnational one for which we should step up international cooperation,” an official of Seoul’s Foreign Ministry told The Korea Herald, declining to be named. On Monday, the Foreign Ministry, along with the Health Ministry, plan to hold a meeting with foreign diplomats in Seoul to explain the current situations surrounding the spread of MERS and Seoul’s efforts to contain the virus.The Seoul government also pledged to closely cooperate with the World Health Organization to investigate the spread of MERS in Korea.A team of WHO experts in virology, epidemiology and public health will launch a joint probe with Seoul officials on Tuesday to evaluate the infection situations and ascertain how the virus was spread here. Among the experts are those who previously handled the outbreak of MERS. The WHO team is led by Keiji Fukuda, its assistant director general for health security.Meanwhile, the number of tourists who have canceled their trips to Korea is on the rise, according to the state-funded Korea Tourism Organization.

They also decided to pass relevant laws in an upcoming parliamentary session while urging the government to consider raising the MERS alert level and to better communicate with local municipalities and relevant ministries.The move came as part of lawmakers’ efforts to prioritize the outbreak during the June parliamentary session which had been widely expected to become a battlefield over the new prime minister nomination and a controversial new legislative law.“At a time of national emergency, the ruling and opposition party should join hands to dissolve the public fear and overcome the crisis,” said Saenuri chairman Kim Moo-sung. NPAD leader Moon Jae-in also voiced his support and said the meeting was productive. “Now we are able to relay information between the central government and local municipalities in real time. And we agreed to do the information sharing quickly and accurately. It is a huge step forward,” said Moon. NPAD had demanded the government publicize relevant MERS information to the public and share it with local authorities. The government, on the same day, disclosed the names of six hospitals with confirmed MERS cases and 18 others that MERS patients had visited.Rival parties also agreed to pass MERS-related laws in the June parliamentary session. The laws are designed to beef up measures for quarantine, refine the government’s manuals for an outbreak of diseases and formulate aid programs to the victims, according to a statement released after the meeting.They also decided to provide assistance to the MERS patients and medical workers. They will give financial aid to the patients and provide medical workers with technical assistance, such as giving to them masks and other protective gear and medical equipment.Despite commendable bipartisan agreement, rival parties have continued to quarrel over the new legislative law that empowers lawmakers to demand an amendment of government decrees. The Saenuri chief reportedly raised the issue during the meeting. He asserted that the law does not have a mandatory clause to force the government to review its decrees, but the NPAD rejected his argument. Meanwhile, the NPAD demanded the Saenuri Party postpone the scheduled parliamentary hearing of Prime Minister-designate Hwang Kyo-ahn, saying that the nominee had failed to submit relevant documents for the hearing.

The number of confirmed patients has steadily risen since the first patient was confirmed late last month. Those under quarantine rose to over 1,800, the Health Ministry said earlier Friday.Sunday’s gathering also comes amid escalating calls from the public that the government disclose more information regarding the MERS threat. The government has refused to publicize the name of the hospitals where MERS patients have been found except for the hospital in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, where the first patient was found.“We must cooperate to come up with a plan to counter the MERS outbreak and the public fears that continue to grow,” Moon said. “The plan must be an all-out effort, including a unified team from local governments, the central government, the legislature and education ministries.”Moon also met Gyeonggi Province Gov. Nam Kyung-pil of the Saenuri Party earlier Friday to discuss possible plans to counter MERS. The outbreak has been worse in Gyeonggi Province, with over 1,000 under isolation there.“The governor and I agreed that interparty efforts are necessary and that taking care of the situation must come before we start blaming officials for incompetence,” Moon said.Kim Moo-sung, meanwhile, urged the people to be calm, saying, “Excessively dealing with MERS will be a huge loss for the country.”While attending an event in Busan, he added, “While it is true that the (government) took poor initial response, and they must be held accountable, we must also quickly remove the fears.”He urged the government to better publicize that MERS is less contagious than swine flu and that it has the similar level of fatality as pneumonia.“Our economy went through an extremely difficult time after last year’s Sewol (accident). If the fears of MERS get out of hand, the impact will be worse than Sewol by tenfold,” he said referring to the ferry sinking that claimed the lives of more than 300 passengers.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","an emergency meeting on sunday ,emergency meeting on sunday ,party earlier friday to discuss ,friday sunday gathering also comes ,emergency meeting on sunday to","['Kim Moo - sing', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Saenuri Party', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Saenuri', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'NPAD', 'Lee Jong - kul', 'the Health Ministry', 'Pyeongtaek', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Moon', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Nam Kyung - pil', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Moon', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Busan', 'Jeong Hunny']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45317578  0.62124562

The eight politicians in the memo include President Park's former and current chiefs of staff. The prosecution earlier said it will soon indict former Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo and Hong Joon-pyo, governor of South Gyeongsang Province, on charges of violating the law governing illegal political funds.Sung also suggested in the memo that he had given the illegal political funds to six other people, including Hong Moon-jong, a ruling party lawmaker who had been in a key post in the Park camp, as well as Yoo Jeong-bok and Seo Byung-soo, the current mayors of Incheon and Busan.

The woman had drunk one bottle of soju, and when the husband returned home from work, they drank three or four more bottles together, the police said, adding that both appear to have been intoxicated.The husband was also arrested for not intervening and for hitting the girl on the head after she was assaulted by her mother.The woman called the emergency dispatch center after her daughter stopped breathing. The girl died 40 minutes after arriving at the hospital. Police said the woman seems to have beaten the child regularly.Police plan to request an autopsy to determine the cause of the girl’s death and seek a formal arrest warrant for the woman, Jeong said.More than 10,000 cases of child abuse were reported last year, up 48 percent from a year earlier, according to government data.A series of high-profile child abuse incidents has raised awareness about the issue and toughened related laws.In October, a 41-year-old woman was sentenced to 18 years in prison for beating her 8-year-old stepdaughter to death in Ulsan.Earlier in 2014, a 36-year-old woman in Chilgok, North Gyeongsang Province, was imprisoned for 10 years after murdering her 8-year-old stepdaughter.From news reports (khnews@heraldcorp.com)","murdering her year old stepdaughter ,arrested wednesday for allegedly beating ,girl to death for throwing ,hitting their daughter repeatedly ,beating 30 month old girl","['Ulsan', 'Jeong', 'Ulsan', 'Chilgok', 'North Gyeongsang Province']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.14534378  0.2687448

Ahn Cheol-soo on Tuesday confirmed his plan to run in the 2017 presidential election.In a radio interview, Ahn said “of course” to a question on his bid, after repeatedly trying to dodge a direct response such as by saying, “The decision is not up to me, but the people.” Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo. YonhapAhn’s confirmation signaled a looming rivalry with the New Politics Alliance for Democracy chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in, who is considered the front-runner for the party’s next presidential candidacy.The two have shared love-hate relationship since the 2012 presidential race, when independent candidate Ahn withdrew his bid and threw his support behind Moon to jointly go up against Saenuri Party candidate Park Geun-hye. Their last-minute collaboration, following a tumultuous negotiation, was considered inevitable as Moon was suffering from lagging ratings, while Ahn, a novice politician, lacked partisan backing despite his high popularity. Their ostensible partnership, however, has remained rickety as Ahn often butted heads with Moon, who became the party leader in March, over key controversial issues. Most recently, Ahn turned down Moon’s public proposal for him to lead the party’s reform after its crushing by-elections defeat. Ahn’s rejection dealt a blow to Moon, who was already facing mounting criticism from the party’s nonmainstreamers for his leadership.Later, Ahn’s associates said the former entrepreneur’s presidential bid remarks were a “theoretical” one and that no significant meaning should be placed.Ahn’s interview was carried out on the same day when the NPAD members led by Moon attended a workshop to review party reforms and policies. Ahn’s absence at the event illustrated internal discord within the party suffering from deep-rooted factional feud between former President Roh Moo-hyun’s loyalists and the non-mainstreamers.During the interview, Ahn said he turned down Moon’s offer to head the reform team because he deemed he was not fit for the post. The party leadership later picked Kim Sang-kon, former head of the Gyeonggi Provincial Education Office, to chair the committee.Ahn also took the opportunity for a swipe at Moon.“Didn’t he win the (party leadership race) by pledging reform? In order for the reform chairman to succeed, the party chairman must stand in the front and work to narrow the differences when reform ideas are met by opposition,” Ahn said.“A failure by the reform committee chair would be equivalent to a failure of the party chairman.”Latest surveys show Moon leading Ahn among the potential next presidential candidates.In the Gallup poll conducted on May 12-14, Moon received 15 percent of approval ratings, while Ahn collected 10 percent.Another survey by Realmeter on May 26-29 showed Moon leading Ahn by a larger margin with 18.3 percent against 7.7 percent.(jhl@heraldcorp.com)","party next presidential candidacy ,2017 presidential election in radio ,the party next presidential candidacy ,party chairman latest surveys show ,former entrepreneur presidential bid remarks","['Ahn Cheol', 'Ahn', 'Ahn Cheol', 'YonhapAhn ’s', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Ahn', 'Moon', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Ahn', 'Moon ’s', 'ahn ’s', 'Moon', 'Ahn ’s', 'ahn ’s', 'NPAD', 'Moon', 'ahn ’s', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Ahn', 'Moon ’s', 'Kim Sang - kon', 'the Gyeonggi Provincial Education Office', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Ahn', 'Gallup', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Ahn']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65996212  0.37439421

484,484,Korea to push ahead with peak wage system,The government and the ruling Saenuri party agreed Tuesday to push to expand the controversial “peak wage system” into the private sector by mapping out guidelines that enable companies to change employment regulations without unions’ approval. The decision came as part of President Park Geun-hye administration’s drive for labor market reform during a meeting between the ruling Saenuri Party members of the parlia...,"The government and the ruling Saenuri party agreed Tuesday to push to expand the controversial “peak wage system” into the private sector by mapping out guidelines that enable companies to change employment regulations without unions’ approval. The decision came as part of President Park Geun-hye administration’s drive for labor market reform during a meeting between the ruling Saenuri Party members of the parliamentary environment and labor committee and Minister of Employment and Labor Lee Ki-kwon.The government’s plan, however, is expected to add fuel to outrage among the nation’s two largest labor organizations ― the Federation of Korean Trade Unions and the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions ― that view the peak wage system as disadvantageous for workers. They believe the scheme only benefits employers by making it easier for them to lay off workers. Under the peak wage system, companies would pay senior employees reduced salaries after the workers peak at a certain age, generally between 55 and 60, in return for extending their retirement age by a few years. “Amid growing concerns over youth unemployment and job insecurity for the older generation, the peak wage program is needed to create an employment-friendly structure that encourages companies to hire more young people,” Labor Minister Lee said at the meeting. “The focal points in reforming the wage system are ordinary wages and reduced working hours,” Lee said, calling on the environment and labor committee to swiftly legalize the issues in the upcoming parliamentary session this month. With the official retirement age set to rise by two years to 60 next year, the government has pushed ahead with plans to overhaul what it saw as “rigid” labor market to make it flexible for companies to hire and fire people. The government believes that the peak wage program is a key to tackling the youth unemployment problem here. It argues that without such a measure, companies will be even more reluctant to hire new employees, thus reducing room for young job seekers to enter the labor force.“The peak wage system helps senior employees hold on to their jobs until they reach retirement age,” said a research fellow Ahn Joo-yeop from government-run Korea Labor Institute. “When workers in the top 10 percent of the income bracket give up their pay raises, the resources can be used to create 150,000 to 218,000 jobs for the young,” he added. According to the government data, the jobless rate among people between 15 and 29 stood at 10.2 percent as of April, significantly higher than the country’s overall 3.9 percent.But the government’s decision to push for reform plans led to fierce opposition from the labor unions.When the government held a public hearing in Seoul last week to discuss guidelines that will allow companies to change employment rules without unions’ approval, some 200 trade union members blockaded the conference room with desks and chairs to prevent the labor minister from entering. He had to leave the scene about 10 minutes after arrival. Enraged by what the unions claimed was the government’s unilateral decision, the unionized workers chanted at the scene, holding up the placards that read “Stop the peak wage system that forces workers to accept reduced pay” and “The change in employment regulations (without unions’ approval) is illegal and against the Labor Standards Act.” “The government is trying to use the public hearing to show that it is listening to laborers, but (given the history) we know that it is nothing more than a gesture to force us to accept their policies,” the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions said in a statement released shortly before the incident. “Without guaranteeing that employees won’t be laid off and retirement age will be extended in every company, the government is only trying to slash our wages first, taking sides with companies in the name of boosting the economy,” the organization added. Earlier in April, the trilateral negotiations to discuss employment conditions among laborers, employers and lawmakers failed, highlighting a tough road ahead for the government to seek support from the labor circles. The government has already decided to implement the peak wage system for 316 state-run organizations starting next year, with its plans to draw up guidelines to expand the scheme into private sector by the end of June. Meanwhile, the two main labor unions vowed all-out war against the government’s push for labor market reforms. The Federation of Korean Trade Unions will vote in mid-June on whether it will go on an all-out strike to protest the government’s proposal.

(Yonhap)The president’s rejection was widely seen as indicating her intention to use her veto if no changes are made to the bill before it reaches the stage of her endorsement. It was also viewed as showing Park’s willingness to block the bill at all costs despite it being a crucial time for her to earn the cooperation of the National Assembly in getting her reform bills and the new prime minister approved.The president can constitutionally exercise a veto within the 15-day period after the parliament sends a bill to receive the president’s signature. If the president returns the bill, the parliament is required to put the bill up for vote again. To override the president‘s veto, the Assembly would require approval from more than two thirds of attending lawmakers. If it fails to meet the quorum, the bill would automatically be scrapped.Citing that similar bills in the past have failed to pass the Assembly as it was viewed as unconstitutional, Park urged the lawmakers to revise the bill.She also slammed both parties for “hastily passing” the bill in exchange for reaching a compromise on a separate reform bill on civil servants’ pension system.The controversial parliamentary law was revised in a plenary session last week as a condition to pass a reform bill on public servants’ pensions proposed by the ruling party. The bill requires government agencies to review their ordinances upon a request by the parliament. The bill was pushed by the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy as it was seeking for a change to the government’s decree that allows public officials to take part in an independent probe into the sinking of the Sewol ferry last year.Cheong Wa Dae instantly opposed the revision, calling it a violation of the constitutional principle that stipulates the division of powers. The bill could also infringe on the executive branch’s right to enact laws, it said. The presidential office also urged the rival parties to clarify their positions over the exact requirements set by the bill, namely the forcibleness the parties’ “demand” would have on the government enforcement ordinances.The ruling party has said the clause would only enable the lawmakers to voice their concerns over any controversial ordinance, while the opposition argued it would have a binding force for the government to make due changes upon legislative opposition. Park’s strong wordings also exposed widening cracks among the ruling camp. Saenuri lawmakers from the Pro-Park faction publicly slammed the party’s non-mainstream leaders, chairman Kim Moo-sung and floor leader Yoo Seung-min, for succumbing to the opposition’s demand at the cost of risking a violation to the Constitution.Saenuri chief Kim, for the time being, is keeping a low profile, saying that the party remains in sync with the president. “The president and the party cannot have different views,” he told reporters after a supreme council meeting. The NPAD, meanwhile, denounced Park for rejecting the bill, saying she was declaring a war against the legislature.NPAD chairman Moon Jae-in criticized the president, saying her remarks were “too much” and urged the government to draft ordinances in accordance with the law as legislated by the parliament in the future.“Legislation rights basically belong to the National Assembly. The government needs to draft an enforcement ordinance within the authority delegated by the law in the first place,“ he said.The issue drew mixed views from legal experts here with some claiming that the bill violates the Constitution because it carries legal binding power that allows the lawmakers to force the government to revise its ordinance. Officials would have no right to veto the request, they added.Law professor Lee Sang-don of Chung-Ang University in Seoul, however, said the bill does not carry unconstitutional elements because it is not about using “the legislative veto.” “The bill does not give the parliament the right or legal force to invalidate the government’s ordinances. I hardly see that the bill violates the Constitution,“ he said.

The 31-year-old woman, only identified by her surname Kim, was apprehended in Jung-gu, central Seoul, on charges of damaging private property, according to Namdaemun Police Station. Kim allegedly spray-painted a heart-shaped image and Roman alphabet letters with an unidentified man on the wall of a building in Myeong-dong, one of Seoul’s busiest shopping districts, with tourists. During the police investigation, the German woman, who entered Korea in April to meet her parents, stated that the graffiti was intended to promote world peace. She does not seem to be affiliated with any organizations, police said. “We are tracing the man who ran away from the scene, but it is difficult to detain him due to lack of evidence,” police said. In Korea, painting graffiti on private property without permission can be punishable with a penalty of 7 million won ($6,300) and up to three years in prison. Those who draw graffiti on public property face a heavier penalty of up to 20 million won and 10 years in jail on charges. Seoul has seen more and more graffiti, with police suspecting foreign nationals of painting graffiti found only meters away from a police office in Myeong-dong.

But Kim appears to be attempting to boost his credentials as a possible 2017 presidential candidate through the trip, observers commented. If confirmed, Kim’s visit to the U.S. will be his second overseas trip since taking the party chairmanship last year. In October, he visited Beijing and met Chinese President Xi Jinping.“(Conservative) party politicians (in South Korea) have gone to the U.S. before bidding for a presidential run,” said Choi Young-jin, professor of Korean politics at Chung-Ang University.“Presidential bid-seekers (on the right) are often interested in showing their party that they are respected internationally, especially in the U.S., as they often have the South Korea-U.S. alliance at the center of their foreign policy platform,” Choi added.Kim is expected to stop at major U.S. cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago, New York and Washington. The five-term lawmaker will hold round-table meetings with leaders of the local Korean communities there and also possibly meet with senior officials of the Obama administration as well as U.S. Rep.

The National Assembly is to start a 30-day extraordinary session on Thursday, which would include a confirmation hearing on Prime Minister nominee Hwang Kyo-ahn to test whether he is qualified for the nation’s No. 2 post. Lawmakers are also expected to lock horns over Park’s reform bills, which have remained stalled for months, as well as the controversial passage of a government decree over the Sewol probe.The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy has pledged a “thorough” screening of Hwang and pending bills, but the ruling Saenuri Party has vowed to block the NPAD’s attempts to “undermine” the legislative process.Lawmakers are expected to wrangle over the scope and authority of a bill that gave them the right to demand an amendment to the government enforcement decree of the special Sewol bill. The decree stipulates that a number of public officials will be a part of an independent probe into the Sewol ferry sinking in April 2014.According to the revised bill, however, lawmakers are authorized to “demand” changes to a decree issued by the executive branch. The government has expressed objection to the law, saying that it would violate the rule of separation of powers.The Saenuri Party has also vowed to complete the parliament’s evaluation of the prime minister as early as possible in the upcoming session to end an administrative impasse. The post has remained vacant for more than a month since former Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo stepped down under political pressure over his involvement in a bribery scandal.Hwang, the incumbent justice minister, was named the new prime minister late last month. President Park selected Hwang for the post, calling him “the best one for delivering national unity and accomplishing an administrative overhaul.”The NPAD, however, has vowed to take as much time as necessary to determine whether Hwang is the best fit for the premiership. The party has alleged that Hwang failed to report his use of business allowances to the authorities and has made politically and religiously biased remarks. “Hwang should be held accountable for the allegations against him,“ NPAD spokesperson Park Soo-hyun said Sunday. “Ever since Hwang was nominated, a series of allegations has surfaced and the public has demanded answers from him. Yet, he has refused to explain himself.”With dozens of bills pending at parliament, rival parties are expected to continue their legislative tug-of-war over economic-related bills, including a list of draft laws aiming to legalize crowdfunding, to allow large corporations to engage in subcontracting and to foster tourism and the medical industry. President Park and the Saenuri Party accused the NPAD of blocking the passage of the bills, saying they would boost the economy and create jobs. “The bills will do nothing but good for our nation,” said President Park last Wednesday. “It is not the National Assembly’s job to block young Koreans from getting help and creating their own companies. I believe the legislature’s job is to pass good bills as soon as possible,” said Park. The NPAD, however, asserted that the party would determine whether the bills would bring expected economic benefits to the nation, refuting the president’s allegations that the party has been blocking legislation of the bills.“We will determine whether the bill is in the interest of the people,” said Park. “The president and Saenuri Party will continue to make their case for economic benefits, but we will make sure to find out exactly whether the bills are truly for the people,” said Park.

None disapproved, while 13 abstained. The Assembly also approved about 60 bills that had been stalled since April due to the partisan stalemate. Various surveys have showed that the changes to the civil service pension will save the government 333 trillion won ($303 billion) over the next 70 years. Saenuri Party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung (right) claps as the plenary session wrapped up after some 60 bills, including the contentious civil pension reform, were endorsed early Friday at the National Assembly. (Yonhap)The reform will raise the contribution rate of public service pensions from 7 percent to 9 percent in the next five years, while reducing entitlements from 1.9 percent to 1.7 percent in stages over 20 years. It would also delay the first payment of public pensions by pushing back the retirement age from the 60 to 65.While most of the details had been agreed upon via special committees and negotiations, the parties have been at loggerheads over the opposition’s demand that the civil service pension reforms be linked to revisions that would increase annuities from the national pension. In connection with the civil servants’ pension reform endorsement, the parties voted to establish a special parliamentary committee and an organization encompassing the social sector to discuss ways to give a face-lift to the national pension fund.Both bodies will be active until the end of October and the special committee could be extended for 25 more days if necessary.The bills’ approval came after drawn-out talks Thursday between the ruling Saenuri Party and the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy over a government enforcement decree of the special Sewol bill. The bill obliges the government to conduct investigations into the government’s failure to rescue over 300 passengers when the Sewol ferry sank in April 2014.The NPAD had charged that the decree allows the government to meddle in the probes by placing public officials in the probe’s executive positions.After hours of a tug-of-war, the parties agreed to a compromise deal allowing amendments to parliamentary rules to enable lawmakers to revise such decrees. Their decision, however, was met with angry response from Cheong Wa Dae and some of the Saenuri Party members, who claimed revising the decree violates the Constitution, signaling yet another round of heavy political wrangling ahead.The Saenuri Party had earlier in the day criticized the NPAD for holding scores of draft bills hostage to its demands.“You cannot hold bills hostage for partisan interests,” Saenuri Rep. Cho Hae-jin had said. The NPAD has unnecessarily delayed reforms to the civil service pension and an array of economy-boosting legislations, Cho added.The NPAD, despite its legislative minority, can stall bills from going to a plenary vote, as it holds the chairmanship of the Legislation and Judiciary Committee.

Kim was suspected of receiving 200 million won ($181,000) in illicit political funds from a confidant of Sung, the chairman of Keangnam Enterprises, at the company’s headquarters ahead of the 2012 presidential election. Following the raid, the prosecution summoned Kim in the afternoon to question him as to whether he accepted money from the late businessman and to whom he delivered the money. The graft scandal surfaced after Sung claimed in a media interview that he offered campaign funds to eight politicians including South Gyeongsang Province Gov. Hong Joon-pyo and former Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo before his suicide last month. Prosecutors are scheduled to indict the two political heavyweights without detention on charges of violating the Political Fund Act. The prosecution, meanwhile, sent a letter requesting relevant documents from the remaining six that were mentioned on Sung’s list. They include Saenuri Rep. Hong Moon-jong, Incheon Mayor Yoo Jeong-bok, Busan Mayor Suh Byung-soo and former presidential chiefs of staff Kim Ki-choon and Huh Tae-yeol.

The reclusive state called Park a “rare wicked woman” and “a loyal dog of a (U.S.) colony” in a white paper published Wednesday.“It is very regrettable that the North has defamed the head of state representing (South Korean) people,” said an official at Seoul’s Unification Ministry, declining to be named.“We call on North Korea to stop the slander that does not help the two Koreas reopen bilateral dialogue. We also call on it to respond to our calls for talks and move out onto the path of inter-Korean development and reunification.”Amid the exchange of harsh words, observers raised the possibility that the isolated country could set off provocations unexpectedly in a show of force and displeasure rather than coming forward for dialogue.The North has used blatant words to attack Park in a series of commentaries in its state media including the Rodong Sinmun, the daily of the ruling Workers’ Party; the Korean Central News Agency; and the Minju Joseon, a newsletter for the North’s cabinet.On Thursday, Uriminjokkiri, a propaganda website run by the North’s Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, criticized Park’s visit to the U.S., slated for June 14-18, saying that it would undermine the preparation of an inter-Korean ceremony in Pyongyang to mark the 15th anniversary of the so-called June 15 inter-Korean declaration.“(Park’s visit to the U.S.) will be a perilous gambling that puts the security of the Korean Peninsula and the region at risk,” the website said in its commentary.Meanwhile, Seoul’s chief nuclear envoy Hwang Joon-kook and his U.S counterpart Sung Kim flew to Beijing Thursday to hold separate bilateral talks with China’s point man on North Korea’s denuclearization, Wu Dawei.Their trip to China came the day after they held a trilateral meeting with their Japanese counterpart Junichi Ihara in Seoul to discuss the escalating nuclear threats from the North.Their talks with the Chinese envoy are expected to focus on stressing China’s responsibility in addressing North Korea’s nuclear issue and coordinating a joint response to its enhancement of nuclear capabilities including the technology to develop an SLBM.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","north korea thursday for slandering ,thursday for slandering its president ,korea thursday for slandering ,korea thursday for slandering its ,slandering its president park","['South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Pyongyang', 'Park', 'North ’s', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Tokyo', 'Pyongyang', 'Park', 'U.S.', 'south korean', 'Seoul ’s Unification Ministry', 'North Korea', 'Koreas', 'inter - korean', 'the Rodong Sinmun', 'Workers ’ Party', 'the Korean Central News Agency', 'the Minju Joseon', 'Uriminjokkiri', 'the North ’s Committee', 'Fatherland', 'Park ’s', 'U.S.', 'inter - korean', 'Pyongyang', 'inter - korean', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Hwang Joon - kook', 'U.S', 'Sung Kim', 'Beijing', 'China', 'North Korea ’s', 'Wu Dawei', 'China', 'japanese', 'Junichi Ihara', 'Seoul', 'chinese', 'China', 'North Korea ’s', 'Song Sang - ho']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.14471509  0.57838899

Senior members of the Saenuri Party criticized the so-called “National Assembly Advancement Act” for blocking the passage of key draft bills such as a national pension reform bill. The law requires the approval of more than three-fifths of lawmakers to put contentious draft bills to a final vote on the floor. “The National Advancement Act is a main culprit (for the Assembly’s impasse),” said Rep. Suh Chung-won of Saenuri Party on Thursday. “I will do whatever it takes to revise the act. If necessary, we should file a constitutional appeal or revise the National Assembly law,” said Suh. The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, however, had asserted that the accusation was an attempt to cover the governing party’s uncompromising attitudes during parliamentary negotiations. “(Saenuri Party) is shifting the blame over the assembly act,” NPAD floor leader Rep. Lee Jung-gul said earlier this month. “I understand there are some issues with the act, but the act itself was an agreement between us and Saenuri Party. Saenuri Party should reflect on what they have done,” said Lee. The act, introduced in 2012, aims to prevent the majority party from unilaterally attempting to bulldoze through bills, while keeping in check any attempt by a party to violently block a passage of bills. According to the act, a parliamentary speaker is not allowed to put a bill to a final vote unless there is a national emergency, an act of God or a consensus between the speaker and each party’s parliamentary representatives.Instead, the act introduced a faster legislative process for bills pending in the Legislative and Judiciary Committee, the last stop before a floor vote, for more than 120 days. The fast-track vote would take place when demanded by at least half of the attending lawmakers of a relevant committee or lawmakers of the plenary session, to be approved by three-fifths of the lawmakers in a secret ballot vote. The act, widely hailed at the time as a step towards an improved parliamentary culture, was expected to foster committee-level dialogue and trade-offs among lawmakers. Some members of the Saenuri Party, many of whom also expressed doubt over the efficacy at the time, blamed the act for obstructing the legislative process because it requires the consensus of three-fifths of lawmakers to bring key draft bills to the floor. They asserted the provision is unconstitutional. Some party members filed a constitutional appeal to the court in January. According to the Korea constitution, majority rule shall be applied at the National Assembly unless otherwise stated in the law or Constitution.Experts gave mixed views to the act’s constitutionality. “The act agrees with the balance of power principle,” said Lee Sang-don, legal professor at Chung-Ang University, in an op-ed to a local daily. “The rationale for (the act) is based on the principle, so is the president’s right to veto,” he said.Shin-yul, a political professor at Myongji University, on the other hand, said, “The bill could be unconstitutional.” “But I doubt whether the National Assembly would be fully functional. I am not sure if there is sufficient legislative mechanism to hear the minority voices,” said Shin. The public is squarely divided on the effectiveness of the act. According to a Gallup poll conducted from May 19 to 21 involving 1,400 adults, 42 percent of respondents said they approved the revision of the act, while 41 percent opposed the revision, well within the margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.

The party has been beset by factional feuds since its crushing defeats in the April by-elections. “From this moment on, there are no such things as factions and interests,” said Kim. “I strongly demand the party members stop holding factional meetings. The panel will not tolerate any attempts to sabotage our reform drive,” said Kim. Kim Sang-kon. (Yonhap)NPAD leader Moon Jae-in showed his support by echoing Kim’s remarks at Wednesday’s supreme council meeting. He said Kim would successfully spearhead the party’s overhaul the same way as he had done while serving as education chief.Kim was elected as a superintendent of Gyeonggi Provincial Education Office in 2009. He was thrown into limelight as he defied then-president Lee Myung-bak’s conservative education policy and won the election. It was the first direct vote by residents in Gyeonggi Province.Kim, a strong advocate of liberal education policy, implemented free meal policy for all students, irrespective of their family’s income level. The policy caused a stir among conservative policymakers. A labor expert and a former university professor, he also focused on preparing policies to improve students’ rights. During his tenure, he laid out a so-called “student human right ordinance” to ban corporal punishments and hair length limitation. NPAD floor leader Rep. Lee Chong-gul gave credit to Kim’s leadership when he reportedly first proposed the post to him. He said on Friday Kim enjoyed wide support across the region and had strong commitment to reform. After being reelected in 2010 for Gyeonggi Province superintendent, Kim became an NPAD member. He resigned from the post in 2014 to run for the governorship of Gyeonggi Province but failed as he lost party nomination.Experts said that Kim would serve his post better even though he is not an elected lawmaker. “The fact that Kim is not a lawmaker will help him in the long term,” said Chung Hae-gu, political professor at Sungkonghoe University.“NPAD members should not sabotage Kim’s leadership. If they keep questioning whether he is the right one, the reform will fizzle out as it had done before several times,” Chung said.

They are written by the government as part of the final steps of the legislative process.The NPAD’s protest focused on the decree for the special Sewol bill, a law creating a government-sponsored probe into the Sewol ferry disaster of April last year when a ferry sinking in the West Sea left 304 dead.Victims’ families had voiced concern that the Park Geun-hye administration would likely meddle in the investigations by placing officials on the probe team’s top executive board, in accordance with the special Sewol bill’s enforcement decree.The NPAD also earlier demanded that the Saenuri Party do “something to guarantee” Moon’s exclusion from future pension debates in the parliament. The NPAD charges Moon with disrupting the assembly’s pension debates by making “factually erroneous” comments earlier this month.“There’s no telling what Moon will say to disrupt talks again,” NPAD floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul said on a local radio show on Wednesday. “The governing party must guarantee that the welfare minister will not be able to make provocative public statements in the future.”The welfare minister had likened NPAD proposals on raising the national pension’s income replacement rate to 50 percent, from the current 40, to “pirating,” earlier this month. The income replacement rate is a coefficient multiplied by lifetime average income levels for pensioners. The higher the rate, the higher the pension for beneficiaries.Moon had reasoned that raising the rate of the national pension, without raising taxes, would inevitably lead to tax hikes for future generations.The NPAD disagreed with Moon’s statements, saying the National Pension Service, the public institution managing the national pension, would be able to give increased allowances to pensioners with only a minimal tax hike on today’s taxpayers. The welfare minister, a former pension expert at a public think tank, declined to retract his comments Wednesday.“I have not made a factual error. I will stand by my words,” Moon said, refusing to apologize.The Saenuri Party, meanwhile, repeated its disagreements on muting the welfare minister. But Saenuri floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min offered a compromise deal to the NPAD, in which Moon would “express regret.”Negotiations continued throughout the day.The reforms to the civil service are aimed at reducing the public debt.

The majority ruling party hopes that the bill will be put to a final vote at a plenary session set for Thursday, Saenuri Floor Leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min said.But the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, which has been reluctant to the degree of reform proposed by the government, could hold the bill from a final vote using the parliament’s Legislation and Judiciary Committee. The committee chair, NPAD Rep. Lee Sang-min, can block bills from going to a plenary vote.Lee is likely to keep the reform bill on hold unless the Saenuri Party gives in to the NPAD demand that the parliament submit a request for removal of Welfare Minister Moon Hyung-pyo to President Park Geun-hye, NPAD lawmakers said. The Saenuri party has balked at the proposal.NPAD officials accuse the minister of making groundless arguments against the party’s stance on pension reforms.The minister opposes the opposition’s proposals to raise annuities of the national pension scheme, which covers most taxpayers. The minister earlier this month called the NPAD proposal “pirating” from future generations, as the increase would hike the national tax burden.Moon said the NPAD’s idea of raising pension annuities without raising contributions from taxpayers now would increase taxes on future generations.The NPAD called the minister’s remarks inflammatory and stated that they were based on bad information.Saenuri Party Chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung repeated his reluctance to consider the main opposition’s demands against Moon earlier Tuesday.“I just don’t understand. If you keep adding new negotiating points on top of the agreements (the parties) have made (on the civil service pension), it keeps those agreements stalled in the National Assembly,” he said.“We have to pass (civil service pension reforms) as soon as possible.”President Park also urged the main opposition to agree to pass the civil service pension reform bill at a Cabinet meeting.“I plead with lawmakers to pass the reform bill this week,” she said. “If such an option is impossible, I plead that they at least pass bills targeting youth unemployment,” she added, in reference to bills that aim to boost the economy by encouraging entrepreneurship, among others.The proposed changes to the civil service pension will save the government 333 trillion won ($303 billion) over the next 70 years, tallies by a nonpartisan expert panel of local university professors showed.Critics assert though the tallies do not consider possibilities such as improved healthcare elongating the lives of retired civil servants and the expansion of the civil service.The NPAD and the Saenuri Party have been at loggerheads over the reforms. The NPAD has demanded that the civil service pension reforms be linked to revisions that would increase annuities from the national pension. The Saenuri Party is against the idea, and supports discussing national pension reforms after passing the civil service pension reforms this week.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","lawmakers on tuesday ,lawmakers on tuesday the majority ,of its lawmakers on tuesday ,its lawmakers on tuesday ,reform bill at cabinet meeting","['South Korea ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri Floor', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Legislation and Judiciary Committee', 'NPAD', 'Lee Sang - min', 'Lee', 'the Saenuri Party', 'NPAD', 'Welfare', 'Moon Hyung - pyo', 'Park Geun - hye', 'NPAD', 'Saenuri', 'npad', 'NPAD', 'Moon', 'NPAD', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Moon', 'the National Assembly', 'Cabinet', 'NPAD', 'the Saenuri Party', 'NPAD', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Jeong Hunny']",17,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.81948262  0.22077027

The New Politics Alliance for Democracy’s ethics committee said it would suspend Rep. Jung Chung-rae from his post in the party for a year. Jung’s remark, criticizing a fellow party member, was brought to the committee after NPAD members filed a protest against him. “Six out of nine members of the ethics committee approved the suspension of Jung’s post for a year,” said Rep. Kang Chang-hee, chairman of the NPAD ethics committee. “We have come to a conclusion after collecting relevant information such as a petition by party members,” said Kang.The move, to be implemented in seven days, will oust Jung from his seat on the NPAD Supreme Council. He will, however, be able to run for next year’s general election as he managed to retain his party membership. Jung, known for being outspoken against lawmakers, came under intense criticism from within the party for his vulgar comments against fellow NPAD Supreme Council member Rep. Joo Seung-yong during a council meeting earlier this month. On May 8, Jung accused Joo of “blackmailing” the party by threatening to resign and blamed him for “sabotaging” the party’s unity. Joo had said he would resign from his post, urging the party to overhaul the leadership after crushing defeats in the April by-elections.Joo then resigned, and NPAD members, mostly nonmainstream party lawmakers, urged Jung to apologize. He visited Joo’s home to mend fences with him. Joo accepted Jung’s apology, but refused to return to the post. Mindful of escalating fractional tensions surrounding the issue, NPAD leader Rep. Moon Jae-in asked Jung on May 13 not to attend meetings of the party’s top decision-making body until the committee reached a decision. Jung complied and vowed to remain quiet until the decision.

The New Politics Alliance for Democracy said Sunday that Kim Sang-kon, the former chief of Gyeonggi Provincial Education Office, would chair the “innovation committee,” a reform body to overhaul the party, which has been beset by factional confrontations since its defeat in the April by-elections.Kim, 63, will exercise full authority to lead the reforms, party officials said. He will organize panels on the reform committee and oversee the process of nominating candidates for the next general election. Both were seen as thorny issues that would likely worsen infighting. “I agree with some people saying my position will be a poisoned chalice,” said Kim on Sunday during his acceptance speech. “But somebody should step up and do the job. I gave the proposal a lot of thought and finally decided to accept it.”The NPAD leader Rep. Moon Jae-in vowed to give Kim his full support in his task. In an interview after talks with Seoul Mayor Park Woon-soon late Sunday afternoon, he told reporters that the party agreed to grant Kim “virtually” unfettered discretion on party reform. Moon also urged him to end factional infighting and create a fair nomination process for the next general election. Moon has been accused by nonmainstream party members of inciting factional feuds and failing to address conflicts during the nomination process for the April by-elections.Kim accepted the chairmanship a week after the party announced a plan to launch the reform committee. The chair has been left vacant since Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, the former cochair of the NPAD, rejected the post. Among other candidates, Seoul National University professor Cho guk was discussed as an alternative to Ahn. However, NPAD floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul raised objections and instead proposed Kim, saying the committee chair should have ties to the party. Kim is a party member. “He has solid understanding of what is going on inside the party,” said Lee on Friday. “Besides, he has enjoyed wide support across different regions and built extensive networks while serving as a university professor. That is why (I) offered him the post.” Kim, a former university professor and a prominent labor expert, was elected as Gyeonggi education superintendent in 2010 and served until 2014. He advocated for a liberal school system and free meals for all students, irrespective of how well-off they were, defying former President Lee Myung-bak’s conservative education policy.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","sunday during his acceptance speech ,chairmanship week after the party ,main opposition party on sunday ,party reform moon also urged ,general election the new politics","['the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Kim Sang - kon', 'Gyeonggi Provincial Education Office', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'NPAD', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Kim', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Kim', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Seoul National University', 'Cho', 'NPAD', 'Lee Jong - kul', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Lee', 'Kim', 'Gyeonggi', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46847495  0.44270977

The Seoul High Court sentenced Cho to 10-month imprisonment, but suspended the term for two years.The ruling came five months after Cho, also known as Heather Cho, the eldest daughter of the airline’s chairman, was imprisoned for violation of aviation safety last December. The court handed down a reduced sentence, ruling that Cho did not cause a change in the flight path when she forced the taxiing flight back to the airport gate to deplane a chief steward in a rage over macadamia nuts. The lower court sentenced her to a one-year jail term in February. The 40-year-old could have faced up to 10 years in prison if she was found to have altered the flight path.  Cho Hyun-ah“Despite her problematic view and attitude, the accused did not seem to have the intention to threaten the flight’s safe operation,” said the chief judge Kim Sang-Hwan in the ruling.“Given the original ruling was made to protect passengers’ safety, Cho’s crime had only limited impact on the plane’s security and safe operation,” adding that the aviation law is meant to avert dangerous acts such as hijacking.But the court upheld her conviction by a lower court for assaulting the chief cabin crew Park Chang-jin and disrupting the plane’s operation with more than 200 passengers onboard. Prosecutors sought a three-year jail term for Cho, saying that she does not seem to feel sorry.She admitted to all charges except changing the flight’s course. Cho, who was in charge of in-flight service of the nation’s biggest airlines, ordered the chief steward off the flight from New York to Incheon at John F. Kennedy Airport after she was not satisfied with the way Kim Do-hee, a first-class flight attendant, served macadamia nuts ― in an unopened bag, not on a plate. Enraged by what she viewed as “poor cabin service,” Cho verbally abused the chief steward, made him kneel and jabbed his hand with a folder.The incident immediately triggered controversy over the long-held privileges of a handful of family-owned conglomerates that dominate the national economy, making it one of the most high-profile cases in Korea. On Friday morning, Cho made her appearance, wearing glasses with her hair tied up, at the Seoul High Court, filled with some 150 reporters and spectators. After the ruling, she bowed to judges, changed from her green prison uniform into black clothes and quickly left in a car without answering a flood of questions by reporters.The focal point in the verdict was whether the plane that moved about 200 meters at airport apron to return to the terminal gate could be seen as “flight route deviation.” Overturning the initial ruling, the upper court said that the aircraft’s movement on the ground is not part of the flight’s planned route, acquitting her of the charge. The judge also said that Cho seems to have deeply repented her past behavior and realized the damage she caused to victims since she began serving her term with other prisoners. “As she seems to be willing to apologize to victims, it is meaningful to give her another chance to make up for her behavior,” the judge said. “We also considered that she would have to live with social criticism.” The court also took into account that she has 2-year-old twins, never committed a crime before and stepped down from her post as vice president of Korean Air. But the victims appeared unwilling to accept her apology.The flight attendant Kim, who served the nuts in question, filed a petition to the court last weekend, calling for “stern punishment” for Cho. She claimed that the “nut rage” case led to “serious damage to her psyche and reputation.” She also filed a civil lawsuit in a U.S. court in March. The chief steward Park is also reportedly preparing to take legal action in the U.S. to seek financial compensation worth 50 billion won ($46 million).

Calls have been mounting for the New Politics Alliance for Democracy to undertake party reforms ahead of the general elections next year. The party decided to form a “Panel for Innovation,” but it was struggling to find a suitable figure to lead the committee.“Chairman Moon Jae-in officially proposed (Kim) to accept the chairman post of the reform committee today,” NPAD spokesperson Kim Sung-soo said. “Kim told him that he needs more time to consider the offer. We believe that he will give the answer no later than Sunday,” he said. Kim, 65, was elected as Gyeonggi education superintendent in 2010 and served until 2014. Having worked as a university professor and a labor expert, he advocated a liberal school system and free-meal initiative, defying the former President Lee Myung-bak’s conservative education policy.“I anticipate a positive outcome,” said Rep. Lee Jong-kul, the floor leader of NPAD. “I was told that NPAD chairman Moon Jae-in met Kim last night and shared a common understanding. I think the result will come out by the end of Friday.” The move came two days after Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo rejected the same proposal. The former cochair of the NPAD said that it would be “inappropriate” for him to assume the post even though he shared the need for the panel.The rejection has dealt a blow to NPAD’s efforts to regroup itself after the April by-election defeats and the ensuing factional infighting. The party set up the reform panel last week, but they have failed to find the right person to chair it. Among the likely candidates were Cho Guk, professor at Seoul National University. As a prominent advocate of liberal values, he enjoys popularity among left-wing supporters who often asked him to join politics. He has rejected the offers. “Kim is much better than me in every sense of the word,” Cho wrote on Twitter. “I have respected Kim for being reform-minded and fair-minded. I sincerely hope he will play a significant role in the party.” In an interview with a local TV network on Monday, Cho said he would assume the panel chairmanship under the condition that he agreed to the party’ overhaul plan and received corresponding authority to do his job. But Rep. Lee expressed his objection to Cho on Thursday, saying that a party insider would better serve the chairmanship than an outsider. He asserted that insiders were more knowledgeable about the party’s affairs and could help contribute to the unity.

After graduation, Pyo started as a police inspector investigating criminal cases at local police stations in South Korea. Pyo Chang-won, director of Pyo Institute of Crime Science (Kim Myung-sub/The Korea Herald)However, things were not quite what he had imagined. He was not making noticeable progress in investigations. Other veteran investigators told him, in apparent efforts to cheer him up, that he may have to spend another 20 years to develop his instinct and guts to solve the cases.“I didn’t want to wait for another 20 years,” he said. “Then I thought of Sherlock Holmes, believing that England could show me a different way,” he said, adding that the country developed techniques to solve cases based on a scientific approach for more than 200 years.Pyo then attended University of Exeter and earned both a masters and Ph.D. in police studies. After his extensive research and studies on criminology and investigative methods, he came to realize that it was not the scientific techniques that South Korea lacked, it was the system that ignored a neutral investigation open to all possiblities.“We often jump to conclusions that most of criminal cases involve people who are close to the victim, and start the investigation from there,” he said. “If it turns out that not one on the list was the real culprit, the case ends up as a mystery.”Pyo said his destiny as a criminal profiler started there: to start an investigation by assessing the evidence at a crime scene first, reconstruct the scene, make judgements on what likely happened and to find the truth behind the lies and the mystery left behind by a crime.He became the nation’s first profiler investigating high-profile cases on serial killers and unsolved cases while working as a professor at KNPU to teach criminal psychology and investigations. Pyo began receiving public attention after he appeared on local TV programs such as an in-depth investigative program “The Unanswered” where he interviewed as a profiler to offer his assessment of many unsolved criminal cases.The fluent, outspoken speaker with extensive knowledge of criminal cases and assessment of the mentality of criminals, soon wowed the audience. He also began to write columns on a wide range of fields including politics, culture and labor. Pyo become more and more open to express his criticism and analysis of controversial social issues that persisted through the Korean society, not only through the mass media, but also through social networking. But then in 2012, Pyo criticized the police for being passive in its investigation into the spy agency’s alleged interference in the presidential election.“I was deeply hurt by fellow police officers, calling me an internal enemy and betrayer,” he said. “I could have been stigmatized if I distorted the truth for my own self-interest, but I was not. I believed in the truth,” he said. As his remarks stirred controversy, he voluntarily stepped down as professor at the state-run university that year. Though the resignation was not something “intended,” Pyo said, it led him to embrace more, limitless opportunities. He became more active in writing, publishing more than 10 books including “Enemies of Justices (2014),” “Dignity of Conservatives (2013)” and “I want to live like Sherlock Holmes (2013).” He also appeared on several TV shows including “Sisa Dolgikgu” in which he hosted a number of live debate sessions on sensitive political and social issues raised in South Korea. Currently, he is the founder and the director of Pyo Institute of Crime Science, a civilian research and training lab, dedicated to educate young Koreans aspiring to become criminal profilers. He even got more exposed to the public, appealing with his image of charismatic, clear-headed, and self-made man by making the cover of fashion magazines.In his books, Pyo constantly compares the two groups of criminals ― from the upper class and the working class ― offering a view that not every criminal is treated equally.For instance, he tells the story of Chun Kyung-hwan, younger brother of former militant President Chun Doo-hwan, on how he was able to stay away from prison for years, citing health, despite charges of multiple frauds and tax evasion. Pyo also writes about Chung Won-seop, the owner of a local cartoon book store, who served 15 years in prison after he was forced to make a confession on killing a girl in 1972 although he didn’t. After 39 years, Chung was found innocent by the top court in 2011.“The reason why I make a comparison between the two groups is because this makes me sad,” he said.“Trust is the key to investigations and the jurisdiction process. I want to say that the public won’t be able to trust any law enforcement agencies or even the courts as long as they keep treating people differently in regard to their status in society.”Living as a critic is a difficult, tiring and unpaid task, he said, stressing that he wants to extend his belief in justice through a novel he has been working on.The versatile writer has recently finished his first fiction, a mystery novel written for children aspiring to become profilers like him.

Prime Minister nominee Hwang Kyo-ahn answers reporters’ questions at the Gwacheon Government Complex in Gwacheon, South of Seoul, Thursday. (Yonhap)“Hwang has a deep understanding of the president’s philosophy on state management, and is the right man to build a new Republic of Korea by eradicating corruptive practices and achieving political reform,” said Senior Press Secretary Kim Sung-woo.“Now we need to root out corruption and irregularities that have been tolerated from the past in order to revive the economy and achieve sustainable development.”Shortly after the announcement, Hwang vowed to propel social integration and embrace vulnerable members of society.“I will do my best to uphold the people’s wishes, with an understanding that taking care of the socially weak is also a crucial national task while achieving people’s harmony and social integration,” the nominee said at a press conference.The nomination of a prime minister requires parliamentary endorsement. Hwang is expected to go through a tough confirmation session within two weeks with the opposition party already resisting Park‘s nomination.Born in 1957, Hwang spent more than 30 years serving as a public prosecutor. He has held key posts within the prosecution throughout his career and has served as the justice minister since the Park administration began in early 2013.Though he was approved by the parliament to take the justice minister’s post two years ago, the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy is also expected to take issue with his expertise in public security.“President Park Geun-hye naming minister Hwang is an overt declaration that she would reign over the country with a public security-focused (government),” NPAD senior spokesman Rep. Kim Yung-rok. The opposition lawmaker claimed that Hwang’s past career went against the efforts of democratization by curbing opposition forces, and that he was not fit to be prime minister, a role that must bring the people together and revive the economy.The staunch constitutionalist, who has been advocating a need for early education of the Constitution, is well known for his public security-focused career at the prosecution. While serving as the justice minister, Hwang spearheaded the arrest of former leftist lawmaker Lee Seok-ki and the dissolution of his party for supporting the North Korean regime. He, as justice minister, was also in the position of handling the ongoing prosecution’s investigation into the eight politicians involved in the Sung Won-jong scandal. Hwang is also likely to face questions over allegations that he received preferential treatment in courts and also a large income while working as a senior attorney upon finishing his service as civil prosecutor.Park’s press secretary also said that the president would pick a new justice minister to replace Hwang as soon as he gets the parliamentary approval.“The nomination of justice minister will proceed through the necessary legal and political procedures, and it won’t be delayed,” he said, adding that the procedures would begin only after the P.M. nominee was able to officially take the post.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","thursday nominated justice minister hwang ,her reform drive prime minister ,political funds from deceased businessman ,new justice minister to replace ,month after former prime minister","['Park Geun - hye', 'Justice', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Park ’s', 'Hwang', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'the Gwacheon Government Complex', 'Gwacheon', 'Seoul', 'Yonhap)“Hwang', 'Republic of Korea', 'Kim Sung - woo', 'Hwang', 'Hwang', 'Park', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Park Geun', 'Hwang', 'NPAD', 'Kim Yung - rok', 'Hwang', 'Hwang', 'Lee Seok - ki', 'north korean', 'Hwang', 'Park ’s', 'Hwang', 'P.M.', 'Cho Chung - un']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65112317  0.46038938

Hong Joon-pyo are to be indicted without detention on charges of violating the Political Fund Act, prosecutors said Thursday, a decision that the opposition bloc viewed as “too lenient.” The Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office was set to indict Hong and Lee for illegally receiving political funds, making them the first two political bigwigs to be prosecuted in connection with the high-profile bribery scandal involving President Park Geun-hye’s top aides. The prosecutors, however, reportedly decided not to detain the accused despite circumstantial indications that Lee and Hong allegedly attempted to sway the investigation in their favor by pressuring witnesses not to make statements against them during the questioning. The indictment came 38 days after prosecutors launched the investigation into the allegations that eight senior officials from the Park administration accepted illicit political donations from deceased business tycoon Sung Woan-jong. Lee and Hong flatly denied the accusations during their questionings. “We secured enough credible testimonies and circumstantial evidence to press charges against Lee and Hong by questioning Sung’s aides,” the prosecutors said, adding that their statements were specific and consistent.The main opposition New Political Alliance for Democracy, meanwhile, took a swipe at the prosecution for taking a soft line on the accused.“The prosecution’s decision not to detain them is obviously in favor of the ruling party,” said NPAD floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul, reiterating his calls for a thorough probe into the six other politicians listed on Sung’s memo. The former premier Lee, who stepped down from the post on April 27, is suspected of receiving 30 million won ($27,000) from Sung in April 2013. Sung allegedly offered 100 million won to Gov.

Cho Won-jin of the governing Saenuri Party and Kang Gi-jung of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy also agreed to refrain from issuing “provocative public statements” on the reform, so as to minimize partisan fights until a final deal is reached.But they remained divided on whether to link the reforms to revisions strengthening the national pension, a plan backed by the main opposition. The national pension is a social welfare scheme designed to pay annuities to almost all retired South Korean taxpayers. Reps. Cho Won-jin (left) of the ruling Saenuri Party and Kang Gi-jung of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy discuss civil service pension reforms at the National Assembly on Wednesday. (Yonhap)The agreements are also not binding, leaving room for the parties to ditch the reforms this month, observers said.Cho and Kang agreed to pass the draft bill that would vastly downsize monthly pensions paid out to ex-government officials by May 28, the last day of this parliamentary session.The reforms are backed by the Saenuri Party and President Park Geun-hye. They say the civil service pension is liable for over 524 trillion won ($480 billion) in public debt. They add the pension would cause an extra 10 billion won in debt per day, if left unchanged.The NPAD has opposed the reforms unless they are linked to increases in the national pension’s income replacement rate to 50 percent from its current rate of 40. The replacement rate is a coefficient multiplied to the lifetime average monthly incomes of pensioners.The NPAD has demanded that the number be included in any binding agreement on the civil service pension. The Saenuri Party has opposed such measures, saying any binding number on the national pension should be agreed upon in separate negotiations from the civil service pension.But the chief negotiators expressed confidence they would finalize a deal in the coming weeks, before the May 28 deadline.“We’ve made much progress on the 50 percent issue,” Cho said. “The key issue here is whether we will be able to write a bill that the leaders of each party can approve,” he said.“But we’ve made meaningful progress on that.”Kang repeated Cho, saying, there had been “much progress,” and that Tuesday’s deal would be discussed further at another meeting this Friday.A final deal is likely to include the passage of reforms to the civil service pension and a parliamentary resolution authorizing the creation of a panel to discuss how to strengthen the national pension, observers said.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","meeting this friday final deal ,wednesday to pass reforms ,wednesday to pass reforms before ,to pass reforms before june ,agreed wednesday to pass reforms","['Cho Won - jin', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kang Gi - jung', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'south korean', 'Cho Won - jin', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kang Gi - jung', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'the National Assembly', 'Cho', 'Kang', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun', 'NPAD', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Cho', 'Cho', 'Jeong Hunny']",0,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.27746573  0.26578423

Kim Moo-sung decided to leave, a decision that prompted debate here between those sympathetic to the five-term lawmaker, and those who criticized him for not understanding diplomatic affairs.Indian officials had invited Kim to the meeting with Modi on Tuesday afternoon. But they left him waiting, as Modi was running late due to an earlier meeting with Indian expats here.As the wait grew longer, Indian officials proposed that Kim meet Modi at the sidelines of the premier’s meeting with Indians here, for a brief photoshoot, instead of the prescheduled one-on-one meeting.Kim refused, saying the request went against diplomatic protocol.“It does not fit in with diplomatic protocol that the chief of a country’s ruling party is treated this way,” Kim said.But the Saenuri Party chairman later added that it was understandable for Modi to be on a tight schedule as he was here for “only two days.” Kim also said the Indian embassy’s frontline staff had likely made scheduling mistakes.Modi arrived in Korea on Monday before leaving on Tuesday.Kim’s critics blasted him, saying that Modi, the leader of a nation, outranked Kim, who was a chief of a political party.A South Korean foreign ministry official who spoke on the condition of anonymity added support to critics.“Indian staff likely made scheduling errors. But, the schedule of a visiting president or prime minister changes frequently and often,” the source said.“Even when our president visits other countries the timetable is timed to the minute, but schedules are often changed, so Rep. Kim should take that into account.”But supporters of Kim said the Indian embassy should have not kept Kim waiting. They added that a visiting leader should invest time and effort to show respect for the host nation’s ruling party chief, as such figures are often contenders to be the next president or prime minister.Kim is often considered by local pollsters as a possible 2017 presidential candidate on the Saenuri Party ticket.Indian embassy officials could not be reached for comment despite multiple calls from The Korea Herald.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","modi on tuesday sparked controversy ,botched meeting between south korea ,poor diplomatic protocol after waiting ,on tuesday sparked controversy ,on tuesday sparked controversy here","['South Korea ’s', 'indian', 'Narendra Modi', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'indian', 'Kim', 'indian', 'indian', 'Kim', 'Indians', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim', 'indian', 'Korea', 'Kim', 'Modi', 'Kim', 'south korean', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'indian', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'the Saenuri Party', 'indian', 'the Korea Herald', 'Jeong Hunny']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46806976  0.47627008

Duncan Hunter (R-CA), the section was almost identical to the Hostage Recovery Improvement Act (H.R. 1498) that the lawmaker introduced to the House in late March with support from 11 co-sponsors.It calls for the president to designate ""an existing federal officer to coordinate efforts to secure the release of U.S. citizens who are hostages of hostile groups or state sponsors of terrorism."" The ""Interagency Hostage Recovery Coordinator"" should be named within 60 days after the bill's enactment.While defining the term ""state sponsors of terrorism,"" the bill singled out North Korea as a country that should be considered a terrorism sponsor nation under the legislation, even though Pyongyang is no longer on the State Department's list of states sponsoring terrorism.North Korea was put on the U.S. terrorism sponsor list for the 1987 midair bombing of a Korean Air flight that killed all 115 people aboard. But the U.S. administration of former President George W. Bush removed Pyongyang from the list in 2008 in exchange for progress in denuclearization talks.Calls grew for redesignating Pyongyang as a state terrorism sponsor after the FBI determined the North was responsible for the cyber-attack on Sony Pictures last November, but the State Department was negative about its effectiveness.According to the legislation, the coordinator is tasked with coordinating and directing ""all activities of the federal government ... to ensure efforts to secure the release of all hostages ... are properly resourced and correct lines of authority are established and maintained.""The officer should also establish a task force consisting of appropriate personnel of the federal government with respect to each hostage situation and submit to Congress a quarterly report on each hostage situation and efforts to secure their release, the bill said.

Moon Jae-in seeks to devise “innovation plans” through panel discussions sometime next month, party officials said.  Rep. Moon Jae-in (right), the leader of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, shakes hands with his fellow party member Rep. Chung Sye-kyun at a wedding ceremony for Chung’s son in the National Assembly complex on Sunday. (Yeo Jun-suk/The Korea Herald.)At the panel, party officials will discuss the conflict-laden party’s personnel overhaul, ways to ensure transparency and fairness in the candidate nominations for the general election and other reforms.The officials have not yet decided whether an outsider will lead the panel and how to fairly reflect the voices of all competing party factions in the reform process, NPAD officials explained. “The basic aim of the (innovation committee) will be to defuse tensions among the party’s factions,” NPAD spokesman Kim Sung-soo told reporters. “We agreed that the party must finish forming this panel as soon as possible.” The latest reform efforts came amid a worsening factional crisis in the NPAD.Moon has failed to tackle feuds between the party’s leading faction, the “pro-Rohs,” political proteges of the late former President Roh Moo-hyun, and another crucial group ― the “non-Rohs.” The latter group holds the pro-Rohs liable for recent election losses and dwindling public support. Moon, who served as Roh’s presidential chief of staff, is widely seen as the leader of the pro-Roh faction. He was elected to the party’s top post in February, defeating non-Roh rivals Reps. Park Jie-won and Lee In-young.The non-Rohs want Moon to resign to “take responsibility” for the party’s defeats in the April 29 parliamentary by-elections. Moon has refused, accusing the non-Rohs of initiating a power struggle within the party.The ruling Saenuri Party won three of the four contested regions, including a constituency in Seoul long considered a safe liberal seat. The NPAD won none, even losing to independent candidate Chun Jung-bae in Gwangju, another voting district the party was expected to win.The Saenuri Party’s wins also came in spite of ongoing prosecutorial probes on leading ruling bloc officials accused of graft. The corruption charges were expected to sway public opinion against the NPAD. But the comprehensive defeats sparked blame-trading between the non-Rohs and pro-Rohs.The factions continued their feud online over the weekend.“Even baseball managers take responsibility for defeats,” Park wrote on his Facebook account on Saturday, criticizing Moon’s objection to calls to surrender his chairmanship.“We are getting further and further away from winning the next presidential race,” Park added. “Losing (in elections) leads to division (among the party’s factions), which in turn leads to more losses.”Pro-Roh Rep. Kim Kyung-hyub tweeted his objections to the accusations calling them of being “hegemonic” on Friday.“Hegemony means violently, unilaterally, taking someone else’s things. I find the (non-Rohs’) accusations groundless.”Moon left for the southwestern city of Gwangju later Sunday to prepare for ceremonies commemorating the 35th anniversary of the May-18 Gwangju protests. Citizens there in 1980 clashed with paratroopers backing ex-President Chun Doo-hwan, leaving hundreds dead.Before leaving Seoul, Moon also reportedly reviewed plans proposing to devolve the party leadership’s authority to senior party officials of opposing factions. He also repeated plans to privately visit senior non-Roh lawmakers demanding his resignation.By Jeong Hunny and Yeo Jun-suk(hj257@heraldcorp.com) (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","may 18 gwangju protests citizens ,next presidential race park added ,his facebook account on saturday ,gwangju later sunday to prepare ,main opposition party on sunday","['Korea', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Supreme Council', 'npad', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Moon Jae - in', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Chung Sye - kyun', 'the National Assembly', 'Yeo Jun - suk', 'the Korea', 'NPAD', 'NPAD', 'Kim Sung - soo', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Moon', 'Roh', 'pro - roh', 'Park Jie - won', 'Lee In - young', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Saenuri Party', 'Seoul', 'Chun Jung - bae', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'Moon ’s', 'Roh', 'Kim Kyung - hyub', 'Chun Doo - hwan', 'Seoul', 'Moon', 'Jeong Hunny', 'Yeo']",17,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.2727468   0.5101639

Park Yong-sung, the former head of Doosan Group and ex-chairman of Chung-Ang University in Seoul, is suspected of delivering about 100 million won ($92,000) worth of gifts and cash to Park Bum-hoon, who was then former President Lee Myung-bak’s top aide on education and culture. In return, the former Cheong Wa Dae official had allegedly pressured the Education Ministry to approve controversial projects pursued by the university, officials said.  Former Doosan chief Park Yong-sung speaks to reporters at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office on Friday. (Yonhap)Chung-Ang University was pushing ahead with a project to integrate its two campuses in Seoul and Anseong, Gyeonggi Province, in 2011. The plan was opposed by the Education Ministry as it violated a regulation that bans mergers between campuses more than 20 kilometers apart.But the prosecution believes that the ministry approved the plan later on under pressure from the former secretary. He was arrested last week for abusing his power to grant business favors.The businessman Park was also summoned as a suspect in the case, the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office said. The prosecution said it would decide whether to indict him after questioning.Authorities investigating the case said that Park offered donations and the lease for a shop in Doosan Tower ― a popular shopping center in central Seoul ― to two cultural foundations whose de facto owner was the former secretary. The ex-secretary was also the chairman of CAU before joining Cheong Wa Dae.Park is facing a prosecutorial summons for the second time in a decade. He was sentenced to three years of imprisonment, suspended for five years, on charges of creating a slush fund in 2005. In 2007, he was pardoned by the Roh Moo-hyun administration and returned to his position as chairman of Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction. He also started to serve as the chairman of CAU from 2008. He stepped down from all posts last month after his rough remarks sparked a controversy. The ex-chairman allegedly threatened faculty members who opposed the board’s plans to restructure the school, saying “it is not good manners not to strike someone’s neck when they have asked for it. I will strike in the most bloody and painful way possible,” in an email.The 75-year-old also resigned from the post of honorary president of the Korean Olympic Committee.He was credited for his contribution to the nation’s sports after being named a member of the International Olympic Committee in 2001. Park, the third son of Doosan Group founder Park Doo-byung, was named Doosan Heavy chairman in 2001 and also served as the chairman of Doosan Infracore and Doosan Group.

Lim was apprehended Tuesday evening for taking two children’s clothes off and touching them at a children’s hospital in Seoul. Police are looking into whether Lim committed similar crimes elsewhere.The case raises concerns over the effectiveness of the monitoring system, as authorities failed to prevent the crime despite the sex offender was wearing one and under surveillance.The government introduced the system in 2008 to deter sex criminals from reoffending, despite the controversy that the system might infringe on the convicts’ human rights. Under the system, sex offenders are required to wear an electronic tag for up to 30 years after they are released from prison.If they try to destroy it or move outside a permitted area, probation officers are automatically notified. But the monitoring system appears to be ineffective in preventing repeat offenses, with the number of convicts destroying their electronic tags and committing sexual crimes growing in recent years. According to the Ministry of Justice, the number of sex offenders who reoffended while tagged rose from three in 2010 to 30 in 2013. In March, a 20-something man was captured in Daegu after committing sex crimes on three occasions with his electronic device on. A 30-something sex criminal cut off his anklet and escaped last month, though he was later apprehended in Seoul by the police. An official from Ministry of Justice admitted that it was difficult to monitor tagged offenders round the clock, especially late at night, due to staff shortages. “The Justice Ministry will step up monitoring and instruct those wearing the device to return home before midnight,” the official said.

Lee is the second of eight political heavyweights to be grilled over the burgeoning graft scandal.Before entering the Seoul District Prosecutors’ Office, Lee apologized to Korean citizens “regardless of the reason” for causing concern. But the former premier reiterated his earlier position that he would face the prosecutorial summons to prove his innocence.“There is nothing that can defeat the truth. I will explain myself in detail to the prosecution,” Lee told reporters before entering the prosecution’s office. Former Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo arrives at Seoul District Prosecutors’ Office on Thursday.(Kim Myung-sub/The Korea Herald)Lee's questioning lasted until 1:00 a.m. the next day. As he left the prosecutors’ office, he reiterated that he did not receive any money from Sung. He told reporters that he had “no memory” of a private meeting with Sung, which is when he is suspected to have received illegal political fund.Sung claimed that the former premier received 30 million won ($27,412) in illicit funds while running for a parliamentary seat in 2013. The revelation sparked a nationwide scandal that put the integrity of President Park Geun-hye’s administration in doubt. Despite claiming his innocence, the prosecution was expected to file charges against Lee this week for violating the political fund act. South Gyeongsang Province Gov. Hong Joon-pyo, who was called in for questioning last week will be indicted on the same charges, according to legal sources.Besides Lee and Hong, six political bigwigs including Park’s aides and members of the ruling Saenuri party are suspected to have illegally taken money from Sung, the former head of Keangnam Enterprises.Prosecutors investigating the case are focusing on securing evidence and testimonies that the money was delivered to Lee during a private meeting with Sung at his election campaign office. Lee initially denied the allegations and claimed he was not even close to Sung. But the former premier came under siege after he was found to have had over 200 phone conversations with Sung in one year. He was also accused of lying as he made ambiguous and conflicting testimonies to the National Assembly. In light of Lee’s summons, his ruling party refrained from making public comment. But Rep. Kim Young-woo, the party’s chief spokesman, urged the prosecution to conduct a thorough investigation, saying “it would be the only way to carry out justice, and gain the trust of the people.Party leader Kim Moo-sung simply said he was “heartbroken,” and did not elaborate.The opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy urged the prosecution to get to the bottom of the corruption scandal. They have been stepping up the offensive against Saenuri for raising illegal election funds for the 2012 presidential election, when Park was a candidate for the ruling party.“(The NPAD) would like to point out to the prosecution that the investigation should not stop at Hong and Lee. Sung’s revelation is a suspicion cast on the highest powers,” NPAD spokesman Kim Sung-soo said in a parliamentary briefing. “People of Korea will never condone attempts to cover up such an unprecedented scandal by scapegoating a couple of people.”Although the prosecution is making progress in its probe on Lee and Hong, the question remains on who the authorities may target next. Unlike the two, the investigators have yet to acquire solid proof or testimonies on allegations of the other six, according to sources.The prosecution is expected to investigate a former Saenuri spokesman surnamed Kim, to whom a former Keangnam official Han has claimed to have given 200 million won.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","second of eight political heavyweights ,thursday over allegations he received ,saenuri for raising illegal election ,political funds from deceased businessman ,prosecution on thursday over allegations","['Lee Wan - koo', 'Sung Woan - jong', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'korean', 'Lee', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Thursday.(Kim Myung - sub', ""the Korea herald)lee 's"", 'Sung', 'Sung', 'Park Geun', 'Lee', 'South Gyeongsang Province', 'Hong Joon - pyo', 'Lee', 'Hong', 'Park ’s', 'Saenuri', 'Sung', 'Keangnam Enterprises', 'Lee', 'Sung', 'Lee', 'Sung', 'Sung', 'the National Assembly', 'Kim Young', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'Hong', 'Lee', 'NPAD', 'Kim Sung - soo', 'Lee', 'Hong', 'Saenuri', 'Kim', 'Keangnam', 'Han', 'Yoon Min - sik']",4,[1.         0.         0.         ... 0.16566658 0.33635759 0.14935517]

The highest court confirmed the ruling by lower courts that delivered a not-guilty verdict to Kang Ki-hoon, citing the “lack of credibility” of forensic evidence. Kang, 51, was convicted in 1991 for helping a fellow activist Kim Ki-sul set himself on fire and jump to his death from a university building in Seoul, and ghostwriting Kim’s will in protest against the authoritarian administration of the then-president Roh Tae-woo. Though Kang denied the charges, he was sentenced to three years in jail after the National Forensic Service confirmed that he had written the suicide note. The 1991 ruling came when a rash of protests engulfed the nation, demanding more democracy and the resignation of Roh. In the case that later became known as Korean version of the “Dreyfus Affair,” it is widely thought that the authoritarian government framed Kang to sway the public opinion against the sprawling protest movement. Kang sought a retrial in 2008, a year after the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a special committee established in 2005 to review past security-related cases, concluded that Kang did not write the note and prosecutors framed him. Strong opposition from the prosecution delayed the retrial for years, but the Seoul High Court finally acquitted Kang in February 2014, which was upheld by the Supreme Court on Thursday. The Seoul High Court, however, convicted him of violating the National Security Law, sentencing him to one year in jail and partially depriving him of civil rights including his right to vote for a year. As Kang has already served a jail term, he will not be put behind bars, the court said.

The case sparked controversy after the surveillance footage of Seo assaulting his wife was released through the media. After the assault, she underwent three weeks of medical treatment, officials said. The wife has testified in a trial that she had nearly a prisoner-like marriage for 32 years, creating a public stir. The 59-year-old clergyman claimed that his wife’s testimony was false and that she deliberately exaggerated the accidental case in an attempt to divorce with him.

He then shot himself to death. With an investigation underway into his motive, criticism has mounted over the military's lax regulations on training reservists despite its drive to maximize the personnel amid dwindling active-duty soldiers.The shooting range at the training camp has 20 shooting lines, but a mere six active-duty service personnel were there to control the reservists, with three senior officers staying away from the lines.Over the course of the attack, none of the instructors were able to take proper actions to stop him, according to Army officers.While carrying out the exercise involving loaded guns, the authorities also failed to provide reservists with key protective gear, such as bulletproof jackets.""Instructors are supposed to give bullets to reservists after making sure that their guns are properly fixed to the stand with a safety hook, but it is yet to be confirmed if the instructors failed to check it or if the shooter later removed the hook,"" an Army officer said. He refused to be identified. Though reservists are supposed to receive three rounds first for calibrating their rifle before getting another six for regular shooting, the authorities handed out a magazine with 10 bullets at one time, while allowing the trainees to skip ""the zeroing fire"" process of adjusting their sights. ""No fixed regulations exist on how many instructors are supposed to be there to control shooting drills, and many details on managing the training for reservists are at the discretion of a commander of each unit,"" Yang Wook, a senior researcher at the Korea Defense & Security Forum, pointed out. While serving in the Army, the shooter was classified as an at-risk soldier, such information was not properly informed to the reserve component unit, a system that effectively prevents any preliminary measures.As part of efforts to better manage the troops, the military classifies vulnerable soldiers into three categories -- A, B and C -- factoring in the results of enlistees' psychological consultations and their backgrounds, with A deemed the most vulnerable. Choi was a ""Class B"" soldier as he had difficulties in adjusting to military life.""It is almost impossible to expect tighter discipline among reservists and effectively control them. After all, they are already civilians and the service personnel who manage the training of reservists are thinly stretched,"" said Shin In-kyun, a military expert who runs the Korea Defense Network. ""Authorities need to take this incident as an opportunity to thoroughly review the overall system of managing the reserve forces who have been left in gray areas.""

He is the second of the eight politicians to be grilled by the prosecution over the burgeoning graft scandal. South Gyeongsang Province Gov. Hong Joon-pyo was questioned by investigators for 17 hours last week. Former Prime Minister Lee Wan-kooThe nation’s former second-in-command has been one of the primary targets in the graft scandal touched off by Sung’s posthumous disclosure made via an interview with a local daily shortly before his death.The scandal involves several of President Park Geun-hye’s confidents and members of the ruling Saenuri Party.In the face of political pressure and public resentment, Lee quit his post last month. He has become one of the shortest-reigning premiers in the country’s history.Before stepping down, Lee denied allegations saying that he would take his own life if found guilty. The ex-premier also claimed that he and Sung were not even close.Despite his repeated denial of wrongdoings, the public became skeptical as evidence overturning his claims emerged. Phone records showed that the two had made calls to each other more than 200 times a year. Authorities have been working to verify whether Lee had a private meeting with Sung at his election campaign office in 2013 when he was running for a parliamentary seat, and if the supposed illegal transaction did take place. Last week, they called in Lee’s former driver who told local media that he witnessed the meeting. A volunteer from Lee’s camp was also questioned as a witness, as well as Sung’s former driver and his secretary who are believed to have accompanied Sung on the visit.Investigators have acquired toll gate records of Sung’s car that implies he visited Lee’s office at the cited time, along with testimonies from the businessman’s former aides, according to sources.Prior to calling Lee in for questioning, the prosecution is expected to summon his former aide who allegedly attempted to pressure Lee’s former driver not to give unfavorable testimonies. Meanwhile, Gov. Hong on Tuesday continued to claim his innocence via social media and press conferences. Hong said Monday that the money suspected to be an illegal political fund from Sung was actually raised by his wife, who secretly pooled the special allowance he had received as a floor leader of the ruling party. Hong’s explanation, however, sparked criticism that the money ― once mounting to 300 million won ― was not reported to the authorities, coupled with attacks from the opposition that he embezzled government funds.He refuted by saying he had no knowledge of what he called his wife’s “secret fund” prior to the investigation, and that the talks of embezzlement was “absurd” since the special allowance is essentially part of his salary as a floor leader.On Sung’s claim that he gave him 100 million won to be nominated as a parliamentary candidate, Hong said it was not even enough to be nominated as a candidate for a provincial council. “Someone came up to me (in 2004) and offered 500 million won for a nomination. When I told him ‘they used to give 2 billion,’ the person immediately offered me 2 billion,” he said in a press conference Monday.But the comment induced new criticism from the opposition that the nominations process for the ruling party is tainted with bribes.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","eight politicians before killing himself ,to eight politicians before killing ,eight politicians before killing ,prosecutorial summons on thursday for ,businessman officials said tuesday","['Lee Wan - koo', 'Lee', 'Keangnam Enterprises', 'Sung Woan - jong', 'Lee', 'South Gyeongsang Province', 'Hong Joon - pyo', 'Lee Wan - kooThe', 'Sung ’s', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Sung', 'Lee', 'Sung', 'Lee ’s', 'Lee ’s', 'Sung ’s', 'Sung', 'Sung ’s', 'Lee ’s', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Hong', 'Hong', 'Sung', 'Sung ’s', 'Hong', 'Yoon Min - sik']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.12907407  0.70192671

Reform backers say it is responsible for 524 trillion won of the public debt, measured at more than 1 quadrillion won.“The pension reform leaves me with sighs,” Park said at a Cabinet meeting later in the day, in thinly veiled criticism against the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy’s objection to her proposal.The NPAD agrees the pension is in need of change. But the main opposition party demands that the reforms coincide with reforms increasing annuities from the national pension, a government-funded retirement benefit system for most taxpayers nationwide.The NPAD has vowed to keep an array of bills from final voting, unless the Saenuri Party agrees to its demands.NPAD Rep. Lee Sang-min is the chair of the Legislation and Judiciary Committee, the last parliamentary panel that reviews bills before a plenary vote. Lee holds the right to keep bills from going to a plenary session.The NPAD demanded that the Saenuri Party agree to increase the national pension’s income replacement rate to 50 percent from the current 40. The replacement rate is a coefficient multiplied to a pensioner’s average lifetime monthly income.The Saenuri Party opposes fixing the pension to a specific number.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","complete unfinished homework the legislature ,bills at tuesday plenary session ,other bills at tuesday plenary ,tuesday plenary session in seoul ,unfinished homework the legislature","['the National Assembly', 'Japan', 'Seoul', '“the National Assembly', 'Lee Seok - hyun', 'National Assembly', 'Lee Seok - hyun', 'Japan', 'Shinzo Abe', 'U.S.', 'japanese', 'korean', 'Chinese', '“The National Assembly of the Republic of Korea', 'japanese', 'Abe', 'Imperial Japan ’s', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'korean', 'japanese', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park', 'Cabinet', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy ’s', 'NPAD', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Lee Sang - min', 'the Legislation and Judiciary Committee', 'Lee', 'NPAD', 'the Saenuri Party', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Jeong Hunny']",10,"[ 1.00000000e+00  0.00000000e+00  0.00000000e+00 ... -4.71513778e-01

Some 30 investigators stormed into the head office of the Korea National Oil Corporation, the residence of its ex-president Kang Young-won and the Seoul office of investment bank Merrill Lynch on Tuesday morning to secure evidence related to the probe, according to the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office. The raid came amid allegations that state-run companies wasted a huge amount of public funds in the overseas projects, with some lost to corruption. An employee enters a security gate at the head office of the Korea National Oil Corp. in Ulsan on Tuesday. (Yonhap)KNOC was suspected of acquiring a Canadian oil company Harvest Operations and its major subsidiary North Atlantic Refining Limited in 2009 without properly analyzing their values as part of ex-President Lee’s “energy diplomacy.” KNOC allegedly paid 1.2 trillion won ($1.1 billion) ― a lot more than the market price ― to acquire NARL without any value assessment. The state-controlled company, however, ended up selling it last year at about 34 billion won to tackle mounting company debts. Kang, then-president of KNOC, led the company’s dubious acquisition, allegedly causing a financial loss worth 1 trillion won to KNOC. Merrill Lynch was adviser to KNOC for the acquisition deal at the time.During Lee’s presidency from 2008-2013, the government encouraged Korean companies to take part in overseas projects to secure energy resources needed to boost economic growth, calling it “energy diplomacy.” While KNOC played a key role in pushing for the projects, some 86 companies allegedly took part in the resource drive. But the state audit agency, Board of Audit and Inspection of Korea, estimated in April that state-run companies, including KNOC, suffered losses of 3.4 trillion won by carrying out the projects.The investigation into the waste and corruption in the overseas development projects under the Lee administration appeared to lose steam as all eyes were on the high-profile bribery scandal surrounding late business tycoon Sung Woan-jong and President Park Geun-hye’s close aides who Sung claimed had bribed before his apparent suicide. But it will likely gain pace following the raid, sources said. As part of widening probe, there is also a possibility that the prosecution will call in Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan for questioning. Choi, who headed the Ministry of Knowledge Economy, a precursor to Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, allegedly made the final decisions on KNOC’s Canadian acquisition deals. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","prosecutors raided on tuesday ,prosecutors raided on tuesday state ,high profile bribery scandal surrounding ,administration some 30 investigators stormed ,bribery scandal surrounding late business","['Lee Myung - bak', 'the Korea National Oil Corporation', 'Kang Young - won', 'Seoul', 'Merrill Lynch', 'the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ’ Office', 'the Korea National Oil Corp.', 'Ulsan', 'canadian', 'Harvest Operations', 'North Atlantic Refining Limited', 'Lee', 'KNOC', 'NARL', 'Kang', 'KNOC', 'KNOC', 'Merrill Lynch', 'KNOC', 'korean', 'KNOC', 'Board of Audit and Inspection of Korea', 'KNOC', 'Lee', 'Sung Woan - jong', 'Park Geun', 'Sung', 'Finance', 'Choi Kyung - hwan', 'Choi', 'the Ministry of Knowledge Economy', 'Ministry of Trade , Industry and Energy', 'KNOC ’s', 'canadian']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.10664649  0.25526071

The banker, who had been in charge of accounts and mostly worked as a teller before taking leave, was asked to be an usher instead when she returned. Her own desk was gone, and as an usher she had to stand the whole time. When she confronted her boss after waiting for a month, he told her: “I don’t consider you as my employee. If you feel this is unfair, you should talk to Cheong Wa Dae.”The worker soon descended into depression, and was eventually hospitalized. She was fired as she did not return to work ― the victim claimed she was still too sick to work ― even after her sick leave allowance had run out. The court ruled her employer pay 20 million won ($18,272) in compensation for her emotional and career damage.Workplace bullying in South Korea is quite serious, and women workers are especially vulnerable due to poor work-life balance as well as the glass ceiling, according to a study by the Korean Women’s Development Institute. About 62.3 percent of all Korean workers have been bullied at least once at the workplace as of 2008, while 45 percent said they have witnessed workplace bullying as of 2012.Among the witnesses, 61.3 percent said the bullying they had seen was “very serious.” Also, 58.3 percent said they have had a coworker who left work after being bullied by their bosses or colleagues. Experts said female workers, especially those in contract positions, were more vulnerable to workplace bullying and sexual harassment than their male counterparts. Among the 360,000 who joined the temporary workforce over the past decade, 89 percent were women. According to the Korea Labor and Society Institute, female temporary workers earned only 36 percent of full-time male workers’ average salary last year. Last year, a female contract worker at an amusement park in Seoul filed a complaint to the human rights authorities at the city government, claiming she and her female colleagues were bullied by those in full-time managerial positions. The workers were all in temporary positions and were hoping to get full-time positions by the end of their contract. Their managers often threatened them by saying “not everyone can become full-time workers and you never know what would happen to you” whenever the women did not obey their requests.The managers also reportedly forced them to attend drinking sessions, where they were often sexually harassed while asked to pour drinks for their superiors. The bullies were mostly men, but a female manager also reportedly sexually harassed contract female workers. After organizing an independent investigation, the Seoul Metropolitan Government concluded that the worker’s claims were true. The managers eventually faced disciplinary action.“There is still little public awareness on what workplace bullying is and why it is a violation of human rights,” said researcher Koo Mi-young at the Korean Women’s Development Institute. “And since women are more vulnerable to this particular type of abuse, there should be more gender-based discussion about workplace bullying, sexual harassment, as well as discrimination.”Overseas studies have long shown that workplace bullying can lead to a number of health issues, including post-traumatic stress disorder and even suicide. Also, coworkers who witness workplace bullying can also have negative effects, such as severe stress, fear and emotional exhaustion, according to a study by the National Communication Association in the U.S. A bill to deal with workplace bullying was proposed in 2013 in Korea, but is currently pending in the National Assembly.

Jung Cheong-rae and Joo Seung-yong of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy gave no reason for their absence. They had exchanged heated words last Friday, continuing to trade blame over the party’s defeats in the April parliamentary by-elections.NPAD chair Rep. Moon Jae-in apologized for the incident.“Last Friday’s brawl was an embarrassment. How can we criticize the Park Geun-hye administration if we fail to show unity, and fail to gain the trust of our citizens?” Rep. Moon Jae-in (center), chair of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, speaks at the party’s morning meeting, Monday. (Yonhap)Analysts said the Jung-Joo altercation represents a fight between the NPAD’s two main factions, as Jung and Joo are senior members of the pro-Rohs and the non-Rohs, respectively.How the feud ends will affect which faction comes out with more clout in the party. How fast the feud ends will affect the NPAD’s public approval ratings, and its ability to compete with the ruling Saenuri Party on policy issues, such as the public service pension reforms, observers said.The clash began after Joo repeated his desire to resign from the party’s Supreme Council last week. Joo had urged other council members to resign, especially Moon, the leader of the pro-Rohs, in order to “take responsibility” for the party’s losses in all four of the April 29 by-elections.Analysts had expected the NPAD to win in the by-elections, due to ongoing prosecutorial investigations into leading ruling bloc figures accused of taking bribes. But Jung called Joo’s criticism “blackmail” that threatened to destroy the party’s unity amid falling approval ratings and the electoral defeats.Joo marched out of the meeting room after the brawl and has since been at his home in Yeosu, South Jeolla Province. On Monday, Joo turned away Jung who had traveled to Yeosu to meet Joo, refusing to meet him.“I will not retrieve my resignation letter,” Joo said after his refusal to meet Jung.Moon and most of the pro-Roh group have faced heavy criticism for the April 29 electoral defeat. Joo and the non-Rohs accused them of pursuing “divisive” and “factionalist” party politics, by dominating the party’s key posts, and excluding other factions.“Joo’s comments last week represented the brewing dissatisfaction of the pro-Roh led party leadership,” said Choi Young-jin, professor of Korean politics at Chung-Ang University.The pro-Rohs is a group of NPAD lawmakers who began their political careers during the Roh Moo-hyun administration. The faction is the NPAD’s dominant group. Moon is the faction’s de facto leader.Joo is a senior member of the non-Rohs, a coalition of NPAD lawmakers who oppose the pro-Rohs. Most trace their political roots to those who began their careers under ex-President Kim Dae-jung and other South Korean liberals based in the Jeolla region. The feud between the party’s leading groups has contributed to the party’s falling ratings, one analyst said.“There are many voters who are against the Park Geun-hye administration and the governing Saenuri Party,” said Chung Jin-min, professor of politics at Myongji University in Seoul.“But that doesn’t mean they will start supporting the NPAD if the main opposition fails to offer policy alternatives to voters,” he added.The ongoing in-house feud is impeding efforts within the NPAD to design policies that can compete with those of Park and the Saenuri Party, experts said.“Having factions and ensuing feuds within a large party is natural,” Chung said. The NPAD is South Korea’s No. 2 party with 130 of the country’s 298 lawmakers under its banner. The Saenuri Party has 160 legislators.“But Korean politics is too figure-based. The factionalist infighting between the pro-Rohs, largely supporters of Moon, and the non-Rohs, largely those against him, is causing an unproductive chain of events that prevents the NPAD from coming up with policy alternatives to the ruling bloc,” Chung added.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","incident last friday brawl ,the incident last friday brawl ,last month election whitewash reps ,friday brawl was an embarrassment ,monday following verbal fight last","['Jung Cheong - rae', 'Joo Seung - yong', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Moon Jae - in', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Jung - Joo', 'Joo', 'Saenuri Party', 'Joo', 'Supreme Council', 'Joo', 'Moon', 'Jung', 'Joo', 'Yeosu', 'South Jeolla Province', 'Joo', 'Jung', 'Yeosu', 'Joo', 'Joo', 'Jung', 'Joo', 'Choi Young - jin', 'korean', 'Chung - Ang University', 'NPAD', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Moon', 'Joo', 'NPAD', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'south korean', 'Jeolla', 'Saenuri Party', 'Chung Jin - min', 'Myongji University', 'Seoul', 'NPAD', 'Park', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Chung', 'NPAD', 'South Korea ’s', 'the Saenuri Party', 'korean', 'Moon', 'Chung', 'Jeong Hunny']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.69518924  0.18528377

Hong Joon-pyo repeated his denial of corruption allegations Monday, claiming that the illicit money in question was not a bribe but his wife’s secret funds.Hong, currently being investigated by the prosecution for allegedly receiving 100 million won ($92,000) from deceased businessman Sung Woan-jong, claimed that the money came from a secret fund stashed away by his wife without his knowledge. The money is suspected to have been used during the 2011 primaries of Hong’s ruling Saenuri Party.Suspicions grew when the prosecution said Hong failed to explain the source of 120 million won in election funds. It also said Sunday that Hong and Sung’s aide surnamed Yoon ― who supposedly delivered the money ― had met in June 2011, contrary to what the governor had been claiming all along.Through a Facebook posting and a press conference, Hong said the 120 million won came from his wife’s secret fund, one that amounted to 300 million won at one point, which she kept hidden from him. He said his wife stashed away some of his earnings as a lawyer and the special allowance given to floor leaders of each party.“As a ruling party floor leader, I would get 40 million won to 50 million won each month. I gave the leftover funds to my wife, who kept them in a bank safety deposit box,” Hong said. He claimed that at the time, he had no knowledge about where the money came from and learned about the source only after the prosecution started an investigation into the graft scandal.“I believe that the prosecution is pressuring me by revealing the evidence to the public,” he said, adding he was willing to comply with investigations of the fund.The governor also denied the special investigative team’s accusations that he, his staff and Yoon had met at a building in the National Assembly in June, although authorities claimed they have acquired enough evidence.But the prosecutors said Hong’s claims were not convincing. They are expected to file charges against him for violation of the political fund act. The special investigative team is also conducting an investigation into an allegation that Hong’s aides attempted to contact witnesses related to the graft scandal in hopes of pressuring them not to give unfavorable testimonies against him.The prosecutors summoned Hong’s former aide ― a local university head surnamed Eom ― who is accused of asking Yoon to change his testimonies about the supposed illegal transaction between himself and Hong.Hong’s explanation about the money also raised eyebrows of the opposition, who argued that Hong should be arrested right away.“It appears more and more clear that (Hong) attempted perjury on top of trying to destroy evidence. If he had been a member of the opposition or an ordinary citizen, he would have been arrested 10 times over,” said Rep. Jun Byung-hun of the main opposition New Political Alliance for Democracy. Similarly, Rep. Lim Nae-hyun of the NPAD said if he had indeed given the operating expenses to his wife at his discretion, it should be considered embezzlement. He also held Hong responsible for not reporting 300 million won in assets to the authorities.Hong is one of eight politicians whom Sung pinpointed as receiving illicit political funds before committing suicide last month. The revelation sparked a graft scandal, in the wake of which former Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo resigned.The prosecution is now likely to summon Lee this week to question him over allegations that he received illegal funds from Sung while running in the 2013 by-elections.

He was working at the Justice Ministry’s immigration office in southern Seoul. The prosecution launched the probe after the immigration office found out Kim’s wrongdoings during an internal inspection, officials said. During the prosecutorial probe, Kim reportedly contradicted himself. He initially said he falsified visa documents for the foreigners, but later went back on his words, saying that false information was “mistakenly” written on the documents. He is also reported to have denied accepting any bribes.Investigators also booked a 32-year-old female broker who had allegedly introduced Kim to foreigners seeking visa extensions. The broker, whose name was withheld from the media, purportedly retained a commission and handed over the remaining money she took from expats to Kim, they added. The prosecution has secured the evidence of money transfers between Kim and the broker, sources said. Meanwhile, the ministry discussed ways to toughen the punishments for those who falsify visa documents.Foreigners who provide false information for the stay permit will be sentenced to three years in jail or fined up to 20 million won along with deportation. Calls for a stronger penalty have mounted, as the maximum fine for falsely filling out the stay permit form was limited to just 500,000 won.By Lee Hyun-jeong  (rene@heraldcorp.com)","bribes investigators also booked 32 ,an arrest warrant against seoul ,visa extensions officials said monday ,arrest warrant against seoul ,arrest warrant against seoul based","['Seoul', 'the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Kim', 'the Justice Ministry ’s', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23288414  0.69227403

The Seoul Southern District Prosecutors' Office said they have filed for a court warrant to detain the 42-year-old mid-level worker at the southern Seoul unit of the Korean Immigration Service on charges of official document forgery and bribery.The immigration service is under the wing of the Ministry of Justice and it is the first time a member of the ministry is charged with illegal visa transactions.According to the prosecutors, the government employee, surnamed Kim, illegally renewed visas on 27 occasions in favor of some 20 Chinese and other nationals during the two-year period since early2013 in return for financial rewards worth 11 million won ($10,100). Kim's offences were first uncovered in an internal inspection of the southern Seoul immigration office and were later transfered to the prosecution.  Prosecutors have also booked a 32-year-old female administrative agent for brokering the visa-for-money transactions between Kim and foreigners. Kim has denied the bribery charges while claiming some of the irregular visa issuances were made by mistake, according to the prosecutors.

But the partisan standoff over the pension reform bill is likely to be a stumbling block as the rival parties continued to wrangle over the conditions to be attached to the bill.Saenuri floor leader Rep. Yoo Seung-min on Sunday said he would “respect” an agreement made by party leaders on the bill. But he didn’t elaborate on whether the ruling party would accept the opposition’s demand.Last week, parties failed to pass the bill as the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy demanded that the revision explicitly state that the income-replacement rate of the national pension would be raised to 50 percent, from the current 40 percent. The income-replacement rate is the figure multiplied to a pensioner’s average lifetime monthly income.The ruling Saenuri Party rejected the demand in the face of fierce criticism from Cheong Wa Dae, making a U-turn from its agreement with the opposition party to affiliate the issue of raising the payout rates to the bill. Saenuri Party Floor Leader Yoo Seung-min (left) shakes hands with Lee Jong-kul, newly-elected counterpart of New Politics Alliance for Democracy at the National Assembly, Seoul, Sunday. (Yonhap)Cheong Wa Dae pressured both parties on Sunday to pass the bill during the extra session, and urged them not to mention any changes to the national pension system in the bill. Senior press secretary Kim Sung-woo explained that the increase of the income replacement rate to 50 percent would require an infusion of 1,702 trillion won in taxpayers’ money over the next 65 years.“An increase of even one percentage point (in the income replacement rate) may pass a disastrous burden on to future generations,” said Kim at a press briefing.“It is not appropriate to link the national pension to the civil servant pension because such changes require prior agreement from the citizens,” he said.NPAD’s newly-elected floor leader Lee Jong-kul, however, refused to step back and held the ruling party accountable for failing to pass the pension reform bill. “We should honor our agreement on the pension reform bill. If not, those involved need to be held accountable” said Lee in his first official meeting with Rep. Yoo.On May 2, leaders of rival parties ― Kim Moo-sung of Saenuri and Moon Jae-in of NPAD ― agreed to raise the contribution rate of public service pensions from 7 percent to 9 percent in the next five years, while reducing entitlements from 1.9 percent to 1.7 percent in stages over 20 years. Because of this agreement, the bill on civil servants’ pension reform was widely expected to be passed at the plenary session last week. But another, unexpected condition attached to the agreement involving a change in national pension system instantly sparked concerns from the government. Top officials, including Welfare Minister Moon Hyung-pyo, blasted the parties for acting outside their authorities and said it was a matter that required public approval to even begin discussions. Other than the pension bill, lawmakers from rival parties are facing demands to pass the tax-code revision bill. It is aimed at allowing taxpayers to receive deserved tax refund by the end of this month. The bill, designed to alleviate the undue tax burden, needs to get parliamentary endorsement by Monday to allow the government to implement the plan as it promised the people.“It is regrettable that the bill failed to pass the National Assembly in April. We might not deliver on our promise to the taxpayers unless the Assembly passes the bill no later than May 11,” said Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan. Next in line is a bill for free child care program. It aims to fund an education subsidy, called Nuri Curriculum, a government-sponsored free child care program for children aged 3 to 5. The bill has been awaiting approval since last year.Other economic-related bills, such as legalizing crowdfunding and allowing corporates to engage in subcontracting, are expected to be discussed at the plenary session. Those pending bills, however, are likely to face partisan bickering as rival parties have debated the details of the bills. Lawmakers will also discuss whether to legalize putting graphic images of tobacco’s side effects on cigarette packs. The Assembly’s Legislation and Judiciary Committee approved the bill on May 1 to mandate tobacco companies put images to highlight the dangers of smoking.

Hong Joon-pyo met a former aide of deceased businessman Sung Woan-jong that counters the politician’s denial that the meeting took place.Sung’s aide, surnamed Yoon, has claimed to have delivered illicit money from the businessman to Hong in 2011 when he was running for chairmanship of the Grand National Party, the precursor to the ruling Saenuri Party.An official at the special investigative team told reporters that Hong was confirmed to have met with Hong at the time of the supposed transaction.Hong is among eight politicians whom Sung claimed to have given illegal political funds to before his death last month. On Friday, he became the first of the eight to be questioned by the prosecution, after Yoon said he delivered 100 million won ($92,000) to Hong’s secretarial staff in June 2011.While Hong repeatedly denied the charges and insisted that he never met Yoon prior to November 2011, investigators said they acquired evidence verifying Yoon’s testimony to be accurate. “We’ve acquired all the solid proof (on whereabouts of Hong), so we don’t think there is any doubt about it,” the prosecution’s special investigative team on the case said.Contrary to Hong’s claims, Yoon told investigators that he met Hong and his staff at a building in the National Assembly in June. Prosecutors reportedly procured a photo of Hong’s party in the building at the said time. The investigators were to summon Hong’s former aide -- who worked as his secretary during a 2011 primary election of his party -- later in the day to verify the governor’s testimonies. The prosecution suspects Hong’s staff received the money while he was running for the leadership of the Grand National Party. They are strongly considering filing charges against him for violation of the political fund act. As part of an ongoing probe into a burgeoning graft scandal, the investigation is now expected to zero-in on former Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo, another of the eight who supposedly received money from Sung. According to sources, the prosecution is likely to summon Lee this week to question him over allegations that he received illicit political funds in 2013.Besides Hong and Lee, the so-called “Sung Woan-jong List” also includes three of President Park Geun-hye’s former and current chiefs of staffs, two mayors and a lawmaker of the ruling Saenuri Party. It sparked a graft scandal that saw the resignation of the prime minister -- who held office for just two months -- and the plummeting approval ratings for Park, coupled with attacks from the opposition on the administration’s integrity. On Saturday, the special investigative team grilled Sung’s aides including his driver and his secretary, who accompanied the chief of former Keangnam Enterprises when he is believed to have visited Lee’s campaign office in 2013. They also summoned a volunteer at the office who claimed to have witnessed Sung at the site.Sung claimed he handed Lee the money during the visit, according to an interview he gave a local newspaper just before his death.Lee has denied the allegations that he had a private one-on-one meeting with Sung, but his former driver told local media that he witnessed the two having such a meeting. The investigators questioned the driver -- identified by his surname Yun -- on Wednesday. The focal point of the investigation on Lee is when and how the money was handed over to the former premier -- if such a transaction had taken place at all. Initial investigation implied that the supposed transaction occurred on April 4, 2013, when the cited volunteer testified to having seen Sung at the campaign office. But further investigations dug up another potential date of April 7, when Sung visited a region in South Chungcheong Province near where Lee was conducting his election campaign. The prosecution is also probing the suspicion that Lee’s former aide -- surnamed Kim -- had called Yun and the volunteer to persuade them not to testify.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","june prosecutors reportedly procured photo ,secretary during 2011 primary election ,former driver told local media ,june prosecutors reportedly procured ,his election campaign the prosecution","['South Gyeongsang Province', 'Hong Joon - pyo', 'Sung Woan - jong', 'Sung ’s', 'Yoon', 'Hong', 'the Grand National Party', 'Saenuri Party', 'Hong', 'Hong', 'Hong', 'Sung', 'Yoon', 'Hong', 'Hong', 'Hong', 'Yoon', 'Hong', 'the National Assembly', 'Hong ’s', 'Hong', 'the Grand National Party', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Sung', 'Lee', 'Hong', 'Lee', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park', 'Sung ’s', 'Keangnam Enterprises', 'Lee', 'Sung', 'Sung', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Sung', 'Lee', 'Sung', 'Sung', 'South Chungcheong Province', 'Lee', 'Kim', 'Yun', 'Yoon Min - sik']",13,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.60158026  0.21954715

Hong Joon-pyo was questioned Friday by the prosecution in Seoul over his alleged involvement in a high-profile graft scandal, becoming the first to be questioned among eight political heavyweights mired in the case.The bribery allegations have dealt a serious blow to Hong’s reputation as a “corruption buster” that he built while working as a state prosecutor in the 1980s and 1990s. “I feel sorry for having caused public concern. I am here to offer my explanation (concerning the allegations against me),” Hong told reporters as he appeared at the Seoul High Prosecutors’ Office in southern Seoul. Hong is alleged to have taken 100 million won ($93,000) from late former Keangnam Enterprises chairman Sung Woan-jong in 2011. Sung, who was found after an apparent suicide last month, left a bribery list that included Hong and President Park Geun-hye’s top aides, such as her chief of staff Lee Byung-kee. South Gyeongsang Province Gov. Hong Joon-pyo speaks to the press before entering the Seoul High Prosecutors’ Office for questioning over his alleged involvement in a graft scandal Friday. (Yonhap)Investigators are considering filing a charge against Hong of violating the political fund act. Hong denied the charge.The prosecution suspects Sung handed illicit money in a shopping bag to Hong’s secretarial staff via a former executive of the construction firm in June 2011 when Hong was running in the leadership contest of the Grand National Party, the precursor to the ruling Saenuri Party. Investigators are examining whether Hong was aware of the money transfer to his secretary and whether Sung ever contacted Hong to talk about the provision of the illicit money.The prosecution is also investigating the allegation that Hong’s aides tried to pressure the former executive of Keangnam Enterprise, who allegedly delivered the money to Hong’s aides, into not making unfavorable statements about Hong during a prosecutorial interrogation.Hong also denied this allegation. The ex-Keangnam official, identified by his surname Yoon, has already been questioned by the prosecution four times. Investigators said they have secured “circumstantial evidence” to back the allegation that Sung handed the illegal cash to Hong’s aides.A prosecution official said the investigation into Hong’s allegations proceeded “smoothly.”“The probe proceeded smoothly as Hong brought a considerable amount of materials to refute the allegations against him,” the official said, declining to be identified.Political circles have carefully watched the graft investigation into Hong and seven other politicians, as the probe is expected to have a considerable impact over the political landscape, particularly ahead of the general parliamentary elections slated for April 2016.Hong’s fall from grace is also expected to affect the ruling party’s lineup of presidential hopefuls. Hong, the former chairman of the ruling party, has long been cited as one of the party’s potential contenders for the 2017 presidential election.Amid the ruling party’s struggle to minimize the fallout from the graft scandal, the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy has stepped up its offensive against its rival party, arguing that a thorough probe into President Park’s aides, embroiled in the scandal, should be conducted.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","graft scandal friday yonhap investigators ,bribery allegations have dealt serious ,suicide last month left bribery ,aides embroiled in the scandal ,prosecution in seoul over his","['South Gyeongsang Province', 'Hong Joon - pyo', 'Seoul', 'Hong', 'Seoul', 'Hong', 'Keangnam Enterprises', 'Sung Woan - jong', 'Sung', 'Hong', 'Park Geun - hye ’s', 'Lee Byung - kee', 'South Gyeongsang Province', 'Hong Joon', 'Sung', 'Hong ’s', 'Hong', 'the Grand National Party', 'Saenuri Party', 'Hong', 'Sung', 'Hong', 'Hong ’s', 'Keangnam Enterprise', 'Hong', 'Sung', 'Hong', 'Hong', 'Hong', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Song Sang - ho']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.30795488  0.06931335

Lee Jong-kul. (Yonhap)The veteran politician faces numerous challenges during his one-year term, observers said.The imminent task for Lee is to stamp out growing factionalism in the wake of crushing defeats to the Saenuri Party in parliamentary by-elections late last month. The NPAD lost in all four of the contested districts, sparking a blame game among the party’s multiple factions.Lee will also undertake the daunting task of leading negotiations with the Saenuri Party over proposed public service pension reforms, which is generating significant public attention and criticism.The proposed amendments to the civil service pension aims to cut the pension’s growing deficit, which must be shouldered by government coffers. Supporters of the reforms assert that the civil service pension is the source of more than 523 trillion won ($480 billion) in public debt.The main parties had agreed to approve the reform bill at a plenary session Wednesday, but last-minute fissures within each party and President Park Geun-hye’s objection to details of the draft bill derailed efforts to reach an agreement late that day. Lee will have a voice in picking candidates to run in next year’s parliamentary elections. The polls will decide if the main opposition party can dismantle the governing party’s parliamentary majority.Lee represents a district in Anyang, Gyeonggi Province, a city of 600,000 south of Seoul.

Therefore, we could not find any particular reason to withdraw or change our decision,” said an SMOE official. The Seoul office will seek Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea’s consent tomorrow, he added.Under Korean law, the minister of education must either consent or decline the request for designation or cancellation of a special purpose school within 50 days of receiving the said request.Last month, the SMOE announced that two special purpose schools ― Seoul Foreign Language High School and Younghoon International Middle School ― failed to meet the requirements necessary for redesignation as de facto elite schools.Younghoon, however, will not be facing the ax, as it was granted a two-year grace period to comply with SOME’s measures. The school presented specific plans for improvements, SMOE officials said, and will be reevaluated after two years to see if it has followed the plans. Initial expectations in the education circles was that Younghoon may be stripped of its status due to its recent admission fraud in 2013. According to Korean law, any school that is involved in admission fraud can be revoked of their privileges as an elite school regardless of the evaluation results.But an SMOE official pointed out that the clause mandating the automatic status downgrade was added in February 2014.

According to government data, Seoul’s ODA increased by 5.4 percent last year to total $1.85 billion. The growth rate was the highest among the member nations of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development.Despite Seoul’s growing ODA contribution, it has yet to implement a systematic program to carry out its ODA projects ― a reason why it has inefficiently distributed ODA to multiple international organizations in small amounts instead of strategically supporting specific countries, the auditors noted.“The concerned ministry had the fund managed by several divisions in charge of international organizations, without rules or guidelines on an ODA strategy or plan,” the BAI statement reads, urging the Foreign Ministry to establish clear guidelines for the ODA implementation. During the inspection, the BAI also found the Foreign Ministry ignored a related law when using the ODA funds. In May 2013, the Foreign Ministry pledged to offer $10 million to the World Bank without necessary consultations with the Ministry of Strategy and Finance, which is in charge of overseas financial contributions.The auditors also said the Foreign Ministry spent $500,000 to launch the South Korea-Mekong cooperation fund in 2013 without complying with proper accounting protocols. Other irregularities, which were found during the inspection, included the ministry’s failure to check overseas missions’ irregular accounting. The auditors also found that 13 professors at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy under the Foreign Ministry earned nearly 300 million won ($275,500) combined at other schools between January 2011 and October 2014 without the needed approval from the foreign minister.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","the state auditors on thursday ,13 professors at the korea ,thursday called on seoul ,thursday called on seoul foreign ,on thursday called on seoul","['Seoul ’s Foreign Ministry', 'the Board of Audit and Inspection', 'Seoul', 'the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development', 'Seoul', 'ODA', 'ODA', 'ODA', 'BAI', 'the Foreign Ministry', 'ODA', 'BAI', 'the Foreign Ministry', 'ODA', 'the Foreign Ministry', 'the World Bank', 'the Ministry of Strategy', 'Finance', 'Foreign Ministry', 'South Korea', 'Mekong', 'the Korea National Diplomatic Academy', 'Foreign Ministry', 'Song Sang - ho']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.75595224  0.66166079

He was detained by South Korean authorities in 1990 for gambling in Macau. With the chairman's arrest, Dongkuk Steel has reportedly entered into ""emergency"" management mode with Vice Chairman Chang Sae-wook expected to take over the leadership tentatively in making major business decisions. Chang, a younger brother of the chairman, had led Union Steel Co., an affiliate of Dongkuk Steel, until he was promoted to the vice chairman post in January when it merged with the steelmaking giant.Observers said that the leadership vacancy might not result in serious business disruption, considering the younger brother's management experience. Some still raised worries that Dongkuk Steel might face a bumpy road in corporate restructuring, which has been spearheaded by the chairman. Also, his arrest could hurt its credit ratings and eventually make it tougher to secure money needed to operate the company.Since 2012, Dongkuk Steel has suffered setbacks in its business, hit by an industry-wide slump. In June last year, the steelmaker agreed with its main creditor, Korea Development Bank, to enhance its financial health and launched a large-scale corporate restructuring drive that included an asset sale.Last month, Dongkuk Steel's board of directors approved a deal to sell its headquarters building located in downtown Seoul to Samsung Life Insurance Co. for about 420 billion won ($389 million).

(Yonhap)The governing party unilaterally approved the appointment of a controversial Supreme Court Justice nominee on Wednesday using its majority, ending a weekslong partisan fight over the nomination.The National Assembly voted 151 to 6 in favor of the appointment of Park Sang-ok to the Supreme Court. One vote was counted as invalid. The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, numbering 130, boycotted the vote in protest.Persisting disagreements on public service pension reforms between the main parties held off a plenary voting on related amendments and scores of other economy-related bills.The nomination of Park has been pending in the Assembly since January due to the opposition’s objection. The NPAD says the ex-prosecutor actively participated in the alleged cover-up of the torture death of Park Jong-chul, a student protester under police custody, in January 1987.Park denied the accusations, saying he had been a junior prosecutor following orders from higher-ups.Many of the NPAD’s lawmakers have ties to the deceased Park, as they were also student protesters during the 1980s.“In the cold winter of 1987, a college student was found dead, naked, tortured,” NPAD Rep. Park Wan-ju,” said. “Official investigations later found that he had been killed by five police officers through torture,” the former activist added, before walking out of the main parliamentary hall before voting. NPAD lawmakers stage a sit-in protest against the Saenuri Party's nomination of Park Sang-ok after the appointment was approved late Wednesday. (Yonhap)Assembly Speaker Rep. Chung Ui-hwa put the nomination up to a vote urging the opposition to express its objection through the “legislative process.”“The opposition is free to vote against Park’s nomination,” Chung had said Monday. “If you are against his appointment, convince the (Saenuri Party) to vote against him,” he added.Last-minute disagreements on public service pension reforms between the rival parties also delayed Wednesday’s plenary meeting, holding off voting on dozens of economy-related bills.The impasse left dozens of bills awaiting plenary approval. They included a draft law aiming to legalize crowdfunding, another legalizing images of tobacco’s side-effects on cigarette packs, and a bill allowing large corporations to engage in subcontracting, among others.The NPAD demanded that the revised texts of the public service pension bill should specifically state that the income-replacement rate of the national pension would be raised to 50 percent, from the current 40 percent.The income-replacement rate is the figure multiplied to a pensioner’s average lifetime monthly income. The governing Saenuri Party’s Rep. Yoo Seong-min agreed to put the wording in the bill’s addenda. Yoo’s agreement came after initial refusals, stating any specific statistic should be finalized during later talks among lawmakers and pension experts.Yoo’s agreement though will depend on the Saenuri Party’s Supreme Council’s final approval. The Supreme Council consists of the party’s most senior incumbent lawmakers.Over the weekend, the rival parties agreed on a set of reform measures for the civil servants’ pension to raise the contribution rate of public service pensions from 7 percent to 9 percent in the next five years, while reducing entitlements from 1.9 percent to 1.7 percent in stages over 20 years. The two sides also agreed to raise the income-replacement rate of the national pension, but faced opposition from Cheong Wa Dae due to the fear of increased burden on taxpayers.“I don’t want to talk much right now,” Saenuri Party Rep. Kim Moo-sung said as he came out from a closed-door meeting among Saenuri lawmakers earlier in the day.“But it’s been weeks and months since we started talks on the public service pension reforms,” Kim added in apparent frustration. “And (party leaders) signed an agreement (last Saturday). Annulling this agreement is nonsense.

Moon Jae-in’s leadership is being put to the test with mounting pressure to reorient the opposition’s political alignment and policy disposition following last week’s electoral defeat.The beleaguered leader’s approval rating has been declining. Realmeter survey said Wednesday that his ratings stand at 24.8 percent, down by 1.9 percentage points from last week, while his rival, Rep. Kim-Moo sung, enjoyed 19.2 percent, 5.7 percentage points higher. On Wednesday last week, his party lost four parliamentary seats in by-elections, three to the Saenuri Party and one to party defector Chun-Jung-bae. They include two seats in Gwangju and Gwanak District, Seoul, which are considered to be NPAD’s stronghold. Moon Jae-inBut despite the crushing defeats, Moon is expected to lead the party until 2016 general elections as his party struggles to search for a heavyweight to challenge Moon as the 2017 presidential candidate. At the postelection press conference, he said he felt “grave responsibility,” and vowed to rebuild his party “from the very beginning,” implying that he would retain the chairmanship.His commitment, however, did not resonate with his fellow party members. Rep. Joo Seung-yong, third-time lawmaker of NPAD, challenged his leadership, saying “(Moon) needs to articulate how he is going to hold responsibility for the election results.”Now he is tasked with bringing together party members, particularly loyalists to late President Kim Dae-Jung and late President Roh Moo-hyun, while embracing newcomers such as Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, former rival to Moon at the party’s primaries for 2012 presidential election. Until now, he has focused on applying what he considers to be “fairness” to his party. Instead of nominating heavyweight politicians to gain an easy victory, he decided to provide every candidate with an equal opportunity to contest elections.His move, however, was fiercely opposed by NPAD bigwigs such as Rep. Chun Jung-bae. He criticized Moon, who served as a former chief of staff during the late Roh administration, saying it was yet another attempt to reinforce the pro-Roh faction. He left the party afterward and won the election. As party members urge Moon to bring the party back on track and steer it toward victory in the general elections, experts believe that the focus should be on strategic solutions, not procedural measures to overhaul the beleaguered party. “I think the selection of candidates for an election is a minute issue,” said Lee Jung-hee, professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. “Fair election in itself is a step in the right direction, but NPAD should put more attention on structural reasons why it was defeated (in the by-elections),” said Lee.Political pundit Jeon Won-chaek pointed out that NPAD should resolve ideological differences among different factions to address intraparty feuding. “Pro-Roh factions and other factions are ideologically different,” Jeon said in a radio interview with local broadcaster TBS. “Both factions have different views about politics and thus they need to bridge ideological gaps, no matter how long it will take.” By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","week his party lost four ,following last week electoral defeat ,last week his party lost ,his party lost four parliamentary ,last week electoral defeat the","['Moon Jae - in', 'Kim - Moo', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Chun - Jung - bae', 'Gwanak District', 'Seoul', 'NPAD ’s', 'Moon Jae - inBut', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Joo Seung - yong', 'NPAD', 'Moon', 'Kim Dae - Jung', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Moon', 'NPAD', 'Chun Jung - bae', 'Moon', 'Roh', 'pro - roh', 'Moon', 'Lee Jung - hee', 'Hankuk University of Foreign Studies', 'NPAD', 'Lee', 'Jeon Won - chaek', 'NPAD', 'pro - roh', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.81636816  0.18693635

The move came three days after the 66-year-old was grilled over his alleged influence-peddling for 19 hours from Thursday morning at Seoul Central District Prosecutor’s Office. Park was accused of accepting kickbacks from Doosan Group, which owns Chung-Ang University, in return for pressuring the Education Ministry to grant privileges to the school. He allegedly exerted undue influence on the ministry to allow the university to merge its separate campuses and acquire the Red Cross College of Nursing in 2011. The merger is reported to have saved the school tens of billions of won.Park served as president of Chung-Ang University from 2005 until he joined Lee’s administration in 2011.The former presidential secretary reportedly denied all charges during the investigation. Prosecutors also accused Park of receiving about 1.8 billion won ($1.6 million) between 2008 and 2012 from Doosan Group’s affiliates through Mootsori Foundation, where Park is a chief director, in return for giving favors to the company-owned university.Park allegedly transferred ownership of a building constructed with public funds to Mootsori in 2013 after he ended his term at Cheong Wa Dae, which prosecutors viewed as embezzlement.The investigation also found that Park violated the Private School Act by accepting financial donations for Chung-Ang University’s foundation from Woori Bank through an inappropriate bank account. Woori Bank allegedly offered the money as a token of gratitude after Chung-Ang University extended its contract with the bank in 2008 while Park was president of the university. Other accusations include that his wife illegally secured leases at a shopping mall operated by a unit of Doosan Group in 2011 and that Chung-Ang University altered its recruiting requirements to hire his daughter as a music professor last year. Park himself has served as an outside director at Doosan Engine since March 2014, receiving an annual income of 58 million won. A court will hold a hearing early next week to review the warrant application.

Moon Jae-in, chair of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, pledged to consider changing “everything from the party’s people to the party’s day-to-day functioning” to achieve victory in the 2016 general election. Next year’s nationwide polls will decide if the governing party maintains its long-held parliamentary majority.“Voters delivered a strong message to us in (last Wednesday’s) polls,” Moon said in reference to the four parliamentary by-elections that the governing Saenuri Party won, increasing its parliamentary majority to 160 in the 298-seat National Assembly, from 156.“I will never forget this loss. I will use it as an opportunity to launch our party to victory in 2016,” Moon added. NPAD leader Rep. Moon Jae-in shakes hands with a resident during his visit to Gwangju, Monday. (Yonhap)The defeats came amid a public uproar over a corruption scandal involving top Saenuri Party officials. Analysts had predicted the scandal would give easy wins to NPAD candidates running in the four contested districts in Seoul, Incheon, Gwangju, and Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province.The NPAD’s most surprising loss was to independent candidate Chun Jung-bae in Gwangju, a region long considered an NPAD stronghold. Chun is an ex-NPAD official who left the party in February after twice failing to secure a spot as a party candidate in Gwangju ― first in last July’s parliamentary by-elections and in the by-elections last week.Moon flew to Gwangju on Monday to meet voters for the first time since the electoral defeat to Chun, reportedly appealing to former NPAD voters who had turned their backs on the polls. Moon met senior citizens at a community center in Korea’s fifth-largest city, bowing his head in deference and folding his hands together in front of him.“I consider your votes as calls urging our party to get our act together,” he said in his deep monotone voice in a speech marked by brief pauses.Senior NPAD figures have not shied away from expressing their discontent at Moon’s leadership, despite his efforts to unite the party’s many factions after the losses last week.“If I were Moon, I’d step down,” former liberal lawmaker Chung Dai-chul said. Chung is a senior adviser to the party and also the father of incumbent NPAD Rep. Chyung Ho-joon. “A politician must take responsibility for electoral results,” the ex-legislator said.NPAD Rep. Joo Seung-yong accused Moon of favoritism.“Rep. Moon must resign. If he doesn’t resign, he’d better promise to do away with his factionalist policies,” Joo said Monday.Joo appeared to be criticizing Moon’s alleged favoritism of members in the NPAD’s most dominant faction, which consists of politicians who started their careers under former liberal President Roh Moo-hyun.Moon was Roh’s presidential chief of staff and is considered the “big brother” of the pro-Roh group.But Moon’s approval ratings still lead those of his counterparts in the Saenuri Party. A Realmeter nationwide poll conducted from April 27 to May 1 with 2,500 respondents showed Moon’s endorsement rating at 24.8 percent. Saenuri chair Rep. Kim Moo-sung came in second at 19.2 percent. The margin of error was plus or minus 2 percent, with a 95 percent confidence level.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","election next year nationwide polls ,main opposition leader monday vowed ,win next year parliamentary elections ,korea main opposition leader monday ,opposition leader monday vowed to","['South Korea ’s', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Moon', 'Saenuri Party', 'National Assembly', 'Moon', 'NPAD', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Saenuri Party', 'NPAD', 'Seoul', 'Seongnam', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'the NPAD ’s', 'Chun Jung - bae', 'NPAD', 'Chun', 'Moon', 'Chun', 'NPAD', 'Moon', 'Korea', 'Moon ’s', 'Moon', 'Chung Dai - chul', 'Chung', 'Chyung Ho - joon', 'Joo Seung - yong', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Joo', 'Joo', 'Moon', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Moon', 'Roh', 'Moon ’s', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Moon ’s', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Jeong Hunny']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.58916199  0.4007434

This means an employee would receive about 50 percent of his annual income as a pension after reaching retirement age. If the bill passes, public officials will be required to pay more in premiums while in service and receive less in payouts after retirement. The parties predict that some 333 trillion won ($309 billion) would be saved in the next 70 years thanks to the reform plan.Under the revised system, a public servant who worked for 30 years with an average monthly salary of 3 million won will have to pay 270,000 won in monthly premiums, which is 60,000 won more than before. After retirement, the official will receive 1.71 million won in monthly payouts, which is 180,000 won less than in the existing scheme.According to the parties’ agreement, 20 percent of the funds saved from the civil servants’ pension reform will go toward the national pension fund. This is designed to help pay for the increased payouts in an effort to combat senior poverty.But even with this injection, the government will still need to find more money to cover the costs of increasing national pension benefits, either through taxation or by raising premiums. The Welfare Ministry predicts that Koreans would need to spend an average of 18 percent of their income on national pension premiums to fund a 50 percent income replacement rate. Currently, 9 percent of incomes go toward national pension premiums. Welfare Minister Moon Hyung-pyo on Saturday visited Saenuri Party leader Kim Moo-sung to complain the parties’ decision to increase the nominal income replacement rate of the national pension, claiming they exceeded their authority. Cheong Wa Dae also reportedly complained to the ruling party about the same matter.“We estimate that at least 70 trillion won is needed to raise the nominal income replacement rate (of the national pension) to 50 percent, regardless of inflation,” Moon told reporters. “The cost (of increasing the income replacement rate) may exceed the funds saved from the civil servants’ pension reform.”According to the National Pension Research Institute, the number of national pension recipients will exceed that of those paying into the scheme by 2060, as the senior population is grows and the nation’s fertility rate remains low. The Welfare Ministry also predicts that the national pension fund will be completely depleted by 2060.Amid Cheong Wa Dae’s growing concerns, the leaders of the rival parties agreed to establish a task force to improve the current government-run pension system, which has been ridden with growing deficits as the elderly population rapidly increases. A special National Assembly committee will be formed to draw up a relevant bill to be passed by September.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","alliance for democracy on saturday ,000 won in monthly premiums ,million won in monthly payouts ,assembly this wednesday but cheong ,for democracy on saturday","['the National Assembly', 'Saenuri Party', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'the Welfare Ministry', 'Koreans', 'Moon Hyung - pyo', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'Dae', 'Moon', 'the National Pension Research Institute', 'the Welfare Ministry', 'National Assembly', 'Claire Lee']",0,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.30068058  0.20506157

But it faced mounting calls for a leadership overhaul to seize the political agenda.The NPAD was seen moving to demand new legislation to create an independent unit to investigate the scandal, which was sparked after claims by late businessman Sung Woan-jong that he gave money to top aides to President Park Geun-hye. Among the listed names are former Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo and former and incumbent presidential chiefs of staff.The NPAD suffered an embarrassing defeat in last Wednesday’s by-elections for four parliamentary seats, losing three to the Saenuri Party and one to an independent candidate.The surprise defeat prompted calls for a complete party overhaul, including discussions on whether to align with other opposition forces ahead of next year’s general election.“If the Park administration attempts to divert public attention from the graft scandal, NPAD will do what it is supposed to do as an opposition party. We will respond in a firm and stringent manner,” said NPAD leader Moon Jae-in at a press conference Thursday.The party is slated to select a new floor leader this Thursday to steer the party until next year’s general election. Five candidates have so far entered the race. Reports said that the party members would favor a candidate who can embrace Rep. Chun Jung-bae, a party defector who won by a landslide victory in the NPAD stronghold of Gwangju. Besides resolving potential intraparty feuds, the leadership is also pressured to work out a legislative standoff with the ruling party. The governing party has been pushing for legislation to provide free child care to children aged 3 to 5 and revamp business laws in Korea ―- both are still pending in the National Assembly.The opposition party is likely to oppose the legislation unless the ruling party accepts their proposal. NPAD has been demanding that additional government officials be assigned to support the free child care policy. The ruling party has refused this demand, branding it a waste of taxpayers’ money. Meanwhile, reports said President Park was likely to return to work this week. She has been missing from the political stage since she fell ill after a visit to Latin America last month. During her time off, Park accepted the prime minister’s resignation and issued a statement on the graft scandal. Now that the governing party has won the by-elections and concluded a plan for pension reforms for public workers, it is expected that the president will push ahead with the government’s labor and public sector reforms.

YonhapThe opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy suffered crushing defeats in constituencies where political liberals had shown strong showings in past elections. It lost its stronghold of Gwangju to a defector of the party.The ruling party was hit hard by the snowballing bribery scandal involving President Park Geun-hye’s close confidants, providing a strong political weapon for the opposition party to attack just before the by-elections.The performance is expected to not only cement Kim’s leadership in the party but also raise his status as a promising candidate for next president, analysts said. ""The ruling camp now has the mandate to push the political reform of the entire spectrum, effectively overshadowing the opposition’s push to use the graft scandal against the Saenuri Party,” said Bae Jong-chan, senior analyst of Research and Research.“The win is also expected to elevate the ruling party’s position in future discussions with Cheong Wa Dae,” he added.Opposition leader Moon Jae-in, on the other hand, is expected to face demands to take responsibility for the defeat, the pundits said. The party is expected to face mounting calls to rethink its policy agenda and fix the internal power struggle among those loyal to former President Roh Moo-hyun and loyalists of former President Kim Dae-jung.The by-elections were held in four constituencies ― Seoul, Incheon, Gwangju and Seongnam of Gyeonggi Province ― to pick lawmakers for the 298-member National Assembly.Electoral officials count the votes in Seoul’s Gwanak district late Wednesday. YonhapThe election, dubbed as “ultra mini-general election,” would not have significant impact in changing the current political landscape, pundits said. But the winner of the election was expected to take a lead in the partisan fight over the escalating graft scandal and in ongoing discussions over pending issues such as pension and labor reform. Earlier in the day, Saenuri leader Kim urged voters to pick the party’s candidates, stressing that all the four constituencies need reliable support from the governing party.“To achieve regional development, we need talented lawmakers and above all, the power of the governing party,” he said during a supreme council meeting.Opposition leader Moon, on the contrary, urged voters to give a referendum on the scandal-stricken Park administration through the by-election.“Only votes can give an answer to the Park Geun-hye administration’s failed economic policies, personnel appointment and corruption,” he said at a meeting.Analysts said the election was crucial for leaders of the rival parties, as it was their first major test.The snowballing graft scandal involving President Park’s key aides had set up a favorable environment for the main opposition party ahead of the election, said a Seoul-based political analyst Yoon Hee-woong. But the scandal failed to serve as a winning factor for NPAD in the election, he said, citing systematic limitation of the mini election.Voter turnout stood at 36 percent, 3.1 percentage points higher than last year’s by-election. But the slight changes in the turnout had little to do with the number of liberal voters aged between 20s and 40s ― crucial groups for the opposition party.Yoon Pyeong-joong, political professor of Hanshin University, also played down the impact of the election, stressing that it doesn’t have any of decisive factors expected to bring changes in political landscape. “I don’t think the election would become a barometer of public sentiment. The scale of the election in which parties are competing with each other for four (out of 298 parliamentary) seats is not big enough to have an impact,” he said“The election is taking place with complex feelings toward the Park (administration) conflicting together,” he said.Park continued to show her authoritative leadership through a message announced on Tuesday, Yoon pointed out. “Park’s counterattack against the opposition party could stimulate liberal voters and further disappoint swing voters who may have wanted to see her take responsibility over the burgeoning graft scandal involving her close confidants,” he said. “But at the same time, her illness caused by overwork, could garner more sympathy votes from conservative voters.” By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","snowballing bribery scandal involving president ,snowballing graft scandal involving president ,party emerged unscathed in wednesday ,seoul on wednesday yonhapthe opposition ,snowballing bribery scandal involving","['Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Yoo Seung - min', 'Seoul', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Kim', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Bae Jong - chan', 'Research and Research', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'Seoul', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'National Assembly', 'Seoul', 'Saenuri', 'Kim', 'Moon', 'Park', 'Seoul', 'Yoon Hee - woong', 'voter', 'Yoon Pyeong - joong', 'Hanshin University', 'Yoon', 'Cho Chung - un']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38207933  0.32920837

Hong Joon-pyo to gather information on their whereabouts when deceased businessman Sung Woan-jong claimed to have given money to them.Lee, who resigned upon mounting pressure last week, and Hong are two of the eight politicians on the list left by Sung before his apparent suicide earlier this month, suggesting he had given illicit political funds to them. South Gyeongsang Province Gov. Hong Joon-pyo heads to his office in Changwon, South Gyeongsang Province, Wednesday. (Yonhap)The investigation, slowed by a lack of evidence, appeared to hit another snag Tuesday following a message from President Park Geun-hye calling for an investigation into her predecessors’ special pardon on Sung.Her remarks, given through her chief press secretary, came under fire from opposition and local observers as an attempt to sway the investigation. Sources from the prosecution were quoted as saying in reports that Park’s message tightened their discretion as any investigation outcome may appear to be directed by Cheong Wa Dae.They also cited current laws that make it impossible to investigate a past pardon decision.Under the law, a presidential pardon is an act of the state that is not legally binding. If it is suspected of having a criminal motive ― such as the president or his or her confidants receiving money or favors in exchange for the pardon ― it can be subject to investigation. But in such cases, investigators must prove that the money or favors were provided in exchange of the promise of the pardon.Rep. Jun Byung-hun of the main opposition New Political Alliance for Democracy claimed Park’s argument lacked substance as there was no evidence suggesting a deal was made for Sung’s pardon.The NPAD has tried to shift the blame over Sung’s pardon to the Saenuri Party, claiming that the businessman was pardoned in early 2008 at the request of then-President-elect Lee Myung-bak.The Saenuri Party dismissed the argument and demanded NPAD leader Moon Jae-in ― who was chief of staff to then-President Roh Moo-hyun ― to explain exactly why Sung was pardoned.Yang Seung-ham, a politics professor at Yonsei University, pointed out that because the incident happened several years ago and Roh no longer alive, it is very unlikely that either side will be able to provide enough evidence to prove their case.Contrary to Park’s emphasis on rooting out corruption, observers said Park’s public address was designed to raise support ahead of Wednesday’s by-election while dodging responsibility for the graft scandal. The eight suspected of receiving money from Sung consist of her former and incumbent chief secretaries and ruling party members. “Park appears to be trying to ‘water down’ suspicions against her and her staff with political intent for the by-election,” Yang said.Justice Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, meanwhile, underscored that the investigation would stay neutral.With regard to any probe into the pardons, Hwang said he was looking into all possibilities, but added that an investigation was unlikely if evidence of wrongdoing did not turn up. “I’m just saying that we are not confining the scope of the investigation to any specific party,” he told the parliamentary legislation and judiciary committee.

The victory effectively gives the party a mandate to push through the administration’s reform plans and economic initiatives. The conservative party prevailed in three of the four contested districts, dealing a crushing blow to the main opposition New Political Alliance for Democracy, which won none.Independent Chun Jung-bae (left) and the Saenuri Party`s Shin Sang-jin celebrate after their wins. YonhapThe liberal opposition was defeated even in its traditional stronghold of Gwangju by Chun Jung-bae, an independent candidate who defected from the party. Chun’s win, with 52.37 percent of the votes, leaves the NPAD with an uphill battle to realign its policy drives and mend its factional struggles.Three Saenuri candidates won comfortable victories in Seoul and nearby cities. Shin Sang-jin won in Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province, taking 55.9 percent of the votes. Ahn Sang-soo won in Incheon with 54.11 percent.In the most closely contested district of Gwanak, Seoul, Oh Shin-hwan triumphed with 43.89 percent of the votes, as liberal votes were split by the NPAD’s Jung Tae-ho and Chung Dong-young, a former opposition presidential candidate running as an independent. The majority governing party increased its seats in the 298-member National Assembly to 160, while the main opposition holds 130.Turnout was 36 percent, with 256,232 voters showing up at polling stations, the National Election Commission said. The polls were held to fill four seats vacated by members of a defunct leftist party and a Saenuri official found guilty last month of violating election laws in 2012.Analysts said the Saenuri Party’s win has secured it a stronger position to lead future talks in the Assembly on reforms pursued by the Park Geun-hye administration.Voters line up to cast their ballots in Seoul on Wednesday. YonhapThe party also showed some recovery from negative public opinion against it sparked by a graft scandal involving the party’s top officials. Eight Saenuri officials were accused of taking illegal campaign funds from the late Sung Woan-jong, who claimed to have given billions in unlisted funds to them since 2007.The win also offered Saenuri chair Rep. Kim Moo-sung a chance to expand his clout within the conservative party as an alternative force to the mainstream pro-Parks, the faction backing the president, pundits said.The political reform initiative, reiterated by Park through her chief press secretary a day before the elections, also gained momentum.The bills pushed by Park and the ruling party include one aiming to invigorate crowdfunding in South Korea’s conservative business culture and another draft amendment targeting the public service pension, a source the ruling bloc has blamed for the snowballing national debt.Voters cast their ballots in Seoul on Wednesday. Yonhap“The election does not change the majority party. Nor will it change the president’s attitude,” said Chung-Ang University professor Choi Young-jin.One of the most heated competition took place at Gwangju, the traditional stronghold of the liberals. The seat was heavily contested by opposition-turned-independent Chun Jung-bae, Jung Seung of the Saenuri Party and Cho Young-teck of the NPAD, among others.“I will eradicate regional discrimination, reform the opposition and fundamentally change Korean politics,” Chun said in his victory speechThe overall outcome of the by-elections, however, would be lesser than anticipated, as the elected lawmakers will only serve a one-year term before next year’s general elections.“If you take out Gwangju, an area the opposition fought over amongst themselves, there were only three districts the ruling and opposition blocs were contesting,” said Yoon Pyung-joong, professor at Hanshin University. “That means it will be difficult to gauge public opinion of the Park administration.”“Moon has always been viewed as a Roh lieutenant,” Yoon said in reference to former President Roh Moo-hyun. “That image of being under Roh’s shadow has always been a weakness for him.”The disappointing results will consequently weaken Moon’s foothold in the opposition party, but he will still hold onto the leadership position as the bloc lacks an alternative figure who can be projected as the next presidential candidate, the pundits said.Moon served as Roh’s chief of staff and secretary before running in the 2012 presidential race against Park.

(Yonhap)Finance ministers from the two countries had met every year since 2006 to discuss outstanding issues, but the meeting was halted after senior Japanese politicians paid homage at the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo that honors Japan's war dead. Seoul countered this provocation with then President Lee Myung-bak's visit to its easternmost islets of Dokdo.  The shrine is viewed in South Korea as a symbol of Japan's militarism and the country's unwillingness to acknowledge it past mistakes. Japan has persistently claimed that South Korea is illegally occupying Dokdo. However, Seoul maintains that territorial claims made by Tokyo are groundless and another sign that the neighboring country has not repented for its past aggression.  The finance ministry, however, said that any significant agreement is unlikely to be reached at the upcoming talks since there has been little improvement in diplomatic relations in the past few months.  In addition, bilateral trade fell 13.9 percent on-year to $18.44 billion in the first quarter of this year.  ""There are no specific agendas to put on the table, with the finance ministers likely to agree in principle to expanding economic and financial cooperation,"" a ministry official said.  Before the planned bilateral meeting, Choi and Aso will meet with China's finance minister in Azerbaijan at the ASEAN-plus-three meeting on Sunday, where they will likely discuss strengthening economic cooperation and the need to be prepared for sudden emergency situations, he added.

All but one listed on the memo are close associates of the president.  Park accepted Lee's resignation offer earlier this week.  The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, which fielded candidates for all the four seats, is running on its election campaign to pass judgment on the scandal-stricken Park administration.  Expressing regret over Lee's resignation, Park vowed to root out corruption and push for a fresh political reform.  Another major intrigue in the by-elections is the fate of two heavyweight politicians who defected from the main opposition party to run for the parliamentary races.  The two former NPAD members -- Chung Dong-young and Chun Jung-bae -- are each running for the race at the B constituency of the Kwanak district in southern Seoul and the B constituency of the Seogu district in the traditionally left-leaning southwestern city of Gwangju.  The bids by Chung, a former presidential candidate, and former Justice Minister Chun are expected to split opposition votes.  Both the ruling and main opposition parties are running toward the goal of each winning at least two seats, although ceding all four seats to the opposition bloc will not weaken the ruling party's 157-strong majority held at the National Assembly.  The Saenuri Party is largely seen as holding sway over the B constituency of Ganghwa county, Incheon, with the rest of the three, including the Jungwon district in Gyeonggi Province, preferring the opposition bloc.   Voter turnout during the two-day early voting, held last week, stood at 7.6 percent, according to the National Election Commission.

Monday's attack in the Bosnian Serb town of Zvornik instantly raised tensions in Bosnia, still fragile two decades after the end a war between its Christian Orthodox Serbs, Muslim Bosniaks and Catholic Croats that left 100,000 people dead and divided the country along ethnic lines.The suspect taken into custody is known to police and has been questioned in the past for possible Syria ties and recruitment efforts for the Islamic State group, Bosnian Serb police chief Dragan Lukac said. The gunman was identified as 24-year-old Nerdin Ibric. Police say the gunman shouted ""Allahu akbar,"" which is the Arabic phrase for ""God is great,"" before opening fire in the town of Zvornik.Police didn't give the full name of the suspect arrested Tuesday, identifying him only by the initials A.S.H. in accordance with Bosnia's privacy laws.Lukac said the suspect had frequent contact with Ibric in the lead-up to Monday's attack. The police chief didn't immediately give details about the suspect's connection to the shooting, or whether he may have inspired the gunman to launch an attack by preying on his vulnerabilities about his father.Izeta Okanovic, a neighbor of the gunman in the nearby village of Kucic Kula, told The Associated Press that the man's father was taken away in 1992 and that he never came back. Local media reported that Serb police rounded up the father along with 750 Muslims from the town and killed them all.The town, located on the border with Serbia, was about 60-percent Muslim before the start of the 1992-95 war. Almost all Muslim residents were expelled from the town, and many were rounded up and killed as part of a Serb campaign to create a purely Serb area.The 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement ended the vicious war and divided the country into two autonomous regions, one for Serbs and the other shared by Bosniaks and Croats. The regions are linked by a weak central government, parliament and presidency. In the wake of Monday's attack, the Bosnian Serb leader, who is pushing for independence for the Serb region of Bosnia, said the country's central institutions are ""useless"" and Bosnian Serbs should form their own intelligence service.Milorad Dodik said Tuesday morning the Bosnian Serbs have the right to ""defend themselves."" The previous evening, a Bosnian Muslim gunman killed one police officer and injured two after he stormed into a police station in the northeastern town of Zvornik, in the Serb part of the country, shouting ""Allahu akbar,"" or God is great.","bosnian police on tuesday arrested ,monday attack the police chief ,evening bosnian muslim gunman killed ,police on tuesday arrested man ,allahu akbar killing one policeman","['kucic KULA', 'Bosnia - Herzegovina', 'AP', 'bosnian', 'bosnian serb', 'Serbs', 'bosnian serb', 'Zvornik', 'Bosnia', 'Christian Orthodox Serbs', 'Muslim Bosniaks', 'Syria', 'Islamic', 'State', 'bosnian serb', 'Dragan Lukac', 'Nerdin Ibric', 'arabic', 'Zvornik', 'A.S.H.', 'Bosnia', 'Lukac', 'Ibric', 'Izeta Okanovic', 'Kucic Kula', 'the Associated Press', 'serb', 'Muslims', 'Serbia', 'Muslim', 'muslim', 'serb', 'serb', 'Serbs', 'Bosniaks', 'Croats', 'bosnian serb', 'serb', 'Bosnia', 'bosnian Serbs', 'Milorad Dodik', 'the bosnian Serbs', 'bosnian muslim', 'Zvornik', 'serb']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45172414  0.55578935

He retweeted a claim by a local reporter that Koh and his children had a U.S. green card.Under the Korean law, an elected official loses his or her post if sentenced to a prison term or a fine of 1 million won or more. Cho has already said that he will appeal, meaning he is likely to retain his post for at least several months. But the ruling is expected to present major hurdles to his education policies. Seoul’s education chief Cho Hi-yeon speaks before signing a memorandum of understanding with Paris’ education office on Tuesday. (Yonhap)Cho said he would appeal to the Constitutional Court, saying the defamation clause cited against him infringes upon the freedom of expression during the election. The clause was challenged in 2008 by former lawmaker Lee Moo-young, but was ruled constitutional. In light of Friday’s ruling, an old debate about the direct election system reemerged. The Korea Federation of Teacher’s Associations, one of the most outspoken opponents of the system, claimed that the ruling demonstrates a well-known problem.“Since the system was implemented in 2007, two out of four elected Seoul education chiefs were forced to step down due to scandals involving their election campaigns, while a third might go down the same path,” said KFTA spokesman Kim Dong―seok. “This problem goes beyond personal blunders; it is derived from the structural problems of the direct election system.”Last year, the right-leaning teachers group filed a petition to the Constitutional Court to strike down the system. It claimed that using an election to choose an apolitical figure such as an education chief was contradictory, since running for election itself is a highly political action.Korea’s education superintendents ― entrusted with policies for primary and secondary education within a city or a province ― were originally appointed by the president. Amid calls for education autonomy, however, direct elections were adopted. But since then, everyone who has been elected as Seoul education chief has stood trial for election misconduct. Two of Cho’s predecessors ― Kwak No-hyun and Gong Jeong-taek ― were stripped of their positions.A KFTA survey of 238 teachers conducted shortly before last week’s ruling showed that 64 percent of the respondents thought the direct election system had a negative impact on Korean education. Some 53 percent said the biggest reason behind the reoccurring problems was the excessive competition among candidates. Saenuri Party Rep. Won Yoo-chul said the current system forces candidates to spend large amounts of money, making them more susceptible to corruption. “In the process of raising funds, (candidates) are easily involved in corruption. The system also allows wealthy people with political influence to have an edge over education experts,” he said.Won, who also heads the party’s policy committee, announced that the committee would discuss possible alternatives to supplement the current system at the Saenuri Party’s Supreme Council meeting Monday. Saenuri leader Kim Moo-sung also told reporters that the Cho Hi-yeon situation prompted him to think that the current system was not working.Among the possible alternatives was a “running mate” system, which pairs a candidate for a mayor or a governor with a candidate for a superintendent post. One of the problems cited by opponents of the direct election system was discord between the head of a regional government and the education chief. Cho’s predecessor Moon Yong-rin, a conservative, often butted heads with liberal Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon over key education policies.Liberal candidates dominated the 2014 educational chief elections in 2014. The NPAD has criticized the ruling party‘s move to abolish the direct election as an attempt to overhaul the system as liberal candidates prevailed last year’s elections against the conservative rivals.The Korea Teachers and Education Workers’ Union also refuted the calls to overhaul the system, saying such attempts ran “against the wave of education autonomy that is slowly taking root as a result of nationwide consent.” “Such calls are ridiculous as suggesting we should overhaul direct election of presidents, after a problem occurred during a presidential election. … Are they suggesting that we return to the past when the Education Ministry dictated everything and used education to serve its political purposes?” the KTU said in its statement.Progressive education chiefs across the country also defended the current system.Jang Hwi-kook, the education chief for Gwangju and the head of the superintendents’ association, voiced his opposition about talks of abolishing the direct election system.“Such an approach deals with an educational issue with a political purpose in mind. It is likely to disrupt educational autonomy,” he said.Lee Jae-jung, the education superintendent of Gyeonggi Province, also criticized such debates and said the more effective way of preventing election-related crimes would be to thoroughly verify each candidate’s qualifications, suggesting that the authorities should implement a system to make this possible.Last year’s race for Seoul education chief turned into a dogfight after prominent candidates Cho, Koh and Moon Yong-rin began to hurl suspicions and criticisms at each other. Koh recently told local media that Cho’s accusation of him having a U.S. green card was the key reason he lost.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","stood trial for election misconduct ,four elected seoul education chiefs ,race for seoul education chief ,fined million won 700 friday ,trial for election misconduct two","['Seoul', 'Choi Hi - yeon', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education', 'Koh Seung - duk', 'Koh', 'U.S.', 'korean', 'Cho', 'Seoul', 'Cho Hi - yeon', 'Paris ’', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Lee Moo - young', 'the Korea Federation of teacher ’s Associations', 'Seoul', 'KFTA', 'Kim Dong―seok', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Gong Jeong - taek', 'KFTA', 'korean', 'Saenuri Party', 'Won Yoo', 'Won', 'the Saenuri Party ’s Supreme Council', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Cho', 'Moon Yong - rin', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'NPAD', 'the Korea Teachers and Education Workers ’ Union', 'the Education Ministry', 'KTU', 'Jang hwi - kook', 'Lee Jae - jung', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Seoul', 'Cho', 'Koh', 'Moon Yong - rin', 'Koh', 'Cho ’s', 'U.S.', 'Yoon Min - sik']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ...  0.11957306 -0.08276828

Most of the 304 victims were high school students on a field trip..  Lee Joon-seok, the captain of the sunken Sewol ferry, in a hearing on Tuesday, April 28, 2015. (Yonhap)A lower court had convicted the 70-year-old of gross negligence and dereliction of duty, giving him a 36-year prison term.   Lee ordered the passengers to remain where they were and failed to have them evacuate while he was among the first to be rescued, the court said.  ""The captain prematurely ended the students' lives and scarred their parents for life,"" said an emotional Judge Seo Kyeong-hwan, who fought back tears as he read the ruling. ""His actions tarnished South Korea's image and could not be justified under any circumstances.""  In the ruling, the court threw out the murder conviction of the ship's chief engineer, identified only by his surname Park, and commuted his prison term from 30 to 10 years.  The prison terms of 13 other crew members were reduced, and range from one and a half years to 12 years.  Less than half a dozen family members watched the proceedings on TV from a courthouse in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province, where the students went to school.  One of them, who lost her only child, said the sentences delivered to the crewmen were too light.  ""All of them are responsible for abandoning the children, so they should be given heavier sentences,"" she said.  South Korea announced last week plans to salvage the ferry which remains at the bottom of the sea along with nine missing bodies.  The retrieval is expected to begin in September and take up to one and a half years.  The government is forecast to spend up to 150 billion won in the process, although there may be added costs down the road.

""I am determined to eradicate the time-honored irregularities and corruption so we could achieve a new political reform.""  Park could not appear in public due to an illness. She is still receiving medical attention due to stomach cramps and a sore throat after her recent trip to South America.  Former Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo, who is at the center of an alleged corruption scandal, delivers his resignation speech in Seoul on Tuesday, April 28, 2015. (Yonhap)Park's message came a day after she accepted Lee's resignation offer over the scandal involving Lee and some of her key aides.  Lee is accused of taking 30 million won ($27,000) from a businessman at the center of the bribery scandal in 2013, when Lee was running for a parliamentary seat.  Before hanging himself earlier this month, the businessman, Sung Wan-jong, left behind a memo listing the names of Lee and seven other high-profile politicians he claimed to have bribed. All but one listed on the memo are close associates of the president.  Still, Lee has flatly denied the allegation.  Park called on the prosecution to carry out a thorough probe into the scandal and said the ruling and opposition parties should launch an independent counsel probe if any suspicion is left after the prosecution's investigation.  Park also called for the truth behind two special pardons Sung received in 2005 and 2007 when President Roh Moo-hyun was in office, noting the special pardons undermined the rule of law.  Her remarks are seen as a push to punish not only the ruling party politicians but also those from the opposition party if they are found guilty of bribery.  Lawmakers of the ruling Saenuri Party have raised suspicions of irregularities involving Sung's pardons given under the Roh government of the now major opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy.  In South Korea, presidents usually grant special pardons in commemoration of major national holidays, though the practice has long been under fire for being abused to give favors to their friends and associates jailed for corruption.  ""This is the last chance to sever the cycle of corruption and eradicate it in our politics,"" Park said.

South Korea sent a deputy finance minister as a chief negotiator to the meeting, the fourth of its kind, which was under way at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, the source said. Details of the AIIB are still sketchy, but the source who has the knowledge of this week's meeting said, ""A broad outline of each member's stake in the AIIB could be visible after the fourth round of meetings in Beijing."" Fifty-seven countries, including South Korea, became founding members of the AIIB, which is seen as a potential counterbalance to U.S.-led multilateral lenders such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank.

The parties set a May 2 deadline to finalize the plan.The committee, comprising government representatives, public servants and pension experts, has mapped out a tentative plan, which would decrease pension payments for civil servants by 10 percent and increase their financial contribution by 30 to 40 percent.“The pension reform plan has nearly come to a close as there were agreements on many aspects,” said Rep. Kang Gi-jung from the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy. The government has pushed to restructure the loss-making pension system for government employees in an attempt to deal with snowballing national debt. According to the revised scheme, the government’s pension payment rate will be lowered to between 1.65 and 1.75 percent from the current 1.9 percent. This will raise the insurance rate from 14 percent to between 18 and 20 percent.Government workers currently receive 57 percent of their average income when they retire, but it is expected to drop to between 49.5 and 52.5 percent. It would mean under the revised plan, public servants will be required to pay 30 to 40 percent more from their income, but receive 8 to 13 percent less when they retire.The government and pensioners have so far agreed to put a cap on the maximum pension public servants can receive. The working group for the pension overhaul agree that the new plan will be based on a pay-more, receive-less proposal, but the details are yet to be finalized, sources said.Issues such as implementing a wage peak system and realigning the pension payment between higher-earning public servants and lower-earning government officials were some of the remaining sticking points in the negotiations.Unionized workers have resisted the changes. About 260,000 workers, including 60,000 government employees and 10,000 teachers, staged a one-day strike Friday last week to protest the government’s drive for reforms to the pension system and labor market.About 100 members from 90 trade unions from the Confederation of Korean Government Employees’ Union vowed to go on a hunger strike for five days starting Monday.

Cho is appealing to the Supreme Court. If the nation’s highest court upholds Seoul District Court’s decision, he will lose his post and be asked to return some 3 billion won in campaign funds. Seoul education chief Cho Hi-yeon. (Yonhap)The Supreme Court’s decision is expected to be announced in one year. In the meantime, Cho’s major projects as Seoul education chief, including the controversial plan to reduce the number of elite high schools in Seoul, may be affected by his weakened position and the court’s ruling. The district court concluded that Cho spread false claims that Koh was a permanent resident of the United States and that he was using his resident status to educate his two children overseas. During the campaign, Koh, a lawyer-turned-politician, publicly explained he did not hold permanent residency in the U.S., and his children were U.S. citizens by birth. After Koh’s explanation was proven to be valid, Cho continued to accuse Koh with the allegations during his campaign, the court said.Cho, a former sociology professor and the only liberal candidate, won an unexpected victory in the Seoul education chief election last year, beating two conservative frontrunners, including Koh. His key pledges included increasing the number of public, ordinary high schools, while reducing the number of private elite schools to promote equality in education. He also pledged to increase the number of public kindergartens to serve children of unprivileged households. Cho is not the first education chief of Seoul to be found guilty of breaching the nation’s election laws. In 2009, then-Seoul education chief Gong Jeong-taek was removed from his post after the Supreme Court fined him 1.5 million won for receiving bribes to bankroll his election campaign. In 2012, Kwak No-hyun was stripped of his post as Seoul’s top educator after the Supreme Court upheld his conviction on charges of giving bribes to Park Myoung-gee, a rival liberal candidate, in return for his withdrawal from the 2010 election for the job.

""If this cannot be sealed this time, the Republic of Korea has no future.""

Saenuri Party lawmakers have opposed the proposal and have expressed holding the hearing after the polls, apparently worried the scandal could adversely influence voter sentiments.The Sung scandal began on April 9, when the businessman claimed in an interview with a local daily to have given illegal campaign funds to officials with close ties to Park, hours before police found him dead in an apparent suicide in the woods of northern Seoul.Prosecutors had been probing Sung, the ex-chief of Keangnam Enterprises, for allegedly swindling government subsidies. He had denied the allegations and called the investigations against him a witch-hunt sponsored by corrupt Park officials such as Lee.Investigations into Sung’s claims intensified in the early hours Wednesday when prosecutors detained Park Joon-ho, a former top Sung aide, for allegedly tampering with evidence. Park had tried to erase evidence backing Sung’s graft allegations, authorities said. They also suspect Park could be withholding information on how and when Sung had allegedly given illegal campaign funds to the accused officials of Park.Prosecutors also raided the home and car of Sung’s first son in search of evidence supporting the claims.

The military will hold a public hearing Tuesday with food companies and nutritional experts before finalizing the plan to update the menu, the officials said.The military is also considering reducing the number of types of MREs to two from the current four. The types are based on how they are prepared ― eaten as is or warmed by immersion in hot water, adding hot water directly or using a self-heating object.The military plans to remove the two types that involve hot water.“The scheme is still in the making. The scheme, which is designed to better meet the tastes of our troops, will be finalized after due process of soliciting public opinion,” an Army official said, declining to be identified.The menu is expected to include Chinese noodles in black bean sauce, fried rice with vegetables and rice with curry sauce.Along with the diversification of the menu, the military also seeks to make the MREs smaller and lighter to make them better suited for combat situations. It will push to decrease the cost of the meals to 3,500 won ($3.24) per unit. Currently, each unit costs between 5,000 won and 10,000 won.

Party leaders shook hands with voters in early traffic hours, emphasizing its job creation platform.“There has been much commotion about the Sung Woan-jong scandal,” Kim said. “But we remain strong and determined in our belief that only members of the ruling party will bring more growth to these areas.”The main opposition, on the other hand, vowed the scandal “was only getting started.”The New Political Alliance for Democracy reiterated their calls for a parliamentary hearing on the scandal before the by-elections.

He is accused of destroying evidence about his late boss, who allegedly bribed politicians, including Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo.Sung Wan-jong, the late chairman of Keangnam, hanged himself earlier this month, leaving behind a list of people, mostly close associates of President Park Geun-hye, with won figures next to most of the names. Prosecutors allege these figures represent bribery sums.Prosecutors arrested the former executive director without a warrant, using the right to detain him temporarily for emergency purposes to head off any further cover-up. They said they will soon seek a formal arrest warrant.  Park joined Keangnam in 2003 and had since been a close aide to Sung as the company head and a ruling Saenuri Party lawmaker.He is considered the person with the most knowledge on his former boss' alleged underhanded dealings.The scandal gave ammunition to the opposition party, which had threatened to impeach the prime minister.

Deceased businessman Sung Woan-jong ― who died in an apparent suicide on April 9 amid a corruption probe ― suspected that Lee initiated the investigation that targeted him, and told local media shortly before his death that he had given illegitimate money to Lee and seven other prominent politicians.As the nation’s incumbent prime minster, Lee was the main point of attack in a hailstorm of criticism from the public and opposition following revelations about the graft scandal. Even the ruling Saenuri Party determined Monday that Lee should resign after a myriad of evidence disproved his claims of not having close relations with Sung.Lee Wan-koo. (Yonhap)“A commander in a ‘war against corruption’ fell in battle due to his own corruption, a misfortunate incident,” said Rep. Jung Chung-rae of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy. The “war against corruption” refers to a slogan the premier was planning to use for the anti-corruption campaign, before scrapping the name just minutes before announcing the plan. While it was widely expected that Lee would eventually quit, his abrupt announcement in the middle of the night surprised even some at the prime minister’s office. “We’re just as shocked as rest of the country. There’s nothing we can really say at this moment,” an official from the office said.It marks the fourth time Park’s pick for her second-in-command has been forced to quit due to a scandal; three premier-designates were denied the job, while Lee was forced to step down after only 63 days in office. Lee will retain his position as a ruling party lawmaker.If Lee’s resignation is accepted by President Park, he would have served as prime minister for the shortest period in history, two days shorter than the 65 days that 1960s politician Heo Jeong served in the post. But since Park is expected to accept his resignation after returning from her Latin America tour next week, Lee’s tenure is likely to be slightly longer than Heo on paper. In reality, Lee’s days as the nation’s premier is effectively over. He did not show up at Tuesdays’ Cabinet meeting ― which was to be presided over by him in Park’s absence ― and did not leave his Seoul residence as of Tuesday afternoon. The Prime Minister’s office was quiet regarding Lee’s remaining schedule for the week, but some officials said it is likely that it will be canceled.Lee’s resignation concludes a short but tumultuous tenure as the premier. When Park appointed the 64-year-old lawmaker in January, the initial reaction from rival parties was relatively favorable. It was considered a good sign, considering the past nomination fiasco that saw two consecutive premier candidates fall due to scandal.But Lee was soon embroiled in a series of scandals, namely suspicion about him and his son dodging mandatary military duties, illegal real estate dealings and threatening reporters. The National Assembly eventually approved Lee, albeit by a slight margin in the lawmaker’s vote. Lee’s unusually short term followed Kim Hwang-sik and Chung Hong-won, two of the longest-reigning prime ministers since 1987, when the direct presidential election was introduced. Only three ― including Kim ― stayed in office longer than Chung. Chung offered to step down after last April’s ferry disaster ― which left more than 300 dead or missing ― but stayed in office until Lee took over, as other premier-designates were thwarted by scandals.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","suicide on april amid corruption ,march 12 deceased businessman sung ,april amid corruption probe suspected ,recent graft scandal lee demise ,corruption on march 12 deceased","['Park Geun - hye', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Lee', 'Sung Woan - jong', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee', 'Sung', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Yonhap)“A', 'Jung Chung - rae', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Lee', 'Park', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Heo Jeong', 'Park', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Park', 'Seoul', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Park', 'Lee', 'the National Assembly', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Kim Hwang - sik', 'Chung Hong - won', 'Kim', 'Chung', 'Chung', 'Lee', 'Yoon Min - sik']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.00213057  0.27953342

Kim Moo-sung is seen expanding his clout with the backing of nonmainstream members.While the scandal involving former and incumbent aides of President Park Geun-hye has become the biggest stumbling block for the party ahead of the April 29 by-elections, Kim’s approval ratings have soared. Analysts attributed Kim’s rise to conservatives’ growing demand for an alternative to the pro-Parks.“(Kim’s rise) was only a matter of time,” said Yoon Pyung-joong, a political philosophy professor at Hanshin University. “Even though there are other political heavyweights in the ruling party, Kim is practically the only one capable enough to navigate the party through crises. Therefore, Kim’s rise is inevitable,” said Yoon.Saenuri Party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sungThe survey by Realmeter released on Monday showed that Kim received 13.2 percent of support among the potential presidential candidates, behind longtime front-runner Moon Jae-in of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy with 27.9 percent.By category, Kim beat Moon in the Saenuri strongholds of Daegu, North Gyeongsang Province and Gangwon Province, as well as among voters in their 50s.Kim’s prominence was exhibited by last week’s one-on-one meeting with Park, as she sought his help in sustaining the opposition’s pressure to sack Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo, one of eight people accused of having received money from deceased businessman Sung Woan-jong. The prosecution is currently investigating the allegations.While Kim had urged the opposition to wait until Park returns from her Latin American tour, by Monday he reportedly decided that Lee’s resignation would be inevitable in the wake of worsening public opinion and the opposition’s move to impeach the premier. Hours after Kim’s comment, Lee tendered his resignation.Kim had also beat Park to take the initiative when the scandal broke out earlier this month by holding a press conference calling for a “thorough prosecutorial probe” into the allegations. It was only hours after Kim’s briefing that Cheong Wa Dae managed to release a statement reiterating the same position.Kim also wasted no time in canceling a scheduled high-level meeting with Cheong Wa Dae and the government, in an apparent move to distance the party from the officials embroiled in the allegations including presidential chief of staff Lee Byung-kee.Fifth-term lawmaker Kim, 63, won the chairmanship in July last year by defeating Seo Chung-won, a longtime confidant of Park, and vowed to forge “healthy tension” with the administration. While Kim was not necessarily considered an anti-Park member, he had had a “love-hate relationship” with her throughout the Lee Myung-bak administration when the rift between the pro-Parks and the pro-Lees peaked.When the party went through an internal power struggle during the 2012 presidential campaign, it was Kim who Park had sought to head her campaign headquarters. Kim, however, grew apart from Park upon the launch of her administration, as the staunch pro-Park members secured top posts within the party and Cheong Wa Dae.Now, Kim, empowered by reformist floor leader Rep. Yoo Seung-min, is expected to continue to butt heads with Cheong Wa Dae over critical issues such as a Constitutional revision and the introduction of the open primary system that is feared by the pro-Park members to disadvantage them in the run up to next year’s parliamentary elections.Earlier this year, he urged the government to raise taxes for financing welfare ― seemingly a veiled swipe at Park as she promised welfare without a tax increase during her presidential campaign.“It appears to be a struggle between current power and future power,” said Yoon of Hanshin University. “Former presidents pulled out all stops not to lose control to party leaders. “But they ended up giving in as the presidency entered the lame-duck period,” said Yoon. The most immediate test of Kim’s leadership will be the by-elections next week, as he faces the first competition with his rival Moon in the parties’ contest for four constituencies.

Swimmer Park Tae-hwan's doctor, accused of professional negligence, is seen leaving the court after the first hearing of her trial. (Yonhap)The doctor of the Olympic swimming champ, identified only by her surname Kim, had given him an injection of a drug called Nebido.Prosecutors accused the female doctor of professional negligence for failing to disclose the risks and ingredients of the injection.She is also charged with violating the medical code and causing bodily harm.She pleaded not guilty to all of the charges at the first hearing of her trial, insisting Park had agreed that it was his responsibility to confirm whether the injection had something to do with doping. The agreement was made as she is an anti-ageing and health care doctor who is not a doping expert.They met through a shared acquaintance, and Kim has treated Park free of charge ""out of compassion,"" according to her lawyer, Moon Jeong-il.""Kim has no professional knowledge in sports and had never treated an athlete before,"" Moon told the judge at a courtroom in the Seoul Central District Court.

The report revealed the teenager had run away from home after falling victim to sexual violence at 12 years old. Her alcoholic father, a single parent, had been physically abusive. She soon became involved in juvenile crime, habitually intoxicated with alcohol, and was eventually forced by other runaway teens to sell herself for money.The late teen was just one of some 200,000 teenagers who are estimated to run away from home every year, with the number growing.Statistics show that illegal sex trade involving teenagers is rising, in conjunction with the rising number of runaways, as the country struggles to clamp down on the sex industry. CCTV footage shows a murder suspect (left) and his teenage victim entering a motel in Seoul last month. The two reportedly met via a mobile messaging application for prostitution at the property, where the victim was later found dead. (Yonhap)Korean law currently stipulates that both purchasing and selling sex carries a one-year penalty in prison or a fine of up to 3 million won ($2,767). Buying sex from the underage carry a heavier penalty of one year and 10 months in prison or a fine of up to 50 million won ($46,310). Despite the penalties, the number of sex trade cases that involve teenagers more than doubled from 528 in 2010 to 1,290 in 2014, while the total number of sex trade cases dropped ― from 9,583 to 8,977 ― in the same time period, according to data released by the National Police Agency. The number of teens who ran away from home also increased between 2009 and 2012, from 15,114 to 21,813. The government predicts that figure would reach 200,000 if it counted those who ran away from home but were not reported by their parents or guardians. As of 2013, 60 percent of teens who were forced into prostitution were runaway teens. New Politics Alliance for Democracy Rep. Nam In-soon said one of the reasons behind the increasing number of teens involved in the sex trade has to do with the government’s poor regulation of the Internet and smartphone use. As of 2010, about 80 percent of the sex trade with teenagers was pre-arranged online, mostly using instant messaging applications on smartphones, which makes it harder for authorities to crack down on. According to Nam’s office, 717 mobile applications were involved in the illegal sex trade in 2013. “Among 182 of the apps involved in the sex trade, 65 percent did not require their users to register their age, and 96 percent were free applications for anyone to use,” she said in a statement.Lax regulations against managers of accommodation widely used for illegal sex trade was also considered a factor.In March, the murder of a middle school girl by a man in his 30s at a motel room in Seoul received heated news coverage. The victim reportedly met the suspect for prostitution via a mobile messaging application.Following the arrest of the suspect, a group of female lawyers filed a request to police to investigate the owner of the motel. “It is illegal for motel owners to let teenagers stay in their property without checking their ID,” said Kim Bo-ram, from the Korean Women Lawyers Association. “But 65 percent of sex trade cases involving teenagers take place in motels, according to data released by the Gender Equality Ministry.”Local studies have shown that female teens are more likely to run away from home and turn to sex work than their male counterparts. In 2010, 13,462 female teens ran away from home, compared to 8,825 male teenagers, according to the National Police Agency data. Among the 175 female runaway teens surveyed by the Seoul Metropolitan Government in 2012, 41 percent said they had been sexually abused at least once in their lives, while 55.3 percent said they were involved in the illegal sex industry.“The studies show that sexual violence and underage prostitution are linked to each other,” said Kim Nan-hee, a Gwangju-based activist for youth rights. “This tells us that we need to look at the two issues together, rather than simply trying to combat sex trades.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","175 female runaway teens surveyed ,175 female runaway teens ,murder of middle school girl ,462 female teens ran away ,the 175 female runaway teens","['cctv', 'Seoul', 'the National Police Agency', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy Rep.', 'Nam', 'Nam ’s', 'Seoul', 'Kim Bo - ram', 'the korean Women Lawyers Association', 'the Gender Equality Ministry', 'the National Police Agency', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Kim Nan - hee', 'Claire Lee']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48185816  0.39514375

Moon Jae-in, chair of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, said accusations that Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo took 30 million won ($28,000) from the late Sung Woan-jong justified an impeachment motion at the National Assembly. Lee has denied taking the money.“Prime Minister Lee must resign. His involvement in the case is taking up his time and energy,” Moon said. “That impedes him from running this country. This is also eventually harmful to the Park administration.”The comments come after President Park announced plans to make a decision on Lee after her return from a Latin America tour ending on April 27. Some governing Saenuri Party officials also back sacking Lee.The Saenuri Party, meanwhile, said it opposes any motion for Lee’s impeachment, and urged the opposition to wait until Park returns.“If the prime minister were to step down immediately, an administrative vacuum is inevitable ... we should wait as the president has pledged to (decide on Lee) once she returns,” Saenuri spokesman Rep. Park Dae-chul said.Sung alleged that he gave Lee illegal campaign funds in the April 2013 parliamentary by-election during an interview with the Kyunghyang Shinmun on April 9, hours before police found him dead in an apparent suicide. Sung was the former chair of construction firm Keangnam Enterprises and an ex-legislator with the Saenuri Party. Prosecutors had been probing him for allegedly swindling government subsidies in the weeks before his death. Rain fell in the Supreme Prosecutors' Office in Seocho-gu, Seoul, Sunday. (Yonhap)In the interview, Sung accused prominent Park officials of taking illegal funds from him in the run-up to the 2012 presidential race. They include presidential secretaries, South Gyeongsang Province Gov. Hong Joon-pyo, and Lee, among others.Authorities plan to summon past aides of Sung this week, to verify his accusations.“It is hard to tell how this case will turn out. Although we may need a lot of time considering the way the probe is going, we may encounter help along the way if we continue to exert all efforts,” an official was quoted as telling reporters on Friday.Among those aides is Park Joon-ho, an ex-Sung aide and current chief of Onyang Hot Spring Hotel, a subsidiary of Keangnam Enterprises. Prosecutors suspect Park could be withholding testimonies supporting claims that Sung gave illegal funds to LeeProsecutors will also question 52-year-old Yoon, whose given name prosecutors did not publicize. Sung claimed that Yoon had delivered 100 million won to Hong in 2011 under his orders.Hong has denied taking the money. Prosecutors will seek testimonies from another aide to Sung surnamed Han, suspected to have knowledge of the whereabouts of illegal funds at Keangnam Enterprises amounting up to 3.2 billion won. Prosecutors think the money could have been used for bribes.Sung’s accusations sparked a public uproar this month against the Park administration and the Saenuri Party, as many of their top officials are alleged to have taken billions from Sung.The unexpected scandal poses risks to the government’s ability to implement its proposed changes to South Korea’s public service pension, labor market, and initiatives aimed at encouraging entrepreneurship, as public attention sways lawmakers’ focus to the scandal.The scandal is also expected to shake the prospects for Saenuri Party candidates running in this month’s parliamentary by-elections, set to contest four seats at the National Assembly.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","party officials also back sacking ,week for allegedly accepting bribes ,park officials of taking illegal ,party leader on sunday threatened ,officials also back sacking lee","['Moon Jae - in', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Sung Woan - jong', 'the National Assembly', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Moon', 'Park', 'Lee', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Saenuri', 'Park Dae - chul', 'Lee', 'Sung', 'Keangnam Enterprises', 'the Saenuri Party', ""the Supreme Prosecutors ' Office"", 'Seoul', 'Sung', 'Park', 'South Gyeongsang Province', 'Hong Joon - pyo', 'Lee', 'Hot Spring Hotel', 'Keangnam Enterprises', 'Sung', 'LeeProsecutors', 'Yoon', 'Sung', 'Yoon', 'Hong', 'Hong', 'Sung', 'Han', 'Keangnam Enterprises', 'Sung ’s', 'Park', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Sung', 'South Korea ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'the National Assembly', 'Jeong Hunny']",4,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.16703424  0.20194244

The money saved can then be used to hire more young people.Parties at the tripartite talks exchanged views on freezing the wages of top wage earners, which can lay the foundation for creating some 800,000 new jobs for young people.On growth, the policymaker said South Korea has entered a period where mid-3 percent growth should be viewed as being good.""People should accept the fact that the rapid growth witnessed in the past will never happen in the future,"" he argued.The finance ministry has set the country's growth rate for 2015 at 3.8 percent, which is viewed by many as being too optimistic.On the other hand, he stressed that only by trying to push for reform can growth be nudged up, even just a little bit.In regards to speculations that South Korea will have to mark up interest rates if the United States takes steps to prevent the outflow of capital, Choi stressed that the two countries were facing different conditions.He said the U.S. is leading global economic growth at present, while South Korea's economy is not doing as well, so any action taken should take into account this difference. He said South Korea could move to raise rates, but it does not necessarily have to. Speaking on Seoul's membership into the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the official said a deputy minister level official has been set to represent the country's interests at the upcoming negotiations set to take place early next week in Beijing.He pointed out that China has vowed to ensure that the writing of the AIIB's Articles of Agreement will be undertaken in a transparent manner in line with global standards.

He was being investigated for corruption and embezzlement. In an interview with local newspaper Kyunghyang Shinmun shortly before his death, he claimed he was framed due to his alleged friendship with Ban.“This case has nothing to do with me. I’ve met (Sung) at official events and I knew him, but not well,” Ban said in a recent interview. “I have no interest in Korean politics, and I barely have time for it. I’m perplexed, since I’ve made this perfectly clear.”Sung has accused Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo of directing a corruption probe. He claims he and his company were unfairly targeted due to the prime minister’s concerns about a close relationship with Sung and Ban.

(Yonhap)During Thursday’s interpellation, Lee said he did not remember meeting Sung during his run for a parliamentary seat in 2013. The comment ran counter to his earlier remarks to local media that he never met him alone. When Rep. Yoo Dae-un of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy accused him of flip-flopping, he replied, “What I meant was that I have no recollection of such a meeting.” Lee said he could have been misunderstood because of his Chungcheong Province dialect.Lee’s comments came after several of Sung’s former employees and aides testified that the two had a private meeting. Prior to his death, Sung claimed that he handed Lee 30 million won ($28,000) during the supposed meeting at his campaign office two years ago. Lee had denied having a personal relationship with Sung, but after a memo surfaced showing that the two had met 23 times over the past 20 months, he said that Sung could have been one of the Saenuri Party members that he met several times a day as he was floor leader of the party.In what has been viewed as an attempt to undermine his relationship with Sung ― who was formerly a member of a President Park Geun-hye’s 2012 election committee ― Lee claimed that he did not participate in the campaign as he had blood cancer. But after a video of him urging support for Park at a rally emerged, he admitted that he participated in “two or three” rallies. Lee’s unconventional choice of words has also hurt him. He pledged Tuesday to “end his life” if any evidence of him receiving money from Sung turned up. These words sparked a cold reaction from opposition lawmakers and even some ruling party members.“I think was I too emotional when I said it, and I’ve already apologized yesterday (for the comment),” he said Thursday. Despite mounting pressure to step down, Lee maintained that he would continue to carry out his duties as the premier.The NPAD stepped up their offensive and said they could choose to push for Lee’s impeachment.“If (the prime minister) himself does not step down and the president continues to do nothing about the situation, our party has no choice but to take a more drastic decision,” NPAD leader Rep. Moon Jae-in told reporters. Under Korean law, one-third of National Assembly members have to consent to propose a premier’s dismissal, and a majority has to agree in order for it to be passed.As the graft scandal shook the political circles, the prosecution stepped up its probe into Keangnam Enterprises by raiding the company’s headquarters along with residence of 11 of Sung’s aides. They also summoned a 43-year-old confident of Sung surnamed Lee, who worked as his secretary and aide during Sung’s tenure at the National Assembly.The investigation focused on tracking the money flow that leaked from the company, which may have been used for illegal lobbying.Meanwhile, additional release of Sung’s interview with the Kyunghyang Shinmun newspaper showed that Sung believed he became the target of the prosecutorial investigation for his close relationship with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who is often considered a prospective candidate for next presidency. Sung had reportedly contacted several politicians to raise support for Ban while Ban’s brother had worked for Keangnam Enterprises.

With North Korea’s nuclear program topping the agenda, they discussed ways to shore up peace and stability in the region, as well as Seoul’s initiative to promote peace and cooperation in Northeast Asia. The consultations were arranged after Blinken’s proposal during his visit to Seoul in February. Cho is also scheduled for separate talks each with the two other diplomats. The series of meetings came as Washington steps up efforts ― or pressure ― to bring about a reconciliation between its two top regional allies whose relations have plunged to their lowest ebb amid the Shinzo Abe government’s ongoing attempts to whitewash its wartime history. While acknowledging the need to address past atrocities, a rising number of U.S. officials have been calling for South Korea and Japan to move forward for the future and work together to better counter North Korean threats and tackle other pressing regional and global issues. With the protracted strain threatening to dent practical gains and adding to the diplomatic burden, Seoul has also turned to a two-track approach under which it would strictly respond to Tokyo’s historical and territorial provocations while keeping up collaboration on mutually beneficial areas.Cho has said he would raise history issues and why they must be addressed for greater tripartite collaboration with both of his counterparts. “I’m planning to speak clearly and sternly on historical issues of Japan. Through this, we are making diplomatic efforts so that Japan will act based on the correct understanding of history,” he told reporters upon arrival at Washington airport.“At the same time, we are seeking to promote cooperation with Japan on issues where we can increase our national interests such as the North Korean nuclear issue, the economy and other exchanges.”By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","thursday in washington as seoul ,talks on thursday in washington ,korea nuclear program topping the ,foreign ministerial talks on thursday ,visit to seoul in february","['South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'South Korea ’s', 'Cho Tae - yong', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'State', 'Tony Blinken', 'japanese', 'Akitaka Saiki', 'North Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'Blinken', 'Seoul', 'Cho', 'Washington', 'Shinzo Abe', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Cho', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Washington', 'Japan', 'north korean', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43120766  0.50291818

(K-Sure) for its nonexistent exports.An investigation by the prosecution has found the false reports, along with the trade insurance from K-Sure, allowed the company to borrow some 3.4 trillion won ($3.12 billion) over a seven-year period starting in 2007.The company was declared bankrupt late last year with about 550 billion won in outstanding loans from 10 local lenders.To prevent any company from securing trade insurance or bank loans based on false or inflated trade reports, the trade insurance company will be required to check and verify the authenticity of any export deal, through on-site inspections if necessary, when the deal requires more than $1 million in insurance, according to the Ministry of Trade, Insurance and Energy.K-Sure will also be required to introduce an assessment program that can expose accounting fraud.The company is already subject to annual audits by the ministry and the national board of audit and inspection, but it will freshly be subject to inspections by the Financial Supervisory Service, which can better check the financial soundness of trade insurance extended by the company, ministry officials said.They said this may also help expose possible corruption by company officials by checking the validity of trade insurance.The prosecution investigation has concluded that a number of former K-Sure officials, as well as tax investigators, may have received financial kickbacks from Moneual in exchange for letting the company dodge any scrutiny.

South Korea was represented by Deputy Defense Minister Yoo Jeh-seung, while his counterpart was Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense David Helvey.The talks, set to run through Wednesday, are expected to focus on ways to bolster joint deterrence capabilities against missile and nuclear threats from North Korea and measures to follow up on last year's agreement to postpone the transfer of wartime operational control over South Korean forces from Washington to Seoul.South Korea also plans to seek U.S. help over its plan to launch an association of former members of U.S. Forces Korea in an effort to honor them for their service and help enhance ties between the allies. Currently, some 28,500 soldiers are stationed in South Korea to help deter the North.The two sides are unlikely to discuss the U.S. wish to deploy a THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) missile interceptor battery, which has been the hottest defense issue between the two countries in recent months due to China's outspoken opposition.Considering its sensitivity, Seoul and Washington have said that there have been no formal consultations or decision on the issue. U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter also said in Seoul last week that the U.S. is not ready to begin discussions on the issue.Other topics that could be discussed in this week's KIDD meeting include the envisioned revision to the U.S.-Japan defense cooperation guidelines, which is expected to include Japan's decision to exercise its perceived right to collective self-defense. Japan's post-war constitution specifies that its forces are purely defensive.South Korea has concerns about the possibility of Japan sending forces to the Korean Peninsula in the name of aiding the U.S. under collective self-defense in the event of a conflict with North Korea.Seoul has demanded Japan win explicit consent from Seoul if it wants to respond to contingencies on the peninsula. Japanese boots on the peninsula are one of the last things South Koreans want to see due to painful memories of Japan's colonial rule of Korea from 1910 to 1945.The defense guidelines revision is also expected to be a topic for defense talks between South Korea, the U.S. and Japan.

Lee was seeking to reenter politics through a by-election at the time after suffering from blood cancer. Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo responds to a lawmaker’s question at the National Assembly on Tuesday. (Yonhap)Lee denied the claim, reiterating that he was neither close to him nor received the money. The premier also said he would take part in the prosecution’s probe, amid opposition lawmakers demanding he step down from his post.“If any evidence that (I) received the money show up, I will end my life,” he said during an interpellation session at the National Assembly.The newspaper raised the fresh allegation by releasing a third part of the 50-minute telephone interview carried out before his apparent suicide last Thursday.“I gave him 30 million won in cash during the previous by-election,” Sung was quoted as saying. When asked if he was aware whether the money was officially submitted as campaign funds, Sung said: “What (official) report? He gobbled it up.”In an apparent effort to distance itself from Lee, the ruling Saenuri Party held an emergency meeting in the afternoon and pressed the prosecution to question the prime minister first. The party leadership, however, said they failed to reach a conclusion on whether to urge Lee to resign before he responds to the prosecution’s summons.The party also vowed that it would not protect any members on the list.“Regardless of ranks, (officials) should face stern investigation if they are accused of corruption,” said Saenuri floor leader Rep. Yoo Seung-min.Yoo said earlier in the day that the party could establish an independent counsel if the prosecution fails to satisfy the public’s demand of a transparent investigation. Lee was one of eight political heavyweights whose names were written on a memo left by the late businessman. He wrote the amount of money next to the names, except for Lee and Lee Byung-kee, the incumbent chief of staff at the presidential office. Sung was found dead on a mountain last week after facing charges of irregularities over his involvement in failed energy projects during the Lee Myung-bak administration. The businessman also accused the prime minister of directing the prosecution’s investigation into Keangnam Enterprises, suggesting the probe began a month after he delivered a public address to eradicate corruption in Korea. Sung claimed his company had been unfairly targeted. The prosecution has launched a special investigation into Sung’s testimonies, which have rattled political circles. Suspicions intensified that the people on the list, most of whom are close confidants of President Park Geun-hye, accepted money from Sung and used it to support her election campaign in 2012. The eight politicians include Park’s two former chiefs of staff ― Huh Tae-yeol and Kim Ki-choon ― as well as the current mayors of Busan and Incheon.Calls have been mounting from the main opposition party to set up an independent probe, arguing that the prosecution has failed to stay politically neutral. All the politicians on the list have said they will cooperate with the prosecution’s investigation. But critics and the opposition party argued that the prosecution won’t be free from the influences of Cheong Wa Dae, or the Prime Minister’s Office, citing the tradition of authorities reporting the investigation processes of high-profile cases to the upper offices.The presidential office maintained its earlier position, reiterating that it would wait for the prosecution’s probe.“Cheong Wa Dae has nothing to say,” said presidential spokesperson Min Kyung-wook.“The prosecution’s probe has begun and the prime minister has said that he would cooperate with the investigation.”Rep. Moon Jae-in, chairman of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, pressed the prime minister and chief of staff to step down from their posts and urged President Park to speak up.“The case of a sitting premier and chief of staff facing the prosecution’s probe as suspects is unprecedented in history,” he said. “The two have to decide on their fate before additional suspicions are raised.”South Gyeongsang Province Gov. Hong Joon-pyo, who was also on the list, denied allegations that he accepted 100 million won from Sung through a mutual friend.The former chairman of the Grand National Party, the predecessor of the Saenuri Party, wrote on his Facebook page that he had never met Sung in private, except for a meeting in Seosan in 2011 where they just exchanged greetings. Hong is one of the first to be investigated by prosecutors. He is suspected of receiving 100 million won from Sung through his former aide in 2011 while running in the party leadership race.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","koo to resign intensified tuesday ,blood cancer prime minister lee ,from blood cancer prime minister ,tuesday amid burgeoning graft scandal ,graft scandal involving deceased businessman","['Lee Wan - koo', 'Lee', 'korean', 'Kyunghyang', 'Keangnam', 'Sung Woan', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'the National Assembly', 'the National Assembly', 'Sung', 'Sung', 'Lee', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee', 'Saenuri', 'Yoo Seung - min', 'Yoo', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Lee Byung - kee', 'Sung', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Keangnam Enterprises', 'Korea', 'Sung', 'Sung ’s', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Sung', 'Park ’s', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'Dae', 'Min Kyung - wook', 'Moon Jae - in', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Gyeongsang Province', 'Hong Joon - pyo', 'the Grand National Party', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Sung', 'Seosan', 'Hong', 'Sung', 'Cho Chung - un']",13,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.40362898  0.08996004

(Yonhap)“I went to (Lee’s) campaign office (in the 2013 April by-elections) and handed the money over in person,” Sung was quoted as saying.On Tuesday, Lee repeatedly denied any illegal ties to Sung at an interpellation session in the National Assembly.“You all know that hundreds of people stop by our campaign offices during elections,” Lee said. “I do not remember each and every visitor.”As speculation escalated following the note, as well as phone records showing Lee calling a mutual acquaintance with Sung up to 15 times on the day after Sung was found dead, Lee said, “Sung and I were not as close as many of you think.”The acquaintance reportedly claimed Sung had expressed disappointment over Lee’s refusal to stop prosecutorial probes on Sung’s company, and that Lee repeatedly asked to know what Sung had said about him.Prosecutors had accused Sung of swindling government subsidies by overstating his company’s profits. But Sung claimed President Park Geun-hye’s administration was on a witch hunt against his company to shore up declining political support in the days before his death.Prosecutors declared an end to investigations on Sung after his death. But officials found a note on Sung after he died naming eight officials he had allegedly given kickbacks to, including former presidential aides, and P.M. Lee, among others.Lee’s comments so far appear to be placing him in a deeper quagmire.On Monday, Lee said he had suffered from cancer in 2012, preventing him from assisting President Park’s campaign rallies. But past photos showed Lee standing next to or around Park during rallies at Daejeon and Cheonan, South Chungcheong Province.Lee’s past record of making false statements also seems to be haunting him.In February during his confirmation hearing opposition lawmakers had accused Lee of intimidating journalists at a private luncheon. Lee claimed he did not remember the incident and continued to deny related accusations until opposition lawmakers publicized a tape recording of him making threats against reporters, saying he could get them fired using his ties to media company executives.“(The sacked reporters) won’t know what hit them,” Lee said in the recording.

He returned to South Korea in early April after wrapping up his tenure in Libya.His successor, Amb. Kim Young-chae, arrived in Libya on Monday, ministry officials said.They apologized for what they called a ""mistake"" largely attributable to a gap between the date of Lee's departure and that of Kim's inauguration.""It seems that we made a mistake since we didn't have a clear understanding of the situation,"" a senior ministry official said.He stressed that the ministry did not make the incorrect statement intentionally.Islamic militants opened fire on the guard post of the embassy, killing two local security guards and wounding another.

The resolution comes amid souring Seoul-Tokyo diplomatic relations over history and territorial issues stemming from Japan's 1910-45 colonization of the Korean Peninsula.Earlier this month, Japan approved more middle-school textbooks that claim ownership of the South Korean islets, rekindling a long-running diplomatic feud over Dokdo.""The issue of distorted and fabricated (history) textbooks will foster strife and disputes between South Korea's and Japan's future generations and in that sense we express serious concerns,"" according to the resolution.

Trading of Keangnam shares will be terminated on Wednesday as the company has failed to deal with mounting debt, according to the Korea Exchange.Keangnam leaves the local stock exchange 42 years after becoming the nation's first construction company to go public. The main bourse operator has been in the process of delisting the builder after creditors last month rejected its request for additional financial support and its attempts to go into court receivership fell through. The builder had been struggling in the red in recent years amid a prolonged slump in the local housing market, suffering annual losses of 182.7 billion won and 310.9 billion won in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Last week, its former chairman, Sung Wan-jong, committed suicide in the midst of a widening probe into his company and other state firms involved in the overseas development projects pushed during the former Lee Myung-bak administration. During Lee's years in office from 2008 to 2013, local companieslaunched expansive business projects to secure energy resources.Sung, who had served as a ruling lawmaker between 2012 and 2014, left behind a list of politicians, including close aides to President Park Geun-hye, whom he claimed to have given up to several million dollars.

Lee was one of the eight political heavyweights whose names were written on a memo left by Sung before his apparent suicide last Thursday. The late businessman, who was under prosecutorial investigation over a failed energy project implemented during the Lee Myung-bak administration, claimed that he delivered the money to them.The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy intensified the attack, urging the prime minister to step down from the post and raising speculation that he may attempt to control the prosecution’s probe. Lee defended himself, saying there would be no sacred ground in the investigation and that he was no exception. Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo (left) listens to a question at a parliamentary interpellation session at the National Assembly on Monday. (Yonhap)Saenuri Party chairman Kim Moo-sung also refuted the NPAD’s attack, saying he was willing to cooperate with the prosecution if the authorities zeroed in on campaign finances of the 2012 presidential election.The Saenuri leader affirmed that he had been in charge of the presidential election and that there were no illegal campaign funds. He retorted that the prosecution’s probe should also cover the NPAD’s finances.The burgeoning scandal also appeared to show a rift within the ruling party, with the Saenuri Party chief implying he would not hold a trilateral meeting with Prime Minister Lee and Chief of Staff Lee Byung-kee for the time being. The list included the names of the president’s two former chiefs of staff and her current one. Kim Moo-sung was not among the list. The Saenuri leader was a campaign manager in Park’s camp during the 2012 presidential election, but reportedly was not one of the pro-Park members who directly managed the party’s funds and personnel organization at the time. “I cannot raise more suspicions by meeting with the people whose names are on the list,” Kim told reporters on Monday. “I have no plans to hold (the trilateral meeting).” The ruling party leader also dismissed the possibility that he collaborated with Cheong Wa Dae before he held an emergency news conference on Sunday urging the prosecution for a thorough probe.“In a situation where Cheong Wa Dae’s chief of staff is on the list, I wasn’t able to consult on the matter with him,” he said at the news conference.Some suggested that Kim moving separately from Cheong Wa Dae reflects his plan to distance himself from the presidential office during the scandal to protect the party as well as his prominence as a presidential hopeful. Saenuri lawmakers expressed concern that the scandal would have a negative impact on the party ahead of the April 29 by-election. The election, set to fill three vacant parliamentary seats, is seen as a barometer of public sentiment, as well as a pre-test for the 2016 general election and 2017 presidential election. Speculations, meanwhile, are escalating that the Park camp used illicit and unregistered funds delivered by local businessmen for her election in exchange of favors.The Park camp notified the election watchdog that it spent 47.91 billion won ($43.48 million) for the presidential election ― 500 million won less than her rival Moon Jae-in’s camp reported. Pundits pointed out that Park’s camp may have spent massive amounts of illegal funds to micromanage both small and large electoral constituencies across the country by operating unofficial organizations there. Political parties have been widely reported to use illicit funds delivered by businessmen like Sung in order to build and manage such networks. Such practices are usually kept secret, according to local reports.Saenuri Rep. Hong Moon-jong, Busan Mayor Seo Byung-soo and Incheon Mayor Yoo Jeong-bok ― whose names were on Sung’s list ― played central roles in raising and managing funds for Park’s camp.On the memo, “200 million won” was handwritten next to Hong Moon-jong’s name. Hong served as Park‘s campaign manager in the 2012 presidential election.

Hong Joon-pyo, Incheon Mayor Yoo Jeong-bok, Saenuri lawmaker Rep. Hong Moon-jong and Busan Mayor Suh Byung-soo ― in 2011-2012 by Sung as suspected. Among the four, the first to be investigated will be Gov. Hong, the prosecution said. The four are suspected of having received the money from Sung to spend in the ruling party’s leadership race in 2011 and the 2012 presidential election campaign. Rep. Hong, in particular, managed President Park’s election campaign in 2012.Sung, the former head of local builder Keangnam Enterprises, was found dead Thursday just hours before a court was to issue an arrest warrant for his alleged involvement in a corruption scandal related to a resource development project carried out by the Lee Myung-bak administration.“We will make every effort to thoroughly investigate the case that is the subject of the nation’s widespread suspicion,” Moon told reporters Monday.The team received investigation data gathered by the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office that had been probing allegations of Keangnam’s irregularities, including Sung’s phone logs, bank accounts, and documents seized during the search of the company. The team will also check the call records of two mobile phones that Sung used until he committed suicide.Investigation will also focus on the whereabouts of 3.2 billion won in cash that had been withdrawn from Keangnam’s business account on 370 occasions between 2007 and 2014.In his suicide note, Sung listed names of eight key politicians, including the four, along with the money amounts. In the note, Gov. Hong was alleged to have received 100 million won, Yoo 300 million won, and Rep. Hong and Suh 200 million won each.Sung’s memo also included names of President Park’s former chiefs of staff Kim Ki-choon and Huh Tae-yeol, along with Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo.Local daily Kyunghyang Shinmun last week revealed a voice recording of Sung’s interview in which he argued he handed $100,000 won and 700 million won to Kim and Huh, respectively.Both of Park’s former chiefs of staff and governor Hong on Monday vowed to cooperate with the prosecution probe, while denying the allegations. “If Sung were alive, I would confront him and let the public know the truth,” Park’s former chief of staff Kim Ki-choon said in an interview with a local radio station on Monday. He said all the claims were “fictional.”“But since that is not an option, I feel rather perplexed.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","businessman to four political heavyweights ,suicide last thursday eight political ,deceased businessman to four political ,thursday eight political heavy hitters ,2012 presidential election campaign rep","['Sung Woan - jong', 'Park Geun', 'Sung', 'Daejeon ’s', 'Moon Moo - il', 'South Gyeongsang', 'Hong Joon - pyo', 'Yoo Jeong - bok', 'Saenuri', 'Hong Moon', 'Busan Mayor Suh Byung', 'Sung', 'Hong', 'Hong', 'Keangnam Enterprises', 'the Lee Myung - bak', 'Moon', 'the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Keangnam ’s', 'Sung ’s', 'Sung', 'Keangnam ’s', 'Sung', 'Hong', 'Hong', 'Suh', 'Sung ’s', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Kyunghyang Shinmun', 'Sung ’s', 'Kim', 'Hong', 'Sung', 'Park ’s', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'Claire Lee']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.21787645  0.44442701

Bae scored two birdies and an eagle, along with three bogeys, and finished tied for 33rd with four others.Noh Seung-yul, in his first Masters, finished one worse than Bae at one-over 289. His final round was an even more of a roller coaster, with six birdies, four bogeys and one triple bogey for a 73. He ended in an eight-way tie for 38th.Bae finished the 2012 tournament at four-over 292 and missed the cut last year. He also called a penalty on himself on the par-4 seventh when the ball slightly moved on the green as he was getting ready to take his putt. Assessed a penalty stroke, Bae left the hole with a bogey.Bae somewhat salvaged his day with an eagle on the par-4 14th.With 165 yards to the pin, Bae struck an eight iron that landed on the back of the green and spun into the cub for his fifth career eagle at Augusta National. Bae said afterward this year's Masters was a major learning experience.""I prepared hard, but I now realize I have to work even harder,"" he said. ""I didn't putt as well as I wanted to on all four days.""Noh's day could have been better if not for the triple bogey on the par-5 13th.

""My swing is getting better now, and I hope to improve my short game.""Jordan Spieth completed a wire-to-wire victory with a round of 70 on Sunday. At 18-under 270, the 21-year-old tied the Masters scoring record, established by Tiger Woods in 1997, for his first major championship.Spieth became the first golfer to reach 19-under at any point during a Masters with a birdie on the par-5 15th but bogeyed the par-4 18th to finish one shy of a record.Phil Mickelson and Justin Rose tied for second at 14-under.

The team will be headed by Daejeon’s chief prosecutor Moon Moo-il under the supervision of chief prosecutor Kim, they added. The team will officially begin the probe on Monday.  Saenuri Party leader Kim Moo-sungThe move came shortly after Saenuri Party chairman Kim Moo-sung urged a “swift and thorough” investigation into Sung’s memo implicating Park’s closest aides in the bribery scandals.“The ideal thing right now is for the prosecutors to conduct a swift investigation into the matter to discover the truth, and they should leave no stone unturned,” Kim said in an emergency press conference at the party’s headquarters. “We do not have the slightest intention to protect (the accused) from the probe.”Sung, the former head of Keangnam Enterprises, was found dead Thursday in an apparent suicide, just hours before a local court was to issue an arrest warrant for embezzlement and his alleged involvement in a corruption scandal related to a resources development project by the previous Lee Myung-bak administration. He was carrying a memo that had the names of eight political heavyweights, including Park’s former chiefs of staff Kim Ki-choon and Huh Tae-yeol, along with the incumbent prime minister and Saenuri lawmaker Lee Wan-koo. On Friday, the local daily Kyunghyang Shinmun revealed a recording of Sung’s interview in which he claimed that he handed $100,000 and 700 million won ($639,970) to Kim and Huh, respectively, in line with the content of the memo. Later in the day, the daily disclosed another recording of Sung saying he handed Saenuri Rep. Hong Moon-jong, who managed President Park’s election campaign, 200 million won to be used during the campaign.“The memo written by the deceased is casting doubts upon entire political circles, hindering the entire government affairs,” said Saenuri chief Kim. “Any attempts to cover up irregularities can only spark further suspicion. The Saenuri Party will make sure no outside influence will sway the prosecution’s investigation.”He said he did not discuss the content of the press conference with the president, explaining such consultation would be inappropriate since her aides’ names are included in what has been dubbed the “Sung Woan-jong list.” Kim also revealed that Sung called him just days before his death to plead innocence. But the ruling party leader ― whose name was not included in Sung’s list ― also said he did not recognize the phone number of Sung, the businessman who was a Saenuri lawmaker until 2014. All eight politicians whose names were on Sung’s list had claimed they did not have a close relationship with the deceased and denied ever receiving money. Rep. Hong held a press conference Saturday and vowed to retire from politics if he “had received even a penny” from Sung.Despite the ruling party feverishly attempting put distance between Sung and themselves, the revelation is likely to affect the upcoming by-election slated for April 29. Kim admitted there is “no question” that the incident spells bad news for the ruling party.Moon Jae-in, the leader of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, denounced the incident as an “unprecedented corruption case in which the president’s aides have been revealed to have received huge bribes.”“The people whose names appeared on the list must lay down their positions and ranks and cooperate willingly with the investigation,” he said, adding that the probe is likely to be hindered as the people accused of corruption are all high-ranking officials. The bribery scandal is expected to be high on the agenda of the four-day interpellation session that will open in the National Assembly tomorrow, along with government-proposed pension reform, possible deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, and salvaging the sunken Sewol ferry.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","an arrest warrant for embezzlement ,ranking officials the bribery scandal ,prosecution sunday launched an investigation ,aides in the bribery scandals ,arrest warrant for embezzlement","['Sung Woan - jong', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Kim Jin - tae', 'Daejeon ’s', 'Moon Moo - il', 'Kim', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sungThe', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Sung ’s', 'Park ’s', 'Kim', 'Keangnam Enterprises', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Park ’s', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'Saenuri', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Kyunghyang Shinmun', 'Sung ’s', 'Kim', 'Sung', 'Saenuri', 'Hong Moon - jong', 'Saenuri', 'Kim', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Kim', 'Sung', 'Sung ’s', 'Sung', 'Saenuri', 'Sung ’s', 'Hong', 'Sung', 'Sung', 'Kim', 'Moon Jae - in', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'the National Assembly', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'Yoon Min - sik']",13,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.26281786  0.23094584

Authorities launched a special investigation team Sunday to probe the bribery allegations into the political heavyweights, most of whom are regarded as pro-Park figures. Later in the afternoon, the president, in a statement released by her spokesperson, urged the prosecution to “sternly deal with the case without sanctuary in accordance with the rule of law and principle.” Observers say the investigation into the memo, as well as the full script of the phone interview still unreleased by the Kyunghyang Shinmun, will likely have massive political repercussions and could possibly tarnish Park’s image as a clean leader.This image is a strong weapon that has given her an implicit political cause to drive massive reform efforts so far. The president has been pushing ahead with overhauling four sectors ― labor, education, public offices and finance ― by calling them “a must” for the country’s economic revitalization. However, the scandal could hold back Park’s reform drive as it centers on her long-time political aides ― those who played pivotal roles in elections that Park ran before becoming the president. According to the newspaper, Sung said he gave about $100,000 to Kim Ki-choon in 2006 and 700 million ($640,000) to Huh Tae-yeol in 2007, when Park ran in the presidential primary held by the Grand National Party, the predecessor of the ruling Saenuri Party. Both Kim and Huh served as chiefs of staff for the Park administration. The memo also includes the incumbent chief of staff Lee Byung-kee. All of the officials have denied the allegations.Some also suggest that the scandal could put her into early lameduck status, as the attention could shift to the general election to be held next year and also the presidential election in the following year.The scandal comes at a time when Park is looking to stabilize her leadership and draw attention to her sales diplomacy to Latin America. She will tour Brazil and three other South American countries from Thursday for 12 days. Political pundits say the possibility is high for Park to speak out on the bribery scandal to quell angry sentiments before she leaves for Latin America. She could urge the prosecution for a thorough investigation, while stressing that she has remained clean from corruption and bribery attempts.Since last year, Park has been struggling to restore public confidence over criticism about her government’s botched rescue missions as well as her response, which was seen as lacking sincerity. A series of political scandals involving conflicting groups of aides, as well as the government’s inconsistent policies on tax and health insurance, have also damaged her credibility. Presidential documents were leaked to the media late last year raising speculation over lax discipline within Cheong Wa Dae. Park also came under fire after she refused to abandon her aides who were involved in a related influence-peddling scandal. Her popularity plummeted to below 30 percent early this year.Her approval rating bounced back to the 40 percent mark in the first week of April as she tried to break away from her image as an uncommunicative leader by appearing at a series of public events in recent months.

That was for the election,"" he told Kyunghyang. The daily belatedly made public part of the phone interview.   Asked if the money was properly handled in accordance with concerned accounting law, Sung said he ""does not think so.""   Sung also said he delivered 100 million won to Gov. Hong Joon-pyo of South Gyeongsang Province in 2011 through one of his close aides when Hong ran for the ruling party chief.   If found true, the two are subject to punishment for violating the political fund law as the statute of limitation in this case is seven years.   On Saturday, Hong flatly denied the allegation, saying that he would ""quit politics if I took even a penny from him.""    The governor also said he had no idea why he was named in Sung's handwritten memo.   Other people listed in the memo also dismiss the allegations.   Kim Moo-sung, the ruling party chief, said he cannot comment on the list at a time when there are only allegations, which have never been confirmed.   Sung, a construction tycoon and former lawmaker, was a major target of the ongoing investigation into the country's overseas resources development projects pushed by the former Lee Myung-bak government.    He is suspected of taking 80 billion won in government loans by exaggerating the amount of profit his company was expected to make on an investment in an oil exploration project in Russia. He allegedly used part of the funds to create a slush fund worth 25 billion won.   ""We are checking if the memo was written by Sung himself and analyzing two cellphones he used,"" an investigator said.

The list, apparently written by the late Sung Woan-jong, includes two former chief presidential secretaries and the incumbent prime minister.Local daily The Kyunghyang Shinmun reported earlier Friday that Sung, former chief of a construction company facing an irregularities probe, claimed to have given money to two of President Park Geun-hye’s former chiefs of staff in a telephone interview just hours before his apparent suicide. Police found Sung dead on a mountain in Seoul on Thursday.According to the newspaper, Sung said he gave about $100,000 to Kim Ki-choon in 2006 and 700 million won ($640,000) to Huh Tae-yeol in 2007, when Park unsuccessfully ran in the Grand National Party’s presidential primary. The GNP is the forerunner of the governing Saenuri Party. Former Cheong Wa Dae Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon on a trip to Belgium in 2006. The late Sung Woan-jong accused Kim of receiving $100,000 from him just before this trip. Police found Sung dead Thursday in an apparent suicide. Prosecutors had been probing Sung for allegedly swindling government funds. (Yonhap)Kim served as chief of staff from 2013 to early this year, while Huh was Park’s first chief presidential secretary in 2013.They denied the claims.“Although I express my deepest regret over (Sung’s) death, the accusation is an absurd lie that has no grounds whatsoever,” Kim said in a statement released through Cheong Wa Dae.Huh also said that “such money trade is unimaginable” as then-candidate Park stressed the need for a “clean primary.”In a note found with his body, Sung also listed Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo, Incheon Mayor Yoo Jeong-bok, South Gyeongsang Province Gov. Hong Joon-pyo, current Presidential Chief of Staff Lee Byung-kee and “the mayor of Busan.”Prosecutors are examining the handwriting to ensure Sung wrote the note.Prime Minister Lee said he had no connection to Sung, while incumbent Busan Mayor Suh Byung-soo called the allegation “baseless.”The Saenuri Party went into an uproar after the prosecutors disclosed the list, with the party leadership planning an emergency meeting but canceling at the last minute.“It is our position that the truth must be clarified first. ... . It is difficult to make any official statement when no facts have been clarified,” party spokesman Rep. Kim Young-woo said.The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy called the accusations proof of “the Park administration’s largest political scandal.”While some demanded a special probe into the new allegations, others took a more cautious approach. They cited the difficulty in unraveling the truth as Sung was dead.Sung’s claims are nonetheless expected to hinder the Park administration’s recent anticorruption drive as its top officials are linked to the allegations. The accusations are also expected to affect the by-elections this month as many of the accused are members of the Saenuri Party.Prosecutors have been probing firms linked to influence-peddling allegations during the administration of Park’s predecessor, Lee Myung-bak. Prosecutors suspected Lee officials of giving firms favorable financial treatment, including Sung’s company Keangnam Enterprises.Prosecutors had planned to detain Sung on the day of his death, pending a court’s approval. Sung had denied his charges.In his Thursday interview published on The Kyunghyang Shinmun’s website at noon Friday, Sung claimed he had given the money in good faith to Kim and Huh.“I helped Park’s campaign team a lot in 2007,” he said.“Those funds were given with an implicit trust, you know, that we would be helping each other out,” Sung added. Sung’s allegations could have some impact on the by-elections later this month depending on how the investigations unfold, experts said.“The names are big enough to have some impact,” said Yoon Pyung-joong, professor at Hanshin University, noting that the incumbent prime minister and former presidential chiefs of staff were among those accused of receiving money.“But we will have to wait for the dust to settle to see how big the impact will be on the elections.”Yang Seung-ham of Yonsei University said many aspects of Sung’s accusations remained murky, as they also need to figure out how the money was spent, and if they were actually given to the aides.“The list could damage the credentials of the Saenuri Party candidates in the elections … but we’re going to have to wait and see,” Yang added.By Jeong Hunny hj257@heraldcorp.com)","police found sung dead thursday ,political funds from deceased businessman ,charges in his thursday interview ,suicide police found sung dead ,trip police found sung dead","['Sung Woan - jong', 'Sung', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Sung', 'Seoul', 'Sung', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'Park', 'the Grand National Party ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'Cheong', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'Belgium', 'Sung Woan - jong', 'Kim', 'Sung', 'Sung', 'Sung ’s', 'Kim', 'Sung', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Incheon', 'Yoo Jeong - bok', 'South Gyeongsang Province', 'Hong Joon - pyo', 'Lee Byung - kee', 'Busan', 'Sung', 'Lee', 'Sung', 'Busan Mayor', 'Suh Byung', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Young', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Park', 'Sung', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Park', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Lee', 'Sung ’s', 'Keangnam Enterprises', 'Sung', 'Sung', 'Sung', 'Kim', 'Park ’s', 'Sung', 'Sung ’s', 'Yoon Pyung - joong', 'Hanshin University', 'Seung - ham', 'Yonsei University', 'Sung ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'Yang', 'Jeong Hunny']",13,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.03731564 0.21778212 0.09068666]

The party will soon begin talks with the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy as the implementation of the new nomination system requires a legal revision.Calls have been mounting from both parties to allow more rank-and-file party members and ordinary voters to participate in the process of nominating candidates, as part of political reform to guarantee more transparent nomination process and to give more opportunities for newcomers.“The only way to restore public trust and eradicate irregularities in political circles is to establish party democracy,” Saenuri chairman Kim Moo-sung was quoted as saying by lawmakers who attended the meeting. “The party democracy begins with returning the nomination rights to the people,” he said.The plan, however, is expected to continue to face resistance from within and outside the party.The scheme has been pushed by the leaders of the rival parties, but their proposal has drawn mixed views.Proponents say the new system would reflect a wide range of voter sentiment and help resolve feuds between party groups wanting to secure more nominations ahead of elections. Opponents, however, raised concerns that the new measure would limit parties’ election strategies and that it may protect the vested interests of incumbent lawmakers and other elected officials.The system, though in a limited way, was tried in previous elections. But parties have so far failed to adopt the system on a full scale.According to the rules suggested by the Saenuri Party, the open primaries will be held on the first Saturday, 60 days before the elections. Candidates seeking nomination through open primaries should also register themselves a year before the election from the current rule of 120 days in advance.

Lawmakers from the ruling and the main opposition party are also expected to intensify attacks on each other ahead of the by-elections scheduled later this month, as the event is seen as a barometer of public sentiment.The ruling Saenuri Party has set its priority on passing a bill aimed at overhauling the current pension system for public officials, a plan proposed by President Park Geun-hye to reduce the hefty financial burden on future generations. The plan, however, has been facing vehement resistance from the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy. The NPAD has been taking sides with public servants, lashing out at the government and the ruling party for failing to convince officials to endorse the plan that forces them to increase their contribution and receive less by the time they retire. Supreme Court judge nominee Park Sang-ok attends a hearing at the National Assembly on Tuesday. (Yonhap)“The (Saenuri) party has been threatening to pass the bill within a deadline, without putting efforts to persuade public servants,” said NPAD Rep. Seo Young-kyo.Lawmakers engaged in a war of nerves on the first day of the extraordinary session as they held a controversial confirmation hearing on Park Sang-ok, a nominee for Supreme Court judge.NPAD lawmakers pressed Park during the grilling session to withdraw his nomination, saying the former prosecutor was unqualified to represent the top court. The hearing was held after more than two months of political wrangling over the candidate’s alleged ethical misdeeds.The opposition lawmakers had refused to hold the session citing his role in the 1987 investigation of police officers accused of torturing a student activist to death. The prosecution had come under fire after a revelation by Catholic priests that there were more police officers involved in the torture than those it had indicted. The NPAD has claimed that the justice nominee was responsible for the cover-up and urged him to voluntarily withdraw his nomination.Park expressed regret to the family of the student activist, but said he was not aware of the police’s attempt to whitewash the incident at the time.“I want to deliver words of consolation (to the victim’s family) and blame myself that I had no power at that time to identify (the cover-up),” he told lawmakers at the grilling session.The rival parties agreed to continue the parliamentary probe into resource diplomacy until early next month. The probe has hit a stumbling block as parties failed to agree on the witnesses to be called for the parliamentary hearing since late last month.The NPAD called on former President Lee Myung-bak, and his older brother Lee Sang-deuk, Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan who was then energy minister, former Vice Energy Minister Park Young-june and Energy Minister Yoon Sang-jick to appear as witnesses.The Saenuri Party rejected the demand and in turn urged NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in, former chief of staff at the presidential office during the Roh Moo-hyun administration, to appear as a witness. The opposition party is also expected to escalate its criticism against the ruling party over the government’s botched response for the Sewol crisis. April 16 marks the first anniversary of the tragic accident that left more than 300 killed last year. Some of the victims’ families have demanded that the government scrap its ordinances drafted for the Sewol special bill that passed late last year. They claimed the ordinances would hurt the neutrality of a planned probe into the government’s rescue operation during the ferry disaster. The Maritime Ministry has proposed to include a number of its officials on the investigative team.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","torturing student activist to death ,months of political wrangling over ,session that kicked off tuesday ,tragedy lawmakers from the ruling ,student activist to death the","['the National Assembly ’s', 'Sewol', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Supreme Court', 'Park Sang - ok', 'the National Assembly', 'Saenuri', 'Seo Young - kyo', 'Park Sang - ok', 'Supreme Court', 'NPAD', 'Park', 'catholic', 'NPAD', 'NPAD', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Lee Sang - deuk', 'Finance', 'Choi Kyung - hwan', 'Park Young', 'Energy', 'Yoon Sang - jick', 'the Saenuri Party', 'NPAD', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'the Maritime Ministry', 'Cho Chung - un']",14,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.14856559  0.36536518

There were some 13.61 million people that made less than the key amount last year. The government added that on average these people paid 30,000 won less as a result of the tax code change.  Despite such claims, civic groups and the media reports argued there were many people slapped with more taxes.  The official said that the follow-up changes, which will be applied retroactively once lawmakers pass the related bill, will cut the tax burden for 5.41 million people by 422.7 billion won, or roughly 80,000 won per person. The ruling Saenuri Party said it plans to pass the bill this month, which will allow refund payments to be made in May.  ""The move will put to right any unplanned gains in taxes,"" he said.  Moon said 2.02 million people, or 98.5 percent of those whose tax burden did rise despite earning less than 55 million won, will be given refunds that will nullify any gains, while the remaining 27,000 will pay only marginally more.  Despite early condemnation, a detailed analysis of all 16.19 million people who were subject to tax refunds, showed the government's initial assessment was mostly on the mark, according to the ministry.  Related to the findings, Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan told lawmakers earlier in the day that of those making less than 55 million won, 85 percent were not subject to any tax increases, with most of the gains only happening among people making more.  ""Most people who paid more taxes were those living alone, families with three or more kids or households that had newborns last year,"" Choi said.  The finance ministry said some people paid more because the tax refunds given to one-person households and families with many children were cut. It said this oversight occurred because when the tax code was being written, officials based their assessment on average households and did not check special cases closely.

The discussions focused on the issue of the labor market’s dual structure ― the huge gap between full-time regular employees and nonregular workers ― pending topics like wages, working hours and retirement, the issue of partnership among tripartite partners, and other policy and institutional improvements. Kim Dae-hwan (center), chairman of the government-labor-management committee for labor reforms, preside over the plenary meeting at the Seoul Government Complex in central Seoul on March 30. (Yonhap)In particular, in light of the importance and urgency of the pending issues such as the reduction of working hours and ordinary wages ― whether to include regularly-paid bonuses in ordinary wage calculations ― they agreed to come up with “principles and direction for a solution of the pending issues and labor market structure improvement.” Details are expected to be arranged in the first half of the year.The trilateral meetings reportedly reached some agreement, especially on ordinary wages, plans to reduce working hours and an extension of the retirement age. However, labor unions strongly resisted a government proposal to grant employers more discretion in firing underperforming regular workers. News reports also suggested that management opposed the labor groups’ suggestion to force them to give nonregular workers regular status if their work is similar to that of regular workers.The presidential office took the unusual step of reminding the panel to find common ground, stressing “it is necessary for the nation’s economic growth and future generations.”The overhaul of the labor market is one of the reform measures President Park Gyeun-hye is pushing as part of her three-year economic revitalization plan. She has argued that labor reform is key to job creation.To increase labor market flexibility, the government and management have urged labor groups to accept the idea of lifting some labor regulations for employers so they can replace underperforming workers. But labor groups oppose the idea, saying it would eventually allow businesses to seek massive lay-offs and pressure poorly performing workers to accept salary reductions. The idea is intended to force regular workers out and replace them with nonregular workers, which would lower the overall quality of jobs, they claim.Given the continued mistrust between the concerned parties, it is unlikely that they will reach an agreement anytime soon. Unions have even threatened a general strike if the government and management push for reforms without consent from workers.Therefore it may be prudent to take a look at Korea’s labor market from a historical perspective, before we analyze what, exactly, are some of the current problems.Seeing eye-to-eyeSince the 1960s, Korea has achieved remarkable economic growth, mainly due to cheap labor and diligent and skilled workers. Labor policies during this period were intended to guarantee the basic livelihood of workers and provide sufficient workers for industrial development. But it was not until the mid-1970s that the government recognized the importance of labor issues.Until then, industrial relations were not viewed as a major social and economic issue, but in the following years, when the country’s labor market saturated, the problem of working conditions replaced that of job creation as the central social and economic focus. Many fierce labor disputes erupted, which resulted in severe government crackdowns.In the early 1980s, workers’ awareness of their rights became widespread, especially with regard to claiming their fair share of the fruits of the economic growth achieved in the past two decades. However, the government cracked down on the labor movement. As a result, in spite of the marked increase in the number of workers from 1980 to 1987 and the growing awareness of their rights, the number of unionized workers remained at around 1 million.With rapid democratization in 1987, Korea underwent significant changes in its labor movement. A number of new labor unions were formed, and many businesses saw a dramatic increase in disputes.The shortage of manual workers in the construction and manufacturing sectors became acute as workers became less willing to take on difficult, dirty and dangerous jobs.Labor was no longer cheap, as wages rapidly increased. These changes forced the nation to transform from a labor-intensive economy a more technology-based one.The labor policy underwent dramatic changes through the reduction of government intervention based on the principle of labor-management autonomy and the revision of labor-related laws to meet international standards.The government also made efforts to actively promote the interests of workers with the institutionalization of the minimum wage system, the reduction of working hours and the abolition of legal restrictions on strikes.Trade unions called for the introduction of new labor laws in the early 1990s to ensure that job seekers received appropriate vocational training to meet the demand for new skills generated by structural changes in companies. When the nation was hit by the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the urgent need to reform both the social and economic sectors was recognized.While making continuous efforts to reach a consensus on major labor issues, the government revised labor laws to meet international standards in 1997 with the founding of the Labor-Management Relations Reform Committee, thereby achieving remarkable improvements in the area of basic labor rights. However, it had its own side effects.The Tripartite Commission was formed as the need to draw a national consensus for the sake of overcoming the economic crisis became clear after Korea had to introduce reforms after being bailed out by the International Monetary Fund. A historic consensus was reached among labor, management and the government over structural reforms and burden-sharing in February 1998. On the basis of this consensus, many businesses could implement corporate restructuring measures, including employment adjustments and pay freezes.Since 2000, there have been both legislative reforms such as shortening working hours, enacting the Law on Nonregular Works, and structural reforms such as the spread of industry-level unions and the expansion of labor’s political activities.Thanks to such efforts, the economy rebounded quickly. Industrial relations, however, worsened as expectations ran high and more structural reforms got underway. The number of factors that contributed to labor-management conflicts, such as lay-offs, a decrease in new hiring, a larger number of nonregular workers, a widening gap between labor and management positions on wage hikes, compensation and provisional seizure claims against strikers etc., has been on the rise, in line with worsening economic conditions.Experts have pointed out that despite this, when comparing Korea’s labor standards and regulations to those of advanced economies, it is important to keep in mind that the core labor standards have developed through an evolutionary process over more than a century, and it has been less than 30 years since the democratic movement in 1987 began to free Korea from its long past of oppression and autocratic control. It can be safely said that Korea’s labor movement is still in a transitional period, in which the labor structure is slowly converging with global labor culture and practices.Trade unionsTrade unions in Korea are broadly divided into three organizational types: enterprise-level trade unions, federations of trade unions and nationwide federations of trade unions. There are 42 federations of enterprise-level unions and two nationwide federations.The Federation of Korean Trade Unions was formed in 1961 after a military coup, and the dissolution of the General Federation of Korean Trade Unions and its affiliates. It was placed under the guidance of the military authorities and was the sole legal trade union center in Korea until the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions was recognized in November 1999. Of the two, the KCTU is generally considered to be more militant.As of the end of 2013 ― the latest available government estimates ― the number of unionized workers in Korea was 1.848 million, up 66,000 from the previous year. The unionization rate was 10.3 percent, meaning that 1 in 10 Korean workers is a member of a trade union. According to a report on trade unions published by the Ministry of Employment and Labor, Korea’s unionization rate fell from 19.8 percent in 1989, and declined to single digits (9.8 percent) for the first time in 2010. In 2011, the figure bounced back to 10.1 percent, due to the law allowing multiple unions to operate within one company, and has stayed around 10.3 percent for the past few years.Segmenting the number of unionized workers by umbrella organizations shows that the FKTU had the largest membership of 819,755 members (44.4 percent); the KCTU had 626,035 members (20.7 percent); the Korean Labor Unions Confederation had 22,221 members (1.1 percent); and the remaining 381,575 workers (20.7 percent) belonged to independent trade unions. The number of members climbed by 11,000 (1.4 percent) for the FKTU; by 21,000 (3.5 percent) for the KCTU; by 2,000 (12.9 percent) for the KLUC; and by 32,000 (9 percent) for independent unions.At end-December 2014, it was announced that the FKTU and the KLUC would merge. They claimed that the decision to reconstitute as a single organization was “to eliminate unnecessary conflict between labor organizations, make themselves more reliable for the public, and play a bigger role in social issues based on a higher unionization rate.”As a result of the merger, the FKTU will take on 15,000 government workers belonging to the KLUC to reach 960,000 members.The number of independent unions, meanwhile, went up eightfold, compared with 2003, perhaps due to a new tendency emerging among workers to pursue practical interests, instead of politically-charged labor movements, the report noted.According to sectorial classification, private sector labor unionization is 9.1 percent, the government employee unionization rate is 63.5 percent, and the educational worker unionization rate is 16.8 percent.It is important to mention that the ESDC has been seriously disrupted by the KCTU’s struggles against the government and the withdrawal of the FKTU. However, in mid-August 2014, the FKTU returned to the ESDC and the urgent labor issues of ordinary wages, working hour reductions and the retirement age are currently under discussion.Labor relations As per the latest available figures, in 2014 there were over 100 labor disputes and 551,305 lost working days. Given the stalemate in the ESDC talks, one can only expect the conflict between labor and management to degenerate this year.For that matter, according to a recent survey of 306 companies by the Korea Employer’s Federation, 63.1 percent of respondents said “industrial relations will worsen in 2015 than last year.” Being more specific, 11.4 percent of companies responded that “industrial relations will worsen much,” “industrial relations will worsen a little” (51.7 percent), “similar to last year” (33.5 percent), and “more stable” (3.4 percent). The most common answer from companies was “industrial relations will worsen” due to conflicts surrounding industrial relations regarding ordinary wages, the reduction of working hours, and in-house subcontracts and partner firms (outsourcing).The major risk factor in industrial relations in 2015 are legal conflicts surrounding pending industrial relations issues, conflicts over the improvement of the wage system, and the improvement of labor related law and systems.The companies which projected unstable industrial relations in 2015 pointed out legal conflicts surrounding pending industrial relations issues, conflicts over the improvement of the wage system, and the improvement of labor-related law, and systems. In particular, companies viewed the expansion of legal conflicts surrounding pending industrial relations issues as the biggest risk factor since the burden on companies increased due to lawsuits regarding ordinary wages on industrial sites, ruling on additional payments for holiday work, and ruling on the violation of illegal dispatches.Companies projected that the major issues in the 2015 wage negotiation and collective bargaining would be wage increases, extended scope of ordinary wages, welfare expansion and employment security like prohibiting reconstruction. In particular, it is presumed that many companies would carry out only wage negotiations and trade unions would focus on demanding wage hikes and welfare expansion that are the major interests of union members.Moreover, the government announced its Comprehensive Measures for Nonregular Workers in 2014, stating its intention to work on structural reform of the labor market ― enhancing flexibility within the labor market and reforming wage systems.Furthermore, discussions on changes to labor law and regulations will not be easy since labor is strongly opposed to the government’s policies in this area. Conflict between the government and labor may well intensify as the government plans structural adjustments to public institutions and public pensions. Under these circumstances, collective bargaining this year is likely to be difficult.Issues on handOn Dec. 29, the government submitted comprehensive plans for nonregular workers to the ESDC aimed at eliminating the abuse of and discrimination against nonregular workers, and narrowing the gap in terms of working conditions between regular and nonregular workers. To achieve these goals, the plans focus on reducing the differences between workers of different status, enhancing job security, and improving regulations for the labor market.As of end-2014, the number of nonregular workers was about 32.4 percent of the total paid workforce, a 53.5 percent of female workers. The percentage of nonregular workers among workers aged 60 or older was 68.7 percent.The government has proposed a measure to amend the fixed-term work act and the temporary agency work act so that employees of either status aged 35 years or older can, if they want, work for the same company for up to four years, as opposed to the current two. Also, it would become much easier for workers to be eligible for severance pay. It wants to make employees eligible to receive severance pay if they work for a company for three months or longer, as opposed to the current one year or longer, so 1.95 million workers are expected to benefit from this relaxation in requirements. In addition, the government recommended that employees should be able to receive a transition benefit worth 10 percent of their wage for the two-year period of extended service, along with severance pay if they fail to become regular workers after the extension.So far, temporary agency work has been permitted in 32 business categories, and such work is now allowed for those aged 55 years or older, and for highly paid professionals as well. The Labor Ministry said it would take measures to rationalize the regulations on temporary agency work following discussions with the ESDC. The ministry will also allow six special types of worker to be covered by work injury and employment insurance.The requirements for layoffs will become more specific, making it easier for businesses to dismiss underperforming regular workers, and the layoff process will become more demanding, requiring companies to hire people for positions that were lost due to financial difficulties. The government will formulate “Layoff Guidelines,” which will specify what efforts companies should make before dismissing underperformers, such as assigning them to different positions. Currently, nonregular workers have to appeal to the Labor Relations Commission as individuals if they believe they have been discriminated against in terms of wages or welfare benefits, but they will be able to use a trade union to appeal on their behalf. Businesses will be prohibited from the practice of paying only 90 percent of the full salary for menial workers, such as convenience store clerks or gas station workers, for a training period, which is usually three months. Also, for those whose performance is closely linked to human safety, such as captains or chief engineers on cruisers, train engineers, airport controllers and airplane pilots, nonregular work will not be allowed as a matter of principle.However, both business and labor communities have expressed their concerns about the “side effects” of the government plans.The corporate sector has argued that “The government plans will expand the scope of nonregular workers too much, and have focused on strengthening regulations relating to the use of nonregular workers, ignoring the real situations of employers and of the labor market. The plans will put significant burdens on business operations.” In an official statement, the KEF noted that the reforms “disregarded the circumstances of corporates that are the main agents for job creation and the reality of the labor market. It is deeply concerning that these opinions are written in a way that it mainly represents the labor stance on important issues that possibly influence decisions on directions for the Korean labor market.”The barriers to labor market entry should be lowered in order to create jobs and improve the dual structure of the labor market, it said. However, the current policy will “strengthen the vested rights of workers who are already in the labor market.”Major causes for polarization of the labor market are the overprotection of regular employment and the excessive hike of wages based on a seniority-based wage system. Therefore, it is almost impossible to expect an improvement of vulnerable workers’ labor conditions unless these issues are solved in the first place.However, these new regulations may shift the burden to companies by disregarding the improvement of reasonable human resource management such as resolving the current overprotection of regular employment and alleviating requirements for changing working conditions.Also, it is not appropriate to intensify the burden through introducing such systems as living wages and market wage prices at a time when minimum wage stability is urgent, since minimum wages surged rapidly after 2000.Trade unions point out that “The government is seeking to massively increase the number of nonregular workers by extending how long companies can hire a nonregular worker for a position, by introducing a new status of ‘semiregular worker,’ which falls between regular and nonregular workers, and by allowing temporary agency workers aged 55 years or older in more business categories.”Kim Dong-man, president of the FKTU, which is negotiating in the trilateral commission, stressed, “The government is pushing ahead with full-scale strategies for labor flexibility without making an effort to reach an agreement among social partners. We have no option but to stop social dialogue if the government continues to do so. The unilateral plan will be faced with strong protest by the FKTU and we are ready to stage a general strike.”He went on to say, “We are demanding the government drastically change the economic structure and policy directions for the achievement of income-led growth. To this end, we will step up our efforts for the alleviation of discrimination against precarious workers, the eradication of unfair subcontracting practices and the achievement of fair taxation.”It now remains to be seen whether the government can get labor groups and management on the same page in the near future, so the Park administration can focus on economic revitalization. The next few weeks are surely going to be very dramatic.

He allegedly used part of the funds to create a slush fund worth 25 billion won.  Sung also faces charges of accounting fraud worth 950 billion won from 2008 to 2013, the duration of President Lee's term.  He allegedly exploited the little-strings-attached loan policy pushed by then President Lee, who encouraged private investment in overseas resource projects. The purpose of the energy diplomacy initiative was to lower the cost of imported oil, which makes up more than 95 percent of South Korea's total energy resources. Critics, however, say the project wasted taxpayer money and reaped disappointing results.  A hearing is due Wednesday to determine the legitimacy of the warrant.

Nearly 160 others have been indicted without detention, and more than 100 people remain at large, they added.South Korea offers cheap housing loans to low-income people, with the state-run Korea Housing Finance Corp. offering bailout funds that cover most of them. Those who are eligible are simply required to submit proof of employment to local banks.Prosecutors believe the suspects created a paper company and employed those in need of cash, including the homeless, to fabricate their employment certificates and then divided the loans among ring members depending on the roles they played.The ring members abused the fact that banks rarely verify these certificates for factual accuracy since the government guarantees at least 90 percent of the money is returned, prosecutors said.Prosecutors believe there could be others who committed similar frauds since the Korea Housing Finance Corp. paid out more than 200 billion won last year.Prosecutors also said they will ask the land ministry and the Korea Housing Finance Corp. to overhaul their policy to prevent similar scams.

In the fall of 2013, the Education Ministry ordered all eight local publishers to revise descriptions that they deemed were inaccurate or ideologically biased. These descriptions mainly concerned North Korea’s political philosophy of “juche,” Pyongyang’s sinking of the South Korean corvette Cheonan, the former South Korean president Park Chung-hee and the 1950-53 Korean War.But the authors of seven publishers claimed the government move was an attempt to cover up flaws in a textbook by Kyohak Publishing Co., which they said was subpar in quality and ideologically-biased toward conservatives.They said the textbook contained favorable descriptions about Japan’s 1910-45 colonization of Korea and the authoritarian government of former president Park, who is the father of President Park Geun-hye.The authors of six textbooks filed a lawsuit against the ministry, arguing that it had forced a particular historical viewpoint on them.“Today’s ruling proved that textbooks are not about teaching the correct historical perception to students, but in fact can be revised at any time to ingratiate the government administration,” Han Chul-ho, a history professor at Dongguk University and one of the authors who filed the lawsuit, told local media after Thursday’s ruling.The controversy surrounding the textbooks had carried over to 2014, when left-leaning civic groups, opposition lawmakers and some parents protested against schools choosing the controversial Kyohak books. Surviving “comfort women” ― victims of Japan’s sexual slavery during World War II ― even sought an injunction to ban the books.In the aftermath, the debate was rekindled over potentially reinstating a state-authored history textbook system for high schools.

With Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe scheduled to make a congressional address later this month, Seoul is forecast to focus chiefly on rallying U.S. lawmakers behind its efforts to extract a sincere atonement for Tokyo’s atrocities during World War II, such as sex slavery involving Korean and other women.Rep. Nancy Pelosi, who was the first female speaker of the House of Representatives from 2007-11, played a key role when the lower chamber unanimously endorsed a resolution in 2007 calling for Japan’s formal apology for the wartime sexual enslavement, initiated by Rep. Mike Honda.  President Park Geun-hye welcomes U.S. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi at the presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae Thursday. (Yonhap)“Park will request the Congress’ active cooperation and understanding about major pending issues between South Korea and the U.S.,” Cheong Wa Dae spokesman Min Kyung-wook told reporters ahead of the meeting, without elaborating further. The third-term lawmaker touched down in Seoul on Wednesday for a three-day stay with a group of about 10 politicians from both the Democrat and Republican Parties, including Reps. Charles Rangel (D-New York), Sander Levin (D-Michigan) and Mike Fitzpatrick (R-Pennsylvania).She also visited South and North Koreas in 1997 as a member of the House intelligence committee. Pelosi also met with Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, National Assembly Speaker Rep. Chung Ui-hwa and other ranking officials and lawmakers here. The delegation is scheduled to leave for Tokyo on Thursday. The visit came shortly after Abe was invited by the incumbent speaker John Boehner to address a joint session of the Congress on April 29. However, criticism is growing for what is seen as his ongoing attempts to whitewash Japan’s imperial past, with the premier depicting the so-called comfort women as victims of “human trafficking” in an apparent effort to dilute Japan’s direct involvement in the issue. During a lunch meeting earlier in the day, Chung expressed regret that Abe’s failure to face up to history poses a hurdle for not just a thaw between the two old foes, but also greater three-way collaboration, including with the U.S. “The history issue is not just a matter of the past ... I hope that Prime Minister Abe will use his address at the U.S. Congress to ‘acknowledge, apologize, and accept historical responsibility,’ as requested in H. Res. 121, and make the event a turning point where the countries concerned leave the past behind and move forward to achieve peace in the region and beyond,” he said, referring to the watershed resolution. In response, Pelosi introduced two Japanese-American lawmakers who are accompanying her on the trip ― Doris Matsui and Mark Takai ― and praised their contribution in the lead-up to the text’s passage. “When we put forth the resolution, the strength of it was the Japanese-Americans, who are putting forth the resolution on the comfort women,” she said. “Again, high priorities for us and one of the first pieces of legislation that we passed in a strong bipartisan way, signed by the president.” On the bilateral front, the sides were predicted to change their views over ongoing negotiations to amend a nuclear energy pact, a proposed bill in the House designed to raise the quota of professional visas and South Korea’s potential participation in the U.S.-led Trans-Pacific Partnership. Yun, for his part, briefed lawmakers on Seoul’s efforts to mend ties with Tokyo, such as through a trilateral partnership including Beijing, while stressing the need for Japanese leaders to correct historical perceptions, ministry officials said.

But she was acquitted of obstructing a government probe into the incident.Both the prosecutors and her attorneys have filed for an appeal.A noticeably enfeebled Cho appeared at the first appellate hearing, which took place in a packed Seoul High Court room.She pleaded guilty to the latter two charges but said she wasn't guilty of changing the route of the flight.""Cho acknowledges her act of violence and asks for the victims' forgiveness,"" her attorney said. ""But it's not fair to say she obstructed aviation safety or changed the route of the flight.""Cho's lawyers said the taxiway shouldn't be considered part of the ""route of a flight,"" which is not clearly defined in the aviation law.Meanwhile, prosecutors called for a heavier punishment for Cho, who they said abused her authority as the executive member of South Korea's largest full-service carrier.""It's questionable whether she actually feels sorry,"" a prosecutor told the judges. Cho had initially said she ordered the flight back to the gate because she was ""doing her job as the vice president.""In a green prison uniform and wearing black horn-rimmed glasses, Cho asked for leniency.""I ask for the victims' forgiveness,"" she said in a barely audible voice. ""I am deeply sorry for what I did.""Her attorneys said she has suffered emotionally during her three months in a detention center. They had earlier told local media that Cho was missing her twin boys, who just turned 1.

The three parties have reportedly reached an agreement on issues including “ordinary wages,” plans to reduce working hours and extension of the retirement age.However, the dialogue ended in a rupture Tuesday, as labor strongly resisted a government proposal to grant employers more discretion in firing underperforming regular workers. Management, for their part, opposed the labor groups’ suggestion to force them to give nonregular workers regular status if their work is similar to that of regular workers.The committee resumed talks on Wednesday afternoon.The panel, titled the Economic and Social Development Commission, is a consultative body formed of representatives of labor, management and the government.The three-way dialogue was resumed last year as the Federation of Korean Trade Unions, one of the two major union umbrella groups, returned to the panel.The presidential office, meanwhile, pressed the panel to find common ground stressing it is necessary for nation’s economic growth and future generations.“Cheong Wa Dae would keep an eye on the negotiation process,” said Min Kyung-wook, spokesman for President Park Geun-hye. “The office hopes for a meaningful compromise as the people have high expectations of that,” he said.Senior presidential secretary An Chong-bum also urged the members of the panel to make concessions for the greater good.The overhaul of the labor market is one of the reform measures Park is pushing as part of her three-year economic revitalization plan. The president has argued that labor reform is key to job creation, particularly for young people struggling to find suitable jobs at a time when businesses are hesitant to hire new workers.The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said last month that South Korea needed to resolve the differences between regular and nonregular workers in terms of pay and job security to boost productivity and encourage more female employment.The three parties have been locking horns as they differ on how to tackle a divide between regular workers and nonregular workers.The government and the management believe that Korea’s labor market is rigid because regular workers are being overprotected. This, in turn, makes businesses reluctant to hire more regular workers and rely on nonregular workers instead, because they can fire the latter more easily, and employing them costs less.To increase labor market flexibility, the government and the management have urged labor groups to accept the idea of lifting some labor regulations for employers so that they can replace underperforming workers. But labor groups oppose the idea, saying that it would eventually allow businesses seek massive lay-offs and pressure poorly performing workers to accept salary reductions. The idea is intended to force regular workers out and replace them with nonregular workers, which would lower the overall quality of jobs, the labor groups claimed.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","rupture tuesday as labor ,committee resumed talks on wednesday ,tripartite committee had set tuesday ,businesses reluctant to hire more ,in rupture tuesday as labor","['the economic and Social Development Commission', 'the Federation of Korean Trade Unions', 'Dae', 'Min Kyung - wook', 'Park Geun - hye', 'An Chong - bum', 'Park', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'South Korea', 'Korea', 'Cho Chung - un']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35904601  0.29155439

But they said their probe would continue to verify the allegations that Kim had violated the law by possessing various publications carrying “enemy-benefiting” contents. Kim Ki-jong. (Yonhap)The 55-year-old assailant attacked Lippert with a paring knife during a forum in downtown Seoul on March 5. At the scene, Kim said that he carried out the attack to stop the South Korea-U.S. military drills that were strongly opposed by North Korea.The attack left an 11-cm wound on Lippert’s face and another injury on his left arm. The ambassador immediately received surgery and is currently recovering.The prosecution filed an attempted murder charge as the depth of the wounds and the paring knife indicated that Kim had premediated the attack with an intention of killing the top U.S. envoy. But Kim has claimed that he did not mean to murder Lippert.The investigators questioned two surgeons who conducted the surgery on Lippert to analyze the wounds and prove that Kim attempted to murder him with the knife.As for the possibility of complicity, the prosecution said Kim appears to have carried out the attack alone.Meanwhile, on Wednesday, Lippert wrote his first blog post since he left the hospital on March 10.

He is likely to face a summons from the Seoul District Prosecutors’ Office in the coming weeks.While the prosecutors initially targeted the firm’s alleged irregularities, involving embezzlement, during its overseas investments under the Lee administration-led resources development projects, its large amount of sour loans could lead investigators to summon some FSS officials and bank executives.The company, which filed for court receivership last week, is also suspected of rigging financial statements to get higher credit ratings.The prosecution is investigating alleged irregularities by a consortium of Korean companies, including Keangnam, formed to invest 300 billion won in an oil field development project on the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia between 2005 and 2009. The consortium withdrew from the project in 2010.Keangnam’s involvement in a nickel development project in Africa is another probe target.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","irregular lobbying with banking officials ,politicians to get the loans ,financial health investigators said tuesday ,firm alleged irregularities involving embezzlement ,out irregular lobbying with banking","['Keangnam Enterprises', 'the Board of Audit and Inspection', 'Keangnam Enterprises', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'BAI', 'the Export - Import Bank of Korea', 'Shinhan Bank', 'the Korea Development Bank', 'Nonghyup', 'Kookmin Bank', 'Sung Woan - jong', 'the financial Supervisory Service', 'Sung', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee Sang - deuk', 'Lee', 'FSS', 'korean', 'Keangnam', 'Russia', 'Kim Yon - se']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.1819018   0.19335623

They rebuked that only 22 of the party’s 137 lawmakers had been exempted from service while 29 of the NPAD’s 105 male legislators had never served.The party’s spokesperson Rep. Kwon Eun-hee prepared commentary accusing Moon of defaming President Park Geun-hye, who was reportedly not among Moon’s targets of criticism, only to rescind it later and apologize to the rival party leader.Observers said the latest tit-for-tat reflects the overheating competition ahead of the April 29 by-elections. Four constituencies will pick new representatives to the National Assembly.“But I don’t think it’s childish to be having this debate,” Yoon Pyung-joong, professor at Hanshin University, said. “I think it’s good for the public that both parties expose each other’s military records. Both parties know it’s embarrassing to have that many lawmakers who were exempt from military service, often for unclear reasons,” he said.Military service is one of the touchiest subjects in South Korea, which is still technically at war. The country obligates all physically and mentally fit men to join the armed forces for close to two years.Both parties have worked to strengthen their image as a party that prioritizes national security. The Saenuri Party hopes to consolidate its traditional conservative voter base, while the NPAD seeks to rid its pro-North Korea image.Observers called the latest partisan fighting an unproductive one that would have minimal to no influence on the upcoming election.“The debate (over military service) might allow parties to consolidate their traditional support bases, but generally, I don’t think the wrangling is going to meaningfully affect the elections,” said Yang Seung-ham, professor of politics at Yonsei University in Seoul.On Sunday, Moon had added that the 2010 sinking of the Navy’s Cheonan by a North Korean submarine had occurred under the watch of leaders with no military experience.Key members of President Lee Myung-bak’s Cabinet at the time include National Intelligence Service chief Won Sei-hoon, Prime Minister Kim Hwang-sik and Cheong Wa Dae Chief of Staff Chung Chung-kil.

President Park Geun-hye has declared an all-out war against it when the nation's first indigenous salvage ship, the Tongyeong, failed to function during a major ferry disaster last year.

He was president of the university before joining Lee’s camp.The prosecution plans to summon officials of Chung-Ang University and the Education Ministry to probe Park’s influence-peddling regarding various approval and authorization processes linked to the school. The Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office raids Chung-Ang University to search for evidence against the university’s former dean Park Bum-hoon on Monday. (Yonhap)Corruption allegations involving Park are being released file-after-file, as the prosecution tightens its investigations into former ranking officials of the Lee administration, as well as their ties with conglomerates such as POSCO.Park, who served for Chung-Ang University as president from 2005 to 2011, worked at Cheong Wa Dae from February 2011 to February 2013 as senior secretary for education and culture.Along with spreading suspicions of Park exerting influence in various personnel decisions at the school, prosecutors are also reportedly looking into the background of how his daughter was hired as a professor of an art college at the school at the age of 33 in September last year, Chosun Ilbo reported Monday.Insiders were quoted as saying that most faculty members spend around 10 years as part-time lecturers before securing a seat, and hence most professors are in their 40s.Park has also been suspected of engaging in illicit college admission practices, complying with several requests from social dignitaries for their sons and daughters’ entrance.Further, investigative authorities are also reportedly looking into any dubious transaction involving a training institute for gugak, Korean traditional music, during his term as the university head.In 2008 Park donated his land in Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi Province, to a gugak art performance association to establish a training center, backed by 900 million won in funds from the Yangpyeong-gun Office. He was working as the college head and the project could be regarded as a social contribution.But the ownership of the land was handed over to a foundation, held by Park, again in March 2013. Currently, Park and his oldest daughter was registered as directors of the foundation.The land, which stood at 9,000 won per square meter when he was donating it, is hovering at 150,000 won.The Seoul District Prosecutors’ Office is interrogating the former presidential aide while internally fine-tuning whether to seek an arrest warrant for him on a variety of corruption charges.Park, who graduated from the same university in 1976, majored in music composition.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","corruption charges park who graduated ,daughter was hired as professor ,interrogating the former presidential aide ,daughters entrance further investigative authorities ,university former dean park bum","['Lee Myung - bak', 'Park bum - hoon', 'Lee', 'the Education Ministry', 'Chung - Ang University ’s', 'Seoul', 'Lee ’s', 'Chung - Ang University', 'the Education Ministry', 'Park ’s', 'the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Chung - Ang University', 'Park', 'Lee', 'POSCO.Park', 'Chung - Ang University', 'Park', 'Chosun Ilbo', 'korean', 'Yangpyeong', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Office', 'Park', 'Park', 'Kim Yon - se']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24831174  0.3550446

He was 91.The state funeral procession of Singapore’s founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in Singapore on Sunday. (EPA-Yonhap)Lee’s dark brown wooden casket, draped in the red-and-white Singaporean flag, left parliament in a glass case atop a gun carriage, and passed by landmarks associated with the British-trained lawyer’s 60-year political career. The motorcade ended at the National University of Singapore for a funeral service attended by Asia-Pacific leaders and other dignitaries. Howitzers gave Lee a 21-gun salute normally reserved for sitting heads of state, even though he was just a member of parliament when he died. Four F-16 fighter jets from the Air Force’s aerial display team, the Black Knights, displayed a formation known as “The Missing Man,” with one of the planes peeling away to signify Lee’s passing. During the funeral service, his son and the current prime minister of Singapore, Lee Hsien Loong, said that the wealthy Southeast Asian city state he helped build would be his monument.“To those who seek Mr. Lee Kuan Yew’s monument, Singaporeans can reply proudly: Look around you,” Lee said. After the ceremony, his body was cremated.World leaders including South Korean President Park Geun-hye, also gathered in the city-state to bid adieu to Lee, whom they recalled as a visionary and legendary leader.President Park, in her condolence message, wrote that Lee was “a monumental leader of our time” and that his name would “remain forever engraved in the pages of world history.” Park was the first South Korean president in 15 years to attend a funeral held in foreign countries, her office said.President Park had shared a close relationship with the former leader of Singapore and his family since the 1970s when her father, the late President Park Chung-hee, was in power.In 1979, Park, who served as Korea’s first lady after her mother’s death, joined a state banquet held between her father and Lee as a translator.She said in her autography in 2007 that Lee and her wife were like parents who showed affection to her during their brief meetings in the past.Her attendance to Lee’s funeral also drew keen attention from local media over her encounter with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe who invited fresh criticism over his remark on Japan’s sexual enslavement of women during World War II. In an interview with the Washington Post, the Japanese premier called the issue “human trafficking” without specifying the perpetrator, keeping his vague position over Japan’s responsibility for the atrocity.At the funeral ceremony, Park proposed to Abe that South Korea, China and Japan take necessary steps to carry out agreements reached by the three nations' top diplomats earlier this month.Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, Malaysian King Sultan Abdul Halim Mu’adzam Shah and Brunei’s Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah were also among the leaders attending the funeral. Former U.S. president Bill Clinton led the American delegation that also includes former secretary of state Henry Kissinger, a close friend of Lee.Lee was Singapore’s prime minister for more than three decades, ruling with an iron grip until 1990. He is regarded by Singaporeans as the architect of their nation’s prosperity and harmonious race relations, but his authoritarian rule was criticized for restricting free speech, taming media and stunting democracy.Singapore has one of the highest GDP per capita incomes in the world, at $56,284 in 2014, up from a mere $516 when it gained independence. Ninety percent of Singaporeans own their homes, thanks to a public housing scheme launched by Lee, and the country enjoys one of the lowest crime rates in the world.By Cho Chung-un, news reports(christory@heraldcorp.com)","an elaborate state funeral sunday ,elaborate state funeral sunday thousands ,elaborate state funeral sunday ,died of pneumonia last monday ,state funeral sunday thousands","['singaporean', 'Lee Kuan Yew', 'british', 'southeast asian', 'Lee', 'Singapore', 'Lee Kuan Yew', 'Singapore', 'EPA', 'singaporean', 'British', 'the National University of Singapore', 'Lee', 'the Air Force ’s', 'Lee ’s', 'Singapore', 'Lee Hsien Loong', 'southeast asian', 'Lee Kuan Yew ’s', 'Singaporeans', 'Lee', 'south korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Lee', 'Park', 'Lee', 'south korean', 'Park', 'Singapore', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Park', 'Korea ’s', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Japan', 'the Washington Post', 'japanese', 'Japan', 'Park', 'Abe', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Japan', 'australian', 'Tony Abbott', 'indian', 'Narendra Modi', 'indonesian', 'Joko Widodo', 'malaysian', 'Abdul Halim', 'Mu’adzam Shah', 'Brunei', 'U.S.', 'Bill Clinton', 'american', 'Henry Kissinger', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Singapore', 'Singaporeans', 'Singapore', 'Singaporeans', 'Lee', 'Cho Chung - un']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38181558  0.21673492

A man in Gangwon province, whose information was withheld, was acquitted Saturday of adultery charges, court officials said. The man was sentenced to a six-month jail term with a stay of one year for cheating on his wife in 2013. “As the Constitutional Court ruled the adultery ban unconstitutional, the defendant’s charges are no longer a crime,” judges said in the retrial. Two other men in Daegu and Incheon, were also cleared of adultery charges in their retrials last week. The 39-year-old man in Daegu was sentenced to a two-year prison term with eight months of probation for cheating on his spouse in July 2013. He immediately sought a retrial after the controversial law was struck down.A 50-year-old man in Incheon was also cleared after facing an eight-month jail term with a stay of two years in 2012 for the same allegations.If acquitted in the retrial, all related criminal records are removed, legal officials said. The Constitutional Court abolished the anticheating law with a 7-2 decision Feb. 26, ruling that the 62-year-old ban violates individuals’ sexual rights and privacy. Under the law, adultery was a crime punishable by up to two years behind bars. Any third person involved in a love affair could also face criminal charges. The regulation was only applicable when a spouse filed a lawsuit.In the past, the court had turned down petitions to repeal the law four times from 1990 to 2008. In its 2008 ruling, the majority of the judges supported personal freedom but were one vote shy of ordering a change.The landmark ruling is expected to save thousands of people who were punished by the law. About 100,000 people were punished since the law was enacted in 1953. Of these, only around 3,000 have been eligible to seek retrials, the law authorities said. The court grants review requests only from those who were given a guilty verdict after Oct. 30, 2008, the date the last ruling in favor of the adultery ban was upheld.Those punished can also seek compensation from the government after getting acquitted in the retrial, they added.

In 2004, Chang was sentenced to three years in prison, suspended for four years, for providing security loans to his relatives and paying off personal debts using company funds. The chairman later received a special pardon from President Lee Myung-bak.In 2011, Chang underwent a special 8-month tax investigation by the National Tax Service, which ended with the chairman paying additional taxes without charges being pressed.The recent investigation is considered to be part of a widening probe into the former Lee Myung-bak administration, including a series of inspections into overseas resource development projects carried out during Lee’s term in office.On Friday, the prosecution began investigating former Chung-Ang University president Park Bum-hoon for allegedly granting special privileges to the university while working as a senior secretary to former president Lee from 2011 to 2013.The same day, prosecutors raided the home of former POSCO Engineering & Construction vice chairman Chung Dong-hwa. Chung is suspected of having created slush funds worth over 10 billion won at the steelmaker’s construction operation in Vietnam.Construction firm Keangnam Enterprises, state-run Korea National Oil Corp. and petrochemicals company SK Innovation are also facing similar charges of allegedly misusing government funds linked to the Lee administration’s state-financed projects.By Sohn Ji-young (jys@heraldcorp.com)","prosecutors office on saturday raided ,day prosecutors raided the home ,saturday raided dongkuk steel headquarters ,office on saturday raided ,local media reports sunday prosecutors","['South Korea ’s', 'Dongkuk Steel Mill Co.', 'the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Dongkuk Steel ’s', 'Seoul', 'Chang Sae - joo', 'Chang', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Chang', 'Las Vegas', 'U.S.', 'Dongkuk International', 'Dongkuk Steel', 'Ferrum Infra Co.', 'Chang', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Chang', 'the National Tax Service', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Lee ’s', 'Chung - Ang University', 'Park Bum - hoon', 'Lee', 'POSCO Engineering & Construction', 'Chung Dong - hwa', 'Chung', 'Vietnam', 'Keangnam Enterprises', 'Korea National Oil Corp.', 'SK Innovation', 'Lee', 'Sohn Ji - young']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46558428  0.35731962

The official, not the spouse, would be subject to the relevant punishment. Following Park's approval, the law will be announced to the public on Friday and go into force on Sept. 28, 2016. The bill was drawn up to tighten loopholes in existing anti-corruption rules under which public officials cannot be punished for accepting expensive gifts and services unless there is evidence of reciprocity.(Yonhap)","thursday sanctioned an anti corruption ,corruption bill that won parliamentary ,school faculty to maximum penalty ,proposed the legislation in june ,punishment following park approval","['Park Geun - hye', 'Kim Young - ran Law']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.21778665  0.36036369

Park Sang-ok, who served as a public prosecutor, was nominated as a Supreme Court judge in January. But his confirmation hearing was put on hold for 76 days, with a group of opposition lawmakers refusing to hold the session, citing his role in the 1987 investigation of police officers accused of torturing a student activist to death.The prosecution came under fire after a revelation by Catholic priests that there were more police officers involved in the torture than those it had indicted. The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy has claimed that the justice nominee was responsible for the cover-up and urged him to voluntarily withdraw his nomination.The rival parties, however, reached an agreement to hold the hearing session after a meeting held between their floor leaders Tuesday. On Wednesday, members of a special parliamentary committee on personnel hearings finalized the date, although they continued to wage a war of nerves. Lawmakers from the ruling party accused the opposition party of neglecting their duty, saying they have delayed the confirmation process and undermined the function of the judiciary. Meanwhile, NPAD lawmakers continued to label Park as a disqualified nominee and warned that they will press him to withdraw the nomination during the grilling session.“We are not accepting his nomination just because we agreed to hold the confirmation hearing,” said Rep. Jeon Hae-cheol of NPAD. The lawmaker warned that his party could boycott the session again if the prosecution and the court do not present a full investigation report and the court record of police officers involved in the torture of the student 28 years ago.Rep. Lee Han-sung of the ruling Saenuri party vowed to cooperate with NPAD in securing the relevant documents, but criticized the opposition party for hastily jumping to the conclusion that Park, who was then a junior prosecutor, was disqualified because he was part of the investigation team at the time.A bench in the 14-member Supreme Court has been left vacant since a justice retired last month.

The government and ruling Saenuri Party have already made their joint proposal.Kang Gi-jung, NPAD's chief policymaker, said his party's proposal centers on keeping pensions at the current level for middle- and lower-class public officials and raising the contribution rate for a sustainable pension scheme.""The core of our proposal is the strengthening of public pensions and the restructuring of civil service pensions,"" he said in a press briefing at the National Assembly.The NPAD's proposal calls for a partial application of the national pension plan to civil service pensions. Under the national pension plan, low-income workers receive more in entitlements relative to their contributions compared to the high income bracket. This system would apply to 4.5 percentage points of the 7 percent public servants set aside from their income in contributions toward pension. For the remaining 2.5 percentage points, civil servants would receive entitlements proportionate to their income.Under the proposal, civil servants would receive about 50 percent of their average salary over their lifetime in monthly pension payments, down from the current 57 percent.The NPAD estimated that the proposed reform would save a total of 321 trillion won ($291 billion), or 55 trillion won more than the 266 trillion won expected to be saved under the government and ruling party's proposal.It also proposed the formation of a body for social compromise on reforming public pensions.The ruling party called for a clearer proposal.""As was expected, (the NPAD) is confusing (the public) with vague figures,"" Saenuri Chairman Kim Moo-sung said.

FINA slapped Park, a four-time Olympic medalist and two-time world champ in freestyle, with an 18-month suspension, starting retroactively on Sept. 3, 2014, when FINA collected Park's urine samples.\The suspension is to end in March 2016, which theoretically gives Park time to prepare for the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro five months later.However, a rule instituted by the Korean Olympic Committee last summer could prevent Park from entering his fourth Summer Games.The rule states that athletes who have received a drug-related suspension of any length are ineligible to represent the country for three years, starting at the end of the suspension. In Park's case, he'd be barred from the national team until March 2019.The rule has been in place for less than a year but it has fueled debate over a potential double punishment of athletes for the same crime.While critics of the rule say Park deserves a chance for redemption because of his contribution to the sport -- he's the first and only Olympic swimming medalist from South Korea -- others says he shouldn't receive any special treatment.Lee, who is also a vice president of the KOC, tiptoed around the issue on Wednesday.""There will be opportunities to discuss this rule,"" he said.""But first and foremost, Park Tae-hwan should apologize to the people that he's let down and plead for their forgiveness, and take time to reflect on himself.""Park arrived back home separately Tuesday night, and issued a brief apology through his agency, Team GMP.Lee said Park will soon have a chance to speak publicly about the issue.Park will be stripped of all medals earned on or after Sept. 3.Competing at an arena bearing his own name, Park won one silver and five bronze medals at last year's Incheon Asian Games, which took place after the samples were collected. Three of his bronze medals came in relay events, and Park's teammates in those races will also lose their medals with Park's suspension.

The ministries were launched late last year as part of President Park Geun-hye’s government reorganization plan. The plan was part of follow-up measures devised to address public criticism over the government’s response to the Sewol crisis.The two ministries were excluded from the government’s relocation plan completed last year. Observers say the government could speed up the relocation process of the two ministries because the work requires no additional legislation.The authorities, however, did not conclude on the matters of relocating other executive offices in and near Seoul, such as the ministries of future strategy, maritime affairs and public administration to Sejong City, which observers worry could invite fresh criticism from other officials already stationed in Sejong City.The idea of creating Sejong City was first proposed by late President Roh Moo-hyun in 2002 as part of the efforts to relieve the overcrowding of Seoul by moving the country’s capital to the central provinces of Chungcheong. Former President Lee Myung-bak had opposed the plan and tried to scale down the original project in 2010. It was considered one of President Park’s notable political feats at the time when she, as leader of the ruling party, opposed Lee’s revision, eventually maintaining most of Sejong’s role.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","government said tuesday the decision ,relocation plan completed last year ,trilateral meeting held on monday ,the government said tuesday ,government relocation plan completed last","['Seoul', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun', 'Seoul', 'Sejong City', 'Sejong City', 'Sejong City', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Seoul', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Lee ’s', 'Sejong', 'Cho Chung - un']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3549045   0.44294864

Kim Moo-sung, chairman of the ruling party at first and second, respectively, in the approval ratings as potential contenders for the upcoming 2017 presidential election.Observers said the by-elections would serve as a barometer of Kim and Moon’s leadership as the parties wrangle over President Park Geun-hye’s economic and social reform measures.Up for grabs are four constituencies ― Gwanak-B district in Seoul, Jungwon district in Seongnam of Gyeonggi Province, Western Ganghwa-B district in Incheon and Seo-B district in Gwangju.The ruling Saenuri Party and main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy are expected to fight especially hard in the three Seoul metropolitan constituencies. The NPAD faces a tough challenge in Gwangju, its traditional home turf, following a decision by Chun Jeong-bae, a party heavyweight during the Roh Moo-hyun administration, to run as an independent candidate.The Saenuri Party, meanwhile, chose Oh Shin-hwan to run in the Gwanak-B district, while Shin Sang-jin, who represents Jungwon will run for reelection. In Gwangju, Chung Seung, the minister of food and drug safety, has confirmed his bid to run, and former Incheon Mayor Ahn Sang-soo has joined the race for the Ganghwa-B district.The NPAD selected Jung Tae-ho to run in Gwanak-B, while Jung Hwan-seok will run in Jungwon and in Seo-B of Gwangju, Cho Young-teck will run for the party. Shin Dong-keun will confront the ruling party’s Ahn in Gwanghwa-B.Though the by-election results have conventionally been favorable to opposition candidates, the Saenuri Party recently broke the jinx by winning in the July 30 by-elections in 2014.Political researchers said that winning at least two out of the four seats will be inevitable for both Kim and Moon to secure their statuses as party leaders.Kim Moo-sung said the governing party would encourage voters in their 20s and 30s to take part in the election. The Saenuri Party also plans to consolidate the conservative votes by stressing the need to “expel followers of North Korea from the National Assembly” via speeches at colleges including Seoul National University in Seoul.Moon Jae-in, for his part, plans to highlight “the incumbent administration’s failure in economic policies” and the widening income gap between the haves and have-nots.For the Saenuri Party, it is considered a tough challenge to win in Gwangju and is instead focusing on winning the three metropolitan constituencies, pundits said.Kim received 11.8 percent of the approval ratings according to the latest poll by Realmeter as of March 23.Moon, who topped the list for the 11th consecutive week garnered 24.9 percent of support. The NPAD faces a daunting task of placating the voters in Gwangju by quelling widespread disapproval among the Jeolla residents regarding the current party leadership held by figures hailing from the politically hostile Gyeongsang Province.South Jeolla-based heavyweight Hahn Hwa-kap has publicly claimed that Jeolla Province should revive the region’s leadership status in the party, expressing his support for Chun, the former justice minister.

The foreign ministers from Seoul, Tokyo and Beijing agreed Saturday to improve trilateral cooperation in their rare meeting in Seoul, which was held after a near three-year hiatus due to conflict over their shared history.""(Seoul) has yet to discuss specifics with Japan, but I think there's a need to hold the meeting sometime during next month,"" the source noted. The bilateral director-level security consultation, first launched in 1997, has been stalled for the last five years amid soured South Korea-Japan relations.The two countries attempted to resume the meeting of diplomatic and defense officials in late 2013, but all was in vain due to rising tension over territorial and historical issues under the Shinzo Abe administration. Japan's move to refurbish its defense forces has also fueled regional tension along with Prime Minister Abe's much-denounced visit to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine that year. A resumption of the security policy consultation meeting is widely expected to help Seoul and Tokyo recover their soured relations although they have yet to restore a summit meeting that has been stalled for nearly three years. It is also timed to make Seoul's voice heard ahead of Japan's quickening moves to re-strengthen its military forces.Japan and the U.S. are expected to revise their defense guidelines late next month as part of a legal process needed for the military build-up. The Japanese parliament is likely to start the related legislative efforts around May. The source said South Korea may try to repeat its concern over Japan's military rearmament at the envisioned April meeting as Seoul remains opposed to any military action by Tokyo on the Korean Peninsula without advance approval.

695,695,[Reporter's Column] Cutting vicious chain of violence,"During the recent trial of her famous husband facing domestic violence charges, Seo Jung-hee revealed that she was in fact forced to marry comedian Seo Se-won after being nearly raped at age 19, and that she’d been constantly abused and confined during their 32 years of marriage.“Your honor, do you think I ended up here because I was abused only once?” the 55-year-old who filed for divorce said in tears during the...","During the recent trial of her famous husband facing domestic violence charges, Seo Jung-hee revealed that she was in fact forced to marry comedian Seo Se-won after being nearly raped at age 19, and that she’d been constantly abused and confined during their 32 years of marriage.“Your honor, do you think I ended up here because I was abused only once?” the 55-year-old who filed for divorce said in tears during the hearing. CCTV footage showing Seo being dragged by the ankle and physically abused by her husband rattled many while prompting more rumors over what was portrayed publicly as a rosy marriage. Some claimed both were at fault, while others blamed the wife for putting up with it for all these years.Just a year before, Kim Joo-ha, a prominent TV news anchor, filed for divorce, claiming she had been physically abused by her husband since 2004. It took her nine years to come forward. The agony behind Kim’s image as a successful woman seemed to unveil the uncomfortable reality here, where domestic violence is often still blamed on the victims, who therefore choose silence instead. When looking at statistics, Seo and Kim are just two of some estimated 3.7 million people who have been abused at home in South Korea as of 2009. According to government data, 15.3 percent of all South Korean women aged 65 or under had been abused by their spouses at least once as of 2013. The rate was more than five times higher than in other developed nations, such as Japan and the U.K. On top of that, more than 80 percent of all domestic abuse cases occurred in marriages. Almost 63 percent of them never report the violence, mostly because of fear and concern for their children. “Many abused women fear divorce for many reasons,” said a shelter worker who asked to remain anonymous. “Those who do not work fear that they may not be able to support their children. Others fear that their children may be stigmatized as children of single mothers.”So what do these numbers tell us? After all, Seo and Kim stood for what many women and mothers pursued. Seo managed to send her children to prestigious schools in the U.S. and Japan while running her own interior design business. Kim was undoubtedly one of the most influential media figures here. Perhaps that is why their cases rattled so many, as they reminded once again that no matter where you are on the social ladder, it is still hard to come forward against abuse.Although the number of women in the high social tiers traditionally occupied by men is rapidly rising, their vulnerability to violence, and furthermore, social condemnation against female victims seems to persist.Seo’s grown-up daughter, who is currently a Ph.D. student at the Wharton School of Business, recently supported her mother’s decision to file for divorce. She told local media that she “didn’t realize her father’s actions against her mother were wrong as a child, but learned to accept that they were not right as she grew up.” Park Cheon-taek, a public servant who oversees domestic violence issues at the Gender Ministry, said that exposing children to domestic violence, including letting them witness their mother being abused by their father, is also a form of serious child abuse. In parts of in the U.S., it is considered a crime. “It’s an emotional abuse,” Park said. “Kids exposed to domestic violence are at a higher risk of increased emotional and behavioral problems.”According to a 2010 study released by the Korea Legal Aid Center for Family Relations, 51 percent of 998 teenagers surveyed said they have witnessed domestic violence at least once in their lives, and those who have witnessed it had a higher chance of becoming bullies in school. One in 5 juvenile offenders in South Korea is from a single-parent household or homes with conflict. The number of teenagers who run away from home is also increasing ― from 15,114 in 2009 to 21,813 in 2012. Many of them turn to illegal prostitution.Often, issues of domestic violence turn into a gender war on Internet forums. But perhaps, there is a need to accept that combating domestic violence is not a battle of the genders but a fight against a brutal crime that demolishes not only the victim but also the next generation.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","many abused women fear divorce ,won after being nearly raped ,divorce she told local media ,husband facing domestic violence charges ,their children many abused women","['Seo Jung - hee', 'Seo Se - win', 'cctv', 'Seo', 'Kim Joo - ha', 'Kim', 'Seo', 'Kim', 'South Korea', 'south korean', 'Japan', 'U.K.', 'Seo', 'Kim', 'seo', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Kim', 'seo ’s', 'the Wharton School of Business', 'the Gender Ministry', 'U.S.', 'Park', 'the Korea Legal Aid Center for Family Relations', 'South Korea', 'Claire Lee']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66167963 -0.0147931

He was found to have played a behind-the-scenes role in supporting Lee’s policies. Kim, 56, was a close aide of the ex-president’s brother Lee Sang-deuk.Han and Kim were reaping yearly sales of 5.4 billion won and 11 billion won through supplier contracts with POSCO.Another Kim, 55, the head of a regional builder, was also operating an outsourcing firm for the conglomerate.

Curtis Scaparrotti made the remark in a written testimony submitted Wednesday to the House appropriations subcommittee on defense amid intensifying debates in South Korea about whether to accept a U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery.  Scaparrotti is the one who brought up the need for a THAAD battery in South Korea for the first time in June last year. The issue has since become one of the most sensitive defense and political issues in Seoul as China and Russia have expressed strong opposition to such a deployment.  ""Due to the nature of the evolving threat, particularly ballistic missiles, it is critical for the alliance to build a layered and interoperable BMD (ballistic missile defense) capability,"" Scaparrotti said in the statement.  ""Each nation has unique contributions to make to missile defense. While the U.S. has an existing layered BMD capability, the ROK is moving forward in the development of its KAMD and 'Kill Chain.' It is essential that we work together to ensure interoperability of alliance BMD capabilities,"" he said.  Intense debates have been going on in South Korea about the THAAD system.   Supporters say the advanced missile defense unit is necessary to meet ever-growing missile and nuclear threats from North Korea, while opponents claim mid- and lower-altitude missile interceptors are enough for the South as the North is unlikely to attack the country with such high-altitude missiles.  Opponents also claim a THAAD deployment would cause unnecessary tension with China.  China has increased pressure on Seoul to reject the THAAD.

The conglomerate attained state approval for the controversial 123-level Lotte World Mall in southern Seoul during Lee’s term.The case has been taken on by the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office, which is also in charge of the probe into slush fund speculation of Shinsegae Group, a retail business competitor of Lotte.On Thursday, Justice Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn was quoted in news reports as saying that the authority “would make public any (irregular business practices in the conglomerate sector) through thorough investigation as long as (we) secure evidence and confirm their crime.”Hwang made it clear that the prosecution is investigating “not the overall enterprises but those engaged in corruption” and that the probe would not be conducted in an unfair manner.

The consortium withdrew from the project in 2010. The prosecution on Wednesday raided the offices of Korea National Oil Corp. and Keangnam Enterprises for their alleged irregularities involving an aborted resources development project in Russia during the former Lee Myung-bak administration (Yonhap)At the time, the consortium held a 45 percent stake in the Russian project. Of them, KNOC held the largest share at 27.5 percent followed by Keangnam (10 percent) and SK Gas (7.5 percent).The prosecution is reportedly looking into whether the developers inflated the anticipated profit despite concerns of feasibility to gain approval from the financial authority for the project. The companies are also suspected of embezzling some of the investment.Sources said the probe will expand to other resources development projects overseas pursued during the Lee administration. Lee’s “resources diplomacy” has been criticized for yielding limited results despite the hefty investments.The investigation comes on the back of President Park Geun-hye’s all-out war on corruption. On Tuesday, she vowed to root out all the irregularities that have been holding back the country’s economic growth.Prosecutors also reportedly searched the home of Seong Wan-jong, the biggest shareholder of Keangnam and former lawmaker of the ruling Saenuri Party. Seong is said to be a close confidant of Lee Sang-deuk, brother of the ex-president.The prosecution will also scrutinize Keangnam’s involvement in a nickel development project in Madagascar. After the builder withdrew from the consortium due to a cash shortage, the state-run Korea Resources Corp. allegedly bought its stake despite an extensive loss.Opposition lawmakers have claimed that the Lee administration poured 40 trillion won into the overseas resource development projects, but recouped only 5 trillion won, or 13 percent, of the total investment.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","war on corruption on tuesday ,administration prosecutors confiscated bookkeeping records ,wednesday raided the offices ,on wednesday raided the offices ,growth prosecutors also reportedly searched","['Korea National Oil Corp.', 'Keangnam Enterprises', 'Russia', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Ulsan', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'Russia', 'Korea National Oil Corp.', 'Keangnam Enterprises', 'Russia', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'russian', 'KNOC', 'Keangnam', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Seong Wan - jong', 'Keangnam', 'Saenuri Party', 'Seong', 'Lee Sang - deuk', 'Keangnam ’s', 'Madagascar', 'Korea Resources Corp.', 'Lee', 'Kim Yon - se']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.30229217  0.77943265

Kim Moo-sung and main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy chair Rep. Moon Jae-in is expected to kick new life into the debate.“The president and Reps. Kim and Moon also agreed on the need to reform the public service pension,” senior NPAD spokesperson Rep. Kim Yung-rok said of the three-way meeting at Cheong Wa Dae.The Saenuri Party and the NPAD have been at loggerheads over reforming the public service pension for months.The public service pension has been cited as one of the main causes of the snowballing public debt. Some calculations estimate that the pension could absorb up to 18 trillion won ($15.9 billion) from public coffers annually from 2030 if left unreformed.The Government Employee Pension Service asserted that the funds could require more than 8.8 trillion won per year in government subsidies for it to be maintained by 2023, from current levels of 3.29 trillion won.Experts, pension benefactors and lawmakers from both the NPAD and the Saenuri Party have agreed that the pension must be revised, but they have disagreed as to how the funds should be restructured.The Saenuri Party supports a plan that would force senior officials with higher salaries to pay more to the public service pension and receive less after retirement while lower-level public officials would pay less to the pension and receive more after retirement. Government workers, though, have supported a plan that would require them to pay amounts proportionate to their salaries.The NPAD has yet to propose a plan of its own but Moon is expected to present his version in the near future.

(Yonhap)The two companies allegedly squandered 300 billion won ($266 million) in an oil exploration project in Kamchatka in Russia's Far East between 2005 and 2009.  The investment was part of then-President Lee Myung-bak's controversial push for overseas resource projects, which critics say have resulted in wasted taxpayer money with few tangible results.  Prosecutors said they found a promising lead that suggests KNOC and Keangnam Enterprises used illegal means to win the state's approval to invest, despite concerns that the project lacked economic viability.   Investigators believe these companies may have exaggerated the profits they expected from the investment when pitching the idea to South Korea's financial regulator. There is also a possibility that these firms embezzled some of the investment money, they said.  After disappointing results, KNOC and a consortium of South Korean companies pulled out of the Russian business in 2010.  Prosecutors are likely to widen their investigation into other energy diplomacy-related projects pursued during the Lee administration.  They are also looking into suspicions of irregularities in Keangnam Enterprises' sale of a stake in a nickel operation in Madagascar to the Korea Resources Corp. in 2010.

He is set to replace Lee Byung-ki, who will now serve as Park’s chief of staff.But lawmakers from the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy raised concerns that Lee’s “right-leaning” political philosophy could steer the NIS toward political meddling again as the agency allegedly did during the 2012 presidential election. Lee Byung-ho, who was nominated to serve as the nation’s next spy chief last month, answers questions from lawmakers at his confirmation hearing at the National Assembly on Monday. (Yonhap)Former NIS head Won Sei-hoon was found guilty by local courts of having led the spy agency in an online smear campaign against then-opposition presidential candidate Rep. Moon Jae-in, who now serves as the NPAD’s chair. The Supreme Court has yet to rule on the case.Lee vowed he would prioritize national security in his management of the NIS, and that he would prevent the agency from meddling in domestic politics.“Accurate and timely intelligence serves as the cornerstone of national security. I will make sure that our institution does that job,” Lee said at his hearing.“I consider political meddling by the NIS to be a dangerous proposition,” he added, in an apparent attempt to assuage the worries of NPAD lawmakers. “I do not wish to be remembered as a criminal in future history books.”Lee is a member of the Korea Military Academy’s class of 1963, and a combat veteran of the Vietnam War. He went on to serve in the spy agency until 1997 when he was picked to be Seoul’s ambassador to Malaysia. He taught at the University of Ulsan after his posting in Kuala Lumpur.Lee, however, refused to answer opposition lawmakers’ questions on the controversial interpretation of the military coup by former President Park Chung-hee, late father of the current president.“Do you agree that the May 16 coup, was a military rebellion?” NPAD Rep. Kim Kwang-jin asked Lee, referring to the 1961 coup led by Park Chung-hee. “I have my own thoughts about that incident,” Lee answered, refusing to give a straightforward response.Lawmakers from the governing Saenuri Party expressed support for Lee’s nomination, saying the former Army officer, intelligence agent, and diplomat had the “right credentials” to serve as the nation’s top spy.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","opposition presidential candidate rep moon ,spy chief last month answers ,month answers questions from lawmakers ,next spy chief last month ,lawmakers at his confirmation hearing","['South Korea ’s', 'Lee Byung - ho', 'Park Geun', 'the National Intelligence Service', 'Cabinet', 'Lee Byung - ki', 'Park ’s', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Lee', 'NIS', 'Lee Byung - ho', 'the National Assembly', 'NIS', 'Won Sei - hoon', 'Moon Jae - in', 'NPAD ’s', 'the Supreme Court', 'Lee', 'NIS', 'Lee', 'NIS', 'NPAD', 'the Korea Military Academy ’s', 'Seoul', 'Malaysia', 'the University of Ulsan', 'Kuala Lumpur', 'Lee', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Kim Kwang - jin', 'Lee', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Lee', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee', 'Army', 'Jeong Hunny']",8,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.5486635   0.33326662

Unionized government employees have vehemently opposed any changes to their exclusive pension program.  The Saenuri Party has demanded that the government-proposed pension reform bill pass the main floor session scheduled for May 6, which the NPAD reportedly resisted, saying that politicians should have more time to collect public opinions on the bill.  During the upcoming session, lawmakers are also expected to discuss the NPAD's recent proposal to create a special parliamentary committee on constitutional reform.  The session will include floor leaders' speeches on April 8-9, interpellation sessions from April 13 to 16 and three main sessions on April 23, April 30 and May 6, according to the floor leaders.

(Yonhap)The Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office investigating the case said it started calling executives in from Sunday for questioning over their suspected involvement.   An executive surnamed Park, who was the chief of POSCO E&C;'s Vietnamese operations, is among the first officials to face questioning, prosecutors said. Others include officials who were directly involved in the running of POSCO E&C;'s Vietnam branch.  Prosecutors said they are mainly focused on determining how the firm was able to leave millions of dollars out of its books.   POSCO E&C; says it exaggerated its payments to local subcontractors, which were later reimbursed from 2009 to 2012. But authorities believe some of the funds may have been sent back to South Korea.  Prosecutors also plan to interrogate former POSCO E&C; Vice Chairman Chung Dong-hwa, who ran the firm during the cited period.   But first, they will focus on uncovering the exact size and use of the slush funds before calling in the higher-ups.   Some sources within the prosecution said former POSCO Chairman Chung Joon-yang has been banned from leaving the country to possibly face questioning.  Prosecutors also did not rule out the possibility of expanding the probe to other POSCO affiliates either, one of which was found to have evaded taxes in 2013. The National Tax Service referred the case to the prosecution last year, though POSCO E&C; says the corruption was limited to a few individuals within the company.  Last week, Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo declared an all-out war on corruption, which analysts say seems to be aimed at propping up weak public support for President Park Geun-hye's job performance by launching an anti-graft drive against government officials and businessmen, especially those who worked for the previous Lee Myung-bak administration.

The prosecution recently issued travel bans on some incumbent and former executives of POSCO as it widens its scope of inquiry into the allegations that the conglomerate engaged in irregularities involving embezzlement at its construction unit. According to market insiders and news reports on Sunday, the steelmaker’s ex-chairman Chung, 67, was included on the travel ban list.Chung was the key influencer behind the group’s mergers and acquisitions during the previous Lee Myung-bak administration. There has been speculation in the market that the group conducted shady deals for some takeovers. While the number of POSCO units surged from 36 in 2009 to 70 in 2012 via M&As;, 18 units underwent capital erosion. Observers, citing the conglomerate’s worsening financial standing, raised the possibility that the prosecution would look into rumors that a slush fund was created via cozy relations between the group and the political sector. After Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo vowed on Friday to root out slush funds in the conglomerate sector, investigators raided the offices of POSCO Engineering & Construction and the residences of some executives.While the probe started from the allegation that its builder unit POSCO E&C; fostered 10 billion won ($9 million) in slush funds during its Vietnam project, observers say that the travel ban on group executives is heralding full-fledged scrutiny into the overall affiliates and subsidiaries.Some questioned the feasibility of the Park Geun-hye administration’s investigation of whether there were low-key deals between the Lee administration and some major business groups.Among the speculated irregularities under the spotlight are suspected tax evasion by POSCO P&S;, the group’s marketing subsidiary, and a dubious M&A; deal involving total solutions provider POSCO Plantec, according to a news outlet.While the National Assembly is accelerating the probe on the Lee administration’s reported losses from its overseas resource development projects, some observers predict that the prosecution will join the move starting with the steelmaker case.POSCO had yet to comment by Sunday on its stance on the raid and the travel bans.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","prosecution recently issued travel bans ,the conglomerate sector investigators raided ,sunday the steelmaker ex chairman ,sector investigators raided the offices ,conglomerate sector investigators raided the","['POSCO', 'Chung Joon - yang', 'POSCO', 'Chung', 'Chung', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'posco', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'POSCO Engineering & Construction', 'POSCO E&C', 'Vietnam', 'Lee', 'POSCO P&S', 'posco Plantec', 'the National Assembly', 'Lee', 'POSCO', 'Kim Yon - se']",1,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.23560703  0.6830985

The attack left Lippert with wounds that required 80 stitches.  (Yonhap)The 55-year-old faces charges of attempted murder, violence against a foreign envoy and business obstruction. Police said they are planning to ask the prosecutors to take over the case later in the day.Kim has said he was acting alone. But a special task force investigating the case said the 55-year-old contacted more than 30 people -- including a former spy for North Korea and a key member of a pro-North Korea organization here -- in the run-up to the incident.Kim Cheol-jun, the lead investigator from the National Police Agency, said authorities are delving further into Kim's phone and bank transaction records to find out whether any of them had been involved.The investigator also said Kim Ki-jong told officers he attacked the envoy to alert the U.S. to the fact that the ongoing South Korea-U.S. joint military drills hinder inter-Korean reunification.South Korea and the U.S. have jointly carried out the annual exercises to prepare for a possible invasion from the North. The two Koreas remain divided as no peace treaty has been signed to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War.Authorities also said some of what Kim told them shared striking similarities with North Korea's saber-rattling; Kim reportedly told them South Korea was a ""semi-colony"" of the U.S. while North Korea was an independent, autonomous country.Police said they also believe the attack was premeditated.Kim's Internet browsing history shows that he had looked up Lippert's blog, his height and South Korea's criminal law a day before the incident, according to authorities.He also appeared to have had an intent to kill, police said. He reportedly said he brought a knife because his previous attempt to harm a Japanese ambassador to Seoul years ago failed. He also slashed Lippert at least twice, leaving deep gashes on his face and arm that required more than 80 stitches.Kim, however, has said he hadn't planned on bringing the knife until the last minute and that he didn't mean to kill the envoy.Lippert reportedly told authorities he wanted Kim to be punished. He was completely taken unawares by the assailant, according to the testimony he gave to the police a day earlier. The envoy also reportedly said he thought he would have been killed if he didn't hurry towards the exit.Police are also continuing their investigation into the possibility that Kim violated a controversial security law, which bans South Koreans from openly praising North Korea. More than 20 books that are suspected of being in violation of the National Security Law were found in his home, they said.Anti-U.S. activists here have argued the U.S. has hampered progress for Korean unification. But no one had attacked a U.S. envoy before Kim. He was also the first South Korean to try to harm a foreign envoy when he threw pieces of rock at a Japanese ambassador in 2010.

Some have raised suspicions that Lee exaggerated the unit price to get a rebate from Havelsan, and bribed Air Force officers here and DAPA officials involved in the project. Prosecutors believe that Lee was able to reduce the cost for the EWTS production by having his affiliates participate in the project as subcontractors and letting them provide substandard parts for the equipment. At the point of the EWTS introduction, there had been a controversy that the system failed to meet the military's requirements and to fit the country's security circumstances. The platform is designed to train pilots with electronic countermeasure devices against interceptors and artilleries from enemies, including North Korea, to improve the pilots' ability to survive and to boost the country's anti-aircraft capabilities.The chief also faces allegations that he illegally acquired classified information on a state project to upgrade unmanned aerial vehicles.Lee, who founded the defense firm in the mid-1980s, has worked as an arms dealer for more than 30 years.

The Supreme Court upheld the high court’s ruling on Thursday.The district court had ruled that Lee received a credit card and a Mercedes-Benz sedan worth 55.9 million won ($50,800) as a bribe from a 53-year-old lawyer surnamed Choi, with whom she was reportedly in a relationship. Its verdict said the lawyer provided the then-prosecutor with the gifts in an attempt to ask a favor in a criminal case.But the appeals and highest courts reversed the initial ruling, concluding that the two were romantically involved and supporting the defendant’s argument that the gifts were not a bribe but a token of Choi’s love.The case, which had earned nationwide attention, was cited as an example of a loophole in the current legal system as penalizing someone for bribery and corruption by having to prove an exchange of favors.The Supreme Court’s latest decision also drew a loud response on social media, as it coincided with the recent passage of the tough antigraft bill aimed to root out corruption. Under the new anticorruption law that is to go in effect next year, persons found guilty of receiving more than 1 million won in money or kind, regardless of reciprocity, can be sentenced to up to three years in prison.Many netizens also criticized the latest ruling, claiming the judges showed leniency the former prosecutor.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","been indicted for taking kickbacks ,prosecutor to three year jail ,benz sedan worth 55 million ,indicted for taking kickbacks ,bribery charges saying no favors","['South Korea ’s', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'the Supreme Court', 'Lee', 'Mercedes - Benz', 'Choi', 'Choi ’s', 'the Supreme Court ’s', 'netizen', 'Kim Yon - se']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.13933724  0.23389728

Park's ruling Saenuri Party chairman, Kim Moo-sung, will also sit in on the meeting at the presidential office on Tuesday, according to presidential and party officials.""As President Park and Chairman Moon are meeting for the first time since the election, there's a high chance they will cooperate on issues they can cooperate on but also exchange critical remarks on the overall principles underlying state affairs,"" an official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.Park is expected to call for bipartisan support for various economy-related bills pending in parliament as well as her push to reform civil service pensions, officials said. She is also expected to explain the results of her four-nation Middle East trip that ended Monday.Moon, speaking to reporters after a visit to the Korea Federation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises, said his aim is to have ""frank discussions"" on how to revive the economy.""As our economy is in a difficult state, that's probably the biggest concern of the president, and the opposition party's wish is the same,"" he said.On holding his first formal meeting with Park since the election, he said, ""What (special) feelings or thoughts could there be.""Park had a casual meeting with the two party leaders during a government function early this month and agreed to invite them to a formal get-together after she returned from the trip. The meeting was first proposed by her party chief, which the president accepted, the party said.On Friday, Park will also invite Prime Minister Lee One-koo and the respective chiefs of the National Assembly, Supreme Court, Constitutional Court and National Election Commission to brief them on the outcome of her trip to the Middle East, her spokesman Min Kyung-wook said in a press briefing.""I hope it is seen as a move to communicate widely,"" he said, apparently mindful of criticism that Park does not communicate enough in making decisions.The trip to Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar was largely aimed at expanding ties beyond oil and construction to health care and information and communications technology, among other areas.

Investigators asked the ambassador to testify on the assault case as part of the ongoing investigation into the motive of his assailant, Kim Ki-jong, the police said. The U.S. Embassy and the authorities are negotiating on how to deliver the testimony, the police added.If Lippert is not available, investigators may receive the victim’s statement from a representative, they said.In the meantime, the government decided to provide police protection for all foreign envoys here if it is deemed necessary, regardless of their request, as part of heightened efforts to ensure the safety of foreign officials. Police conduct a security training drill in front of the Embassy of Japan in Seoul on Wednesday. (Yonhap)The police have been closely guarding Lippert and his wife around the clock since the attack. They have also enhanced the security measures on all diplomatic properties across the country. According to police, around eight embassies have requested protection for their envoys since last week’s attack.Meanwhile, police continued their investigation into Kim Ki-jong’s alleged pro-North Korean links, and reported confirming more evidence to support a related charge.Of the 30 items confiscated from Kim’s house and office during a raid last week, 19 were found to have contained “enemy-benefiting” contents, the police said. The evidence was examined by experts to determine whether they contain pro-North Korea content.While the suspect was arrested on three charges ― attempted murder, assault on a foreign diplomat and obstruction of official duties ― after attacking Lippert last week, the authorities have separately been looking into whether he violated the security law. Reviewing Kim’s phone record, investigators also found that he had called up several pro-North Korean figures, sources said. The police will grill the suspect over possession of the suspicious items and further investigate whether there were any possible masterminds of the assault, investigators said.They will also try to find out whether Kim was financially supported by pro-North Korea groups, they added. The suspect has reportedly denied all charges and claimed that he had obtained the problematic materials at local rallies in Seoul while doing unification-related studies. Kim is under custody at a police hospital since Tuesday to treat a broken ankle sustained during a tussle with authorities who overpowered him immediately after the attack. He is expected to remain in the hospital for a few more days, medical staff said.

""Lee is suspected of defrauding the government by playing a leading role in providing sub-standard parts for the equipment,"" said a task force official. At the time of the system's introduction, there had been a controversy that EWTS failed to meet the military's requirement and fit the country's security circumstances.The training platform provides a realistic representation of threats through a wide variety of instructor-generated scenarios to improve pilots' ability to survive.Lee is also suspected of illegally acquiring classified information on the state project to upgrade unmanned aerial vehicles.As part of the probe, state investigators also raided the company's headquarters, branch offices and Lee's residence in Seoul earlier in the day, and confiscated the company's classified documents, computer hard disks and account records.Lee, who founded the defense firm in the mid-1980s, has worked as an arms dealer for more than 30 years. He was arrested in 2009 on embezzlement charges while being involved in the country's weapons purchase from Russia.Lee's detention is part of the task force's massive investigation into multiple corruption scandals in the defense industry since November last year.Jung Ok-geun, who served as the Navy Chief of Staff from 2008 to 2010, was indicted for taking 60 million won from a company that brokers sales of German-made communications equipment in 2009, and a handful of former and active-duty officers have been under investigation for alleged graft related to the country's indigenous salvage ship project.A series of allegations prompted Navy chief Adm.

(Yonhap)The suit was filed on Monday in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Queens County, according to U.S.-based law firms representing Kim Do-hee on Wednesday. Kim, a female cabin crew member who served macadamia nuts in a bag instead of on a dish to first-class passenger Cho, a daughter of Korean Air chairman Cho Yang-ho, was verbally and physically abused by the former executive for not following the in-flight service manual on a Seoul-bound Korean Air flight from New York on Dec. 5. Angered by the service, Cho chided the cabin crew chief and ordered the taxiing plane to offload him.“The evidence in this case will demonstrate that Heather Cho’s actions were not only humiliating, degrading and damaging to Kim, but were also emblematic of Cho’s unbridled arrogance and disturbing sense of entitlement,” said Andrew J. Weinstein, founder of The Weinstein Law Firm representing Kim in a press release.He added that he is “very confident that the legal system in New York will find Cho civilly responsible for the extensive damage that she has caused to Kim’s career, reputation and emotional well-being.”During a court testimony in Seoul in January, Kim said Korean Air offered her a position as a college professor in return for giving testimony favorable to Cho in her trial, but she rejected the offer. “Kim had hoped to privately resolve this dispute with Cho and Korean Air without the need for litigation. Unfortunately, Cho and Korean Air, through their respective counsel, have not to date engaged with us in any substantive settlement discussions,” said Jonathan D. Cogan, a partner in the New York office of the international litigation boutique Kobre & Kim. Kim is seeking compensatory damages and punitive damages, and the amount will be determined at the trial.A Korean Air spokesman told The Korea Herald that the company has not yet been able to give an official comment regarding the lawsuit as it has not received a complaint from the plaintiff’s attorney.Kim is currently on sick leave until March 18.In February, the South Korean court sentenced Cho to one year in prison after finding her guilty for violating the aviation safety law and other charges. Cho filed a notice of appeal to the Seoul court on the following day. By Park Han-na and Shin Ji-hye (hnpark@heraldcorp.com)(shinjh@heraldcorp.com)","wednesday kim female cabin crew ,daughter of korean air chairman ,suit was filed on monday ,on wednesday kim female cabin ,filed civil lawsuit against heather","['korean Air', 'Heather Cho', 'the United States', 'the Supreme Court of the State of New York', 'Queens County', 'Kim Do - hee', 'Kim', 'Cho', 'Korean Air', 'Cho Yang - ho', 'Seoul', 'Korean Air', 'New York', 'Cho', 'Heather Cho ’s', 'Kim', 'Cho ’s', 'Andrew J.

""Abe could use the occasion of his visit to the American Congress to formally acknowledge, apologize, and accept historic responsibility in a clear and unequivocal manner for the historic human rights violations committed against the Comfort Women,"" he said.Though most victims have died, survivors deserve justice and closure in their final days, the former lawmaker said. ""They have waited too long. It is time for Japan to apologize,"" he said.Abe could also reaffirm Japan's 1995 statement of apology, known as the Murayama Statement, where the country apologized for its imperialistic past.

Kim Young-ran, who proposed the bill in 2011, also refuted growing concerns that the law may be unconstitutional and abusive for journalists and teachers, citing the need to reform the civilian sector. The bill named after her passed the Assembly last week with over 90 percent of the attending lawmakers approving the bill. The law aims to make it illegal for civil servants, journalists and teachers to receive more than 1 million won ($910) in cash or gifts, regardless of the occasion. The law, however, excludes elected lawmakers from being punished when they lobby for legislation, revision or abolition of the bills and if such activities represent the public value. Kim Young-ran. (Yonhap)Kim strongly denounced that the exclusion of lawmakers could tantamount to them becoming “brokers.” “It is unfortunate that the law was scaled down from its initial draft,” she said during a news conference.“If it goes wrong, (the law) could possibly lead to elected officials like lawmakers being exploited as brokers,” she said. The bill also failed to include measures to prevent civil servants from seeking personal benefits in the areas in which they are designated to work, she said. “There were three elements in the original draft that bans unjust business favors, bribe receiving and the conflict of interests, but only (the first) two elements were included in the final law,” Kim said.She also voiced concerns that the bill requires only spouses of the concerned parties to be subjected to the new rule.Referring to past corruptive cases involving family members of former presidents, Kim urged that the bill should have required children, parents and siblings to report their relatives.Kim said she was surprised that the bill included journalists and teachers of private education institutes. Her original draft was written only to prevent civil servants from abusing their power, she added.Kim, however, opposed the escalating arguments that including journalists and teachers in the bill could go against the Constitution and freedom of press.“I don’t think it violates the Constitution,” she said. Citing a recent poll that showed nearly 70 percent of respondents approving the inclusion, Kim said it is hard to see that the law violated the “equality of rights” and breached the “principle of proportionality” because she believes that the two professions carry roles that are “quasi-public.”But Kim said the law could possibly infringe the freedom of the press and urged lawmakers to come up with a special countermeasure to prevent such things from happening.The remark came after a local lawyers’ group last week filed an appeal to the court arguing that the bill challenges the Constitution.The bill has arbitrarily selected the subjects for regulation, including the press, and violates the principles of equality and precision, the group said. In the face of growing criticism for hastily passing the bill, lawmakers have hinted that they would revise the bill before it goes into effect in September 2016.

By the end of this year, foreign residents will use the council as an opportunity to engage in the city’s policymaking process,” Park said. As of now, the council is likely to be modeled after Kawasaki City Representative Assembly for Foreign Residents in Japan, the officials explained. “The council will serve as an advisory group like the Japanese counterpart, where its members give feedbacks to policymakers,” he said. The council will be the first of its kind in Korea for foreign residents to present their opinion on the city government’s policies. Currently, about 400,000 foreign residents live in Seoul.

Pyongyang flatly denies the accusations as a U.S.-led attempt to topple its regime.""We propose merging and reviewing the Saenuri Party's five bills related to North Korea's human rights situation and NPAD's three North Korean human rights bills at the (relevant) standing committee in April,"" Park Wan-joo, NPAD's floor spokesman, said during a press briefing.Park stressed, however, that his party is opposed to the ruling party's proposal to assist civic groups engaged in sending anti-Pyongyang propaganda leaflets via balloon across the border.The leaflet campaigns have been a source of renewed tension between the Koreas in recent months, leading to a brief exchange of machine gun fire across the border in October.NPAD believes the North should make efforts to improve human rights conditions for its people as the South promotes the North Korean people's rights to freedom and life, Park said. Such efforts should be made in a way that helps improve inter-Korean ties and bring peace and stability to the Korean Peninsula, he added.""We hope a reasonable alternative will be found through careful discussion and consultation (at the standing committee),"" the spokesman said.

Investigators have been gathering evidence to level charges against Kim of violating the National Security Law, as North Korea praised the attack as an “act of justice.” Kim currently faces charges of attempted murder, assault on a foreign diplomat and obstruction of work at a morning seminar in Seoul where the attack occurred. Korean high school students leave comments on a board near the U. S. Embassy on Saturday, wishing U.S. Ambassador Mark Lippert a speedy recovery. (Yonhap)Kim denies any violation of the security law, arguing that he collected the publications as he needed them to write a thesis on the North for his master’s degree, and to study national reunification. He also claims that he has no ties to Pyongyang and never supported the North Korean political system.Among the confiscated items were the “Film Art,” a book that late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il wrote in the 1970s based on the North’s juche (self-reliance) ideology; and a series of periodicals published by the Pan-Korean Coalition for National Unification, a group that the Supreme Court ruled in 1997 had illegally benefited the enemy, namely the North.Kim is thought to have obtained the Film Art and other publications when he visited the North some seven times between 1999 and 2007. In 2007, Kim set up a memorial alter to mourn the death of former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. Last week, investigation authorities mentioned that “enemy-benefitting” materials referred to those carrying contents that could “threaten the existence of the Republic of Korea and the country’s political system of liberal democracy.”Investigators plan to wrap up their initial probe by Friday and hand the case over to the prosecution.North Korea’s Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, meanwhile, claimed the South’s attempt to link Kim with Pyongyang was aimed at shifting the blame on “patriotic forces working for Koreas’ reunification.”“This is aimed to annihilate the patriotic forces for reunification with a villainous attempt to hang more for a plot against (the North),” the statement said.Meanwhile, Lippert is doing well and may be released from hospital as early as Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday morning at the latest, the medical staff said.U.S. Embassy officials said Lippert was grateful for the outpour of encouraging messages from the Korean public and that he was currently reading “The Two Koreas,” a renowned book authored by Don Oberdorfer while on bed rest.Throngs of Korean politicians visited Lippert’s bedside on Sunday, including ruling Saenuri Party chairman Rep.

Yoo Il-ho, named to lead the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, on Monday. Yoo faces allegations of evading 7.64 million won ($6,900) in taxes when he sold an apartment in 2005, according to the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy.A person who has evaded land taxes is not fit to lead a ministry that directs policies on real estate and land, NPAD Rep. Kim Sang-hee charged.Yoo also faces suspicion that he illegally changed the home addresses of his family so that his son could attend schools in wealthier parts of Seoul. Yoo apologized in recent media interviews regarding the accusation.Third-term Saenuri Rep. Yoo Ki-june, picked to head the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, also faces charges that he illegally changed the residential address of his daughter so she could attend a school in a better-off district. He also continued to work as a lawyer during his term as a lawmaker, which pertains to a conflict of interest, opposition officials alleged, vowing a tough questioning session for him on Monday.On Tuesday, the National Assembly will grill Yim Jong-yong, the nominee for the Financial Services Commission chairman. Yim is accused of underreporting a property purchase to pay less taxes in 2004. Unification minister nominee Hong Yong-pyo will attend his hearing on Wednesday. He faces charges of plagiarism and property taxes.On Thursday, lawmakers will examine Jo Yong-gu, nominated to the board of delegates on the National Election commission, the local electoral watchdog.The opposition can delay final approval for the nominees for up to 20 days from the date the presidential office requested the hearings. President Park reserves the right to override any opposition from the legislature, although she risks stiffer Assembly resistance to her policies if she pushes through the nominations over the opposition.Cheong Wa Dae officials sent applications to the Assembly for hearings on four officials on Feb. 25.

Chung Ui-hwa, the Speaker of South Korea’s National Assembly, proposed the plan to U.S. House Speaker John Boehner last week. Chung was to discuss it at the Center for Strategic & International Studies last Saturday until snowstorms canceled the event. Boehner called it a “great idea.” But writing the resolution may spark unexpected disagreements between and within both countries, as it would be forced to mention, or ignore sensitive issues such as North Korea’s nuclear program, Japan’s World War II atrocities and territorial disputes.“The letter will praise the relative peace in Northeast Asia over the past 70 years after World War II, which gave rise to prosperous economies in China, South Korea and Japan,” a South Korean parliamentary source familiar with the proposal said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.“The resolution will urge North Korea to forfeit its nuclear weapons, and the peaceful reunification of the two Koreas,” the source added, noting it could also ask Japan and its neighbors to “resolve disagreements” over history.The source said it was uncertain if the resolution would explicitly mention the comfort women issue. It was also highly unlikely to mention territorial disagreements among Japan and its neighbors.Many in China and South Korea have been demanding Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to reissue “more sincere” apologies for Imperial Japan’s sexual imprisonment of thousands of Asian women during the war, euphemistically known as the comfort women issue.Abe’s apparent denials of the atrocities have sparked anger among Chinese and South Koreans, and worsened ties among the nations. Territorial disputes between Japan and China over islands in the East China Sea, and Japan’s contestation of a set of islets held by South Korea have worsened the situation. The U.S. is expected to be reluctant to take actions that could provoke Japan, a key ally, by openly siding with South Korea and China in the issues of such a resolution, analysts have said.Chung’s potential resolution could also spark protest from constituents in South Korea, who could ask for much stronger wording in any joint resolution with the U.S., against North Korea.If the U.S. ultimately declines to write the joint resolution, South Korea’s legislature is considering writing an exclusive one before Aug. 15, the date marking the end of World War II and Korea’s liberation from Japan’s 35-year occupation of the country.Discussions on the details of the resolution have been initiated by Chung and the foreign affairs committee chief of the South Korean Assembly, Rep.

""Despite any suspicion (the Incheon Immigration Office) might have, asylum seekers should be given the opportunity to be evaluated for refugee status and be provided with permissible legal protection while going through the necessary procedure,"" the Seoul High Court ruling said. In late 2013, a fugitive running from conscription in his war-ridden home country in Africa was denied the right to apply for sanctuary here on grounds that there were inconsistencies in his account.The man, whose identity has been withheld, spent the next year taking legal action against the Incheon Immigration Office and went through several appeals trials in the process to seek a chance to enter the country and have his application for refugee status submitted for evaluation.Immigration officials decided not to appeal the latest outcome, making the ruling final and the first case to reverse the immigration office's decision to deny an asylum seeker's application for refugee status. ""We hope the authorities will work to bring a groundbreaking change to the immigration system,"" said an attorney who represented the defendant.  ""The country needs to improve its immigration system and have it updated in line with its Refugee Law,"" he added. Earlier in 2013, the Justice Ministry revised the Refugee Law to provide financial aid to those applying for refugee status.Under the amended law, applicants awaiting their outcome are given living costs or are allowed to stay at a facility for up to six months after submitting their applications.Last year, 2,896 foreigners sought asylum in South Korea, of which 94 were accepted, according to the Korea Immigration Service.The figure does not include those from North Korea.

It also raised safety worries in a city with a reputation as a relatively low-risk diplomatic posting, despite regular threats of war from North Korea.While an extreme example, the attack is the latest act of political violence in a deeply divided country where some protesters portray their causes as matters of life and death.Lippert, 42, was recovering well but complaining of pain in the wound near his left wrist and a finger where doctors repaired nerve damage, Severance Hospital official Yoon Do-Heum said in a televised briefing. Doctors plan to remove the 80 stitches on Lippert's face on Monday or Tuesday and expect him to be out of the hospital by Tuesday or Wednesday. Hospital officials say he may experience sensory problems in his left hand for several months.Seoul Central District Court granted a police request for the formal arrest of the suspect, Kim Ki-jong, 55, who could face charges including attempted murder, assaulting a foreign envoy, obstruction, and violating a controversial law that bans praise or assistance for North Korea, police officials said.Police searched Kim's offices and house and seized hundreds of documents, books and computer files. Police also obtained Kim's telecommunication and financial transaction records to help investigate how the attack was planned and whether others were involved, police officials said.Police are also looking into Kim's past travels to North Korea — seven times between 1999 and 2007 — during a previous era of inter-Korean cooperation, when South Korea was led by a liberal government.Kim, who has a long history of anti-U.S. and violent protests, said he acted alone in the attack on Lippert. He told police he was protesting annual U.S.-South Korean military drills that started Monday — exercises that the North has long maintained are preparations for an invasion.Security for Lippert was another focus.U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said Lippert had one full-time bodyguard assigned from the Seoul metropolitan police. She said Seoul is not a ""high-threat"" environment in which the U.S. Bureau of Diplomatic Security would deploy its own guards to protect the ambassador. She said ""several"" more South Korean police have now been added to Lippert's security detail.According to a Seoul police officer who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing office rules, 29 officers were deployed as a precaution at Thursday's event, although all but four were on standby outside the building, the officer said.""We are still getting all the facts about how people were screened to get into this event, how people were on the list, how they were allowed in,"" Harf told reporters in Washington.Harf condemned North Korea's gloating response to the attack as ""outrageously callous but unfortunately consistent with the nature of the regime and its rhetoric.""Kim was well-known among police and activists as one of a hard-core group of protesters willing to use violence to highlight their causes. He received a three-year suspended sentence in 2010 for throwing a piece of concrete at the Japanese ambassador to Seoul while protesting Japan's claim to small disputed islands that are occupied by South Korea.More recently, Kim had been under investigation by Seoul prosecutors after allegedly assaulting at least one public employee at an outdoor pop concert in January.When Kim entered the hall where the attack occurred, a police officer asked one of the event organizers whether he should be allowed to enter, Jongno district police Chief Yun Myung-sung told reporters. The organizing official answered that Kim could enter because he was associated with an organization that had been invited to the meeting.A security expert called the police inept.""There is no excuse for allowing a blacklisted person to enter the venue for an event like this,"" said Yu Hyung-chang, a professor at Kyungnam University in Changwon who served in South Korea's presidential secret service for 20 years until 2000.Lippert became ambassador last October, and is a popular figure.

The wounds weren't life-threatening, but the attack left a deep gash extending from the envoy's right chin to cheek, requiring more than 80 stitches.The Seoul Central District Court issued an arrest warrant for Kim, saying ""The reason and the necessity of his arrest were fully explained.""Before entering the court for a hearing to review the legality of his arrest, Kim said he had no ties to North Korea.""That's nonsense,"" he told reporters when asked about the police investigation into the possibility.He denied being sympathetic to Pyongyang and having ever been to the country despite police announcements earlier to the contrary.He also shook his head when asked if he had an intent to kill and said there was no one else involved.Kim had previously told police officers that he plotted the attack to stop the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle exercises that kicked off earlier this week.The exercises are part of Seoul and Washington's efforts to better deter threats from North Korea. Kim said he thought the drills hampered efforts to re-unify the two Koreas as they remain technically at war since the Korean War in the 1950s ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.Hwang Sang-hyeon, Kim's attorney, also said the attack was not premeditated. In mid-February, Kim received a letter of invitation from the organizer, and it was then he decided to confront the ambassador about the joint military drills, according to Hwang.""He hadn't planned on bringing the knife until (Thursday) morning,"" Hwang told reporters as he took from a break from police interrogation late Thursday. ""He was trying to alarm the U.S. but had nothing personal against the ambassador.""The task force said it may add the charge of violating South Korea's National Security Law if they come by enough evidence to support their case. The law bans South Koreans from publicly sympathizing with the North Korean government.Authorities said they have discovered ""treasonous books"" at Kim's home during a raid carried out earlier in the day.In a second press briefing on Friday, Yoon Myeong-seong, chief of Jongno Police Station in Seoul, said they have taken 219 items from his home and office in the western Seoul district of Seodaemun. These included Kim's PC hardware, hard drives, USBs, floppy disks and a letter of invitation from Thursday's event organizer.Yoon said they were particularly interested in some of these items that were ""suspected of being pro-North Korea in nature"" but he refused to detail the amount and what he meant by the description.A preliminary probe has already shown that Kim had been to North Korea seven times between 1999 and 2007. Kim did not appear suspicious during these trips that were approved by the unification ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs. He also tried to erect an altar at the heart of Seoul in memory of late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il in December 2011 shortly after he passed away.Formed earlier Friday, the special investigation team is comprised of more than 100 prosecutors and police officers, and will be led by the anti-terrorism bureau of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.South Korea's prosecution-general ordered a thorough inquiry into the case, which he said shocked the entire world.""We must proactively respond to serious crimes like terrorism and strongly punish those responsible,"" he said in a meeting of senior prosecutors on Friday.It is the first time a top U.S. envoy here has been attacked.Kim was also behind the first-ever assault of a foreign envoy here when he threw a rock at a Japanese ambassador to Seoul in 2010.A police officer said the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation(FBI) has asked the South Korean authorities to share information on the investigation. The FBI won't participate in the actual probe but will make requests about the probe's direction, he addedEarly Friday, police raided Kim's home and office for documents and hard drives, which they said will help them learn how Kim planned the attack and why. They also intend to illuminate whether he had an accomplice. Police have also been issued a warrant to obtain Kim's phone and email recordsLippert, 42, became the youngest-ever U.S. envoy to Seoul last year. His wife gave birth to a son here, to whom they gave a Korean middle name. He was previously the assistant secretary of defense for Asian and Pacific security affairs from 2011 to 2012.

Police said they found a number of materials which indicated his pro-North Korean views during raids on his home and office in western Seoul early in the morning. They also sought a warrant to track Kim’s phone records. Kim Ki-jong (Yonhap)Kim claimed that he acted alone but President Park Geun-hye and top officials called for the law enforcement agencies to ferret out possible masterminds of the assault condemning pro-North Korean elements. “We concurred that this incident should be defined as an act by the followers of North Korea and the masterminds and the truth behind it should be thoroughly investigated,” said Yoo Seong-min, floor leader of the ruling Saenuri Party after a three-way meeting of top-level officials from the presidential office, the party and the administration. During a trip to the UAE, President Park also instructed a thorough investigation. “As the suspect was found to have committed similar crimes before, (investigators) must thoroughly reveal the case to prevent any reoccurrence, including why the suspect committed the attack and whether there was someone behind it,” Park was quoted as saying.Investigators are looking into whether the attacker violated the National Security Law. Kim has reportedly claimed that he did not have any intentions to kill the envoy and committed the attack on his own because he wanted to stop the ongoing bilateral military drills that kicked off earlier this week.The authorities, however, suspected that Kim had planned the crime 10 days in advance and that he attacked the ambassador’s face and hand multiple times with willful negligence. The court will determine whether to arrest the suspect no later than Saturday, the police said. The Unification Ministry has confirmed that he had visited North Korea seven times between 1999 and 2007. Kim toured Mount Geungangsan one time and visited the border city of Gaeseong six times to participate in tree-planting events as a member of a left-wing civic group, the ministry said.He had also attempted to set up an altar near Seoul City Hall in memory of the North’s former leader Kim Jong-il after the dictator’s death in December 2011, it added.In order to investigate whether there were others behind the attack, the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office launched a special probe team, comprised of about 100 police officers and prosecutors. The team will be led by prosecutors in charge of anticommunism and antiterrorism, officials said.The special probe team will further investigate how and why the suspect had planned the crime, they added. Meanwhile, Lippert is recovering and in a stable condition after undergoing an emergency surgery, medical staff said.

He was arrested at the scene.The activist had not been invited to the event, nor was he a member of the Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation, the civic group that had invited Lippert to its morning conference, Saenuri Party Rep. Chang Yoon-seok said. Chang was sitting next to the ambassador when the assault took place.“The event was open to the public. I think that’s why he was allowed into the conference room without much fuss,” the lawmaker said. (Yonhap)According to Chang, Kim had been sitting a few feet away from the head table, where he was seated with Lippert.“It happened in a mere few seconds,” he said.Chang and a few others at the scene wrestled Kim down. Police arrived a few minutes later and carried him away.Kim suffered a broken ankle during the tussle, police said.He later confessed he had prepared his attack for 10 days, after finding out about the event.In 2010, the activist was reportedly arrested on charges of throwing blocks of concrete toward then-Japanese Ambassador Toshinori Shigeie during his lecture in Seoul. He was given a two-year jail term suspended for three years.Kim has been engaged in a series of campaigns, including one to safeguard Korea’s easternmost islets of Dokdo. In 2006 after Japan’s Shimane prefecture declared its Takeshima Day, after the Japanese name for Dokdo, Kim, along with other activists, changed their home addresses to one located on the islets.

The 39-year-old man in Daegu, whose information was withheld, submitted a petition to Daegu District Court for a new trial, officials said. He was sentenced to a two-year jail term with eight months of probation for cheating on his wife in July 2013. If he is acquitted in the retrial, his criminal record will be removed, law officials said. The Constitutional Court abolished the anticheating law last Thursday with a 7-2 decision. The judges ruled that the 62-year-old law breached individuals’ sexual rights and privacy. While about 100,000 people have been found guilty since the law was enacted in 1953, only around 3,000 people are eligible to ask for a retrial, law authorities said.

For gifts that are work-related and worth 1 million won or less, the penalty is a fine of up to five times the gift's value.The bill was drawn up to tighten loopholes in existing anti-corruption rules under which public officials cannot be punished for accepting expensive gifts and services unless there is evidence of reciprocity.On Wednesday, both the ruling Saenuri Party and main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy acknowledged the need to review the details of the law.""We will humbly listen to all opinions about loopholes or side effects and in the one and a half years of preparation, if there is a need to supplement the legislation, we will do so,"" Rep. Yoo Seong-min, the floor leader of the ruling party, said during a party meeting.The ruling party especially raised concerns about excluding civic groups from those subject to the law and the vagueness of what constitutes an illegal request for a favor.The main opposition party, meanwhile, expressed concern about the possibility of ""targeted investigations"" by prosecutors and the police, and excessive legislation.""There must be parallel efforts to build an institutional guarantee against the prosecution's abuse of authority through prosecution reforms,"" Rep. Kang Gi-jung, NPAD's chief policymaker, said in a phone interview with Yonhap News Agency.In a press conference at the main government complex in Seoul, the ACRC's current chief, Lee Sung-bo, vowed to do all he can to ensure the new law takes root at an early date.""We will work hard to resolve the controversy by supplementing the areas the public is concerned about in the process of drawing up relevant enforcement ordinances and rules,"" he said. ""We will do our best to ensure that this law, which carries the people's desire for integrity, becomes a new milestone that makes our society more transparent and clean.""A survey conducted by polling agency Realmeter showed that 64 percent of those surveyed approved of the bill's passage. The survey was conducted on 500 adults on Tuesday and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.The bill's passage had been delayed amid wrangling over various details, including a clause that requires public officials to report a family member's acceptance of a bribe.Critics argued that the clause infringes on the constitutionally-guaranteed freedom of conscience and destroys family relationships.Ahead of the bill's passage, the rival parties agreed to keep that clause but limit the scope of another clause to apply the law only to public officials and their spouses, not their other family members. The official, not the spouse, would be subject to the relevant punishment.The parties also agreed to allow an 18-month grace period for enforcement of the law from the date of its proclamation.Last year, South Korea climbed three notches in an international corruption awareness ranking to 43rd out of 175 countries, according to Transparency International, the Berlin-based anti-corruption watchdog.South Korea scored 55 out of 100 in the 2014 Corruption Perceptions Index, with high scores meaning low corruption.

The National Assembly voted 226 to four, with 17 abstaining, passing the Kim Young-ran bill, named after the former Supreme Court Justice and ex-chief of the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission who initially proposed it.According to the new law, it will be illegal for officials or their spouses to take more than 1 million won ($908), or an equal amount of gifts, in kickbacks. Those who take less than 1 million won will be fined. Journalists, teachers and civil servants will also be subject to the restrictions. Officials will be obligated to report kickbacks suspected to have been taken by their husbands or wives.Monetary kickbacks will encompass all financial benefits including money, marketable securities, real estate, goods, accommodation vouchers, memberships or coupons.  Public servants leave the government complex in central Seoul on Tuesday. (Yonhap)Providing entertainment including eating out, drinking or playing golf will be restricted up to an amount to be set by a follow-up presidential decree. Honorariums for public servants delivering speeches at seminars or writing contributory articles will also be restricted to a certain amount.The court will be in charge of imposing punishments.The law will take effect 18 months after it is approved by the Cabinet, which is likely to take place this month.Tuesday’s vote came after a compromise between the floor leaders of the governing Saenuri Party and the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy late Monday, wrapping up years of wrangling among legislators on the bill’s details.The first draft, proposed in June 2011, suggested making it illegal for officials or their family members to take a material gift, however small. The bill enjoyed widespread public support, but lawmakers were slow to legislate it, saying the first draft was overly inclusive and harsh.Christmas presents such as game consoles or chocolates could be considered kickbacks according to the draft, critical lawmakers said. The bill could apply to up to 20 million citizens, in a country of 50 million, they added, as the bill included officials’ extended families.But public pressure to pass the bill has been mounting since a ferry disaster last April killed over 300, mostly high school students. Known as the Sewol disaster, the accident was mainly caused by relaxed safety oversight over the sunken ferry’s equipment by maritime officials who took kickbacks from the ship’s owners, initial probes showed. Some lawmakers had taken similar bribes, prosecutors alleged.In January, the Assembly’s National Policy Committee came up with a bipartisan revision to the bill similar to the final version.But parties had disagreed over details until the last minute, such as whether officials and their families would be obligated to report on each other, the scope of family members that would be affected by the bill and the amount of kickbacks that would be considered illegal.Debate is likely to continue over the scope of the bill, mainly over the possibility of excessive control by the authorities. Watchers also criticized the bill for omitting clauses directly relevant to incumbent lawmakers.Saenuri Rep. Kweon Seong-dong claimed the bill would cause distrust within families of public servants. He also alleged authorities could abuse the bill to conduct one-sided investigations into political opponents of an incumbent administration.Other bills were passed in Tuesday’s plenary session, including one aiming to facilitate crowdfunding for start-ups and another extending the central government’s subsidy for the Hub City of Asian Culture project in Gwangju, among others. The HCAC is a 5.3 trillion won plan to build new libraries, theaters and research centers for the fine arts in South Korea’s sixth most populous city.Parties also agreed to set up a special committee to remap voting districts before next year’s parliamentary elections.

He allegedly offered the companies contracts to build Navy ships in return. The bribes were provided in the form of a sponsorship to a yacht event arranged by Jung's son, investigators said. The yacht company whose majority stake was owned by the younger Jung went out of business shortly thereafter, raising suspicions that it may have been a paper company.Jung's son, a former Navy officer, and a non-executive director of an STX Group affiliate have also been indicted for collusion.

(Yonhap)Kang hadn't asked for Shin's approval when he surgically shrank the singer's stomach and accidentally punctured the small intestine and pericardium - the sac that surrounds the heart and roots of great blood vessels - in the process, police said.An infection caught on quickly, but Kang failed to take necessary measures to treat the inflammation in the lining of Shin's stomach, according to police. Shin died on Oct. 27 of complications.Police said Kang had downplayed Shin's symptoms despite their potentially fatal nature. Kang had allegedly told Shin that the high fever, abnormal surge in white blood cell count and extreme pain were ""part of the normal recovery process.""In a statement released later in the day, Kang denied any wrongdoing. ""Shrinking a stomach means 70-80% of the stomach tissue has been removed.

Prosecutors at the Seoul Central Prosecutors’ Office said Koo is accused of receiving more than 1 billion won ($909,000) in cash and a luxury car from a KOSDAQ-listed company executive, in exchange for promising him a 5 billion won investment in 2010. However, the investment was never made and the plaintiff had to pay for corporate tax and other costs while squeezing out the 1 billion won kickback for Koo, according to court papers. Prosecutors said Koo had allegedly forced the plaintiff to give him a 700 million won kickback from a 1 billion won donation Koo gave to a charity foundation run by the plaintiff’s father. Koo had also allegedly pocketed another 300 million won in cash and a 90 million won Mercedes-Benz car for his girlfriend. Local broadcaster YTN reported that LG’s lawyers tried to downplay the case, asking the plaintiff to cover up Koo Bon-ho’s name. An LG spokesman did not respond to The Korea Herald’s calls for comment.Koo is the grandson of Koo Jeong-hoe, the younger brother of LG Group founder Koo In-hoe. He is the second cousin of current LG chairman Koo Bon-moo. Koo Bon-ho earlier this year made headlines when he announced a joint project with Hyosung heir and Hyosung Corp. CEO Cho Hyun-joon, which involves some 40 billion won in investment. This includes a 12 billion won investment in online game company Action Square.

Under Monday's bipartisan deal, the bill will be passed through a plenary session on Tuesday.The new law will subject public officials, journalists and private school teachers to a maximum penalty of three years in prison or five times the amount they accepted in money or valuables if they take money or valuables worth more than 1 million won ($908) from one person in one installment, regardless of whether it was in exchange for favors or related to their work.Passage of the bill has been delayed amid wrangling over its details, including a clause that requires public officials to report a family member's acceptance of a bribe.Critics have argued that the clause violates the freedom of conscience and destroys family relationships.On Monday, the ruling Saenuri Party and main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy agreed to remove that clause and limit the scope of another clause to apply the law only to an individual's spouse, not their immediate and extended family members.The parties also agreed to allow a 18-month grace period for enforcement of the law from the date of its passage as proposed by the government.The bill, which is designed to tighten loopholes in existing anti-corruption rules, stirred up a heated debate about whether it would make civil servants reluctant to perform their duties from fear of punishment.(Yonhap)","tuesday under monday bipartisan deal ,rival political parties agreed monday ,anti corruption bill following months ,tuesday the new law will ,monday bipartisan deal the bill","['Kim Young - ran Law', 'Saenuri Party', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36245394  0.24878027

(Yonhap)The move came after two deadly shootings in Sejong and Hwaseong cities last week. During their talks on Monday, lawmakers and policymakers agreed to enhance regulations on hunting rifles, including introducing tougher screening procedures for gun permits and better training for gun owners.The mandate requires that all guns be tracked with GPS devices. Further, anyone with a prison record would be banned from possessing rifles, according to participants at the meeting.In addition, ammunition will only be available near hunting grounds, and any unused rounds must be returned to police. Guns must now be stored at designated police stations with jurisdiction over the registered user.Meeting participants included Saenuri lawmakers and officials from the National Emergency Management Agency and the National Police Agency.They shared the view that current regulations on rifle usage were relatively lax. Guns can be taken out of any police station in the country and transported freely. The present law also allows ordinary citizens to possess air rifles with a caliber of up to 5.5 millimeters and up to 400 live bullets.

In April 2014, U.S. President Barack Obama called Japan's sexual enslavement of Korean women a ""terrible and egregious violation of human rights.""But Sherman's recent remarks stirred controversy here as Washington may have changed its course due to its own interests by apparently tilting toward Japan, which is in talks with Washington over a U.S.-led trade deal dubbed the Trans-Pacific Partnership.An official at the foreign ministry said that the U.S. has maintained the stance that countries in Northeast Asia need to develop future-oriented relations after healing the wounds from the past.""We understand that Sherman's remarks were made based on this basic U.S. stance,"" the official said. ""Sherman also mentioned in detail that Seoul is also Washington's ally and friend that shares core values with the U.S.""Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yong told lawmakers that Seoul will deal with this issue ""with a sense of gravity.""""Seoul's foreign ministry does not take her comments lightly,""Cho said.

Hikes in the tobacco tax and income tax for low and middle-income earners this year went against Park’s pledge to keep taxes steady, they said.NPAD lawmakers also demanded that the government raise corporate taxes and the minimum wage to close the income gap between the rich and poor. South Korea’s gini coefficient ― statistical measure of income disparity ― is 0.302 as of 2013, according to the Bank of Korea.“Government reforms seem to have helped only the rich,” said NPAD Rep. Chang Byoung-wan. “President Park’s tax policies are also full of incongruities. Do you still think there were no tax hikes, as President Park has been claiming?”“The (tax) rises did not come about from any kind of foul play by the government,” Prime Minster Lee said in response. “We are aware there have been some difficulties due to the raised levies on tobacco.”Finance Minister Choi told lawmakers more taxes would be a “last resort.”South Korea’s public debt is estimated at around 900 trillion won ($820 billion) according to finance ministry figures announced in December. Lower-than-expected government tax revenues for the third consecutive year also add to debt concerns.Outstanding household loans of 1,030 trillion won at the end of December 2014, as estimated by BOK, also worries policymakers. They say more debt could spark a stagnation similar to Japan’s in the 1990s and 2000s. Household credit ― loans and credit purchases ― reached 1,090 trillion won, central bank officials said Thursday.Experts have said South Korea’s deflationary fears could be exaggerated, although others including economists at Goldman Sachs, Societe Generale, and BOK Governor Lee Ju-yeol, have warned private debt levels deserved closer attention.Politicians are likewise divided.The governing party is torn between a faction backing decreased welfare payments by the government and another faction backing President Park’s view that the economy cannot afford additional taxes. They say readjusting tax regulations could bring in up to 135 trillion won in untapped money.The main opposition demands higher corporate taxes and a reversal in Finance Minister Choi’s policies on the real estate market. Choi’s policy of easing lending rules to induce home buying only increases private debt, and is a long-term risk, the NPAD says.The NPAD supports stimulating growth by raising disposable income levels among middle and low-income earners.

(Yonhap)The Act on the Prevention of Illegal Solicitation proposes criminal punishment for public officials who receive money, products or services that reach or exceed 1 million won ($910) in value. It is currently pending at the Legislation and Judiciary Committee of the National Assembly. The antigraft act has been in limbo since Kim suggested it in 2012, but resurfaced last year following a ferry accident in April that left over 300 dead or missing. The accident revealed a network of corruption involving both public and private sector officials. Under the growing public outcry against corruption among civil servants, the act was finally passed by a parliamentary subcommittee in January, 17 months after it had first been presented to the lawmakers.But the act ― which originally targeted civil servants ― has become a hot issue since lawmakers expanded the scope of the bill to include the media and private school teachers. Rep. Lee Sang-min of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, who chairs the parliamentary legislation committee, said the lawmakers should accept the original version of the bill. He said that the current version of the act has parts that could be seen as unconstitutional.“It is not appropriate to label (the act itself) as unconstitutional, just because it applies to a wider range of people,” ACRC chief Lee recently said in a meeting with reporters. But he acknowledged that there needed to be sufficient discussion on whether or not to apply the anticorruption act to nonpublic officials as well.In addition, Lee said the ACRC was promoting the enactment of a bill to prevent false claims on public finances that will help the government prevent wasteful budget items. The ACRC is also set to revise an act on protecting whistleblowers, which will encourage more anonymous reporting of corruption in various sectors, he added.The ACRC has been hosting an annual policy briefing for foreign business leaders here, offering them a chance to raise suggestions and complaints about difficulties they have encountered while acquiring information on policy changes. Participants at this year’s event included James Kim, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Korea; Toni Schreibweiss, European Chamber of Commerce in Korea vice chairman; and Hiroe Tadashi, Seoul Japan Club vice chairman.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","antigraft policies to fight corruption ,thursday held policy briefing for ,commerce in korea toni schreibweiss ,policy briefing for foreign businesses ,thursday held policy briefing","['Korea', 'korean', 'Lee Sung - bo', 'the Anti - Corruption and Civil Rights Commission', 'Lee Sung - bo', 'the Anti - Corruption and Civil Rights Commission', 'the Legislation and Judiciary Committee', 'the National Assembly', 'Kim', 'Lee Sang - min', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'ACRC', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'ACRC', 'ACRC', 'ACRC', 'James Kim', 'the American Chamber of Commerce', 'Korea', 'Toni Schreibweiss', 'European Chamber of Commerce', 'Korea', 'Hiroe Tadashi', 'Seoul Japan Club', 'Yoon Min - sik']",2,[1.         0.         0.         ... 0.02681425 0.58551365 0.33480701]

By law, South Korean presidents serve a single five-year term and cannot seek reelection. From left: Government Policy Coordination Minister Choo Kyung-ho, Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan, Saenuri floor leader Rep. Yoo Seung-min, Presidential Senior Secretary for Policy Coordination Hyun Jung-taik, Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea, Saenuri Policy Committee Chairman Won Yoo-chul and deputy floor leader Cho Hae-jin hold hands for a photo at a meeting of the newly launched trilateral committee on policy coordination on Wednesday. (Yonhap)“We have reached common ground to have the party take the lead in policy drives,” said Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea, who also serves as vice prime minister for social affairs.“Since the National Assembly is important (for the legislation of related bills) and the party is close to the people, it is better for the party to take a center role for smooth communication with the people,” he said after the meeting.At the meeting, officials also agreed to speed up efforts to pass bills aimed at improving people’s livelihoods and revamping the public servants’ pension system, as well as salvaging the ferry in which more than 300 died when it sank last year.The trilateral committee, representing the government, Cheong Wa Dae and the ruling Saenuri Party, was launched last month as part of Park’s efforts to regain momentum for her reform drive and for smooth communication with the party.Since early last year, she has been calling for massive restructuring of the private and public sectors, including the reform of the public servants’ pension system, education, labor and financial markets. Hit hard by a series of political scandals and nomination debacles as well as escalating discord with her party, Park has been seeking a way to bring her reform drive back on track.Experts say that the launch of the trilateral committee for policy coordination may have come from Park’s “accurate assessment” of the current political situation that she will not be able to push ahead with reform plans without support from the party. “So far, Park’s office reigned over the government and the party, and isolated its partners over policy coordination, which in return resulted in public concerns over inconsistent policies such as tax settlements and the health insurance system,” said Yoon Pyung-joong, a professor at Hanshin University.Observers also noted that Saenuri Party’s taking the lead in the committee signifies a shift from Cheong Wa Dae exercising exclusive power in policymaking to sharing power and responsibility with the party. “The president may have decided to lend more power to the party, as she has realized it won’t work without the party’s support,” Yoon said.Rep. Yoo Seung-min, the Saenuri Party floor leader, urged the president, who celebrated her third year in office on Wednesday, to drastically revise her policy directions.Yoo, a nonmainstream lawmaker who defeated former Maritime Minister Rep. Lee Joo-young in the party’s primary vote last month, has been taking a critical approach to the president’s policies, particularly “welfare expansion without a tax hike.”Yoo’s victory was also seen as consolidating Saenuri chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung’s control of the party. Kim is known to be a longtime rival of Park.Meanwhile, Park kicked off her third year in office by holding a meeting with presidential staff.She called for more efforts to initiate economic reform and prepare for inter-Korean unification.The two-year anniversary comes as Park has suffered from deepening public distrust in recent weeks.

Hwang left for Russia on Monday for a three-day visit.  Hwang said that five countries -- South Korea, the United States, China, Japan and Russia -- have narrowed gaps over conditions for the resumption of the denuclearization talks that also involve North Korea through a series of recent bilateral and trilateral meetings among the five nations' top nuke negotiators.  ""The five countries have built consensus about the need to have 'exploratory talks' to gauge whether North Korea is serious about denuclearization before reopening the six-party forum,"" Hwang told Korean correspondents in Moscow. ""Six-way exploratory dialogue involving the North can be also taken into account.""  Hwang said that the consensus will be delivered to Pyongyang in an appropriate manner, expressing hope that North Korea could respond to such a request with sincerity.  The six-party talks have been dormant since December 2008 when the North abruptly left the bargaining table.  North Korea has demanded the resumption of the six-party talks without preconditions, but Seoul and Washington have said that the North should first demonstrate its seriousness about denuclearization. China, the host of the six-party talks, has claimed that Seoul and Washington should lower the bar for the resumption of such talks.  Exploratory dialogue can be held without strings attached to test North Korea's willingness to abandon its nuke program before the six-party talks formally resume.  The format of such talks can be seen as a compromise as Seoul and Washington stressed Pyongyang show sincerity toward denuclearization, while the North, China and Russia put more focus on the reopening of the six-party talks without preconditions.  But it is not clear whether North Korea will accept the offer by the five nations, given Pyongyang's deteriorated relations with Washington or whether having exploratory talks could lead to the resumption of the six-party talks.  South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se told a cable TV news channel that excluding the North, the other four nations have considerably appreciated the so-called Korean Formula, Seoul's initiative to resume the six-party talks in a ""multifaceted and creative"" manner.  ""We believe that the level to which North Korea can show its sincerity toward denuclearization is neither too high nor too low. (The Korean Formula) contains contents involving a proper level to which the North is able to begin to denuclearize,"" Yun told YTN, without elaborating. Pyongyang offered on Jan. 10 to temporarily halt nuclear tests if the U.S. suspends its annual military exercises with South Korea this year, a proposal flatly rejected by Seoul and Washington. North Korea's provocative acts could increase next month as Seoul and Washington have announced their plan to conduct annual joint military drills in March, which has been denounced by Pyongyang as rehearsals for an invasion of the North.  The North has advanced its nuclear capacity following its nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013.

The president has also been calling for public support for her reform drive, stressing that the New Year is the “last golden time” to push ahead with the plan. Contrary to her wishes, Park now faces a political crisis with questions building over her authoritative, top-down leadership, which remains unchanged despite constant demands from the public.A series of political scandals involving conflicts between groups of aides as well as the government’s inconsistent policies on tax and health insurance has damaged her credibility. President Park Geun-hye attends a lunch meeting with a group of business tycoons on corporate support for culture at Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul on Tuesday. From left are POSCO chairman Kwon Oh-joon, Samsung Electronics vice chairman Lee Jay-yong, LG Group chairman Koo Bon-moo, President Park, Korea Mecenat Association chief Park Yong-hyun, Hyundai Motor vice chairman Chung Eui-sun, CJ Group chairman Sohn Kyungshik, EAGON chairman Park Young-ju and Naver founder Lee Hae-jin. (Yonhap)Presidential documents were leaked to media late last year, raising speculation over lax discipline within Cheong Wa Dae. Park also came under fire after she refused to abandon her aides involved in a related influence-peddling scandal.She continued to struggle over her tax policies as the government backtracked on its initial plan to revise the tax settlement scheme in the face of public worries that the middle class would have to pay more.Her approval ratings plummeted to below 30 percent on Jan. 27, the lowest rating since she entered office. According to local pollster Realmeter, her job ratings quickly rebounded to 36 percent last week. But the score is still far lower than when her leadership was questioned in the wake of the Sewol ferry accident. Critics say that her second year was “full of disappointment,” noting that she should have reached out more to the public and given more leeway to the Cabinet to actively work on her reform drives.“Park handled foreign affairs relatively well during her second year but failed entirely on home affairs, particularly on her promise to bring about national unity,” said Yoon Pyung-joong, a professor at Hanshin University.Yoon stressed that the people started to “feel heavy” due to perceptions that she is an uncommunicative leader.“People have suffered from economic downturns for many years, not just this time,” Yoon said.“It is the leadership that gives hopes to the people in times of difficulty. But with Park, a president only reads reports day and night alone at the presidential office, people started to feel distanced from her and give up seeking hope from her.”Last week, Park appointed a new prime minister and conducted a partial Cabinet reshuffle, as part of her efforts to restore public confidence. With a new lineup, however, the president needs to keep her pledge to share more responsibility with the prime minister and minsters by allowing them greater discretion in decision-making and personnel choices, said Yoon of Hanshin University.But experts say she may have already lost her opportunity to push ahead with her reform drive.“I think she put too much focus on diplomacy during her first two years in office,” said Choi Young-jin, a political science professor at ChungAng University in Seoul. Choi lashed out by saying that she enjoyed “Cinderella moments” through introducing her mantra of a creative economy and trustpolitik, the centerpiece of her North Korean policies, during her series of presidential trips.“She missed the right time to push ahead with her reform efforts and other major agendas such as restructuring the public servants’ pension system and health insurance. Now is too late,“ he said. Despite the pessimistic views, Yoon Hee-woong, head of public opinion research firm Min Consulting, said it was too early to say she had entered lame duck status.“The possibility is still high that Park will restore public confidence, as she and her governing party hold a strong and loyal base of conservative supporters,” he said. The Saenuri Party currently holds 158 seats in the 295-strong parliament.As for inter-Korean relations, Park has been praised for her principled approach to forging a normal state-to-state relationship with Pyongyang ― rather than pampering a recalcitrant North with unconditional largesse.But she has also been criticized for being inflexible in breaking the prolonged cross-border impasse ― a reason why calls have been mounting for her to be more active in tackling bilateral issues including the issue of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War.Inter-Korean tensions have remained high due to the North’s provocative behavior and menacing rhetoric. The North has constantly warned of retaliation against South Korean activists who send balloons filled with anti-Pyongyang leaflets to the North and demanded that Seoul and Washington cancel their allied military drills. Amid its verbal threats and shows of force, the impoverished North has also demanded that the South lift its economic sanctions against it, resume the long-stalled tours to Mount Geumgangsan and agree to reopen the multilateral aid-for-denuclearization talks without preconditions.Observers say that Park needs to devise creative options to defuse inter-Korean tensions and forge momentum to block Pyongyang from further developing its nuclear weapons, rather than rigidly calling for sincerity in the North’s denuclearization commitments.On the wider diplomatic front, Park’s pursuit of improved ties with Beijing has been hailed as foreign policy feat.In a departure from her predecessor’s excessive focus on enhancing relations with the U.S., Park has sought to deepen and broaden the strategic partnership with China, a crucial partner for trade, tourism and efforts to denuclearize the North.At the same time, Park has made strong efforts to maintain the traditional security alliance with the U.S.Through the conclusion of free trade negotiations with China, Seoul has strengthened its economic partnership with Beijing. It has also deepened its security cooperation to cope with the North through bilateral summits and various strategic dialogue channels.Over the course of just two years, Park has met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping six times and with Premier Li Keqiang once, which analysts say reflects the closer partnership she has built with the emergent Asian power.But the improved relations with Beijing have also posed a diplomatic challenge to Seoul. Amid the intensifying strategic competition between the U.S. and China, the South was forced to make tough strategic choices on several occasions.China has pressured the South not to allow the U.S.’ deployment of an additional missile defense asset to the peninsula and to participate in the scheme to establish the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, which the U.S. sees as a move by China to exclude it and lead the regional financial order.Over recent years, the South’s relationship with Japan has worsened due to Tokyo’s failure to fully atone for its wartime misdeeds including its sexual enslavement of Asian women during World War II. Tokyo’s continued claim to South Korea’s easternmost islets of Dokdo has continued to be a source of diplomatic friction between the two neighbors.Experts say that although the public antagonism against Japan has worsened, Seoul should continue to pursue practical cooperation in security, business and other areas rather than being bound by the past.By Cho Chung-un, Song Sang-ho(christory@heraldcorp.com) (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","her second year in office ,presidential trips she missed ,her last week park appointed ,dae in seoul on tuesday ,struggle over her tax policies","['Park Geun', 'Park', 'Park', 'Park Geun', 'Seoul', 'POSCO', 'Kwon', 'Samsung Electronics', 'Lee Jay - yong', 'LG Group', 'Koo Bon - moo', 'Park', 'Korea Mecenat Association', 'Park Yong - hyun', 'Hyundai Motor', 'Chung Eui - sun', 'CJ Group', 'Sohn Kyungshik', 'EAGON', 'Park Young - ju', 'Lee Hae - jin', 'Cheong', 'realmeter', 'Cabinet', 'Yoon Pyung - joong', 'Hanshin University', 'Yoon', 'Yoon', 'Park', 'Park', 'Cabinet', 'Yoon', 'Hanshin University', 'Choi Young - jin', 'ChungAng University', 'Seoul', 'Choi', 'Cinderella', 'north korean', 'Yoon Hee - woong', 'Park', 'the Saenuri Party', 'inter - korean', 'Park', 'Pyongyang', 'North', 'inter - korean', 'North ’s', 'south korean', 'anti - pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'inter - korean', 'Pyongyang', 'North ’s', 'Park ’s', 'Beijing', 'U.S.', 'Park', 'China', 'Park', 'China', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Park', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'Li Keqiang', 'asian', 'Beijing', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'China', 'China', 'U.S.', 'the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'asian', 'Tokyo', 'South Korea ’s', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Cho Chung - un']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.00245649  0.33735821

He later deleted the video upon the teenager’s request, law officials said. Under the youth protection law, producing pornographic material of children or teenagers is a crime.The court ruled that the filming did not violate the youth protection law because there was mutual consent. “The victim, who is old enough to be legally considered able to consent, did agree to take part in the filming without anything in return, and Kim did so. Therefore, this should be considered (not as pornography but) as their privacy, which must be protected,” the verdict said. “Since the concerned video was not produced for the purpose of sales, rental or distribution but only for personal record, the concerned video cannot be categorized as pornography of children or youth,” it added. Kim, however, was sentenced to two and half years in prison with a stay of three years for raping the girlfriend twice after their relationship became estranged in May 2012.

""Shutting down the Wolsong-1 and Gori-1 reactors would be symbolic of her sincerity.""  In 2007, the government extended the life span of the 580-megawatt Gori No. 1 light-water reactor, which began commercial operations in 1977, by 10 years.  ""If the life span of the Wolsong-1 reactor is extended, it would be a betrayal of President Park's promise,"" Moon said.  The state-run Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety in October completed inspection of the reactor and concluded it can be operated for another 10 years. However, the NSSC has delayed its decision on mounting questions over the reactor's safety, especially after the Fukushima disaster in 2011.  The decision is being closely watched as it could affect reviews of the nation's other reactors nearing retirement.  According to a survey of 1,000 adults conducted on Monday, 60.8 percent said the Wolsong-1 should be shut down for safety reasons, environmental group Friends of the Earth Korea said in a news conference.  Of the remainder, 30.4 said the reactor can be restarted if it passes safety tests, while 8.8 percent gave other answers. The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.  ""According to the results of the survey, the majority wanted the Wolsong-1 to be shut down and felt a lack of communication in the current review process,"" an official of the organization said. ""The government should not push ahead with extending its life span but reflect such public opinion.""  South Korea has 23 nuclear reactors in operation, from which it currently gets about 30 percent of its electricity supply, and is building several more.

Though she conducted a partial Cabinet reshuffle last week, the president has invited fresh criticism from opposition parties as she delayed her decision to name a new chief of staff. Incumbent chief secretary Kim Ki-choon has been under pressure to resign for months over allegations that he exercised too much power over state affairs and personnel appointments. Park appears to have struggled to find suitable candidates to replace Kim. According to local news reports, the president could announce his successor Tuesday, but officials at Cheong Wa Dae have remained mute.“I’d like to ask you to seek active and strong impetus to help the Cabinet push for new (reform) policies,” Park said during a weekly meeting with senior secretaries held without Kim in attendance.“For the success of the reform, it is important to complete the legislation of (related) bills by the government and party dealing the process with one voice,” she said.Recently, Park has been losing momentum for her proposed reforms aimed at bringing about economic revitalization. Since early last year, she has been calling for massive restructuring of the private and public sector, including the reform of the public servants’ pension system, education, labor and financial markets. However, the president has encountered a series of setbacks, including political scandals, nomination debacles and the Sewol crisis.The trilateral committee, representing the government, the presidential office and the party, was launched last month as part of Park’s efforts to address the deteriorating situation. The president believes that enhancing communication between the legislative and executive branches could help speed up the implementation of her reform policies. The presidential office said later in the afternoon that the government has picked 24 major agenda to better facilitate economic reform and preparation for unification during Park’s remaining three years in office. Park also urged officials to expand economic cooperation with Middle Eastern nations, stressing that massive construction and infrastructure projects in the region could become a new growth engine for South Korea’s economy.“We should make aggressive efforts to use the second Middle East boom as a new growth engine for our economy,” Park said.In the 1970s, South Korea sent tens of thousands of engineers and workers to the Middle East during a construction boom in the region.The South Korean president plans to visit Saudi Arabia and three other Middle Eastern countries next week to discuss a wide range of issues including security, energy and information technology. Park is also set to sign a memorandum of understanding with her Saudi Arabian counterpart to introduce her mantra of a creative economy.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","resign for months over allegations ,her third year in office ,reshuffle last week the president ,push for economic reform monday ,cabinet reshuffle last week","['Park Geun', 'Cabinet', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'Kim', 'Cheong Wa Dae', 'Cabinet', 'Park', 'Kim', 'Park', 'Park ’s', 'middle eastern', 'South Korea ’s', 'Park', 'South Korea', 'south korean', 'Saudi Arabia', 'middle Eastern', 'saudi arabian', 'Cho Chung - un']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28586882  0.15076689

Most of the reforms were implemented from late 2013 or early 2014.  The FTC claimed there was a 25 percent drop in the so-called four major unfair trading practices, with 22.1 percent decline in the number of unfair commercial agreements.  Subcontractors who sign on with major conglomerates have long complained of being forced to accept unfavorable demands, risking losing franchise agreement and other partnerships if they refuse. Many have reported having to endure contractor-determined payments, rebates, supply agreements, product returns and even unauthorized use of technology.  The poll said 80 percent of the small and medium enterprises that make up the bulk of subcontractors responded there was an improvement in business practices last year compared to 2013.  Despite improvements, the corporate watchdog said that contractors have still been found to have engaged in unfair price cutting and coerced signing of contracts disadvantageous to subcontractors.  ""There have been instances where contractors halted asking for sale rebates but demanded other forms of payment,"" an official said.  He said the FTC will increase probes against unfair trading practices and make further changes that will make it easier for subcontractors to report abuse without fear of reprisal.

South Korea's government has sought to increase the number, saying the current amount falls far short of the need in consideration of a growing number of South Koreans studying and seeking jobs in the U.S.   In 2013, Roskam introduced a similar bill (H.R.1812), also known as ""Partner with Korea Act,"" and an identical bill (S.2663) was also introduced in the Senate last year. But those bills were later scrapped as the previous Congress expired.  The U.S. allows companies to temporarily hire foreign workers in specialty occupations by issuing the H-1B visa.

Jung Ok-geun, who served as the Navy Chief of Staff from 2008 to 2010, allegedly asked for 770 million won ($699,000) in bribes from two affiliates of STX Group in September 2008, a government anti-corruption task force said.Investigators believe Jung offered the companies Navy contracts to build a high-speed guided missile patrol gun boat and the next-generation frigate in return.The bribes were allegedly provided in the form of a sponsorship to a yacht event arranged by Jung's son, according to the investigators.The yacht company whose majority stake was owned by the younger Jung went out of business shortly thereafter, raising suspicions that it may have been a paper company.Investigators said Jung initially asked for 1 billion won but settled for less after the STX chairman Kang Duk-soo balked. He also offered the chairman a chance to ride a warship with then President Lee Myung-bak.Investigators also believe Jung at one point threatened the chairman, suggesting retaliation if he didn't oblige.Jung's son, a former Navy officer, and a non-executive director of an STX Group affiliate were also indicted without physical detention for collusion.

He is expected to be sworn in Tuesday.Legislators in his Saenuri Party were likely to have supported him in the secret ballot. The New Politics Alliance for Democracy likely opposed Lee.The close vote means Lee’s political clout in his first months as prime minister is likely to be limited. Allegations lodged mainly by the NPAD that Lee evaded conscription, speculated in real estate and collaborated with the juntas of the 1980s will also curb his influence, analyst said. Lawmakers vote on Lee Wan-koo’s nomination as prime minister at the National Assembly in Seoul on Monday. (Yonhap)The vote came after a tense partisan deadlock. The plenary vote on Lee’s appointment was originally set for last Thursday. But the NPAD expressed its opposition to Lee, and threatened to boycott the Assembly indefinitely, unless the Saenuri Party agreed to delay the vote. Saenuri floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min acceded.Lee’s nomination late last month had initially received bipartisan support. Lee had earned the opposition’s trust through his role in mediating divisive partisan bills such as the special Sewol bill, as the Saenuri Party’s floor leader last year. The tables were turned, however, after reports of draft evasion and property speculation arose during Lee’s confirmation hearing last week. Avoiding the military draft is considered especially detrimental to public office seekers here as the nation is still technically at war with North Korea.NPAD Rep. Jin Sun-mee cited Military Manpower Administration records from the 1970s to assert that Lee had dodged the obligatory draft, possibly by taking advantage of his position as a civil official.Lee first denied the accusations under oath, saying he had received his first military medical test in Hongseong, South Chungcheong Province. But Jin charged that MMA papers showed Lee had received his medical exam in Seoul, raising concerns that Lee had committed perjury.Lee suffered another blow during his hearing when the NPAD divulged a voice recording of him apparently trying to intimidate journalists. He can be heard telling reporters that he “knows” higher-ups in the media industry who can get them fired if they write critical reports about him.Lee apologized, but public dissatisfaction with him appears to have risen due to the disclosure, according to pollsters Gallup Korea and Realmeter.In a Gallup poll of 1,010 adults nationwide from Feb. 10-12, only 29 percent approved Lee’s nomination. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percent. A Realmeter survey of 1,500 adults from Feb. 11-13 found that 38.7 percent of respondents supported Lee, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percent.“Putting Lee in the Prime Minister’s Office may benefit us in the short term,” NPAD Rep. Hong Jong-haak said before the Monday vote. “But Rep. Lee is a consistent liar as was shown in last week’s hearing,” he added.President Park Geun-hye is likely to have picked Lee to serve as the Cabinet’s second-in-command for his skills as a deal-broker, as he could help break through the NPAD’s opposition to draft bills that Park has labeled “critical” for economic growth. These include bills aiming to boost crowdfunding and reforms of the national pension for retired civil servants.But the partisan strife over Lee’s suspected wrongdoings has cast a shadow over his credibility as the top government deputy, according to critics.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","be sworn in tuesday legislators ,sworn in tuesday legislators ,prime minister monday capping three ,sworn in tuesday legislators in ,monday vote but rep lee","['Lee Wan - koo', 'Saenuri Party', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'NPAD', 'Lee', 'Lee Wan - koo ’s', 'the National Assembly', 'Seoul', 'Lee ’s', 'NPAD', 'Lee', 'Assembly', 'Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'Lee ’s', 'North Korea', 'Jin Sun - mee', 'Manpower Administration', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Hongseong', 'South Chungcheong Province', 'Jin', 'MMA', 'Lee', 'Seoul', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'NPAD', 'Lee', 'Gallup Korea', 'Gallup', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Prime Minister ’s Office', 'Hong Jong - haak', 'Lee', 'Park Geun', 'Lee', 'Park', 'Lee', 'Jeong Hunny']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.14922783  0.47890058

Last month, Duksung Women’s University filed a police complaint against a professor, whose personal information has been withheld, for molesting a student. The professor is alleged to have forcibly kissed the student after drinking together early last year. The school’s unusually proactive response to the alleged sex crime could be a wake-up call for Korea’s universities, as many have been perceived as slow to respond to similar cases, experts said. After finding out that there were other victims at the school, the victim filed a report with the college office in December. Duksung immediately conducted an internal probe and restricted the professor from contacting with the victim. She has been suffering from depression and insomnia since the incident, the school said. The school also secured an admission of wrongdoing from the professor, school officials said. In a police probe, however, he denied the charges, public investigators said. The police will summon the professor again soon, they added. The concerned faculty member was removed from his post earlier this month, the school said.Public anger has been high since a Seoul National University professor was indicted last year for sexually abusing students. Kang Seok-jin, a 53-year-old mathematics professor, was suspected of engaging in inappropriate physical contact with nine students between 2008 and 2014. He will face a second trial hearing next month. A national uproar was sparked after the school accepted Kang’s resignation without imposing any penalties. Recognizing his resignation would allow Kang to receive severance and pension payments and automatically wrap up the university’s internal probe into the case. As public criticism grew over the school’s leniency, the school withdrew the decision. The prestigious public school came under fire again earlier this month when another faculty member was suspected of making inappropriate remarks to female students. While the school is investigating the reported incident, the concerned professor is denying all allegations, university officials said. In response to the series of sexual crimes, SNU students formed a student body called “Communal Action” last week to better cope with sex offenses involving professors.The group will monitor the school’s internal probes into sexual abuse cases and the punishment process for the involved teaching staff, students said. The new body will also directly receive reports from students to help them report their cases, they added. Many of the victims tend to shy away from reporting abuses by professors because of the teachers’ authority and influence, CA said.

Police said the amount can be used by up to 500 people.Police believe the man was able to sneak it in through Incheon International Airport, South Korea's main gateway, since airport X-ray machines aren't able to detect the drug.In South Korea, he allegedly smoked five joints himself and tried to sell 34 grams to a Moroccan he met through a smartphone app, police said without naming the app.The Moroccan reported him to police before the transaction took place, authorities said. Lee was caught in the act as he tried to take out weed from his bag at the promised location in the northern Seoul district of Eunpyeong earlier this month.Lee does not have a history of drug-related crimes, although he confessed to having first encountered the drug when staying in Australia for about two years in the past, police said.Authorities said many young South Koreans are tempted to sell illegal drugs they acquire abroad since they go for five-times the price in their home country.Police are searching for any accomplices Lee might have had.

Lee Wan-koo as new prime minister amid the main opposition’s continued disapproval of the nominee, who has been plagued by allegations of draft dodging, plagiarism, real estate speculation and other misdeeds.The ruling Saenuri Party vowed to approve Lee’s nomination during Monday’s plenary parliamentary session, raising the possibility that the majority party will railroad the motion despite vehement objections from the New Politics Alliance for Democracy.The Saenuri Party argued the partisan bickering over Lee would only create a “vacuum in state affairs” at a time when the Assembly should focus its legislative attention on revitalizing the sluggish economy.“The biggest reason why we are making all-out efforts (to approve Lee) is that we are concerned about the possible vacuum in state affairs,” said Saenuri Party spokesperson Min Hyun-joo. “We are calling for the opposition’s cooperation in focusing our energy on improving people’s livelihoods.” Lee Wan-kooHowever, the NPAD renewed its calls for Lee to withdraw his nomination, warning that should the ruling party unilaterally approve Lee, it would face a backlash that would “leave the new premier in a vegetative state” and complicate the procedures to approve Supreme Court Justice-designate Park Sang-ok.The rival parties agreed last week to delay the Assembly’s full-house session ― initially set for last Thursday ― to Monday as they had failed to narrow their differences over Lee’s nomination. But later, the NPAD called for a public opinion poll on the nomination, further escalating the partisan dispute. The Saenuri Party dismissed the proposal as a move to ignore the legislature’s role to endorse the nomination of the government’s No. 2 post.The Saenuri Party currently holds 158 seats in the 295-strong parliament, meaning the party could unilaterally approve the nomination even if NPAD lawmakers boycotted Monday’s full-house vote. Should Lee be approved only by the majority party, it would be the first such case since Lee Young-deok was unilaterally endorsed as prime minister in 1994.It may not be an easy decision for the Saenuri Party to press for unilateral approval given that it could suffer a severe backlash from the NPAD at a time when it has piles of legislative issues which require cooperation with the main opposition, analysts said.The ruling party hopes to pass the motion quickly as public opinion about Lee has deteriorated due to the NPAD’s offensive. After this week’s Lunar New Year holiday, a time when family gatherings play a crucial role in shaping public opinion, public sentiment could worsen, observers say.The NPAD is expected to hold a general meeting of its lawmakers on Monday morning to decide how to demonstrate its strong opposition to Lee’s nomination without any political repercussions.Observers say NPAD lawmakers are likely to boycott the plenary session or refuse to join the vote since if any of them were to vote in favor of Lee, it could deal a blow to the authority of its new leader Moon Jae-in.Cheong Wa Dae has been anxiously watching the developments concerning Lee’s parliamentary confirmation, as it could face more criticism of a “poor” personnel vetting system should he fail to pass parliamentary scrutiny. Two prime minister designates have so far withdrawn their nominations over alleged past wrongdoings ― the reason why the current Prime Minister Chung Hong-won remains in office although he has offered to resign several times.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","lawmakers boycotted monday full house ,lawmakers boycotted monday full ,npad lawmakers boycotted monday full ,boycotted monday full house vote ,npad lawmakers boycotted monday","['the National Assembly', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Lee', 'Assembly', 'Lee', 'Saenuri Party', 'Min Hyun - joo', 'Lee Wan - kooHowever', 'NPAD', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Supreme Court', 'Park Sang - ok', 'Assembly', 'Lee', 'NPAD', 'the Saenuri Party', 'the Saenuri Party', 'NPAD', 'Lee', 'Lee Young - deok', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Lee', 'NPAD', 'Lee', 'NPAD', 'Lee', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Dae', 'Lee', 'Chung Hong - win', 'Song Sang - ho']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.48150754  0.22505346

John Kitzhaber on Friday said he broke no laws and said in a lengthy statement that his resignation would be effective on WednesdaySecretary of State Kate Brown, a Democrat like Kitzhaber, was expected to assume the office and become the first openly bisexual governor in the U.S. Kitzhaber handily won re-election in November to a fourth term, a rare feat for American governors, who hold considerable power in most states.But the allegations surrounding his fiancee Cylvia Hayes' work dominated headlines in the state following his victory.The spotlight on Hayes led to her revealing that she accepted about $5,000 to illegally marry a man seeking immigration benefits in the 1990s. Later, she admitted she bought a remote property with the intent to grow marijuana.Kitzhaber's decision capped a week in which he seemed poised to step down, then changed his mind, but ultimately bowed to calls from legislative leaders that he quit the state's top job.The announcement is a stunning fall from grace for the longest-serving chief executive in Oregon history.By Thursday, the leaders of the state Legislature said he had to go. Other top officials in the overwhelmingly Democratic state also said Kitzhaber should resign.A series of newspaper reports since October have chronicled Hayes' work for organizations with an interest in Oregon public policy. At the same time, she was paid by advocacy groups, she played an active role in Kitzhaber's administration, a potential conflict of interest.Though questions about Hayes have swirled for months, the pressure on Kitzhaber intensified in recent weeks after newspapers raised questions about whether Hayes reported all her income on her tax returns.","first openly bisexual governor in ,first openly bisexual governor ,the first openly bisexual governor ,resignation amid allegations his fiancee ,enrich herself oregon gov john","['SALEM', 'Oregon', 'AP', 'U.S.', 'Oregon', 'John Kitzhaber', 'State', 'Kate Brown', 'Democrat', 'Kitzhaber', 'U.S.', 'american', ""Cylvia Hayes '"", 'Hayes', 'Kitzhaber', 'Oregon', 'Legislature', 'democratic', 'Kitzhaber', 'Hayes', 'Oregon', 'Kitzhaber', 'Hayes', 'Kitzhaber', 'Hayes']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66255718  0.39823923

The female student, whose father is Canadian and mother is Korean, was scolded by the teacher for not eating kimchi in her school in Suwon last June. The 50-year-old teacher asked her why she wouldn’t eat kimchi when “she is half-Korean,” and stated that her future (Korean) mother-in-law would not like it should she find out her daughter-in-law does not eat the traditional fermented Korean dish.“We acknowledge that the teacher, as an educator, caused great emotional distress to the student with an international background,” the court said.The teacher, who has some 30 years of teaching experience, had been awarded by the Suwon Office of Education in 2004 for her work.The Suwon Office of Education did not take any disciplinary action against her, other than issuing a simple warning, when the student’s parents filed an official complaint to the police in August. “Our rule is that teachers who have been awarded by the government get a certain degree of exemption when they face disciplinary action. If she hadn’t won the award, she would have faced heavier punishment,” Lee Won-mi from the Suwon Office of Education told The Korea Herald.In May last year, the teacher made the whole class call the student “stupid” thrice loudly for “asking too many questions” in class. Another time, the teacher asked those who take private education lessons outside of the classroom to raise their hands. Among the students who did, the teacher pointed at the multicultural student and said “you are particularly a (financial) burden on your parents.”The student, who moved to Korea from Canada with her parents in 2010, reportedly underwent therapy for a number of months after suffering emotionally from such remarks by the teacher. The student’s parents told local media that the teacher never apologized properly, and should not be allowed to remain in the education field.Prosecutors said they would appeal against the court decision, as the teacher can be removed from her position only if she is sentenced to imprisonment. According to the Suwon education office, the teacher is currently not teaching at the school in Suwon, and has been on sick leave since last year.

Lawmakers agreed to launch the parliamentary probe amid escalating criticism that many of its investment decisions resulted in huge losses. Meanwhile, Lee’s supporters have claimed that the investigation is part of a “political witch hunt” and that it is too early to declare the initiative a failure.Suh Moon-kyu, president of the Korea National Oil Corp., reads reports to parliamentary committee members on overseas energy investments by state-controlled firms at the National Assembly in Seoul, Thursday. (Lee Gil-dong/The Korea Herald)Rep. Choi Min-hee of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, raised speculations that the state-run oil developer Korea National Oil Corp. acquired part of a Canadian oil refinery by paying more than 1 trillion won ($900 million). The Lee government was aware of the deal but turned a blind eye, he said.In a feasibility report conducted by the Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources, the value of the upstream oil sector of the oil refinery was estimated at $1.61 billion. But the KNOC purchased the sector for $2.77 billion based on its own calculations, he claimed. The opposition lawmaker also accused the then-Energy Minister Choi Kyung-hwan of ignoring the feasibility report by the mineral resource institution and held him responsible for wasting billions of won of state funds. Choi now serves as finance minister. “Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan, who was then the energy minister, didn’t take any action even though he had this report that stated negative views (of the acquisition),” said Rep. Choi. “He should be held responsible.”Rep. Jeon Jeong-hee also claimed that the state oil firm purchased Harvest Operations Corp. knowing that its affiliate NARL, which operates the downstream sector of the refinery, was not profitable. “The then-KNOC president Kang Young-won was asked by Harvest Operations Corp. to acquire NARL and requested GS Caltex to conduct an asset valuation,” the lawmaker said.GS Caltex suggested to Kang that the deal would not be profitable, but he purchased the firm the next day, she claimed.The ruling Saenuri Party, however, defended the project, urging opposition lawmakers not to criticize the previous government’s overall overseas resource initiative by highlighting the parts of deals that suffered losses.Rep. Kim Tae-heum of the Saenuri Party said that the opposition party was attempting to shift the responsibility onto the minister, stressing that the final decision on the deals was in the hands of KNOC executives.Incumbent KNOC president Suh Moon-kyu, denied the opposition lawmakers’ claim that the deal was not a success, saying that South Korea had secured 60 million barrels of oil by purchasing the Canadian oil refinery.“We think that the acquisition of NARL is the only failure,” he said. “Harvest is a company with potential, and we believe that we could absorb the losses in the long term.”By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","part of political witch hunt ,state run energy companies thursday ,national assembly in seoul thursday ,the opposition lawmaker also accused ,the project urging opposition lawmakers","['Lee Myung - bak', 'Lee', 'Park Geun', 'South Korea ’s', 'middle eastern', 'Lee ’s', 'Suh Moon - kyu', 'the Korea National Oil Corp.', 'the National Assembly', 'Seoul', 'Lee Gil - dong', 'Choi Min - hee', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Korea National Oil Corp.', 'canadian', 'Lee', 'the Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources', 'KNOC', 'Choi Kyung - hwan', 'Choi', 'Choi Kyung - hwan', 'Choi', 'Jeon Jeong - hee', 'Harvest Operations Corp.', 'NARL', 'Kang Young - won', 'Harvest Operations Corp.', 'NARL', 'GS Caltex', 'GS Caltex', 'Kang', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Tae - heum', 'the Saenuri Party', 'KNOC', 'Suh Moon - kyu', 'South Korea', 'canadian', 'NARL', 'Cho Chung - un']",9,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.74275416  0.41570094

The initiative was launched with the Korean Federation of Teachers’ Association, Korea’s largest conservative teachers’ group. “I hope this plan will be a turning point for protecting teachers’ rights, allowing them to concentrate on teaching. This will also help establish a foundation of mutual trust and respect among teachers, students and parents,” said Seoul Education Chief Cho Hi-yeon at a press conference held at the SMOE office.The new plan centers on operating the Teachers Rights Protection Support Center, which previously only existed within SMOE, at district-level education offices to make help more accessible for teachers. The center will provide counseling services and support for possible litigation processes.Education authorities will also commission 38 lawyers to provide legal consultation to teachers. The phone consulting service ― introduced in September of last year ― will be free, while fees for face-to-face consulting will be charged to the SMOE.The ideal option, however, would be to prevent legal disputes, noted KFTA chief Ahn Yang-ok. To help work out amicable solutions to teacher-parent discord, SMOE is planning to create a consulting team of retired education workers with leadership or counseling experience, such as former principals and school counselors.“Legal support will be provided to teachers in the case of lawsuits, but the most important thing is to reach an agreement before going to court. For this, the consulting team (of retired teachers) will help with their experience and wisdom before engaging in a legal battle,” Ahn said.But some argued that the 220 million won budget ― which is a tiny fraction of the 7.6 trillion won allocated to the SMOE in 2015 ― would not be enough to provide support to all the city’s teachers. There are more than 70,000 teachers in Seoul, meaning the funding provides a meager 3,000 won per teacher.Further, the budget for legal consultation service is only 2.75 million won, and the SMOE does not yet have a backup plan when the funding runs out.“We acknowledge that the money we’ve set aside is not sufficient to address the issue of teachers’ rights protection. The budget (for teacher protection) will have to gradually increase,” said an SMOE official. A recent report by Sungkyunkwan University professor Yang Jung-ho showed that 20 percent of Korean teachers regretted their choice of job, the highest figure among all members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. According to the KFTA, on average 1,500 cases of teacher rights violations occurred annually from 2011 to 2013, and 643 cases were reported in first semester of 2014.The KFTA report showed that teachers were being subject to physical, verbal violence and even sexual harassment.

The de facto heiress of the flag carrier was found to have ordered the taxiing plane to return to the gate.The Seoul Seobu District Court acknowledged in its ruling the charges raised by the prosecution that Cho had violated a law banning passengers from pressuring crew members to deviate from the flight route.Its verdict clarified that Cho should be held accountable for obstructing aviation safety by abusing her authority. (Yonhap)In addition, the ruling reflected the charges that she physically and verbally assaulted a female flight attendant as well as the cabin crew chief.Park Chang-jin, the cabin manager who had been pressured off the flight, backed up the charges during his testimony in the formal trial hearing. He said Cho “hustled a (female) flight attendant with some abusive words.”Park, 44, said he had also been beaten by the defendant Cho, adding that both Cho and her father Cho Yang-ho, the chairman of Korean Air and its parent Hanjin Group, had yet to apologize to him over the “nut rage” incident.While Cho Hyun-ah did not make an official apology to the cabin crew chief, it has been found that she submitted a letter of apology to the district court six times.The prosecution had sought a three-year prison term for the former company vice president.Meanwhile, the court also handed down a jail term of eight months to a Korean Air executive director. In addition, a Transportation Ministry official was given a suspended prison term of six months with probation of one year.The prosecution earlier indicted Korean Air executive director Yeo Woon-jin on charges of destroying evidence related to the case. The 57-year-old was also accused of pressuring the cabin crew chief to minimize the case’s impact.A Transport Ministry official surnamed Kim was charged with leaking information about the ministry’s probe to the airline.Kim, 55, had reportedly phoned Yeo about 30 times and sent 10 text messages between Dec. 7 and the day before the ministry’s probe was launched, investigators said. The civil servant, a close confidant of Yeo, was later found to have worked at Korean Air for 15 years as a flight attendant and chief purser.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","seoul court on thursday sentenced ,in prison for obstructing aviation ,prison for obstructing aviation safety ,assaulted female flight attendant ,prison for obstructing aviation","['Seoul', 'Cho Hyun - ah', 'Korean Air', 'Cho', 'New York', 'Seoul', 'the Seoul Seobu District Court', 'Cho', 'Cho', 'Park Chang - jin', 'Cho', 'Cho', 'Cho', 'Cho Yang - ho', 'Korean Air', 'Hanjin Group', 'Cho Hyun - ah', 'Korean Air', 'Transportation Ministry', 'Korean Air', 'Yeo Woon - jin', 'Transport Ministry', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Yeo', 'Yeo', 'Korean Air', 'Kim Yon - se']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.20892982  0.16120599

Lee Wan-koo’s nomination scheduled for Thursday. Majority governing Saenuri Party officials said they could unilaterally pass Lee’s nomination if the NPAD boycotted the session.Lee was nominated to serve as the Cabinet’s second-in-command by President Park Geun-hye last month. Lee’s reputation as a moderate and a mediator among lawmakers across the partisan spectrum appeared to guarantee parliamentary support for the appointment. But a recording of Lee allegedly intimidating journalists was publicized late Tuesday. Lee can be heard saying he “helped journalists get jobs in universities as professors and presidents,” and that he can “get rid of” reporters who write critical stories about him.  Lee Wan-kooSenior main opposition lawmakers urged Lee to step down. “Two nominees have already failed to receive the National Assembly’s approval. So I was going to let this one pass,” said Rep. Moon Jae-in, newly appointed NPAD leader and former 2012 presidential candidate. “But I fear that is no longer possible. Rep. Lee’s nomination requires reconsideration,” he added. Opposition lawmakers have laid out a series of allegations against the third-term lawmaker. Suspicions that Lee had profited in real estate dealings and questions regarding the money used for the property speculation were discussed at Wednesday’s hearing.NPAD Rep. Hong Jong-hak alleged that Lee had received up to 180 million won ($164,000) in bribes in 2002. The money could have been used to purchase the Tower Palace apartment Lee owned in 2003, before he sold it for profit, Hong said.Lee denied the charges but said he had received 50 million won from the Grand National Party, the forerunner of the Saenuri Party. “The money was given to every GNP lawmaker, as funds to be used as campaign assistance during the 2002 presidential elections,” Lee said. Lee failed to clear up allegations that he had pretended to have flat feet to dodge the country’s mandatory military service in the 1970s.Lee is strongly suspected of lying under oath about his military service during Tuesday’s hearing. Lee initially said he had received his first medical exam in 1971 in Hongseong, South Chungcheong Province, where X-ray technology was not available to show he had flat feet.Documents showed, though, that Lee’s first medical exam had been in Seoul, where X-ray machines were available, according to NPAD Rep.

He faked the official documents from July 2008 to May of last year, stealing most of the 310 million won that was supposed to have been paid to six researchers working for him, the BAI said.Although he claimed to have used the money to pay for his students’ tuitions, he failed to turn in the documents as proof, and students denied receiving any money from him.When the inspection commenced, the professor even attempted to conceal his crimes by having a subordinate hide a bag full of cash in his lab. The BAI recommended that the SNU fire him, while requesting the prosecutors to investigate the case. The auditors also notified five state-run bodies that commissioned the cited projects ― including the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning ― to find ways to collect the embezzled funds.The case was revealed in the BAI’s monthlong inspection from April to May last year, when the organization unearthed 68 cases of wrongdoings concerning R&D; funds by 21 state-run institutes and public companies.According to the BAI, each institute invested an average of 699.4 billion won on R&D;, but they added 872.2 billion won of unrelated costs to the R&D; budget. For example, some institutes would include costs for unrelated equipment and various employee training fees.The BAI also found that officials from the state-run bodies charged for the money they spent on pricey bars and karaoke ― which amounted to 119 million won from 2010-2013 ― as part of R&D; funding.

Kim Moo-sung and the newly elected floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min last week voiced their opposition to the government’s plans, saying that it was impossible to expand welfare policies without increasing tax rates.“It keeps nagging at me, how our politics could make such a demand of the people ― that the government has to collect more money from taxpayers simply because we are short of tax revenues,” Park said at a weekly meeting with her senior secretaries.Park accused the ruling party of abandoning its duty to support the government’s policies on economic revitalization, saying that the work is aimed at creating jobs and reducing the tax burden on the people.“The economic revitalization is meant to create jobs, to impose less burden on the people and revive the economy. If (the party) turns away from these efforts, wouldn’t it be an act of betrayal to the people?”The remark came a week after Saenuri leader Kim directly resisted Park’s welfare policies. Rep. Kim, known as a longtime political rival of Park, claimed that they were populist pledges that were impossible to realize.Park had remained mute over Kim’s criticism until Monday.On Park’s cold criticism, Kim took a step backward from his previous stance later in the afternoon, stressing that the president and the Saenuri Party are on the same boat.“The Saenuri Party and the Park Geun-hye government share a common destiny,” said Rep. Kim in a meeting with foreign correspondents in Seoul. “The party is the president’s confident supporter and will help her to (overcome) difficulties.”On welfare and tax disputes, Rep. Kim said the problem could be solved through reaching a social consensus. “But it is not an easy job,” he said.Welfare expansion was the centerpiece of Park’s presidential campaign.Park promised to provide free child care and a higher monthly allowance for elderly citizens and to revise the current health insurance program to fairly impose fees based on subscribers’ income levels. Instead of raising taxes, Park vowed to create new income sources from the underground economy and curtail unnecessary and costly state-led projects. The Park government, however, recently came under fire as it raised tobacco prices, pushed to reform public servants’ pensions and introduced a revised tax settlement scheme, which were seen as attempts to collect more money from workers to pay for the costly welfare policies.The president’s rejection of the party’s demand is expected to spark a heated controversy on tax hikes and further strain her ties with the party.Rep. Yoo, a nonmainstream lawmaker, became the new floor leader in the party’s primary vote last week. His victory was seen as the party starting to make critical approaches to the president’s policies, at a time when she suffers from deepening public distrust. Her ratings plummeted to below 30 percent late last month. To restore public trust, Park said she will carry out reshuffles of the Cabinet and reorganize Cheong Wa Dae. So far, Park has nominated former Saenuri floor leader Rep. Lee Wan-koo as her new prime minister and is to announce another batch of ministers after the appointee gets parliamentary endorsement. Rep. Lee’s two-day confirmation hearing kicks off Tuesday and his nomination will be put to a vote Thursday. His nomination, however, is expected to face fierce opposition from the main opposition New Alliance Politics Alliance Party.The opposition lawmakers have accused him of abusing his power over media firms to stop publishing negative stories on him.The latest controversy follows a series of other allegations including academic plagiarism and real estate speculation.

The Seoul High Court ruled that Won Sei-hoon, former director of the National Intelligence Service, interfered in the 2012 presidential election by ordering staff to make political postings online to sway public opinion. “The agency’s cyberactivity interfered in public’s decision-making while neglecting its duty to keep political impartiality, which is required by law,” the verdict read. “(The NIS) cannot avoid the fundamental criticism that it harmed democracy.” Judges rejected a lower court ruling that found that his orders were not intended to influence the election.  Won Sei-hoon (Yonhap)The 64-year-old had been sentenced to two years and six months in jail, suspended for four years, by the lower court last year for charges of violating the law governing the NIS. Public criticism has since grown over the ruling, which recognized Won’s interference in the election but not his support for a particular presidential candidate. The appeals court said he had directed his staff to post some 270,000 political messages online with 716 Twitter accounts against the opposition-bloc candidate Moon Jae-in. Won defended himself, claiming that “he worked for the country and public.” He was detained immediately after the court’s ruling. Won’s attorneys said they would consider appealing against the decision. After the court made the decision, the ruling Saenuri Party expressed “regrets” over the court’s ruling but acknowledged the necessity to “draft up preventive measures against such wrongdoings.”The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy hailed the court’s decision, saying that “it is a landmark ruling that proves that constitutionalism is still alive.” Won, a confidant of former President Lee Myung-bak, headed the NIS for about four years until early 2013. The ex-spy chief served one year and two months in prison until last year for a separate bribery conviction. He was found guilty of having accepted kickbacks from a businessman while in office. Meanwhile, Kim Yong-pan, a former Seoul police chief who was suspected of soft-pedaling a probe into the high-profile election-meddling scandal, was acquitted by the top court late last month.

Kim Moo-sung and the newly elected floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min last week voiced their opposition to the government’s plans, saying that it was impossible to expand welfare policies without increasing the current tax rates.“It keeps nagging at me, how our politics could make such a demand of the people -- that the government has to collect more money from taxpayers simply because we are short of tax revenues,” Park said at a weekly meeting with her senior secretaries.Park accused the ruling party of abandoning its duty to support the government’s policies on economic revitalization, saying that the work is aimed at creating jobs and reducing the tax burden on the people.“The economic revitalization is meant to create jobs, to impose less burdens to the people and revive the economy. If (the party) turns away from the efforts, wouldn’t it be an act of betrayal to the people?”The remark came a week after Saenuri leader Kim directly resisted Park’s welfare policies. Rep. Kim, known as a long-time political rival of Park, claimed that they were populist pledges that were impossible to realize.Park had remained mute over Kim’s criticism until Monday.Welfare expansion was the centerpiece of Park’s presidential campaign.Park promised to provide free child care services and a higher monthly allowance for elderly citizens and to revise the current health insurance program to fairly impose fees based on subscribers’ income levels. Instead of raising tax, Park vowed to create new income sources from the underground economy and curtail unnecessary and costly state-led projects. The Park government, however, came recently under fire as it raised tobacco prices, pushed to reform public servants’ pensions and introduced a revised tax settlement scheme, which were seen as attempts to collect more money from workers to pay for the costly welfare policies.The president’s rejection on party’s demand is expected to spark a heated controversy on tax hike and also to further strain her ties with the party.Rep. Yoo, a nonmainstream lawmaker, became the new floor leader in the party’s primary vote last week. His victory was seen as the party starting to make critical approaches to the president’s policies, at a time when she suffers from deepening public distrust. Her ratings plummeted to below 30 percent late last month. To restore public trust, Park said she will carry out reshuffles of the Cabinet and reorganize Cheong Wa Dae. So far, Park has nominated former Saenuri floor leader Rep. Lee Wan-koo as her new prime minister and said will announce another batch of ministers after the appointee gets parliamentary endorsement. Rep. Lee’s two-day confirmation hearings kicks off Tuesday and his nomination will be put to a vote Thursday. His nomination, however, is expected to face fierce opposition from the main opposition New Alliance Politics Alliance Party.The opposition lawmakers have accused him of abusing his power over media firms to stop publishing negative stories on him.The latest controversy follows a series of other allegations including academic plagiarism and real estate speculation.

I will block the recklessness of the Park Geun-hye government, which is destroying the people's lives.""Moon especially accused Park of deceiving the public with her campaign pledge to expand welfare without tax hikes. Since taking office in February 2013, the Park administration has been dogged by questions about whether it will be able to implement all of the expensive welfare projects she promised without raising taxes.The government has come under fire in recent months for raising tobacco prices, pushing to reform civil service pensions and introducing a revised tax settlement scheme, all of which critics argue are designed to squeeze more money out of ordinary wage earners.""I will cut through to withdraw tax cuts for the rich, such as by normalizing the corporate tax rate,"" Moon said. ""I will once again establish a fair tax system.""South Korea's corporate tax rate on taxable income exceeding 20 billion won ($18.2 million) was lowered from 25 percent to 22 percent during the preceding Lee Myung-bak administration.Earlier in the day, Moon visited the National Cemetery in Seoul to pay tribute to late former presidents, including Presidents Rhee Syng-man and Park Chung-hee, the father of the current president.About 50 opposition lawmakers accompanied Moon on the visit.It marked the first time that the opposition party's leadership paid their respects to the late authoritarian leaders whose legacies still divide the Korean public.Former President Park is praised by his supporters for leading the country's economic development in the aftermath of the 1950-53 Korean War, but denounced by his critics for brutally suppressing democracy.""I decided to pay my respects with the hope of contributing to national unity,"" Moon told reporters after paying tribute at the late presidents' graves.""True national unity is not achieved by paying respects at a cemetery but when the perpetrators repent for their historical wrongdoing, offer their sincere apology to the people, comfort the victims, and the victims come to have a heart of forgiveness,"" he said.

Late last month, his second son voluntarily underwent a medical exam in public to prove that he was legitimately exempted from mandatory military service.On Monday, Lee denied the allegations in a written response to the National Assembly's inquiries.He claimed that his wife, followed by his second son, has faithfully paid the inheritance tax on a piece of land acquired from his father-in-law in Bundang, just south of Seoul.On the reasons for buying a high-class apartment in southern Seoul, Lee said he bought it for his family to live in, not for speculation purposes.He acknowledged that his thesis did not meet the strict ethical standards of today when it comes to citations, but argued that he still wrote the paper independently using his own data and analytical methods.Lee's nomination is scheduled to be put to a vote during a plenary session on Thursday.If he fails to win parliamentary approval, Park could face another setback in running state affairs as she has been plagued by a series of unsuccessful personnel nominations.In recent weeks, her approval rating dropped to 29 percent, her all-time low since taking office two years ago, according to polling agency Gallup Korea.

(Yonhap)“(The president) is expected to conduct a Cabinet reshuffle with the recommendation of the new prime minister after the parliamentary approval of nominee Lee Wan-koo is completed,” presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook told reporters on Sunday.“What I know (now) is that the scale (of the shake-up) will be small, including the maritime minister,” he said. The maritime minister’s post has remained vacant since late last year after former Minister Lee Ju-young returned to his party.The announcement came after Min announced the list of new vice ministers appointed by the president on Sunday.Park named presidential secretary for education Gim Chae-chun as education vice minister, and promoted assistant ministers for future strategy and culture, Choi Jae-you and Park Min-kwon, to vice-ministerial posts in their respective ministries.When asked about the fate of Park’s chief of staff, Min said there will be an announcement about it after Lee’s confirmation process wraps up. “It is said that there will be an announcement,” he said. But the spokesman said that it is not yet known whether the announcement will be about Kim leaving or staying.Min also hinted that the president is likely to appoint presidential advisers for political affairs after the confirmation hearings.Last month at her New Year’s news conference, the president said she would conduct a “small-scale” Cabinet reshuffle. Park appointed Lee, former floor leader of the ruling Saenuri Party, as her new prime minister and replaced three senior presidential secretaries.But she has come under growing pressure both from the ruling and the main opposition to carry out a massive reshuffle of her Cabinet and presidential secretaries to restore public support for her reform drive. Her approval ratings plummeted more than 10 percentage points in three weeks to below 30 percent on Jan. 27. It was her lowest rating since she entered office and far lower than when her leadership was questioned in the wake of the Sewol ferry accident. Her disapproval rating also polled above 60 percent for the first time.Critics say that Park’s plan to keep the scale of reshuffle minimal reflects her determination to maintain “stability” in her state management. Some suggested that the president could replace a few ministers, including unification, land and transport, and maritime.The presidential office appears to have decided to retain as many incumbent Cabinet members as possible, amid fears of losing time in the confirmation hearings on new nominees as Park entered her third year in the office. Her term ends in early 2018. Under the Korean law, Cabinet members are subjected to confirmation hearings, but only the prime minister nominee requires parliamentary approval.The National Assembly plans to hold a confirmation hearing for Lee Tuesday and Wednesday, with a vote scheduled for Thursday. If the prime minister nominee obtains parliamentary endorsement, the reshuffle could be carried out over the weekend or early next week, according to observers.Park appears confident as she plans to reveal the names of her new Cabinet appointees after Lee gets parliamentary approval. But it remains unclear whether he will pass the parliamentary vote amid escalating controversy over his alleged power abuse over media, academic plagiarism and real estate speculation.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","cabinet reshuffle after her prime ,her unilateral personnel choices presidential ,her new cabinet appointees after ,sunday park named presidential secretary ,new cabinet appointees after lee","['Park Geun', 'Min Kyung -', 'Seoul', 'Cabinet', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Min Kyung - wook', 'Lee Ju - young', 'Gim Chae - chun', 'Choi Jae - you', 'Park ’s', 'Lee ’s', 'Kim', 'Lee', 'Saenuri Party', 'Cabinet', 'Park', 'Cabinet', 'Park', 'korean', 'Cabinet', 'the National Assembly', 'Lee', 'Cabinet', 'Lee', 'Cho Chung - un']",8,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.09298946  0.23146144

Moon Jae-in, former confidant of the late former president Roh Moo-hyun, as its new chairman at the party convention in Seoul.Rep. Moon, who lost to President Park Geun-hye in the 2012 presidential race, defeated Rep. Park Jie-won in a close contest by winning 45.3 percent of the final count. Rep. Park won 41.8 percent of the votes. More than 71 percent of the party’s 15,019 delegates participated in Sunday’s vote.   The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy picks Rep. Moon Jae-in as its new leader. (Yonhap)Reps. Joo Seung-yong, Jun Byung-hun, Jung Cheong-rae, Oh Young-sik and You Seung-hee were elected to the party’s supreme council. Moon and his council will serve a two-year term and oversee the party during next year’s parliamentary elections.“Change begins now. We will move forward now,” Moon said. “I will start an all-out war against the Park Geun-hye administration if (it keeps) destroying democracy, and the middle-class economy.”For Moon and his council members, victory brings on tough challenges ranging from controversial policy debates with the governing Saenuri Party to reknitting a party wracked by factionalism and worryingly low public ratings. If Moon can produce results though, he might have another shot at the presidency in 2017, some analysts say.Proposed reforms to the pension for retired civil servants and revisions to the Constitution that will diminish the president’s grip over domestic politics have been the policy hot potatoes dividing politicians on party lines.President Park and key members of her Saenuri Party have supported reforming the pension for retired officials, saying the funds have wreaked havoc on public coffers. But they oppose rewriting the Constitution, saying it would create partisan fights detrimental to implementing other reforms.They have cited in-house tallies that assert the pension will create additional debts of 18 trillion won ($16.4 billion) by 2020 if reforms are not implemented.The NPAD, on the other hand, has failed to come up with a unified voice. It has also failed to offer the nation any specific alternative to the Saenuri Party’s position on the two issues.The main opposition has merely been able to compel the Saenuri Party to form a parliamentary panel for debating the pension reforms, after public officials’ unions, the main beneficiaries of the pension and a key political base to the NPAD, protested the Park administration’s reform plans.The opposition has also come up empty on constitutional changes, although some NPAD lawmakers have floated suggestions to transfer the president’s authority over nominating Cabinet members to a parliament-elected prime minister.Opposition supporters have hoped this year’s convention would raise the party’s struggling public ratings and unite its many factions before the 2016 general elections. But the race has been marred by emotional verbal fighting that has only worsened factionalism, critics said. The race was viewed as a fight between the leaders of the party’s main factions from the start. Analysts viewed Moon, the opposition’s 2012 presidential hopeful, as the representative of the so-called pro-Roh Moo-hyun faction, named after admirers of the late president. Park was seen as the leader of the non-Rohs, an inclusive camp encompassing those not for the pro-Rohs.Lee was considered the leader of the 486 faction, a group composed of former student activists that led street protest against the military dictatorships of the 1980s.NPAD supporters had hoped though that the three candidates would compete by engaging in productive policy debates to offer alternatives to President Park Geun-hye’s so-called “welfare without taxation” policy.But the campaign trail was tattered with emotional finger-pointing that showed Park and Moon blaming each other for the party’s many woes.The main opposition’s factionalist woes worsened when former presidential candidate Chung Dong-young exited the party last month, saying the NPAD had tilted “too much toward the right.”With Moon having won the leadership by only a small margin, his task to unite the party will be that much more challenging. Park supporters, based mainly in the Jeolla region, have even threatened to exit the party en masse, although that chance appears slim according to analysts.Over one year remains until the 2016 April general elections, but public rating lags behind the governing party, showing Moon has much catching up to do.A Gallup Korea poll conducted from Feb. 3-5 on 1,003 adults nationwide showed the main opposition party having a 24 percent public rating and the Saenuri Party enjoying a 41 percent standing. The survey had a 95 percent confidence level and a 3.1 percent margin of error.A Realmeter survey taken in late January, showed the NPAD’s 27.5 percent rating lagging behind the governing party’s 35.9 percent. That survey had 2,500 adult respondents nationwide and a 95 percent confidence level on a 2 percent margin of error.The numbers come despite falling ratings for an embattled President Park. Her ratings are near the 30 percent mark, according to the same polls.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","2012 presidential race defeated rep ,policy hot potatoes dividing politicians ,presidential race defeated rep park ,the opposition 2012 presidential hopeful ,the 2012 presidential race defeated","['New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Seoul', 'Moon', 'Park Geun', 'Park Jie - win', 'Park', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Moon Jae - in', 'yonhap)rep', 'Joo Seung - yong', 'Jun Byung - hun', 'Jung Cheong - rae', 'you Seung - hee', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Saenuri Party', 'Moon', 'Park', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'the Saenuri Party', 'NPAD', 'Park', 'NPAD', 'Cabinet', 'Moon', 'roh Moo - hyun', 'Lee', 'Park Geun - hye ’s', 'Park', 'Moon', 'Chung Dong - young', 'NPAD', 'Moon', 'Jeolla', 'Moon', 'Gallup Korea', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Park', 'Jeong Hunny']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.15954846  0.18455099

""I will wage a full-out war with the government of President Park Geun-hye if it continues to ruins democracy and the livelihoods of ordinary people.""Moon replaces the current interim chief, Moon Hee-sang, who took office in September after his predecessor resigned amid factional infighting.NPAD has been headed by the interim leader since its two co-leaders -- Kim Han-gil and Ahn Cheol-soo -- stepped down to take responsibility for the party's crushing defeat in July's parliamentary by-elections.The new NPAD leader is faced with a daunting task of regaining public confidence in the opposition party, which has been dogged by infighting between a pro-Roh faction and others.Moon pledged to end the ""factional politics"" by establishing a transparent and fair nomination system to pick the right candidates for the upcoming general election. A weekly survey by Gallup Korea showed Friday that the approval rating for NPAD came to 24 percent, far lower than the ruling party's 41 percent.The new leader is seen as a potential presidential candidate in the next election slated for late 2017. In the previous election in December 2012, Moon was the standard-bearer of NPAD's predecessor but he eventually lost to then candidate and now President Park Geun-hye of the ruling Saenuri Party.Before the national convention, Moon said he would not stand for the next parliamentary elections scheduled for 2016 if he is elected chairman.In response to the new chief's strong stance on the Park administration, the ruling Saenuri Party urged Moon to lead his own party in harmony and make bipartisan efforts to deal with urgent issues pending in the parliament.  ""The temporary parliamentary session in February should be a turning point as should work with the ruling party to handle several issues, including reform of the government employees' pension system and bills aimed at boosting the economy,"" Saenuri spokesman Kwon Eun-hee said in a briefing.

Jin Sun-mee claimed that Lee made profits by buying and selling four apartments in Gangnam and Banpo, residential districts in southern Seoul that were designated as speculation zones by the government at that time.Lee purchased the four apartments after entering public service in 1974, Jin said. The NPAD lawmaker cited property documents showing that Lee had purchased three apartments in the Banpo district of Seoul in the late 1970s and early ’80s by taking out loans on the properties. Lee began by taking out a loan on his first home and using it to buy an apartment in Banpo district in 1978, Jin said. “He took out additional loans on his second home and used the new money to buy a third home. Lee sold the second home once it doubled in value.”Lee used the same method to buy his fourth home in the late 1980s, the NPAD lawmaker added.“This is pretty much standard practice for real estate speculators,” Jin said, adding that the district was a hot target for speculators at the time.This is the latest in a long list of criticisms of Lee, who was appointed to the Prime Minister’s Office on Jan. 23 by President Park Geun-hye.Jin’s allegation adds to suspicions that Lee profited from land deals in Gyeonggi Province in 2000, while serving as a lawmaker on a parliamentary panel overseeing national real estate policy. The value of the property reportedly rose 10-fold between the time of purchase and sale.Lee is also accused of purchasing and selling an apartment in the Gangnam district of Seoul in 2003. The ex-floor leader of the Saenuri Party made a profit, his critics say, of over 400 million won ($367,512).But Lee has denied the charges, saying he has paid related taxes and has not done anything illegal. Lee’s supporters have said the experienced politician will reveal everything at his confirmation hearing next Monday. The NPAD and Saenuri Party are at loggerheads over whom to call in as witnesses to the hearing, suggesting that it could be postponed.Statements by top NPAD officials have shown, though, that Lee is likely to pass the confirmation, despite the accusations.NPAD floor leader Rep. Woo Yoon-keun most recently told the incumbent Prime Minister Chung Hong-won that he had done a “good job during his time in office” during a nationally televised speech Wednesday, apparently implying that Lee would soon replace Chung.Lee earned a reputation as a reasonable negotiator on divisive partisan issues during his term as Saenuri Party floor leader last year.

Woo Yoon-keun of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy repeated demands for constitutional revisions aimed at decreasing the president’s authority over domestic political affairs.Constitutional amendments would resolve not only the country’s political problems but also its long-term economic worries, such as fears over deflation and rising debt levels, Woo said.“Our country is marked by a series of monopolies,” the three-term lawmaker added. “Monopolies are omnipresent in our economy, in politics, and throughout other parts of our society.”“Our nation’s partisan fights have more often hindered efforts to fix our economy,” he continued. “I trust that revisions to the Constitution will offer a fundamental resolution.”Calls to revise the Constitution and thereby limit the president’s powers are decades old. But the NPAD and some members of President Park’s governing Saenuri Party, the dominant parties in Seoul, have reignited the debate in recent months.They support forming a parliamentary panel to discuss details of possible reforms such as taking away the president’s right to nominate members of her Cabinet and the Constitutional Court, while giving more authority to the prime minister, a post widely considered to be ceremonial.Park has refused to discuss the proposals though, saying such debates would divert public attention away from more urgent economic reform plans.Potential reforms suggested by the president include plugging what her supporters call the “debt-sucking” pension for retired civil servants, implementing a more laissez-faire policy in the labor market, and easing mortgage loan rules to increase home purchases. Some of these ideas have been dubbed “Choinomics,” after Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan, who masterminded many of them.Woo called “Choinomics” a failure during his speech.“The government is asking citizens to take more loans even as household debt levels continue past the 1 quadrillion won ($921 billion) mark.”South Korea’s household debt stands at 1.06 quadrillion won as of the third quarter of 2014, according to Bank of Korea estimates.Saenuri Party officials offered a measured response to Woo’s remarks.“Discussing constitutional reforms could hamper the government’s efforts to revive our economy,” Rep. Park Dae-chul said. “Putting it up to a referendum is a bit too early.”“There were many parts in Rep. Woo’s speech that deserve careful consideration and debate,” Saenuri Party spokesman Rep. Kim Young-woo said.“But he seems to have agreed that it’s the economy that requires our attention.

In June of last year, a local appeals court overturned the decision in favor of the four test-takers, and the education authorities changed the scores of all affected students.“The KICE has already canceled grading for all the plaintiffs. A case for an already resolved action is illegitimate,” the court said in its ruling. As of now, a group of 100 test-takers have filed a separate lawsuit against the state, demanding to be compensated for damage inflicted upon them by the flawed question. Last year’s ruling that the Suneung question was flawed touched off public concern over the accuracy of the annual test, and further concerns arose after the discovery of two more errors on the 2014 exam.

Woo Yoon-keun, floor leader of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, made the call during a speech marking the start of this month's extra parliamentary session, saying the National Assembly should launch a special committee to begin discussions on the issue this month.  ""We should leave open all possibilities, including decentralization and a parliamentary system, draw up a proposal over a year for a constitutional amendment that goes beyond partisan politics, based on the discussions so far, and put it to a referendum during the April parliamentary elections next year,"" he said in his address to the National Assembly.  Woo's proposal comes amid a renewed debate over whether the current Constitution drawn up in 1987 should be amended to change the president's single, five-year term to a four-year term with the possibility of re-election, among other issues.  South Korea introduced the single-term presidency in 1987 after decades of autocratic rule by military-backed presidents. The system was primarily aimed at keeping the president from attempting to hold on to power through illicit means.  ""A constitutional revision is not just a matter of interest for politicians, but a demand of the people, and the people are calling for political stability through a constitutional amendment,"" Woo said.  President Park Geun-hye has expressed strong opposition to the idea of a constitutional debate, saying it would become a ""black hole"" for other pending issues, including the task of reviving the slumping economy.  Citing Park's 2012 campaign pledge to push for a constitutional revision, Woo demanded she publicly acknowledge if she is unable to keep her promise.  The ruling Saenuri Party expressed reservations about the proposal, saying it is premature to consider a referendum on a constitutional amendment.  ""Now is the time to concentrate the country's resources on reviving the economy, not on revising the Constitution,"" ruling party spokesman Park Dae-chul said in a press briefing.

As Moon’s remark sparked a heated controversy, Cheong Wa Dae again reversed its decision the next day, stressing that the minister was expressing his own view and that the government would stick to the original plan. Amid growing disputes over the government’s unclear policies, a high-ranking Health Ministry official told reporters that the government would soon propose a plan to reform the system and consult with the ruling Saenuri Party, noting that the new party leadership has promised to fully support the plan. “With the new floor leader elected, the government and the party are likely to resume talks soon over the revamp of the national insurance fee,” the official said. The ministry’s abrupt decision came a day after Rep. Yoo Seong-min won the primary vote for Saenuri Party leader on Monday, defeating former Maritime Minister Rep. Lee Joo-young, who is considered a pro-Park lawmaker. Yoo’s victory was seen as a power shift in the party’s leadership, as the nonmainstream lawmaker was expected to make critical approaches to the president’s policies. Critics say Yoo’s victory will consolidate Saenuri chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung’s control of the party. Rep. Kim is known as President Park’s longtime political rival.Saenuri leader Kim went head-to-head against Park’s welfare policies earlier in the day, claiming it was impossible to implement welfare expansion without a tax boost.“Welfare without a tax increase is impossible and it is inappropriate for a politician to deceive the public with such words,” Rep. Kim said in speech delivered at an extra parliamentary session that kicked off Tuesday.Welfare expansion was the centerpiece of Park’s presidential campaign.Park promised to provide free child care services and a higher monthly allowance for elderly citizens and to revise the current health insurance program to fairly impose fees based on subscribers’ income level. Park pledged to expand these welfare programs without increasing tax rates. The president appeared confident in her first and second years in the office, as she vowed to create new income sources from the underground economy and curtail unnecessary and costly state-led projects. The Park government, however, came recently under fire as it raised tobacco prices, pushed to reform public servants’ pension system and introduced a revised tax settlement scheme, which were seen as attempts to collect more money from ordinary wage earners to operate the costly welfare policies.“Many voted for welfare pledges when the politicians introduced free child care, free meals and halved tuition fees,” said Rep. Kim. “Everyone applauded the campaign pledge making the state responsible for children’s education and (elderly) care, but nobody cared about paying the bills,” he said.

It is proposed to develop 20 pilot lectures within this year and gradually increase the number to 500 by 2018, according to the plan unveiled in Tuesday’s weekly Cabinet meeting. The ministry will also use existing lectures provided by Korea Open Course Ware, an e-learning service that provides video lectures and reference materials for higher education that was launched in 2007.As of December, 9,628 classes are provided by 183 colleges and universities across the country.The government will be in charge of creating the platform, but individual colleges will maintain the respective courses they provide. People who complete the courses can receive certification.A majority of Korea’s top-tier colleges have shown interest in the 2.2 billion won ($2 million) project, according to a ministry official. The government has yet to finalize a plan to actually grant degrees or college credits for K-MOOC lectures.“The credibility of online learning still needs public approval, so accreditation of courses acquired (via K-MOOC) is something we have to review in the long term,” the official said. But students can still receive credits if a college running online courses incorporates suitable measures, for example by also letting them take offline courses or tests.The ministry hopes that the K-MOOC system will impact the overall tertiary education system in Korea and ultimately enhance its global competence. The concept of MOOCs, which aim at unlimited participation and open access to online courses, was introduced in 2008 and gained worldwide popularity in 2012. Many world-renowned higher education institutes including Harvard University and Massachusetts Institution of Technology provide the open online courses.Compared with traditional modes of education, MOOC has a distinct advantage of being highly accessible for people of virtually all age groups and professions. Simon Nelson, the chief executive officer of U.K.-based MOOC platform FutureLearn, believes learning will no longer be perceived just for post-graduates and occasional training courses at work. “I think we all have to face a world where we need to retrain several times in our lives, and move into new areas,” he said.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","to develop 20 pilot lectures ,unveiled in tuesday weekly cabinet ,develop 20 pilot lectures ,develop 20 pilot lectures within ,in tuesday weekly cabinet meeting","['the Education Ministry', 'korean', 'Cabinet', 'Korea', 'K - MOOC', 'K - MOOC', 'Korea', 'Harvard University and Massachusetts Institution of Technology', 'Simon Nelson', 'FutureLearn', 'Yoon Min - sik']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54947829  0.30185488

Last week, Park's approval rating dropped to an all-time low of 29 percent in the Gallup poll.  Park also called on officials to make thorough preparations before implementing policies and to make sure that even small side effects won't occur.  ""I hope that the presidential office and the Cabinet will strengthen prior consultations and coordination"" Park said in a Cabinet meeting.  The comments came two days after the government announced a plan to launch a joint consultative body meant to better coordinate policies between the Cabinet and the presidential office.  She also called on officials to ensure that legislations meant to root out child abuse at daycare centers pass through parliament this month.  A series of child abuse incidents took place at some daycare centers, including one in which a female teacher was seen in footage from security cameras punching a 4-year-old girl on the side of her head. The girl fell on the floor with her two legs up in the air.  The incident has caused a national uproar, prompting the government and the ruling Saenuri Party to unveil a set of measures to toughen punishment for child abuse at daycare centers.  Also Tuesday, Park expressed gratitude for the first wave of health care workers who have returned home after treating patients in Ebola-hit Sierra Leone for about one month.

He was also found guilty of defecting from his unit with weapons and killing a superior officer.A soldier who kills a superior officer can be sentenced to death, according to Korea’s military laws. Army sergeant identified by the surname Lim is seen after appearing in court in Wonju, Gangwon Province on Jan. 16. (Yonhap)“The accused has committed a tenacious and elaborate crime. A death penalty is inevitable for the cruelty of gunning down innocent comrades,” the General Military Court of the First Army Headquarters in Wonju, Gangwon Province, said. “He also discarded his duties as a soldier to protect the safety and property of people. (The court) must hold him accountable for causing a severe security vacuum, and sound an alarm against such a horrid crime.”The court also pointed out that rather than apologize to the victims, he complained about his own sufferings and blamed fellow soldiers for the deaths.  Investigators had said Lim must receive capital punishment for “committing a ruthless and premeditated crime against unarmed men.” They added he had shown no signs of remorse and attempted to justify his crimes by saying he had been bullied by his colleagues in the barracks.A month before the incident, Lim had reportedly been involved in a quarrel with another soldier.His legal representative complained that the court had ignored several testimonies proving that Lim had been bullied, and said he would launch an appeal.A family representative of the victims said it was an “obvious ruling” and urged authorities to make sure such an incident would not reoccur. A psychiatric evaluation of Lim released in January indicated signs of paranoia typically found in bullying victims, but concluded that these were within a normal range.At 8:15 p.m. on June 21, Lim detonated a grenade and opened fire in and outside his unit’s barracks, killing or injuring a dozen soldiers. He then fled the scene with a K-2 rifle, 60 bullets and a grenade.He was captured the next day north of the Civilian Access Control Line near the border after a gunfight with troops attempting to apprehend him.Lim joined the Army in December 2012 for his mandatary military service and was to be discharged in September 2014.The case is the worst military killing spree since 2005, when a soldier killed eight people and left two seriously injured. It also underscored the immense stress general outpost units are forced to endure, including the physical and mental pressure of having to stand guard for long hours in an isolated area.Right before the accident, Lim had conducted vigilance duty for nearly six hours.A 2012 report published by the Korea Armed Forces Nursing Academy showed that about 12.8 percent of GOP soldiers were heavily stressed, due mainly to “lack of personal time” and the “tedious and unchanging work.”By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","sergeant who killed five soldiers ,army sergeant who killed five ,officer soldier who kills superior ,military killing spree since 2005 ,2005 when soldier killed eight","['Army', 'inter - korean', 'Lim', 'Army Division', 'Goseong , Gangwon Province', 'Korea', 'Army', 'Lim', 'Wonju', 'Gangwon Province', 'the General Military Court', 'the First Army Headquarters', 'Wonju', 'Gangwon Province', 'Lim', 'Lim', 'Lim', 'Lim', 'Lim', 'k-2', 'the Civilian Access Control line', 'Lim', 'Army', 'Lim', 'the Korea Armed Forces Nursing Academy', 'GOP', 'Yoon Min - sik']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39633775  0.40094635

Kim Moo-sung addresses the National Assembly on Tuesday. (Yonhap)""Welfare without tax hikes is impossible and it isn't right for a politician to deceive the public with such words,"" he said in his address to the National Assembly.  President Park Geun-hye promised during her 2012 election campaign to expand welfare programs without increasing tax rates. Early in her term, she vowed to regularize the underground economy, curtail unnecessary projects and plug tax loopholes in order to fund the programs.  In recent months, however, the government has raised tobacco prices, pushed to reform civil service pensions and introduced a revised tax settlement scheme, all of which critics argue are designed to squeeze more money out of ordinary wage earners.  ""In order to enjoy the benefits of welfare as a right of the people, one must realize that one must bear the cost of paying taxes as an obligation of the people,"" Kim said, citing the examples of Argentina and Greece, which experienced serious financial trouble due to their short-sighted welfare expansion.  ""We must carry out an overall inspection of how our welfare budget is spent,"" he said. ""Based on the results, tax hikes should be pursued when no alternative can be found after seeking the public's opinion.""  The main opposition party, the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, offered a different solution to the problem, saying the real reason for the lack of funds lies in tax cuts for the rich.  ""Talking about tax hikes in order to avoid withdrawing tax cuts for the rich, after increasing all sorts of taxes for the working class, is the sort of thing Chairman Kim pointed out a politician shouldn't do,"" NPAD spokesman Park Soo-hyun said in a press briefing.

The incident sparked public outrage in South Korea.Cho has been charged with air safety violations as well as coercing staff to give false testimony and interfering in the execution of their duty.In court on Monday, chief purser Park Chang-Jin accused Cho of treating flight attendants like ""feudal slaves"" and urged her to reflect sincerely on her ""irrational and senseless"" conduct.""I think Cho did not show an ounce of conscience, treating powerless people like myself as feudal slaves and forcing us to sacrifice unilaterally,"" he said in a tearful voice.""Like a beast that found its prey gritting its teeth, she yelled and became violent, never listening to what I said,"" he said.Park has said Cho made him kneel and beg for forgiveness while jabbing him with a service manual.On Monday Cho apologized for her ""rash"" conduct but insisted the affair originated from the breach of the service manual by flight attendants.She denied using violence against Park and said the pilot made a final decision to force him off the plane.Her lawyers have argued that there had been no breach of safety laws, given that the plane had not even reached the runway when it turned back.Prosecutors also demanded a two-year jail sentence each for a company executive charged with evidence-tampering and a transport ministry official, who is accused of leaking details of a government probe into the case.Cho, the eldest daughter of Korean Air chief Cho Yang-Ho, has been in custody since Dec. 30.Cho Yang-Ho has said no crew members would lose their jobs over the incident or subsequent investigations.But Park, who returned to work on Sunday, expressed concern about possible damage to his career -- saying he had been treated like an ""expendable.""The incident was seen as emblematic of a generation of spoilt and arrogant offspring of owners of the giant family-run conglomerates, or ""chaebols,"" that dominate the economy.The story hit international headlines and was seen as something of a national embarrassment, with South Korean media commentators suggesting Cho had shamed the country.The transport ministry plans to sanction KAL with a limited flight route ban that could last for up to a month, or fines of up to $2 million.

Her rating slipped to 29.7 percent on Tuesday, the lowest since she entered office early 2013. The government’s controversial tax settlement scheme seems to be correlated to the sharp decline, Realmeter said in a statement.The poll ratings climbed up slowly starting on Wednesday as the president tried to please the public by visiting marketplaces and a day care center in Incheon, it added. For the survey, 2,500 adults were interviewed nationwide between last Monday and Friday. The poll has a 2 percent margin of error and a 95 percent confidence level.Observers say Park’s steadily falling ratings will unsettle her nerves and press her to quickly finalize her reshuffle plan, possibly by early this week. Park appointed former Saenuri floor leader Rep. Lee Wan-koo as new prime minister and replaced her senior secretaries two weeks ago. Park said that she would also conduct a “small-scale” Cabinet reshuffle at her New Year’s conference last month. Some insiders say that the president could announce lists of new Cabinet members on Tuesday at the earliest, and also hinted that she could replace her chief of staff, who has been accused of exercising too much power in terms of state affairs and personnel choices.Park vowed Monday that she would avoid causing the public further concern by closely working with the ruling Saenuri Party over policy coordination. While expressing her gratitude for congratulatory messages for her 63rd birthday on Monday, senior presidential press secretary Yoon Doo-hyun told reporters in the morning that the president was set to have lunch with her chief of staff and other senior presidential secretaries at Cheong Wa Dae.“There was no birthday event planned but we will have a simple lunch at (the president’s) residence as senior secretaries wish to (celebrate the day),” said Yoon.Park has come under fire for her government’s revised tax settlement scheme and suspended plans to revamp the national health insurance system, with many questioning her principles-based leadership.Controversy escalated last week after Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo said he would not consider introducing a new system to levy more health insurance fees on high earners. The remark quickly raised speculation that the minister may have been under pressure from the presidential office to backpedal on the policy to avoid agitating taxpayers already upset with the recent tax increases. The Park government has come under fire as some people with an annual income of less than 55 million won ($50,700) will have to pay additional taxes this year due to a new tax scheme.In an obvious move to placate the public, the Cabinet and presidential office said Sunday they would launch a joint consultative body to coordinate government policies. The new committee will consist of the two deputy prime ministers for economic and social affairs, the minister for government policy coordination, and three senior presidential secretaries for policy coordination, public relations and economic affairs, officials said.Pundits and the opposition party, however, lashed out at Park’s new joint body, stressing that it would not help to solve the political crisis that has arisen over her inconsistent welfare policies. The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy urged the president to give up on her welfare policies if unable to implement them without boosting taxes. Launching a new committee would not help her win back public support, it stressed. “Public distrust of the government’s policies is expanding as it has backtracked on plans to revise tax settlement, reform the health insurance system, and raise automobile and residence tax,” said NPAD chairman Moon Hee-sang at a party meeting.“It is because of the government’s unrealistic policies and its belief that welfare expansion is possible without a tax increase.”By Cho Chung-un(christory@heraldcorp.com)","hit record low last week ,2013 the government controversial tax ,her senior secretaries two weeks ,leadership controversy escalated last week ,her 63rd birthday on monday","['Park Geun - hye ’s', 'realmeter', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'Realmeter', 'Incheon', 'Park ’s', 'Saenuri', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Park', 'Cabinet', 'Saenuri Party', 'Yoon Doo - hyun', 'Cheong Wa Dae', 'Yoon', 'Park', 'Health', 'Moon Hyung - pyo', 'Cabinet', 'Park ’s', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'NPAD', 'Moon Hee - sing', 'Cho Chung-un(christory@heraldcorp.com']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37281853  0.36147994

Lee Ju-young after winning the election on Monday at the National Assembly. (Lee Gil-dong/The Korea Herald)Economist-turned-lawmaker Rep. Yoo Seong-min won the primary vote for Saenuri Party floor leader on Monday, defeating former Maritime Minister Rep. Lee Joo-young with about 56 percent of the vote.Yoo’s victory appears to be an unofficial no-confidence vote for President Park Geun-hye from her governing Saenuri Party, as he is expected to take a critical approach to the president’s policies.Park’s approval ratings have continued to dip on the heels of alleged scandals in the presidential office and public uproar over increased taxes in this year’s settlements, stirring fear among Saenuri lawmakers looking to run in the 2016 parliamentary elections. Realmeter reported on Monday that President Park’s approval rating hit 32.2 percent, the lowest weekly figure recorded by the pollster since her inauguration.Yoo, a third-term lawmaker, told Saenuri lawmakers he would support government policies “that have the support of our people,” sparking speculation among observers that he would support Park’s policies if her approval ratings rose as the 2016 elections near.Before entering politics, Yoo worked at the Korea Development Institute, a government-run think tank focusing on economic issues.Yoo’s running mate Rep. Won Yoo-chul will serve as the party’s Chairperson of the Policy Committee, the top policy adviser to the floor leader. The primary has been seen as a contest between pro-Park Lee and the reportedly anti-Park Yoo.Lee and his running mate Rep. Hong Moon-jong have openly expressed their support for the president. Hong has claimed he would become Park’s “cheerleader” if elected. Lee has echoed one of Park’s campaign pledges from the 2012 presidential race, “welfare without taxation.”Their rivals Yoo and Won were seen as the anti-Park candidates in the floor leader primary, although Yoo has publicly contested the label. “I am neither a pro-Park nor an anti-Park figure,” Yoo said before the vote. “I will strictly follow what our citizenry demands.”Yoo was close to Park when he served as Park’s chief of staff, and as a key adviser to her during the 2007 Saenuri Party presidential primary.But rifts between Yoo and Park have steadily widened since the 2012 parliamentary elections, when Yoo protested what he called “Park’s closed-ear policy.” He is also reported to have declared “never to work with Park.”Park was the Saenuri Party’s interim chair at the time.A majority of the 158 Saenuri Party lawmakers participated in Monday’s vote with 84 casting ballots for Yoo, 65 for Lee and nine abstaining.

The de facto heiress of the flag carrier was found to have ordered the taxiing plane to return to the gate.A prosecutor stressed during the trial hearing at the Seoul Seobu District Court that Cho should be held accountable for hampering aviation safety by abusing her authority.The prosecution is pushing several other charges against Cho, including obstructing the staff in their official duties.A key issue is whether the court will accept the prosecutors’ argument that she violated the law that bans passengers from pressuring crew members to deviate from the flight route. Further, Cho faces charges of physically and verbally assaulting a female flight attendant as well as the cabin crew chief. Park Chang-jin, the cabin crew manager who had been pressured off the flight, backed up the charges during his testimony in the final trial, saying Cho “hustled a (female) flight attendant with some abusive words.” Park, 44, said he had also been beaten by the ex-vice president, adding that both Cho and her father Cho Yang-ho, the chairman of Korean Air and its parent Hanjin Group, had yet to apologize to him over the nut rage incident.The Hanjin Group chief ― appearing as a witness in last week’s court hearing for his daughter ― promised that Park would not suffer any occupational disadvantages. Flight crew manager Park resumed his duties aboard a domestic flight from Gimpo to Busan on Feb. 1.Defendant Cho argued that she had not noticed that the plane was taxiing, adding that she did not order its return to the gate.Cho pointed the blame at the female flight attendant, claiming that she failed to abide by the manual when serving passengers.

Yoo is a three-term legislator and a former researcher at the Korea Development Institute, a state-run think tank focusing on economic policies.The primary is expected to be close. But whoever wins will play the unofficial party whip of the majority Saenuri Party in the National Assembly, as President Park struggles to push through an array of unpopular reforms to areas including civil servants’ pension and the labor market.Many of her proposals have drawn mixed responses from the public at best, compelling vote-wary legislators to defer passing related amendments, with just over one year left until the 2016 parliamentary elections.Analysts consider Lee to be a pro-Park figure, and if he wins, the lawmaker is likely to support many, although not all of the president’s reforms, by passing related revisions in the Assembly. If Yoo wins, he is expected to take a more critical approach to Park’s policies.The reforms on the nation’s pension for retired bureaucrats have drawn a fierce backlash from government officials, the main beneficiaries of the pension. Park proposes decreasing the government’s gross payouts from the pension, as it is expected to deplete national coffers in the coming decades, burdening future taxpayers.

If it is passed, lawmakers, government officials, and possibly journalists, among others, will be subject to strict penalties for graft.The bill is named after its initial proposer, who served as a Supreme Court Justice and the head of the Anti-Corruption & Civil Rights Commission, a government body. It proposes penalizing civil servants and their families found to have received gifts, however small.That would include officials who take ostensibly innocent gifts such as Christmas or birthday presents.The bill also proposed putting non-government officials working for the public good subject to the bill, such as members of the media and teachers in private secondary schools.Critics have alleged that the bill is unnecessarily overreaching.The governing Saenuri Party and the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy have conducted intermittent debates on the bill, trying to narrow its sweeping nature.Lawmakers at the National Assembly’s National Policy Committee passed a version of the bill that put the bar at 1 million won ($907) on Jan. 8. Officials who receive more than that amount will face criminal charges, while those taking lesser gifts will face fines.The bill is pending before the Legislation & Judiciary Committee, which is the final debating ground for the main parties, before a draft law is voted on at a plenary session.Debates over controversial bills at plenary sessions are often symbolic, as partisan divisions over such bills are ironed out beforehand at the Assembly’s judiciary panel.Judiciary committee chief NPAD Rep. Lee Sang-min has hinted that his panel could take some time before OK’ing the bill, due to its overreaching character, despite bipartisan support for the legislation.More divisive partisan battles this session are expected elsewhere.The special investigative committee on the Lee Myung-bak administration’s resource diplomacy policy will hold a meeting Monday to decide on witnesses to testify before the panel.NPAD officials have consistently demanded key administration officials testify, including incumbent Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan, and former officials in the Korea National Oil Corporation, Korea Resources Corporation, and other public bodies that participated in the policy.Saenuri Party officials have consistently refused, citing that calling in such officials is “unprecedented.”Ex-President Lee and top officials in his administration are accused of investing public money into risky foreign ventures on energy development.Prime Minister nominee Lee’s confirmation hearing will also present the main parties with grounds for political fighting.

The arrest warrant was issued by Seoul Central District Court.The 62-year-old is believed to have received about 770 million ($702,000) from STX Engine and STX Offshore and Shipbuilding, according to a government task force on military corruption. The bribe was allegedly made in exchange for helping the companies win supplying contracts for engines and ships in 2008. The transaction was made via a yacht company of which Jung’s son is a majority shareholder, according to investigators. The junior Jung held a yacht competition at a fleet review hosted by the Navy in October 2008, where the two affiliates of STX Group handed his company 380 million won as “advertisement fees.”Investigators took Jung and his son into custody on Wednesday and questioned him whether there were any strings attached to the payment. They believe Jung demanded the money through a man surnamed Yun, who was at the time an outside director of STX.Jung had denied the accusations, but investigators said they had acquired testimony to back the charges from Yun and other former high-ranking officials of STX.This is not the first time Jung has been accused of wrongdoing; in 2012, a local court sentenced him to a two year prison term suspended for three years on charge of embezzling the Navy’s welfare fund while he held the top post. Jung served as the Navy’s chief of naval operations for two years from March 2008.He became the highest profile military personnel to be arrested since a pan-government probe into Korea’s military defense acquisition programs kicked off in November. The ongoing probe has uncovered rampant corruption links between defense firms and the military.Last week, a former Navy rear admiral under investigation for his alleged involvement in a graft case jumped into Seoul’s Han River in an apparent suicide attempt. His body is yet to be found.“Investigations on these corruption cases cannot be concluded as just wrongdoings of a few high-ranking officials, and must be used as a chance to stamp out systematic corruption within the military,” the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy said Sunday in a public statement.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","navy procurement programs the arrest ,junior jung held yacht competition ,into custody saturday on charges ,corruption links between defense firms ,receiving kickbacks from local shipbuilders","['Navy', 'Seoul Central District Court', 'STX Engine', 'STX Offshore and Shipbuilding', 'Jung', 'Navy', 'STX Group', 'Jung', 'Jung', 'Yun', 'Jung', 'Navy', 'Jung', 'Navy', 'Korea', 'Navy', 'Seoul', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Yoon Min - sik']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.13755585  0.14959396

The Supreme Court said it was clear that the extreme work pressure led to his suicide, overturning a decision by a lower court that the company was not responsible for his death. The top court returned the case to the Seoul High Court for review. “Oh worked at the company normally and even moved up the corporate ladder until the company decided to send him overseas. The pressure of having to use English fluently, coupled with his fear that his poor language skills could cause the company damage, appears to have resulted in extreme work-related pressure that accelerated his depression,” the court said in its ruling.The botched dispatch to Kuwait had severe effects on Oh. He suffered from extreme depression even though he was relocated to the company’s head office in Seoul and was promoted as a department head months later.“I don’t even know how I’ll face my subordinates when I can’t even work overseas because I can’t speak English,” he reportedly told his family. In December 2008, five months after he decided to stay in Seoul, he jumped to his death from the company building.Oh’s wife filed a lawsuit against the Korean Workers’ Compensation and Welfare Service in 2010, claiming Oh’s death was the result of an industrial accident and the family should receive benefits.But the Seoul Administrative Court dismissed her case, saying that it was reasonable for the company to ask Oh to work overseas. It added that the source of his stress had been removed when the company overturned its decision to send him to Kuwait. Korean law stipulates that if a worker commits suicide, it should be considered an industrial accident if it has been medically proven that the victim committed the act while his or her power of restraint, cognitive ability or decision-making capability was substantially compromised by work-related stress. The victim also needs to have been treated for a mental condition stemming from work-related stress.In spite of the previous ruling, the Supreme Court said there was a substantial connection between Oh’s death and his work. The psychological pains stemming from Oh’s fear of being disadvantaged at the company for his inability to work overseas were very severe, it said.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","death from the company building ,pressure led to his suicide ,his death from the company ,oh killed himself in 2008 ,worker commits suicide","['the Supreme Court', 'Kuwait', 'the Supreme Court', 'the Seoul High Court', 'Kuwait', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'the Korean Workers ’ Compensation and Welfare Service', 'the Seoul Administrative Court', 'Kuwait', 'korean', 'the Supreme Court', 'Yoon Min - sik']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41705066  0.20787235

Comedian Lee Soo-geun (SM C&C;)Lee is only one of many celebrities who have been rapped by the courts for allegedly violating their legal duty to “maintain a positive conduct” as models for their respective advertisers.Last week, the court ordered actress Lee Seung-yeon, who was put on probation for drug abuse in 2013, to compensate the company she was representing by paying 100 million won. K-pop girl group Kara, who was entangled in a legal battle with its agency last year, was forced to pay 50 million won to the company that the group endorsed. Companies that hired actress Clara -- who is currently in a controversial dispute with her agency -- as their model, are reportedly preparing to file a damage suit against the actress.What exactly are the legal grounds for the celebrities to compensate the companies they represent for what may seem like “private issues?”One major source of legal power comes from the contents of the original contract signed between both sides.Typically included in such contracts is a key clause stipulating that the star must maintain a positive conduct and refrain from any behavior that will damage the image of the company or its product.Such a clause gives the advertiser legal power to file a damage suit against the hired model, who may have harmed the advertiser’s reputation through whatever form of public misconduct.In determining the degree of responsibility as well as the amount of compensation that must be paid, the presence or absence of action-specific clauses is important, legal experts say.Most contracts include a clause that outlines specific procedures for different situations -- in case the celebrity is indicted for criminal activities or commits acts publicly deemed immoral, the celebrity must pay back twice the amount originally received for the modeling service.When such clauses are absent, the settlement process becomes more complex. The prosecution must provide evidence that clearly shows the amount of financial and public damage suffered due to lapses by the celebrity.Perhaps more important is defining the so-called notion of “positive conduct and behavior” and its boundaries. For the notion is by nature subjective, it is often difficult to draw the line between a celebrity’s right to privacy and freedom of action, and the profit-related concerns of the company that hired them as models.More often than not, a number of unfortunate celebrities suffer serious damage to their public image due to issues that are out of their control.One such victim is actor Lee Byung-hun, who is married to actress Lee Min-Jung. Lee’s reputation plummeted when video footage suggesting that he was involved in a romantic relationship with a singer and model began circulating.Though the court later proved that the two women blackmailed Lee for financial gains, he ended up losing many key advertising contracts as public opinion had turned against him.To protect the rights of both the celebrities and the companies that hire them as models, it is important that both parties draw up clauses as specifically as possible when signing an advertising contract, legal experts said.By Sohn Ji-young (jys@heraldcorp.com)","losing many key advertising contracts ,women blackmailed lee for financial ,for illegal gambling in 2013 ,his social misconduct comedian lee ,20 billion won damage suit","['South Korea', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'Lee Soo - geun', 'Lee', 'Comedian Lee Soo - geun', 'SM C&C;)Lee', 'Lee Seung - yeon', 'Kara', 'Clara', 'Lee Byung - hun', 'Lee Min - Jung', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Sohn Ji - young']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.16611442  0.09921971

Investigators said that financial difficulties might have led him to commit the heinous crime. A graduate of a prestigious college, Kang had been unemployed for three years after leaving his job at an Oriental medicine clinic in southern Seoul. After taking out a bank loan of 500 million won (US$454,000) with his apartment put up as collateral, he lost a large sum in unprofitable stock investments, according to the investigators.

Lee has vowed to clear his name at his confirmation hearing next Monday, three days before the National Assembly puts his appointment to a final vote.His critics fall into two camps. A moderate group says Lee’s confirmation hearing should focus on examining the nominee’s competence as the president’s top deputy. Hard-liners say that his past raises questions that must be answered. Prime Minister nominee Lee Wan-koo answers questions from reporters in front of his temporary office in Tongui-dong, Seoul, Thursday. (Yonhap)NPAD hard-liners appear to be focusing their firepower on allegations that Lee speculated on land in Gyeonggi Province in 2000, when he was serving on the parliamentary panel that oversees national real estate policy. The value of the land he bought is thought to have risen tenfold.His critics have also cited property records showing that the governing Saenuri Party’s former floor leader bought a luxury apartment in the relatively wealthy Gangnam district of Seoul in 2003, before selling it six months later for approximately 39 percent higher than the initial price.Lee denied the charges, reiterating that he has documents to prove related tax payments and claimed that he sold the properties for reasons unrelated to speculation.NPAD hard-liners have also launched attacks pertaining to Lee’s family, although main opposition officials appear to be retreating on those issues, after moderates hinted that the charges had gone too far.Those attacks include an accusation that Lee’s second son dodged mandatory military service in 2006 by faking a leg injury, with Lee’s implicit approval.In tears, Lee vowed Thursday that his son would take an MRI image of the leg. “I feel mixed emotions, because I could be asking him to do something beyond anything a father should ask his son to do,” he said.Seoul National University Hospital officials later told reporters that X-ray photos of the leg “likely showed an earlier surgery in the ligament following an injury.”Another charge against his family involves his brother, who was arrested in 2011 for influence peddling and receiving bribes from public contractors in South Chungcheong Province. Lee was governor there until 2009.NPAD officials have also questioned Lee’s stint with law enforcement during ex-President Chun Doo-hwan’s rule in the early 1980s’, when Chun, a military dictator, used his influence over the military and police to impose an authoritarian regime.The list goes on. But Lee appears confident that he will survive the political onrush, saying he will reveal everything at his confirmation hearing.President Park Geun-hye last Friday named Lee to join her Cabinet as her No. 2. Park supporters hope his reputation as a moderate compromiser among lawmakers from both the Saenuri Party and the NPAD will help boost the president’s struggling approval rating, which slid below 30 percent this week according to Realmeter, a local pollster.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","opposition party officials on thursday ,hospital officials later told reporters ,president struggling approval rating ,second son dodged mandatory military ,his confirmation hearing next monday","['Lee Wan - koo', 'Cabinet', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'the National Assembly', 'Lee', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Tongui - dong', 'Seoul', 'Lee', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Saenuri Party ’s', 'Gangnam district', 'Seoul', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Seoul National University Hospital', 'South Chungcheong Province', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Chun Doo - hwan', 'Chun', 'Lee', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Lee', 'Cabinet', 'park', 'the Saenuri Party', 'NPAD', 'Jeong Hunny']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.17069976  0.94999176

Investigators are focused on whether the sponsorship was a cover-up for bribes.

""I plan to tell who told the truth and who didn't in my book.""The lead investigator who first raised allegations of a police soft-pedaling in 2013 said she was disappointed by the ruling.""There were clear discrepancies between the preliminary and final reports released by the police, (suggesting there was pressure from the higher-ups),"" said Kwon Eun-hui, who is now an opposition lawmaker, in a press release. ""I don't understand why the justices made such an irresponsible decision.""Conservative groups have accused her of giving a false testimony, a crime that is punishable only by a prison sentence in South Korea.Thursday's verdict marked the third and final time Kim was acquitted of the charges. It was also the first Supreme Court trial related to the election scandal.The then NIS head Won Sei-hoon is currently standing an appellate trial over charges of meddling in politics and the 2012 election. A lower court found him guilty of the former but not of the latter. A high court ruling is due next Saturday.Also awaiting Supreme Court rulings are two former NIS employees who blew the whistle on the existence of the online smear campaign, and a police superintendent who allegedly destroyed evidence related to Kim's case.

Hong Moon-jong will run for the party’s policy committee chair as party floor leader hopeful Rep. Lee Ju-young’s running mate. Rep. Won Yoo-chul will run as Rep Yoo Seong-min’s deputy. The policy committee chairperson serves as the top policy adviser to the floor leader.The Lee-Hong duo is considered to represent the pro-Park faction, while the Yoo-Won partnership is considered to stand for the anti-Park faction. There has been no credible poll previewing the primary, to be held next Monday. Experts say the results will be close.Lee has previously run for the party’s floor leadership. The former judge ran against Rep. Choi Kyung-hwan in 2013, but lost by just more than 5 percent of the votes. But Lee has strengthened his public standing after serving as the maritime minister in President Park’s Cabinet last year. Lee was one of the few Saenuri officials to openly express sorrow for the victims of a ferry accident that had become politicized, something that many of his party officials avoided. Lee gained a reputation as a moderate through his actions, analysts have said, an image that the president may need to raise her public standings, which have fallen to new lows according to recent polls.Lee’s competitor Yoo also presents strong credentials. The former economist appears to be investing his political future on the growing anti-Park public sentiment. The president’s public ratings have been falling according to recent polls by Gallup Korea and Realmeter, to the 30 percent range.The two pollsters conduct weekly polls with sample sizes often ranging from 1,000 to 5,000.

Just three kilometers from the scene, another Park nephew was found hanging from a tree.Wrapping up their investigation into the two cases, police had concluded that one nephew murdered the other before committing suicide by hanging himself due to financial disputes.In his reports, Baek cited a legal dispute between Park Ji-man and his brother-in-law, arguing that Park was also involved in the crime.

Investigators said they have collected enough evidence to believe that the sponsorship may have been a cover-up for bribes.They allege that STX may have paid Jung and his son to award it contracts for the nation's shipbuilding projects.A former Navy commander, Yun Yeon, was also arrested over allegedly collaborating with the father-son duo.

The new measure was announced Tuesday after public outrage escalated over several child abuse cases in preschool facilities. Currently, anyone who completes over 65 credits of courses at a college-affiliated academy can work as a day care teacher. As of this month, more than 86,000 people have been certified, with some 22,000 working in day care. In order to toughen the qualifications, the government will require a set curriculum and a personality test for those who seek to take the national day care exam, the Welfare Ministry said. Childcare workers swear an oath at an anti-abuse training program held in Seoul on Jan. 22. (Yonhap)In the long term, the ministry will push to restrict the exam applications to those who major in child-related studies, officials said. Earlier this month, three female workers were arrested for allegedly hitting children under 5 for not finishing meals or following the class. One of them had even put wet tissues in the mouth of a 22-month-old, police said.In addition to introducing the new state exam, the government will require all child care facilities to install surveillance cameras, the ministry said. Those without cameras will be barred from operations.The surveillance camera requirement had been pushed at the National Assembly in 2010 but failed to pass the welfare committee after some lawmakers expressed concerns over privacy of day care employees.The government will also double the reward for child abuse whistle-blowers to 20 million won ($18,500) to increase detection, officials said. The ministry will also raise the number of assistant teachers at facilities to reduce the workload of day care workers while improving care quality. “About 6,500 assistants will be provided nationwide and all costs will be borne by the state. While it is under discussion, around 200 to 300 billion won is expected to be earmarked for the move,” a ministry official told media. Along with more workers, the ministry will open 450 additional public day care centers by 2017 in order to handle the high need from parents, officials said. All these new regulations will be submitted to the parliament next month, officials added. Meanwhile, the police authorities vowed to strengthen penalties against those who interfered in child abuse investigations. Dispatched investigators have complained over difficulties in conducting inquiries into child abuse cases. There have been no legal punishments against people who refuse to help investigations. A one-year jail term or a fine of up to 5 million won will be levied for obstructing a police investigation into child abuse allegations, authorities said.

Her disapproval rating hit 58.3 percent, a rise of 6.4 percent. The 95 percent confidence level was plus or minus 2 percent.Support ratings for President Park’s governing Saenuri Party stood at 38.6 percent.The announcement follows a Gallup Korea report last week that showed the president’s approval rating at a record low of 30 percent.Realmeter’s survey results also showed that 40.3 percent of respondents “highly disapproved” of the president, marking the first time the figure has exceeded 40 percent.President Park is facing an apparent political crisis according to survey results from the two pollsters this month. Analysts said Park’s refusal to fire her top aides accused of meddling in state affairs in the so-called Chung Yoon-hoi scandal, and the public uproar over increased taxes were the likely causes.Park last Friday named Saenuri Rep. Lee Wan-koo, a reputed compromiser who has supporters even in the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, as her new Prime Minister to apparently raise her public ratings. Park is likely to reshuffle her aides in coming weeks.“Park’s ratings are lower than her party’s. This means she’s not helping her party. It means she’s actually contributing to the party’s unpopularity among voters,” Myongji University professor Chung Jin-min said in a phone interview last week.If Park’s approval ratings continue to fall, her top initiatives such as reforms to the pension for retired civil servants could be stalled in the National Assembly, as lawmakers looking to run in the 2016 parliamentary election try to distance themselves from the unpopular president’s policies.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","public uproar over increased taxes ,gallup korea report last week ,two pollsters this month analysts ,at 34 percent weekly poll ,the unpopular president policies","['Park Geun', 'Park ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'Gallup Korea', 'Park', 'Park ’s', 'Chung Yoon - hoi', 'Saenuri', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Myongji University', 'Chung Jin - min', 'Park', 'the National Assembly', 'Jeong Hunny']",14,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.21641833  0.76649857

Lee himself was discharged from military service after serving only one year, apparently due to an ankle condition.Lee held a press conference the following day to show X-rays of the injury that led to his son’s exemption. On Sunday, Lee also said he was ready to address allegations of misdeeds concerning his and his son’s mandatary military duty.“If needed, I can even publicly have him take an MRI or X-ray. My son told me he is ready to comply with any demands to settle this issue,” he said.Prime minister nominee Lee Wan-koo. (Yonhap)While the accusation is likely to be a major issue in the hearings, observers expressed optimism about Lee’s chances of surviving the hearing since National Assembly members tend to go relatively easy on fellow lawmakers.The reaction from opposition lawmakers to Lee’s nomination has also been fairly benign. Rep. Moon Hee-sang, the leader of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, vowed a thorough grilling of the candidate, but added that Lee’s competence as politician had “already been proven” and that he could play a significant role right away if he was confirmed.The NPAD, however, criticized the ruling party for helping Lee prepare for the hearing, saying the Saenuri should also join efforts to evaluate Lee’s qualifications for the post.Shin Yul, a politics professor at Myeongji University, said that Lee’s nomination may have been an attempt by Park to seek an “easy way out.”Last year, Park’s bid to replace Prime Minister Chung Hong-won ended in failure after her appointments of both Ahn Dae-hee and Moon Chang-keuk fell through. After the nomination debacle, Park decided to retain Chung. “She (Park) would not have wanted another fiasco like Moon and Ahn. Former politicians tend to have it easy in hearings, as they are ‘colleagues’ (of lawmakers),” he said.But appointing an incumbent ruling party lawmaker is problematic, Shin pointed out. Currently both deputy prime ministers for social and economic affairs are Saenuri lawmakers, which means the top three Cabinet positions may be filled by members of the president’s party. “The Saenuri Party already holds a majority in the National Assembly and if they (Saenuri lawmakers) also get hold of administrative positions, checks and balances will be virtually impossible. Birds of a feather flock together,” he said.Early Sunday, Saenuri officially accepted Lee’s resignation as the floor leader and he was briefed by officials of the prime minister’s office. His confirmation hearing is expected to be held early next month.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","after his nomination on friday ,his son exemption on sunday ,local media accused his son ,2011 shortly after his nomination ,out last year park bid","['Lee Wan - koo', 'Park Geun', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Lee', 'National Assembly', 'Lee', 'Moon Hee - sang', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Saenuri', 'Lee', 'Shin Yul', 'Myeongji University', 'Lee', 'Park ’s', 'Chung Hong - won', 'Ahn Dae - hee', 'Moon Chang - keuk', 'Park', 'Chung', 'Moon', 'Shin', 'Saenuri', 'Cabinet', 'the Saenuri Party', 'the National Assembly', 'Saenuri', 'Saenuri', 'Lee', 'Yoon Min - sik']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.56437135  0.3750459

The company was declared bankrupt last month.After wrapping up a month-long investigation, the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office said it has decided to press additional charges against Park, alleging that he borrowed 3.4 trillion won from banks by keeping up this facade from October 2007 to last September. He has yet to pay back 550 billion won to these 10 banks, prosecutors said.Not only did Moneual pretend to export computers, it also jacked up the price of these hypothetical computers by at least 100-fold to between 2-3 million won, prosecutors said.Park also faces charges of over-reporting Moneual's sales and net profit by a combined 2.7 trillion won. Prosecutors believe Moneual initially reported it exports via KT ENS, an affiliate of South Korea's telecom giant KT Corp., but started doing so itself as the loans ballooned.They also believe Park and the two executives bribed export and tax authorities around 2012 to evade scrutiny. Prosecutors allege that the three spent about 860 million won to this end and succeeded at stretching Moneual's insurance and loan limits by tens of millions of won.Prosecutors said Moneual appears to have been able to do this because authorities never checked to see if their statements were true. They called for legal revisions to prevent similar scams.

Lee Wan-koo, 64, entered public service in 1974 and is a three-term lawmaker. The former governor of South Chungcheong Province and current Saenuri Party floor leader has earned a reputation as a compromiser on divisive partisan issues. Lee Wan-koo. (Yonhap)Analysts said Lee’s appointment was part of efforts to redeem Park’s record-low approval ratings, which had fallen mainly due to her image as an uncommunicative leader.Park’s rating was 30 percent on Thursday according to a Gallup Korea poll of 1,001 adults. The poll has a 3.1 percent margin of error and a 95 percent confidence level. The record-low tally is the result of a weekslong nosedive in Park’s ratings, partially caused by her refusal to yield to opposition demands that she rename some of her top aides, and Cabinet members.Public support for Park waned further earlier this week after preliminary calculations of this year’s tax settlements showed taxpayers nationwide could end up paying more taxes, or forfeit much of their rebates. Revisions to tax codes in 2013 by the government were faulted for the increased taxes.Hasty countermeasures by the Saenuri Party and the government to legislate a retroactive tax code by April were denounced as populist and short-term moves by critics.Local political experts, the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy and some members of Park’s Saenuri Party have recommended that Park conduct a radical Cabinet shake-up in order to lift her ratings.Park had partially agreed, saying she would carry out a minor Cabinet shake-up and a partial reorganization of the presidential office, during her New Year’s press conference on Jan. 12.But the announcement of Park’s latest approval rating appeared to have convinced Cheong Wa Dae officials to conduct a limited reshuffle earlier, to calm the growing public disapproval.Senior NPAD officials welcomed Lee’s nomination but said they would strictly review the Saenuri lawmaker’s qualifications at his confirmation hearing in the National Assembly.“Rep. Lee’s competence as a politician is already something everyone knows,” NPAD chair Rep. Moon Hee-sang said after the announcement was made.But Moon urged Lee to “better facilitate communication between lawmakers and the president.”“And you must know when to say no to the president,” Moon added in a meeting with Lee later Friday. Moon was echoing criticism that senior Saenuri Party officials were yes-men too afraid to offer the president honest political advice.One analyst, though, said the latest personnel change would not be enough to stem Park’s falling ratings. “This is a maximum-effort situation. This is a political crisis,” Hanshin University professor Yoon Pyung-joong said regarding Park’s falling ratings.“But the latest decision is a minimum-effort move,” he said. “Presidential Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon remains in office.”Kim was at the center of the NPAD’s reshuffle demands, as he is considered to be the one who should take responsibility for the Chung Yoon-hoi scandal, one of the contributors to Park’s low public ratings.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","presidential office during her new ,three term lawmaker the former ,friday nominated senior governing saenuri ,term lawmaker the former governor ,approval rating prime minister nominee","['Park Geun - hye', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'South Chungcheong Province', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Lee', 'Park ’s', 'Park ’s', 'Gallup Korea', 'Park', 'Cabinet', 'Park', 'the Saenuri Party', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Park ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park', 'Cabinet', 'Cabinet', 'Park ’s', 'NPAD', 'Lee', 'Saenuri', 'the National Assembly', 'Lee', 'npad', 'Moon Hee - sang', 'Moon', 'Lee', 'Moon', 'Lee', 'Moon', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park ’s', 'Hanshin University', 'Yoon Pyung - joong', 'Park ’s', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'NPAD ’s', 'Park', 'Jeong Hunny']",8,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.34799442  0.27019638

The Seoul Central District Court sentenced him to one year and six months in prison, suspended for two years.Put out by the South Korean foreign ministry in December 2010, the press release claimed the company won a project near the southeastern Cameroon town of Yokodouma to mine about 420 million carats of diamonds, or 2.5 times the annual global production at the time, prosecutors said.The news sent CNK shares jumping more than fivefold in the first three weeks, from about 3,000 won apiece to 16,100 won.The mine, however, was later found to hold only 6 percent of the claimed reserves. The project was eventually handed over to a Chinese company.In the same ruling, the court also acquitted another key defendant in the case -- Kim Eun-seok, the former Energy and Resources ambassador at the foreign ministry -- of charges that he colluded with Oh in the scheme. Kim was alleged to have played a role in getting the foreign ministry to issue the press release on the diamond project.Prosecutors initially sought prison terms of 10 and five years against Oh and Kim, respectively.

Lee Wan-koo as the new prime minister on Friday in a surprising decision seen as an attempt to lift her falling public support.(Yonhap)Cheong Wa Dae also announced lists of three new senior presidential secretaries and four new special advisors as part of Park’s reorganization plan. The president, however, decided to retain Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon for the time being, despite persistent demands from political parties to sack him for allegedly exercising too much power in state affairs and personnel choices.Rep. Lee will replace Chung Hong-won after parliamentary approval is granted. South Korea’s prime minister is the nation’s second-highest post, but serves a ceremonial role as power is heavily concentrated in the president. Chung, the first prime minister of the Park administration, retained his post after two of Park’s choices to replace him withdrew their nominations over ethical breaches.“President Park Geun-hye accepted Chung’s resignation as he offered to resign several times and nominated Rep. Lee as the new prime minister,” said Yoon Doo-hyun, senior presidential secretary for the press.“The nominee has a deep understanding of the president’s philosophy in running state affairs and has contributed to normalizing the operation of the National Assembly by (leading) smooth cooperation with the opposition party,” Yoon said.In an acceptance speech, Rep. Lee vowed to devote himself to the people and steer the government’s drive to bring about economic reform, and to enhance communication with the main opposition parties.“If I become prime minister after obtaining parliamentary approval, I will devote myself to reviving the economy,” Rep. Lee said.The politician, who served as governor of South Chungcheong province, said he was offered the post late Thursday evening and accepted the nomination in the morning.“After much thought, I accepted to the nomination to support President Park, and also for the country and the people,” he said, adding that he would become a prime minister who could speak frankly to the president about state affairs.Park also named Woo Byung-woo as new senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, and Cho Shin, a Yonsei University professor, as new senior presidential secretary for future strategies. Hyun Jung-taik, the former head of the state-run Korea Development Institute, was tapped as new senior presidential secretary for policy coordination.The president also named four experts as special advisors assigned to give her direct advice on state affairs.Shin Sung-ho, former deputy managing editor at the JoongAng Ilbo, was appointed as new presidential advisor for public relations; Lee Myung-jae, former prosecutor-general, as new advisor for civil affairs; Kim Sung-woo, a director at Seoul Broadcasting System, as new advisor for social and cultural affairs; and Lim Jong-in, a Korea University professor considered one of the leading experts on cyberterror, as her special security advisor.Cheong Wa Dae said that the office would announce more special advisors later including one for political affairs, and the nominee for the Maritime Minister post, which has been vacant since last year.The president decided to retain Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon though he has been pressured to step down since last year by the opposition parties, who held him responsible for a series of incidents including a Blue House document leak and the so-called “Chung Yoon-hoi scandal.” Park also kept three secretaries, known as “doorknobs to the president,” who have been accused of holding secret meetings with Chung Yoon-hoi, an aide to Park years ago, and exchanging confidential information with him. The prosecution earlier this month concluded that media reports about the scandal were groundless and the document suggesting Chung’s involvement was fabricated.Earlier this week, Park said she would carry out a “small-scale” Cabinet reshuffle and partially reorganize the presidential office as she seeks to regain public confidence to push ahead with her economic reform drive. According to a local pollster, her job rating plunged to 30 percent this week, the lowest level since she entered office in early 2013.Earlier, many expected that Park would retain Prime Minister Chung and replace Kim Ki-choon instead. But Park’s surprising decision appears to have been made due to a fierce public backlash over the government’s new tax settlement scheme.The Park government has come under fire as some people with an annual income of less than 55 million won ($50,700) will have to pay additional taxes this year due to a new tax scheme.In an emergency meeting, the government and the ruling party have agreed to expand tax credits to appease the angry public.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","three new senior presidential secretaries ,new prime minister on friday ,president also named four experts ,park reorganization plan the president ,new presidential advisor for public","['Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party ’s', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Dae', 'Park ’s', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'Lee', 'Chung Hong - won', 'South Korea ’s', 'Chung', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Chung ’s', 'Lee', 'Yoon Doo - hyun', 'the National Assembly', 'Yoon', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'South Chungcheong', 'Park', 'Woo Byung - woo', 'Cho Shin', 'Yonsei University', 'Hyun Jung - taik', 'Korea Development Institute', 'Shin Sung - ho', 'the JoongAng Ilbo', 'Lee Myung - jae', 'Kim Sung - woo', 'Seoul Broadcasting System', 'Lim Jong - in', 'Korea University', 'Dae', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'Blue House', 'Chung Yoon - hoi', 'Chung ’s', 'Park', 'Chung', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'Park', 'Cho Chung - un']",8,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.59065139  0.82643688

It said that the existence of the “Revolutionary Organization,” said to be the group that discussed the revolt, was based “merely on speculation,” and that there was no agreement among RO members to actually carry out the revolt.The ruling came a little over a month after the Constitutional Court handed down an unprecedented ruling to disband the UPP on the grounds that the aim of the party was to ultimately realize “North Korean-style socialism” and ran counter to the basic democratic order of South Korean society.“The defendants called for implementing concrete activities including destroying national infrastructure as forces in charge of revolution in the South while anticipating that a war would break out. Thus, this confirms their guilt of encouraging a revolt,” said the court in its ruling.“But to constitute the crime of plotting a rebellion, the agreement on the targets of the rebellion and the actual danger should be recognized. But the evidence is insufficient to recognize that the defendants conspired to subvert the government or prepare for (a revolt).” Lee Seok-ki, a former lawmaker of the Unified Progressive Party, enters the Supreme Court room to attend his verdict hearing in Seocho-dong, Seoul, Thursday. (Yonhap)The court added that should the crime of plotting a revolt be constituted when there are only simple exchanges of views on a revolt, this could undermine people’s basic rights and freedom of thought and expression.After his sentence was meted out, Lee, grim-faced and wearing a black suit, shouted towards his supporters in the courtroom, “Criminal justice has died!”The court also upheld the lower court’s ruling to sentence six other former UPP members to jail terms ranging from three to five years on the same charges. The ruling came a day after the Justice Ministry vowed to establish legal grounds to forcibly disband “antistate” entities.The main gate of the top court in southern Seoul was surrounded by police officers trying to calm down scores of members from both progressive and conservative civic groups, which underscored the country’s intense ideological division over the issue.Left-leaning activists called for the release of Lee and other detainees, accusing the conservative government of politically branding them as “pro-North Korea,” while others demanded tough punishments for those supporting the communist regime in Pyongyang.Lee was arrested in November 2013 on a set of charges including plotting an armed revolt by leading the RO. Lee has continued to deny the charges, claiming the judicial process against him was “politically motivated” to suppress liberals.The rebellion scandal broke out in August 2013 after agents from the National Intelligence Service raided the homes and offices of Lee and nine other UPP members on suspicion of plotting to subvert the government during RO gatherings that year. Last February, a district court sentenced Lee to 12 years in jail, convicting him of conspiring to overthrow the government, encouraging a revolt and violating the National Security Law. The six other members of the RO were also convicted, receiving jail terms ranging from four to seven years.Six months later, the appeals court reduced Lee’s jail term to nine years, acquitting him of plotting a revolt. The court said that the claim regarding the existence of the RO ― which allegedly conceived of staging a revolt ― was based only on an informant’s speculation.During court proceedings, prosecutors have revealed the transcripts of the two gatherings in May and December 2013, at which RO members allegedly talked of “revolution” and a plan to destroy social infrastructure. Lee’s side has argued that the transcripts were tampered with and cannot be adopted as court evidence.

As public outrage escalated over the case, the police have launched an intensive anti-child-abuse campaign.While the day care worker admitted that she had hit the children since October last year, she claimed that her actions were aimed at improving their learning, the Incheon police said. Investigators have uncovered more than 60 cases of child abuse from surveillance camera footage over the past 30 days.

Lee was sentenced to eight months in prison, with two years suspended, in November 2013 for abusing the drug at least 320 times over six years. The Seoul Central District Court ordered Lee to pay 100 million won ($92,000) to her former advertiser Tong Yang Group, which filed for financial compensation from the actress and her management agency in January 2013. DongYang Group claimed that the drug controversy tarnished the actress’ image, making her unable to properly fulfill the contract. The company signed a one-year contract with Lee in 2012, offering her a modeling fee of 450 million won for a commercial for its fashion brand. The contract specifically indicates that the model must not create controversy, commit any wrongdoings or taint the image of the brand.“The probe into Lee’s drug abuse case made it socially unacceptable for her to continue to appear in a TV ad,” the court said in a ruling. “Thus, the defendant has the obligation to compensate for the damage.” The 46-year-old actress promoted the brand on cable TV channels 14 times from February to December 2012 until she was accused of receiving propofol injections at various hospitals for nonmedical purposes in January 2013. Fellow actresses Park Si-yeon and Jang Mi-inae were also sentenced to eight months in jail, with two years suspended, for the same charge. Propofol, an anesthetic commonly used during plastic surgery, is known to cause hallucinations and could lead to death when overdosed. The drug was blamed for the death of American pop legend Michael Jackson in 2009. Lee debuted in 1993 with a drama “Our Paradise” after nabbing third place in the Miss Korea beauty pageant. She enjoyed immense popularity with highly rated dramas “First Love” and “Love Is in Your Embrace” in early 1990s.

But another report by the National Human Rights Commission showed that 41.3 percent of multicultural children do not have a Korean friend, indicating that ethnic Koreans show little tolerance for migrant familiesThe government will introduce an online education system that will help ethnic Koreans better understand their neighbors from different ethnic groups. Officials will finalize the education content by August and will kick off pilot programs in September.As regards education reforms, the Education Ministry reiterating its intention to expand the “free semester” ― a no-test semester that provides job-related experience for first-year middle school students ― to 70 percent of all middle schools, up from 25 percent in 2014. The ministry will also push for enacting a bill that will mandate government and state-run bodies to provide programs for students. A pan-government committee on creating such programs will be established, and a separate bureau-level team dealing exclusively with policy will be created within the ministry.But the briefing left out any mention of the free high school education policy, one of President Park’s election pledges.“Free high school education has been put off for this year, and will be discussed next year. But the policy is not being discarded, just postponed” said Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea.

The Korea Communications Commission said in a statement that the decision came at its regular meeting.  The referral for an investigation against Uber Korea claims that its location-tracking function is not registered with the authorities. A violator can be punished with a penalty of up to 30 million won ($24,647) or a 3-year imprisonment, according to local law.""As we've reached a consensus that (the company) has breached the law, it is an appropriate measure to refer the matter to the prosecution,"" KCC Chairman Choi Sung-joon said at the meeting. The ride-booking app offers a taxi or private car upon online requests from users via its smartphone application. Once a user makes a ride request, he or she can track the location of the reserved vehicle shown on the app. The KCC's decision came months after the Seoul Metropolitan Government said it was seeking to refer the company to the KCC with intent to suspend the app. Choi said that the company will not be exonerated for flouting the law even after Uber becomes registered through proper procedures. ""Whether to approve the registration will be decided based on a thorough review,"" he added.As is the case in other cities overseas, Uber Korea has been involved in a slew of legal issues here along with a strong backlash from taxi drivers since it first launched the service in Seoul in 2013. The latest came in December last year when the prosecutors in Seoul indicted Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick and the head of the Korean unit for violation of a rule that states all vehicles for business purposes must be licensed. The Seoul city government began offering a million won ($921) reward this month to those who report private or rented cars that operate using Uber, in line with the official request from South Korea's transport ministry last year for a crackdown on Uber drivers and users. The scrutiny has led Uber to compromise by adjusting its business model. Earlier in the week, the company said it partnered up with a local cab company based in Incheon, the third-largest city in Korea, to connect users to a licensed taxi as an effort of compliance to local regulations. Uber had resisted such criticism and called for readjustment in legal discrepancy, saying that operating a cab service through a mobile app is not illegal according to local law. Founded in 2010, the San Francisco, California-based venture startup currently operates in over 200 cities around the world. In Korea, the company first kicked off with its premium limousine service UberBlack and expanded to the private ride-booking business UberX and UberTaxi.

The latest uproar darkens the political future of Park and the Saenuri Party, analysts said.To address the discontent, the government on Wednesday held an emergency meeting with senior members of the Saenuri Party. They agreed to revise related tax laws by April in the National Assembly. The ruling party said it would discuss with the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy to push for legislation to retroactively apply the changes.The revisions will aim to increase tax deductions to households with two or more children, in a country whose birth rates have dipped to 1.19 as of 2013, according to Statistics Korea, a government-run body.The upcoming changes to tax codes will also increase deductions on pension-related taxes and taxes on unmarried, single-person households, the party said after the meeting.The move came a day after the presidential office and finance minister Choi Kyung-hwan tried to defuse fears about the tax increase. At a hastily arranged news conference on Tuesday, Choi apologized for causing concern but said that the new tax scheme is aimed at improving distribution of wealth. President Park also ordered officials to give proper explanations about the tax issue.The government-party agreement on Wednesday appears to have been reached amid fears that the tax scheme could further aggravate public sentiment.The recent tax increases follow an unpopular tax hike on tobacco products this year. The Korea Taxpayers’ Association, an activist group concerned with public finance, is currently leading a national signature campaign against the tax increases levied on this year’s settlements.“It is safe to say that this is the beginning of the end for the Park administration,” Yonsei University professor of Korean politics Yang Seung-ham said. “Park’s falling approval ratings appear to be difficult to stem. I won’t be surprised if the governing party loses in the 2016 general elections.”Chung-Ang University Korean politics professor Choi Young-jin agreed.“Everyone (in the Saenuri Party) knows this means trouble,” he said.“Taxpayers in their 40s and 50s will be affected the most. They might vote the other way in 2016, meaning that this is an opportunity for the opposition parties.”Park’s approval ratings had already fallen to the 30 percent range, apparently due to the public’s frustration at her refusal to fire her top aides linked to the so-called Chung Yoon-hoi scandal, in which the aides were accused of having meddled in state affairs.Park’s approval rating was 39.4 percent in a recent survey by Real Meter, a local pollster. The survey of 2,500 adults nationwide from Jan. 12 to 16 had a 2 percent margin of error and a 95 percent confidence level.Gallup Korea measured Park’s approval ratings at 40 percent in the last quarter of 2014. The polling company takes weekly tallies of the president’s ratings, usually surveying about 1,000 adults, with a 3 percent margin of error and 95 percent confidence level.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","tax increases follow an unpopular ,tax filing escalated on wednesday ,the calculations sparked public backlash ,discontent the government on wednesday ,follow an unpopular tax hike","['Park Geun - hye', 'the Korea Taxpayers ’ Association', 'Park', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park', 'the Saenuri Party', 'the Saenuri Party', 'the National Assembly', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Statistics Korea', 'Choi Kyung - hwan', 'Choi', 'Park', 'the Korea Taxpayers ’ Association', 'Yonsei University', 'korean', 'Yang Seung - ham', 'korean', 'Choi Young - jin', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Chung Yoon - hoi', 'Park ’s', 'Real Meter', 'Gallup Korea', 'Park ’s', 'Jeong Hunny']",0,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.22339556  0.21664283

The Jan. 7 ruling marked the first time that a local court has convicted a man for spousal rape that does not involve the use of a deadly weapon.The man married his wife, who is 20 years his junior, in 2012 through an international marriage agency. He was convicted of raping her about 10 times during the first two months of their marriage, as well as physically abusing her. His wife managed to escape from the house and file a complaint against him to the police with the support of a women’s rights group.“The plaintiff didn’t know anyone in South Korea other than her husband, who was physically abusive,” the court said. “We acknowledge that it would’ve been very difficult for her to actively resist her husband.” The man received a sentence of five years in prison after the first trial by the Jeju District Court last year, which he appealed to the Gwangju High Court. During the appeal process, the plaintiff settled with him for an undisclosed sum. On Jan. 7, he received a conditional suspended sentence of four years. “Many men still think rape can’t occur within marriage,” said a women’s rights activist who did not want to be named. “We hope more women who are suffering from domestic violence can come forward and seek justice after this ruling.”In 2009, a Busan district court acknowledged for the first time in South Korean history that marital rape was a crime.The convicted man, who was 42, had been sentenced to a suspended 30-month prison term, but was found hanged at his home in Busan four days later in an apparent suicide.

Rep. Park Hong-keun of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy on Tuesday accused a state-run agency of failing to collect royalties that could amount to billions of won. The Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation, in charge of preparing questions for the exam, known here as Suneung, has never exercised its copyrights over the exam questions, Park said.The state-run body customarily posts the test questions on its home page after the exam, and allows anyone to use them as long as it is not for profit. But workbooks containing the questions have hit the market every year. The annual sales of the workbooks is estimated to be about 10 billion won ($9.2 million), according to Park, and are sold publicly in bookstores across the country.Korean law states that copyright violators can face up to five years in prison, or a 50 million won fine. The KICE, however, claimed that Suneung questions were considered “public goods” to which exclusive copyrights did not apply. “The cost for preparing Suneung questions comes from taxes and admission fees by test-takers. By forfeiting the royalty fees, the KICE gave up on a revenue source to ease that financial burden,” said Rep. Park. “We have to figure out if this is due to incompetence of the education authorities, or if there is some sort of ‘connection’ between them and the publishers that profited from selling the workbooks.”In 2014, it cost 6.4 billion won to prepare the questions for the state-commissioned Suneung.Later in the day, the KICE denied allegations of illegal collaboration with local publishers and claimed the reason they did not collect royalty fees was to ensure that students would not shoulder extra financial burden. A KICE official said publishers are likely to charge more to students if it started charging the publishers for the questions.He said the agency will work the the Education Ministry to find best possible approach to copyright. This includes possibly changing the policy to collect royalty fees, although he added that the agency was looking at all options.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","opposition lawmaker tuesday accused state ,annual college entrance exam rep ,an opposition lawmaker tuesday ,an opposition lawmaker tuesday accused ,lawmaker tuesday accused state run","['Park Hong', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'the Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation', 'Suneung', 'Park', 'Park', 'korean', 'KICE', 'Suneung', 'Suneung', 'KICE', 'Park', 'KICE', 'KICE', 'the Education Ministry', 'Yoon Min - sik']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23297463  0.09878435

Before the revision, many wage earners were able to get tax refunds that were commonly referred to as a bonus or extra wage. ""We will actively study policies to relieve the tax burden, raise tax equity and restore the corporate tax rate to normal levels,"" Rep. Woo Yoon-keun, the floor leader of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, said during a party meeting. South Korea's corporate tax rate on taxable income exceeding 20 billion won was lowered from 25 percent to 22 percent during the previous Lee Myung-bak administration.""The warehouses of conglomerates are overflowing, while the glass wallets of ordinary citizens are being emptied,"" he said.""Glass wallet"" is a term used to describe the ""transparent"" income of ordinary wage earners.Woo accused President Park Geun-hye's conservative administration of favoring large businesses at the expense of average wage earners, citing data that the corporate reserves of conglomerates amounted to 552 trillion won last year, double the amount five years earlier.The opposition party will study ways to revise the law to raise the tax credit rate from 15 percent to 20 percent during next month's extra parliamentary session, he added.The ruling Saenuri Party expressed frustration as the government's efforts to defuse the controversy only invited stronger criticism.In a hastily arranged press conference earlier in the day, Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan said the extra money collected, mainly from high-income earners, would be used to finance two government programs aimed at helping low-income self-employed workers and encouraging people to have more children. He also said the government will consider adjusting tax deduction categories to give more benefits to families with children and help people prepare for retirement.""The government shouldn't be bent on temporarily stitching up the problem but think carefully about how to address the public's mistrust in the fairness of the tax system and come up with a solution as soon as possible,"" Kim Young-woo, the ruling party's senior spokesman, said in a press briefing. ""The Saenuri Party will do its best to find a more reasonable way that strikes a balance between welfare and the tax burden.""President Park Geun-hye also addressed the controversy.""It's important that (the public) thoroughly understand (the issue),"" she told Choi ahead of a Cabinet meeting at the presidential office earlier in the day.

During its New Year’s policy briefing to President Park Geun-hye, Defense Minister Han Min-koo said the ministry would push to incorporate into military operations innovative technologies such as ICT, big data solutions and the Internet of Things, under the “Creative Defense” vision.Capitalizing on the country’s technological savviness, the ministry will step up efforts to develop future weapons systems such as combat equipment using laser beams and electromagnetic waves, and unmanned platforms, he said.“In consideration of the limited defense resources and various security threats, we will push to come up with more creative, innovative ways to manage our military, going beyond the old approach that was mainly about catching up with others rather than moving ahead of them,” Han told reporters after the policy briefing at Cheong Wa Dae.“Creative defense means creating new defense values through a significant change that will be brought about by infusing humans’ creative thinking and cutting-edge technologies into all aspects of defense-related tasks.”Touching on the criticism that the initiative seems to be something carved out of a sci-fi novel, Han noted that the vision, devised to support President Park’s “creative economy” vision, was a mid- or long-term one that would require much time and effort. “We can’t say, for now, by when we can fulfill that vision in terms of developing the type of future weapons employing state-of-the-art technologies. But this is the policy direction we are pushing for,” he said.The ministry plans to focus on developing what it terms “reverse asymmetric weapon systems” ― which North Korea cannot develop due to its technological limitations ― to neutralize Pyongyang’s nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction.Among the weapons under development are high-power microwave (HPM) weapons and electromagnetic pulse (EMP) bombs, which are expected to be developed by the early 2020s. The ministry is also considering the development of laser-based weapons.HPM, known as an “E-bomb,” can spew out massive electromagnetic power to damage all electronic devices within around 300 meters, experts say. EMP also unleashes a high-intensity burst of electromagnetic energy that causes severe current and voltage surges to damage adjacent electronic devices. South Korea’s state-run Agency for Defense Development has been researching and developing the EMP weapons systems. These weapons that are designed to disrupt operations of electronic devices and paralyze social infrastructures are called “soft-kill” weapons, compared with “hard-kill” weapons such as missiles that directly strike enemy targets. The ministry said it would build the soft-kill capabilities through close technological cooperation with the civilian sector.Under the creative defense drive, the ministry also envisions a future “smart soldier system” equipped with a host of digital devices such as a high-tech communications tool, a night-vision combat-control helmet and an Internet-linked battle suit.It is also considering paying more attention to developing unmanned battle systems including robots for combat deployment, surveillance tools and unmanned boats that would ensure fewer human losses and greater operational efficiency.Despite the combat advantages that the ministry anticipates from the new vision, critics argue that there should be plans to finance it, and that the vision lacks details on how to realize its objectives.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","monday unveiled new defense vision ,on monday unveiled new defense ,monday unveiled new defense ,ministry on monday unveiled new ,defense ministry on monday unveiled","['South Korea ’s', 'Defense Ministry', 'north korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Defense', 'Han Min - koo', 'ICT', 'Han', 'Han', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'EMP', 'EMP', 'South Korea ’s', 'Agency for Defense Development', 'EMP', 'Song Sang - ho']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49650043  0.73685133

To bring about a fundamental change, we need to hire fully qualified individuals at our day care centers. And for that, we need quality jobs with good working conditions.”According to the National Human Rights Commission of Korea, day care workers earned an average of 1.12 million won ($1,030) a month in 2013, while working as much as 10 hours a day. Among the 1,634 workers surveyed by NHRCK, 60 percent said they did not get lunch breaks, while 40.6 percent said they were stressed because of the workload. Under the current system organized by the Welfare Ministry, a single worker may be asked to care for as many as 20 children aged 4 or older.“Educated and qualified workers don’t want to be overworked or underpaid,” said Yoon. “You can’t expect day care workers to do a good job without paying them enough.”Nationwide concern about child abuse by child care workers has erupted after a 33-year-old worker at an Incheon day cancer center was caught on CCTV footage beating a 4-year-old for not finishing her meal. A subsequent investigation found further abuses by the worker and a court issued an arrest warrant for her on Saturday. Following the controversial case, Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency said it had booked three teachers at an English-language kindergarten in Bucheon on suspicion of mistreating children. Meanwhile, in Goseong, South Gyeongsang Province, the police discovered through CCTV footage that a child had been forced by day care staff to eat food that had fallen on the floor. Hong Seong-bo from the child care division of the Seoul Metropolitan Government said having CCTV cameras installed was better than having no surveillance system at all. According to Hong, about 70 percent of day care centers run by the government in Seoul currently have cameras installed. “The cameras still give them a sense that they are being watched by someone else,” he told The Korea Herald. “It motivates the workers to be more careful with children.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","kindergarten in bucheon on suspicion ,recently announced countermeasure installing surveillance ,at an incheon day cancer ,the police discovered through cctv ,child abuse cases at day","['Yoon Deok - gyeong', 'the Korean Women ’s Development Institute', 'the National Human Rights Commission', 'Korea', 'NHRCK', 'the Welfare Ministry', 'Yoon', 'Incheon', 'CCTV', 'Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency', 'Bucheon', 'Goseong , South Gyeongsang Province', 'CCTV', 'Hong Seong - bo', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'CCTV', 'Hong', 'Seoul', 'the Korea Herald', 'Claire Lee']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.05259247  0.32495913

The usurer has been standing trial on separate charges for the past two and a half years.""Because some of Choi's relatives have been involved, we thought if Choi was questioned without detention, there is a chance he might ask them to change their testimony to his favor,"" a prosecution official said in explaining the absence of a warrant.""We also took into account that he appeared psychologically unstable.""Choi had been probed since last April, and was most recently questioned a day earlier.He reportedly told prosecutors that he had only borrowed 300 million won from a different businessman and that he had paid it off in six months.But prosecutors said the money appeared to have been from the loan shark who is standing trial and whom Choi met when he was a prosecutor in 2008. Choi was in charge of the man's drug-related case, and the two realized they were from the same hometown.This marks the first time in eight years that a sitting judge has been investigated over bribery allegations. The last time was in 2006, when a Seoul High Court judge faced similar charges.Prosecutors said they plan to request a formal arrest warrant for the judge before the emergency arrest period expires after two days. They also said they are considering filing criminal charges against three prosecution officials who allegedly took tens of millions of won in bribes from the same businessman.Following the emergency arrest, the Supreme Court said it will take ""strong and stern action"" against the judge, holding him accountable for his alleged wrongdoing.But the top court said it will carefully consider whether to accept his resignation, which would make it impossible to take disciplinary measures against Choi, who earlier offered to step down.

The accused worker has admitted to the accusations, and police are planning to take her into custody after conducting further investigation into surveillance footage at the center.Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency said it has booked three teachers at an English kindergarten in Bucheon, between Seoul and Incheon, on suspicion of mistreating children and the manager for allegedly overlooking the abuse. The parents of children at the kindergarten had filed complaints against them to local police in November, claiming the teachers took the students to dark rooms to beat them.This still image from CCTV footage of a day care center in Bugae-dong, Incheon, shows a 25-year-old female worker punching a preschooler. (Yonhap)Officials said the suspected abusers have admitted to using disciplinary measures, but denied using violence.“The CCTV images show the teachers taking the children to a blind spot of the cameras, but it is not enough to say with certainty that there has been violence,” an official said. But as the surveillance images do show the children being punished, police are planning to recommend to the prosecutors that they indict the accused.A parent of a 3-year-old in Anyang, Gyeonggi Province, also filed complaints to the police that her son may have been mistreated at a day care center, after she found bruises on his buttocks. Nationwide concern about child abuse by child care workers has erupted since a 33-year-old worker at an Incheon day care center was seen on CCTV footage slapping and punching a child for not finishing her meal. A subsequent investigation found further abuses by the worker ― including making death threats to another child ― and a court issued an arrest warrant for her on Saturday.The case prompted the government to toughen punishments for child abuse by child care workers. Both the ruling Saenuri Party and the Welfare Ministry have released plans to implement measures to increase child protection at day care centers, including requiring surveillance cameras and strengthening the required qualifications for staff.The authorities will also implement a “one strike” system, in which a day care center would be shut down after a single case of child abuse is found. The perpetrator and the head of the facility would also be permanently banned from working in similar jobs. Even child care workers themselves said the government needs to implement stricter standards for day care workers.Hwangbo Eun-hee, who studies early childhood education at Sookmyung University, carried out a survey on workers in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province, 87 percent said they thought the current vetting system needs improvement. The respondents also generally welcomed the idea of conducting a personality evaluation and aptitude tests when certifying child care workers, giving the idea an average of 4.19 points out of 5.Last week, Rep. Shin Hak-yong of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy proposed a bill mandating character education in the training course for child care workers at colleges. “There has been nationwide concern over the qualifications of child care workers. We (lawmakers) need to ensure such concerns are addressed and the qualified workers are not penalized in any way,” said Shin. “The bill will contribute to find effective countermeasures (against child abuse by child care workers).”By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","incheon abused several preschool children ,worker punching preschooler yonhap officials ,flooded local police offices officials ,the children being punished police ,incheon abused several preschool","['Incheon', 'Incheon ’s Samsan Police Station', 'Bugae', 'Incheon', 'Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency', 'Bucheon', 'Seoul', 'Incheon', 'CCTV', 'Bugae', 'Incheon', 'CCTV', 'Anyang', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Incheon', 'CCTV', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Welfare Ministry', 'Hwangbo Eun - hee', 'Sookmyung University', 'Seoul', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Shin Hak - yong', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Shin', 'Yoon Min - sik']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40667075  0.2169836

(Yonhap)Following a controversial child abuse case involving a day care worker in Incheon, the ruling Saenuri Party and the government announced a joint plan to protect children’s rights on Friday.The 33-year-old worker, surnamed Yang, was taken into police custody on Thursday after surveillance video footage was revealed of her harshly beating a 4-year-old for not finishing her food.“This case is the most shocking incident since the Sewol disaster,” said ruling party leader Kim Moo-sung. “We have to protect children’s safety in order to tackle the country’s low fertility rate as well.”Together with the Saenuri Party, the Welfare Ministry plans to implement measures to combat child abuse at day care centers, such as making surveillance camera installation mandatory for all children’s institutions, as well as strengthening qualifications for staff. Any day care center would be immediately shut down should it be caught engaging in abuse, the ministry said. Care providers who have been reported or punished for child abuse will be suspended from their profession for 10 years. “We will try to implement these measures as soon as possible,” an official from the ministry said. The police on Friday requested an arrest warrant for Yang on charges of child abuse. Investigators said they would also summon the day care center’s president for questioning. Parents of four other children also reported Yang’s abuses. The Welfare Ministry on Thursday revoked the licenses of the institution, Yang and its head. While Yang admitted she had hit the child, as shown in the video, she denied the rest of the charges. She reportedly told the police that she “loves children very much,” and this was the only time she had struck a child.Under the current child welfare act, Yang could be sentenced to a maximum of five years in jail or fined up to 30 million won ($27,800). “The head of the center can also be punished if it is found that she was aware of Yang’s abusive behavior and did not take any actions,” said an official from the Welfare Ministry.The government plans to turn the center into a public day care institution, although most of the parents have already decided to send their children elsewhere.The Welfare Ministry has also been publicly criticized over the case as the center in Incheon earned 95.3 out of 100 points when assessed by the government.“I understand this specific case has escalated anxiety among working parents, and as someone who is responsible for the country’s welfare programs I am sorry that this happened,” said Welfare Minister Moon Hyung-pyo on Friday. “The government will do its best to make sure something like this never happens again.”In the video footage, Yang tells the child to finish the kimchi she left on her food tray. When the girl spits it out, Yang slaps her in the face, causing her to fall on her back. Other children are seen to be kneeling fearfully on the floor together.According to government data, a total of 6,796 child abuse cases were reported last year. Among them, about 10 percent of all abusers turned out to be day care workers and staff at children’s institutions, while 80 percent were parents.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","friday yonhap following controversial child ,yonhap following controversial child abuse ,said the police on friday ,her harshly beating year old ,child abuse cases at seoul","['Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency', 'Incheon', 'Saenuri Party', 'Yang', 'Sewol', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'the Saenuri Party', 'the Welfare Ministry', 'Yang', 'Yang', 'the Welfare Ministry', 'Yang', 'Yang', 'Yang', 'Yang', 'the Welfare Ministry', 'the Welfare Ministry', 'Incheon', 'Moon Hyung - pyo', 'Yang', 'Yang', 'Claire Lee']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39694634  0.32438681

Kim Sang-hun, 47, was arrested Tuesday for killing his wife’s ex-husband and his stepdaughter while holding the four hostage in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province. Kim demanded that his wife come to see him during the five-hour standoff. The suspect committed the crime because he suspected that his estranged wife had rekindled her relationship with her ex-husband, the police said. Four days before the hostage crisis, Kim’s wife had asked the police to arrest Kim, claiming that her husband had stabbed her in the thigh with a knife the day before, investigators said.Under the current antidomestic violence measures, the police are allowed to separate an offender from family members in an emergency. The counseling police officer, however, had rejected her demand, saying that it was impossible to nab Kim since he was not caught at the crime scene. Instead, the police officer had advised her to file a suit, the investigators added. Receiving no urgent support, the wife had taken refuge at a motel with her children, and then moved to her ex-husband’s house, where the tragedy occurred, they added. The police said they had launched an internal probe into whether the concerned police station had overlooked the wife’s request for help. They also vowed to consider revamping the counseling system to better deal with emergency situations. Meanwhile, Kim confessed that he had sexually harassed his 16-year-old stepdaughter before stabbing her to death, the police said. The investigators also uncovered that he had committed a lewd act in front of the victim, and then attempted to rape her.While the attacker admitted having taken them hostage, he blamed others for the deaths of the victims. “This is unfair. I’m also a victim of this case,” he told the media before being taken into custody on Thursday. “The authorities are trying to silence me. My wife ignored her daughters’ request to be rescued,” he added. The biological father and his daughter were killed before the police were dispatched to the scene, the authorities said. The other two female hostages were rescued unharmed.

The show was suspended after December's presidential election.

The move was seen as Cheong Wa Dae’s attempt to settle the dust first, as it came without conducting an internal inquiry into the case. Saenuri Party leader Kim Moo-sung. (Yonhap)The presidential office is also likely to speed up the reshuffle of secretaries to clear the air for Park’s reform drive, tighten discipline in the office and mend ties with the party.Lee Jun-seok, a party member, claimed that he heard Eum accusing the Saenuri chief of being behind the scandal, at a dinner the two attended last month. Lee said he relayed the remark to the party chief last week. The case, however, brewed a political storm after a photograph showed Rep. Kim’s written memo, which read “K and Y are behind the ‘document gate.’” “K” is said to stand for the ruling party leader and “Y” for Saenuri Rep. Yoo Seong-min.The ruling party, for its part, also avoided commenting on the issue during a supreme council meeting in the morning, in contrast to their fierce arguments that surprised the public the day before. On Wednesday, Lee Jae-oh, a well-known Park opponent, clashed with Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, former senior press secretary, raising speculations that it was a reflection of the party’s overarching factional feud. Pro-Park lawmakers including Lee Jung-hyun were absent from the meeting, claiming they had other important matters to attend to. The Saenuri chief also refused to respond to reporters’ questions, a contrast to his gruff reaction to the allegation, calling it “nonsense,” the day before.Despite the efforts, the scandal is widely expected to further damage the strained ties between the party and Cheong Wa Dae, namely Kim and Park. According to sources, the party sees the case as an attempt by presidential staff to bring down the Saenuri chairman, who has had a love-hate relationship, with Park for years. Park and Kim reportedly have been at odds, although they tried to sweep their strained relations under the carpet.Kim’s comment on constitutional revision late last year, in particular, roiled Park as it came only some days after she urged politicians not to discuss it, stressing that the issue would swallow urgent economic issues. Some observers also raised concerns that the Cheong Wa Dae-Saenuri relationship would further deteriorate as Eum and Lee Jun-seok started to engage in a fierce battle, returning the public focus to the scandal.The scandal began to surface last November after presidential papers that investigated Chung Yoon-hoi, Park’s former secretary, were leaked to a local daily. The papers alleged that Chung had meddled in government affairs and personnel decisions using his close ties to incumbent Cheong Wa Dae officials. Eum is one of the presidential officials embroiled in the scandal. Eum claimed that Lee fabricated his remarks, and said he is carefully considering disclosing KakaoTalk messages that he exchanged with Lee.Lee said in a radio interview that he relayed Eum’s remark to Kim Moo-sung in an effort to make things right. He said he was worried that Eum’s remark could slander the reputation of the party chief. However, questions remain on how Lee would stick to his claim as others who attended the dinner at that time said they never heard Eum accusing Rep. Kim of being behind the scandal.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","set off recent political scandal ,off recent political scandal ,recent political scandal involving rival ,recent political scandal ,off recent political scandal involving","['Cheong', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Eum Jong - hwan', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Lee Jun - seok', 'Saenuri', 'Lee', 'Kim ’s', 'Saenuri', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Lee Jae - oh', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'pro - park', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'Saenuri', 'Kim', 'Park', 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Park', 'Eum', 'Lee Jun - seok', 'Chung Yoon - hoi', 'Park ’s', 'Chung', 'Cheong', 'Dae', 'Lee', 'KakaoTalk', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Eum ’s', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'Eum ’s', 'Lee', 'Kim', 'Cho Chung - un']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.7539978   0.50027746

Those with populations one-third the size of larger voting districts are granted the same number of lawmakers. Justices said the population gaps were unconstitutional.Leaders of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy and the governing Saenuri Party agreed to create a parliamentary committee sometime next month to discuss how to reduce population differences among voting districts.But parties agreed to give an external organization the final say over remapping the nation’s 246 parliamentary constituencies. Some say that this organization will be the National Election Commission, a government-run body unaffiliated with any party and in charge of managing South Korea’s major elections.The decision to give an outside body overall authority appears to be aimed at calming public fear that the country’s main parties would remap districts in their own favor, to protect their interests before the 2016 general elections.The two parties hold a combined 288 seats in the 295-seat parliament.Party representatives, though, failed to form a panel to consider amendments to the Constitution.Proposals to limit the president’s constitutional powers over domestic affairs such as Cabinet and Constitutional Court appointments have been raised since the 1970s. The opposition and some Saenuri lawmakers have reignited public debate over the issue.Main opposition officials say the president’s powers over Cabinet nominations give the chief executive overreaching political influence over governing party lawmakers, who often seek positions in the government’s top decision-making body to boost their political careers.Supporters of constitutional reform suggest strengthening the prime minister’s authority over domestic affairs. They also support electing the prime minister by parliamentary vote, as opposed to giving the president the right to pick a person for the government’s No. 2 job. Leaders of President Park Geun-hye’s Saenuri Party have been treading carefully though, after the president expressed her staunch opposition to rewriting the Constitution during her New Year Address Monday.The president and influential members of the governing party say such a parliamentary panel would only increase partisan wrangling, impeding key legislative reforms the Park administration is pursuing.These include possible changes to pensions for retired civil servants in order to lower the public debt, and deregulating the labor market, a move targeting the 9 percent youth jobless rate.“The NPAD strongly demanded forming a panel (to revise the Constitution) but the governing party proposed postponing such debates to a later date,” NPAD spokesman Kim Sung-soo said, adding that was all he had been told by the senior party leadership.“Parties were in consensus over the panel for electoral reforms, but there appear to be great differences over constitutional amendments.”By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","main political parties on thursday ,political parties on thursday agreed ,political parties on thursday ,managing south korea major elections ,thursday agreed to create parliamentary","['Constitutional Court', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Saenuri Party', 'the National Election Commission', 'South Korea ’s', 'party', 'Cabinet and Constitutional Court', 'Saenuri', 'Cabinet', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park', 'NPAD', 'Kim Sung - soo', 'Jeong Hunny']",0,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.77529061  0.49710017

The 33-year-old day care provider, identified only by her surname Yang, was accused of striking a 4-year-old female child’s face in Incheon last week. Doubts mounted over the state’s monitoring system after it was found that Yang had received a first-grade day care teacher certificate and that the facility where the incident took place received 95 out of 100 points on the Welfare Ministry’s evaluation. A mother stages a protest to urge the government to strengthen child abuse prevention measures at Songdo International City, Incheon, Thursday. (Yonhap)Yang admitted Monday that she had punched the child, but she claimed that the act was part of discipline measures to correct the child’s bad habit, investigators said. The police secured surveillance camera footage at the day care facility from the last 24 days, which is the maximum storage period, to look into any further charges against Yang. The investigators also collected witness accounts from parents of 16 other students who reportedly shared similar experiences.Yang had reportedly been fired from another day care facility for locking a child in a room, according to the parents’ accounts. The police planned to seek the arrest warrant by early Friday.Families of the children are considering legal action against the day care center.The ministry immediately suspended the operation of the day care center, and said it would be permanently shut down once Yang is convicted. As concerns grew over the child care system, the police vowed to conduct intensive monitoring of all child-related facilities as part of the efforts to prevent child abuse. The ruling Saenuri Party also pledged to tighten child care regulations. “(The government and the ruling party) will make sure to amend the anti-child abuse measures this time. These will include requiring the installation of surveillance cameras at facilities, tightening the eligibility of day care givers and toughening the punishment against child abusers,” Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Lee Wan-koo said. The ruling party and the government will soon form a task force to draft the preventive measures in detail, Lee added.

But Rep.

The ruling did not consider justice,” Rep. Kim added. “I will fight until justice wins,” he said, strongly suggesting he would appeal the ruling.NPAD Reps.

""The part Kim supplied was a crucial piece of equipment, meaning the ramifications of his actions were significant.""Judge Cho, however, said he considered the fact that the piece of equipment provided by Kim was not one of the faulty parts discovered last year.""Thankfully, the piece of equipment he supplied didn't have any defects, so I took that into account,"" he said.Last year, the military said the Tongyeong's sonar system was dysfunctional and its remotely-operated vehicle unable to scale underwater structures during nationwide efforts to save the victims of the ferry sinking.The announcement prompted a government investigation into allegations of bribery and other underhanded dealings between military officials and defense firms.In late December, the vessel was delivered to the Navy after passing an operational capability test.

Seoul remains technically at war with Pyongyang since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.The 41-year-old is also suspected of making flattering remarks about North Korea on a YouTube channel and writing blog posts praising North Korean founder Kim Il-sung for an unidentified period.""Had this been a normal situation, they wouldn't have sought my arrest over a talk show I've been hosting for the past few years,"" Hwang told reporters before entering the court for a hearing Tuesday.Her Korean-American co-host Shin Eun-mi was deported Saturday over similar allegations. She is now banned from entering South Korea for the next five years.Last week, Hwang sued an 18-year-old boy for attempted murder after he detonated a homemade bomb at a talk show in Iksan, 250 kilometers south of Seoul, last December.The boy was later found to be a member of a right-wing online community called ""Ilbe,"" according to police.

The agriculture and oceans ministries and the Fair Trade Commission also joined the briefing.“Although public enterprises have reduced debt and employee benefit packages, the people are still not satisfied with their productivity and efficiency,” Park told the ministries.President Park Geun-hye“I urge the Finance Ministry to lead other ministries to actively push forward reforms in the public sector without retreating and causing a ‘yo-yo syndrome.’”The Finance Ministry said that it would further push state-owned enterprises to reduce debt and completely root out reckless management, and either merge or shut down overlapping businesses by 2016, a year ahead of its initial schedule.Park also called for ensuring flexibility in the labor market, saying reform in the sector was the most important task for building a strong economy under the three-year economic reform plan aimed at boosting the annual growth rate to 4 percent and achieving more than $40,000 per capita income.The Labor Ministry said it would have state-run enterprises adopt a wage peak system and expand a performance-based bonus and pay system so that the private sector could follow suit. The ministry said that the performance-based measure would apply to those who had worked more than seven years at state-owned enterprises.“We will closely evaluate the functions and businesses of public enterprises on whether they are appropriately aligned with the world’s trends, and seek to convert them to focus on core assets as a means of raising productivity and efficiency,” Vice Finance Minister Joo Hyung-hwan told the press.He added that the government would move to allow irregular workers to easily gain regular status based on their performance and skills in the public sector as part of the efforts to boost labor market flexibility.Also, the government will encourage private construction companies to run home-rental businesses by offering tax incentives in line with efforts to increase housing supply and stabilize apartment prices.The Land Ministry said measures would include guaranteeing profit margins of above 5 percent for private home-rental companies, and raising tax cuts from 25 percent to up to 50 percent for acquisition taxes for private companies that buy houses and rent them out to middle-class families. The government will help convert mid-income earners’ mortgages worth some 40 trillion won into long-term loans with fixed interest rates, while providing financing of more than 20 trillion won to tech startups and midsize companies.The Finance Ministry noted that the government might need to readjust its state budget in line with its economic reform plan as there would be changes at state-run organizations.

Moon Hee-sang also criticized Park’s refusal to sack her chief of staff Kim Ki-choon, and a group of presidential aides alleged to have meddled in state affairs, during his New Year address at the National Assembly.“President Park said (in her New Year address) that debates over revising the Constitution would take public focus away from her efforts to boost our economy,” Moon said.“But now is also the ‘golden hour’ to fix our Constitution, a law that allows the president political powers that I fear resemble those of an emperor,” the five-term lawmaker said.Moon and senior NPAD lawmakers have called for constitutional amendments that would diminish the chief executive’s authority over domestic affairs, such as the right to nominate members of the Cabinet and the Constitutional Court, the nation’s highest judicial body.But Park had said during her New Year address on Monday that she was against discussing constitutional reforms. They would create unnecessary partisan wrangling between the NPAD and the governing Saenuri Party and block the enactment of key economic bills, she had said. Public support for constitutional reform was also lacking, Park added.Rep. Moon Hee-sang. (Yonhap)NPAD officials say, though, that the president wields unwarranted political advantages over governing party lawmakers, who often seek positions in the Cabinet to boost their political careers.Members of Park’s Saenuri Party have also expressed support for constitutional reform including Saenuri chair Rep. Kim Moo-sung and Rep. Lee Jae-oh, a five-term lawmaker close to former President Lee Myung-bak, Park’s former political rival. Moon also urged Park to sack members of the presidential staff linked to the so-called Chung Yoon-hoi scandal, named after Park’s chief of staff during her years at the parliament.“I am confident that a large portion of the public supports firing the aides accused of meddling in government affairs,” Moon said.Ten current and former Park aides have been accused of exerting political pressure on senior government officials to resign. Chung is accused of directing the group’s involvement by using his ties to current presidential staff.Park said she would retain her staff, though, as the scandal was based on “groundless rumors.”“How would anyone be able to work with me if I fired someone every time they were linked to uncorroborated rumors?” the president said during her New Year press conference.Public responses to Park’s comments have been mixed. A poll conducted by Realmeter hours after her address reported only 33 percent of respondents said they “agreed” with the remarks. Five-hundred adults were surveyed nationwide, and the poll has a 4.4 percent margin of error and a 95 percent confidence level.But rumors that Park could reshuffle members of her senior staff surfaced Tuesday when Cheong Wa Dae spokesman Min Kyung-wook announced Park was “closely monitoring responses” to her address.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","opposition party leader on tuesday ,party leader on tuesday vowed ,government officials to resign chung ,president said during her new ,opposition to revising the constitution","['Park Geun', 'Moon Hee - sang', 'Park ’s', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'the National Assembly', 'Park', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'NPAD', 'Cabinet', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Park', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park', 'Moon Hee - sang', 'Yonhap)NPAD', 'Cabinet', 'Park ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'Lee Jae - oh', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Park ’s', 'Moon', 'Chung Yoon - hoi', 'Park ’s', 'Moon', 'Park', 'Chung', 'Park ’s', 'Park', 'Cheong', 'Min Kyung - wook', 'Park', 'Jeong Hunny']",3,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.43249708  0.39299494

Choi served in Lee's Cabinet when he was in office.Amid opposition from the ruling party, the two sides agreed last week to postpone a decision on the issue until after the field inspections.Also during the plenary session, the parties passed a bill calling for government compensation for the families of victims and survivors of April's ferry sinking that left more than 300 people dead or missing. Most of the victims were high school students on a field trip to the southern resort island of Jeju.The bill also calls for government scholarships for students who survived the disaster.Meanwhile, a controversial anti-corruption bill that passed through a parliamentary subcommittee last week will be prioritized during February's extraordinary session, officials from both parties said.The so-called Kim Young-ran Law calls for punishing public officials who are caught taking money or valuables worth more than 1 million won ($912) even if they were not in exchange for favors.Kim, who first proposed the legislation in August 2012, is a former Supreme Court justice and a former head of the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission.The bill is intended to tighten loopholes in existing anti-corruption rules that punish public officials only when they receive bribes in connection with their work.The bill has stirred up a heated debate about whether the law makes civil servants reluctant about performing their duties because of the fear of punishment.

The so-called Kim Young-ran bill was passed by a parliamentary subcommittee last week and is expected to be put to a final vote at a plenary session next month. Under the new law, which will take effect in January 2016, public servants and their families will be punished when they receive 1 million won ($910) or more in cash or equivalent gifts, even as birthday or Christmas presents.The bill was named after the former Supreme Court justice and chairwoman of the Anti-corruption and Civil Rights Commission who first proposed it in June 2011.Kim’s initial bill failed to pass the Assembly. The incumbent Park Geun-hye administration submitted a revised package in August 2013 under the same name. The National Assembly convenes a plenary session on Dec. 29. (Yonhap)Public support for the bill has been high, especially in the weeks following the Sewol ferry accident in April last year that killed more than 300, most of them high school students.Investigation found that maritime regulators had chronically condoned safety violations of private industry officials in return for kickbacks, or “special treatment.”But lawmakers have dragged their feet over legislating the bill, wrangling over details such as whether nonpublic servants would be included, or what sum could be considered a bribe.The bill, as passed by the National Policy Subcommittee last week, will include nongovernment public interest groups such as members of the media and teachers at private schools as those subject to bribery penalties.Officials caught receiving bribes of less than 1 million won will be fined.The bill defines monetary gifts as “all deposits, products or services that can be considered monetary in nature.” It also gives special exceptions to those giving financial gifts to public institutions in the form of donations that will be used for public purposes.Due to the comprehensive nature of the bill, up to 20 million people or about 40 percent of the nation could be affected.The bill also intends to make it easier for courts to punish bureaucrats suspected of receiving illicit money. According to current laws, prosecutors must prove that a suspected official received monetary gifts for a specific purpose. The bill will allow courts to incriminate officials if they receive money from interest groups, even if the money was not taken for any specific objective.The original version of the bill had proposed stricter measures, suggesting that all public officials receiving money, regardless of the amount, should be punished. The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy initially supported the original version but agreed to set the bar at 1 million won, after the governing Saenuri Party asserted the bill would have unwanted side effects, such as the punishment of those giving innocent low-cost gifts.In the Corruption Perceptions Index released by Transparency International last year, Korea ranked No. 43 among 175 countries surveyed and No. 27 among the 34 members of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","toughest ever law against corruption ,ferry accident in april last ,toughest ever law against ,nation toughest ever law against ,the nation toughest ever law","['the National Assembly', 'Kim Young - ran', 'Supreme Court', 'Civil Rights Commission', 'Assembly', 'Park Geun - hye', 'the National Assembly', 'the National Policy Subcommittee', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Saenuri Party', 'Transparency International', 'Korea', 'the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development', 'Jeong Hunny']",2,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.50980788  0.06175978

The three-time lawmaker said he sympathizes with the group’s ideals to “pursue a reasonable progressive politics and to create a country based on peace, protection of environment and welfare.” Five former lawmakers plan to join the group, and former four-term NPAD lawmaker Chun Jung-bae is reportedly mulling whether to follow suit. Chung’s exit is likely to deal a heavy blow to the NPAD, which is slated to elect its new leader on Feb. 8. Moments after his defection, the party expressed regret over Chung’s decision. Former liberal presidential candidate Chung Dong-young walks out of the National Assembly press conference room Sunday after announcing that he would leave the New Politics Alliance for Democracy. (Yonhap)“It is very regretful that Chung, who had been our party’s presidential candidate, left us. I think people would have expected us to cooperate under the new leadership,” said Rep. Han Jeong-ae, a spokesperson for the NPAD.Park Jie-won, one of three candidates for the NPAD leadership, also said he was “deeply sorry” Chung had to leave. “His departure made me think the factional feud (within the party) may have been too much,” he said.Moon Jae-in, another candidate for the NPAD leadership, said Chung should have stayed to work out the issues rather than to leave the party. “If by any chance, our party was not as progressive as he (Chung) felt was necessary, he should have made efforts within the NPAD to lead us.”Shin Yul, a political professor at Myongji University, said Chung’s defection may have resulted from the fear that his political career may have no future within the NPAD. But he expressed doubts that many incumbent lawmakers would follow Chung’s footsteps to join the new party. “In most cases, the lawmakers (within the NPAD) likely to leave the party are ones opposing the pro-Roh faction. But most of them are either centralists or moderates who are unlikely to join forces with progressives,” said Shin.Other observers raised the possibility that prominent centralists, such as NPAD lawmakers concerned about the growing prominence of the pro-Roh faction ― namely Rep. Moon ― could join the new party, they said.Chung, a 61-year-old former journalist, entered politics in 1996 when he was elected as a member of the Korean parliament. He served as a unification minister for almost two years in the Roh Moo-hyun administration, and was the liberal bloc’s front-line candidate in the 2007 presidential election.

More than 300 people, mostly teenagers, perished with the ferry, making it one of the deadliest disasters in modern South Korean history.The KCG took much of the flak for the heavy death toll, as many blamed the government's poor initial response for the massive loss of life.In a live interview aired on April 18, Hong posed as a civilian diver and told the MBN channel that the Coast Guard was preventing her peers from trying to rescue those missing.She also said one of the divers was able to communicate with the survivors through the ferry's hull.But soon, allegations that she may have lied emerged, as she was also found to have claimed she was a cousin of a famous South Korean girl group singer in the past.Despite her history, however, the Mokpo branch of the Gwangju District Court said Hong was not guilty of libel because it was difficult to prove that her claims were false.""What she posted on social media and told the cable channel seems to have been meant to spur an effective government response to the disaster,"" Judge Jang Jeong-hwan said in a ruling. ""It is difficult to say whether it was untrue or constituted defamation of the KCG.""The judge, however, conceded that her actions were inappropriate.""But this is not to justify her actions. There were inappropriate aspects of her behavior, which were dangerous throughout the trial,"" he added.Prosecutors had sought a year and a half jail term for the woman.

Lee In-young of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy will challenge the favorites Reps. Moon Jae-in and Park Jie-won in the in-house chair election on Feb. 8. But Lee may play the role of spoiler as votes from the two-term lawmaker’s main political support base could be split between himself and Moon, leading to a win by Park. Lee could also be the answer to the party’s infighting problems, analysts and Lee supporters said.NPAD in crisisThe main opposition party has been on the decline over the past two years amid continuous feuding among its main factions. Three leaders were pressured to resign during this period. The party’s public ratings have nosedived. The party also lost the July by-elections to the governing Saenuri Party, even losing a seat in the Jeolla region, an electoral stronghold that the left has rarely lost in major elections.Those vying to become the party’s new leader in the coming convention have vowed to end the intraparty fighting and turn the party around before the 2016 parliamentary elections and 2017 presidential election.But critics have charged that the Moon-versus-Park paradigm in the coming party convention will exacerbate friction within the NPAD, as the two figures are considered the senior leaders of the party’s two main factions.Moon leads the so-called pro-Roh Moo-hyun group, which is named after the late former president and consists of a relatively younger group of Roh-admiring lawmakers. Park leads the old-school faction that traces its roots to one of modern Korea’s liberal founding fathers, Kim Dae-jung.“Is the NPAD convention going to repeat the usual pro-Roh vs. non-Roh fight?” read a satirical editorial in the right-leaning Chosun Ilbo newspaper in Seoul on Thursday, in reference to Moon and Park.The answer?Lee won the third and last spot in the NPAD’s party chair elections in a primary held Wednesday. In his speeches, Lee underlined his determination to break from the NPAD’s traditional factionalism.“Reps. Moon and Park cannot unite our party. They are the representatives of the pro-Rohs and the non-Rohs,” Lee said during a campaign rally in Gwangju on Thursday. “I intend to make a stand and rally our party at this convention.”Lee argues he is best fit for the party’s chair as the NPAD is in need of a “generational change.”“If Lee runs, he’s likely to offer party voters a third option and break the Moon-versus-Park paradigm, even if he loses,” local daily Hankook Ilbo cited an unnamed “moderate NPAD lawmaker” as saying.Rep. Lee In-young. (Yonhap)But Lee’s candidacy poses challenges to Moon. Lee’s political support base comes mostly from the “86ers,” an NPAD group of former student activists born in the 1960s who spent their college days protesting against the military governments of the 1980s.If Lee choses to give up his candidacy before Feb. 8, the “86ers” are likely to offer their votes to Moon, a former student activist whom the 86ers can empathize with better than Park.As long as Lee runs, though, this support base is expected to be split between Lee and Moon, giving the upper hand to Park, the leader of the old-school liberal camp.“Moon and Lee could also split the votes from Seoul,” Hanshin University professor Yoon Pyung-joong said. Moon earned more votes than President Park Geun-hye in Seoul in the 2012 presidential elections.

The law bans any activities meant to praise, promote or propagandize North Korean ideals in the country.After a series of questionings, the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office said it has decided to deport Shin instead of indicting her as the police have requested. She will then be barred from entering South Korea for the next five years.Prior to entering the prosecution office for a final questioning session on Wednesday, Shin said she was the victim of a ""witch-hunt on alleged North Korea followers.""""I said the two Koreas should restore trust and coexist peacefully. I don't think the remark posed any risk to our national security,"" she told reporters.Informed sources said Shin will likely be deported on Friday.Prosecutors said they have also asked the police to seek a preliminary arrest warrant on Shin's South Korean co-host Hwang Sun, who is accused of the same charges. The 40-year-old is a former deputy spokeswoman of the now-defunct Democratic Labor Party.Hwang has allegedly endorsed former and incumbent North Korean leaders on an Internet broadcasting station since 2011.

Lim was indicted for the charges in May 2014.Lim was also charged with receiving 14 million won in kickbacks from an individual after she promised a legal settlement, citing her relations with the then prosecutor general.The prosecution earlier asked the court to sentence Lim to a jail term of two years.The investigators said that they have secured sufficient evidence confirming that a 13-year-old boy is Chae’s child born out of wedlock.In its unveiling of a probe result last year, the prosecution also cleared some presidential secretaries of the allegations that they illicitly collected the former prosecutor general’s private records to pressure him to resign over the lovechild scandal.

While indicting Cho Wednesday, the Seoul Western District Prosecutors’ Office filed the additional charge that she had interfered in the Transport Ministry’s probe by having company officials attempt to cover up the case and manipulate evidence. The prosecution also indicted a Korean Air executive, surnamed Yeo, on charges of destroying evidence and forcing crewmembers involved to give false testimony to minimize the impact of the case.  A senior prosecutor announces the result of the probe into the so-called “nut rage” incident involving Korean Air heiress Cho Hyun-ah at a press conference in Seoul, Wednesday. (Yonhap)A Transport Ministry official, surnamed Kim, was also charged with leaking information on the investigation to the airline. Kim, a former Korean Air employee for 15 years, phoned Yeo about 30 times and exchanged 10 text messages between Dec. 7 and the day before the ministry’s probe was launched, according to the prosecution. Yeo and Kim were both arrested late last month along with Cho. The prosecution said it would launch an additional investigation into the Transport Ministry over suspicions that public servants had received special favors from Korean Air. Some ranking officials were accused of having their seats upgraded regularly for free.The ministry began to investigate the “nut rage” incident on Dec. 8 ahead of the prosecution’s probe as the public criticism escalated.Public anger grew over the ministry’s investigation after the deplaned cabin crew member claimed in a media interview that the probe had proceeded unfairly. He said that officials from the airline had been present during the probe, and that he had been ordered to revise his written testimony more than 10 times. Facing public doubts over the suspicious relationship between the ministry and the company, the ministry conducted an internal inquiry into its own probe and admitted that the investigation process had not been conducted impartially. The case has gained keen international attention with critics at home and abroad arguing that the incident was an epitome of social injustice. The case has also shed light on those on the receiving end of anger from those in high authority, raising public calls for a change in the rigid, hierarchical corporate culture.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","the prosecution also indicted korean ,daughter of the airline owner ,changing flight plans violence ,prosecution also indicted korean air ,both arrested late last month","['Korean Air', 'Cho Hyun - ah', 'Cho Yang - ho', 'Cho', 'the Seoul Western District Prosecutors ’ Office', 'the Transport Ministry ’s', 'Korean Air', 'Yeo', 'korean Air', 'Cho Hyun - ah', 'Seoul', 'Yonhap)A Transport Ministry', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Korean Air', 'Yeo', 'Kim', 'Cho', 'Transport Ministry', 'Korean Air', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28520861  0.52629626

Moon Jae-in and Park Jie-won are strong contenders for the New Politics Alliance for Democracy’s chairmanship, to be determined through a vote by party officials on Feb. 8. The new leader will oversee the party in the 2016 general election and the 2017 presidential election. On Wednesday, Rep. Lee In-young filled the last spot on the slate for party chair through a primary.But experts say Moon and Park are too invested in their respective factions to resolve intraparty bickering, a reason behind the party’s falling public ratings and landslide defeat to President Park Geun-hye’s governing Saenuri Party in July’s by-elections. From left: Reps. Park Jie-won, Moon Jae-in and Lee In-young, candidates for the chairmanship of the NPAD, pose at the primary on Wednesday that decided the slate for the party convention on Feb. 8. (Yonhap)“Park (Jie-won) is one of the main people who has been using factionalism to his advantage. So don’t expect him to change the NPAD,” said Choi Young-jin, professor of Korean politics at Chung-Ang University in Seoul. “Moon is even more inclined toward factionalism (than Park),” Choi added.Koh One, a Korean politics professor at the Seoul National University of Science and Technology, likewise forecast darker skies for the main opposition party.“Expect the opposition’s factional feuds to intensify after the convention,” he wrote in a book on prospects for Korean politics in 2015. Koh also raised the possibility that a third party could overtake the NPAD, as the nation’s main opposition party has been mired in layers of trouble.The NPAD has suffered from falling approval ratings that sank below the 30 percent mark throughout 2014, according to Gallup Korea. Analysts say the low figure is likely due to the NPAD’s lack of policy initiatives and incoherence among its multiple factions.The in-house division was most recently reflected in rumors that Chung Dong-young, a senior NPAD official and liberal presidential candidate in 2007, would leave the NPAD to found a third party to compete with the main opposition.That party has still not materialized, but the coming NPAD convention is still likely to worsen factional rivalry.Moon and Park are the respective leaders of the party’s two main factions. Moon leads the pro-Roh Moo-hyun faction, named after the late liberal president, while Park leads the old-school liberal camp, a faction that traces its roots to former President Kim Dae-jung.But despite its troubles, the NPAD remains South Korea’s No. 2 political party by multiple standards. It holds 130 seats in the 295-seat National Assembly, behind only the Saenuri Party, which holds 158. It ranks second among the nation’s top parties in major polls, although its ratings barely breach the 20 percent mark, according to Gallup Korea and Realmeter, another local pollster.Analysts say the NPAD will have to get its act together before the 2017 presidential election if the left wing wishes to reclaim Cheong Wa Dae.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","presidential election on wednesday rep ,2017 presidential election on wednesday ,presidential election on wednesday ,two political heavyweights running in ,chairmanship election early next month","['Moon Jae - in', 'Park Jie - won', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy ’s', 'Lee In - young', 'Moon', 'Park', 'Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park Jie - won', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Lee In - young', 'Choi Young - jin', 'korean', 'Chung - Ang University', 'Seoul', 'Moon', 'Choi', 'Koh One', 'korean', 'the Seoul National University of Science and Technology', 'korean', 'Koh', 'Gallup Korea', 'Chung Dong - young', 'NPAD', 'NPAD', 'NPAD', 'Moon', 'Park', 'Moon', 'roh Moo - hyun', 'Park', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'NPAD', 'South Korea ’s', 'National Assembly', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Gallup Korea', 'Realmeter', 'NPAD', 'Jeong Hunny']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45434466  0.26876581

A local court in Uijeongbu, Gyeonggi Province, on Tuesday dismissed a case filed by Lee Min-bok, a North Korean defector who leads the leaflet distribution drive, seeking 50 million won ($45,000) in compensation from the government for inflicting emotional distress by stopping his work last year. While endorsing his right to express his opinions through the flyers, the verdict said his campaign may place the people’s lives and bodies in “clear and existing danger,” which could be sufficient reason to limit the fundamental rights, citing North Korea’s repeated threats of retaliation and a recent exchange of fire across the border. The two Koreas traded fire in October after the North began shooting heavy machine guns, apparently aiming at balloons released by civic groups including Lee’s, which were filled with leaflets denouncing the communist regime, $1 bills, mini radios and other items.The court decision appears to be deepening the dilemma for Seoul over how to balance the need to improve inter-Korean ties and ensure the citizens’ freedom of expression and assembly and association.While the campaign could serve as a crucial public diplomacy tool toward North Koreans beyond the government’s role, they at times help heighten tension and thus set hurdles for Seoul’s policy goals. Doubtful about imposing any ban, the Unification Ministry pledged to work more with the police but upheld its principles. “We will provide support so that the police could take necessary safety measures to prevent any potential damage to the citizens’ lives, bodies or property,” ministry spokesman Lim Byeong-cheol told reporters Wednesday.“The necessary safety measures do not mean any physical, direct restriction on the leaflet launches that constitute the freedom of expression. … The government has been and will continue to handle the issue by comprehensively considering North Korea’s threats against the South and the possibilities of a physical clash involving our citizens.” The government has been coming under mounting pressure in particular since North Korean leader Kim Jong-un displayed his willingness for “highest-level talks” with South Korea in his New Year speech. Another defector organization recently sent a batch of balloons containing some 1.3 million anti-Pyongyang handouts, triggering concerns that it would thwart the nascent mood for a cross-border rapprochement.The North’s state media on Wednesday lashed out at Seoul for not stopping the liftoff, demanding that it choose between “confrontation and improvement of the relationship.”The National Assembly is forecast to approve a resolution next week calling for an end to slander between the divided states in line with their previous agreements. While criticizing Pyongyang for its provocative behavior, it also urges the government to take action to keep the leaflet spread from marring its pursuit of better inter-Korean ties or endangering the lives of citizens in border regions. Shortly after the shooting incident, Yeoncheon County residents pleaded for government action and took to the streets, using trucks and tractors to block the activists from reaching the venue where they had planned to release more balloons.“As a basic right of the citizens, the freedom of expression ought to be defended, but putting in danger not just yourself but others is well beyond the matter,” Rep. Kim Young-woo, a spokesman for the ruling Saenuri Party, said at a news briefing Wednesday. “The state is under an obligation to protect the people’s lives and property.” The text passed the parliamentary committee on foreign affairs and unification on Tuesday.“Given the nature of their Stalinist system, North Korean officials cannot engage in talks with the South if flyers undercutting Kim’s authority are distributed in their country,” said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior fellow at the Sejong Institute. “The prospects would darken if the Unification Ministry, which should know the regime better than any other agency, sticks to its uncompromising attitude and does not exert any flexibility.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","korea leaflets after court ruling ,north korea leaflets after court ,new year speech another defector ,gyeonggi province on tuesday dismissed ,anti north korea leaflets after","['anti - north Korea', 'South Korea ’s', 'Uijeongbu', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Lee Min - bok', 'north korean', 'North Korea ’s', 'Koreas', 'Lee ’s', 'Seoul', 'inter - korean', 'North Koreans', 'Seoul', 'the Unification Ministry', 'Lim Byeong - cheol', 'North Korea ’s', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'South Korea', 'pyongyang', 'North ’s', 'Seoul', 'National Assembly', 'Pyongyang', 'inter - korean', 'Yeoncheon County', 'Kim Young', 'Saenuri Party', 'stalinist', 'north korean', 'Kim', 'Cheong Seong - chang', 'the Sejong Institute', 'the Unification Ministry', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.07006525  0.32177389

Those that scored 85 or more received a “very satisfactory” rating, and those in the 80-84, 75-79 and 65-74 ranges were marked “satisfactory,” “average” and “unsatisfactory,” respectively.Those that scored below 65 were rated “very unsatisfactory.”Only three education offices ― in Daegu, North Chungcheong Province and Daejeon ― were in the “satisfactory” group while 10 ― including the ones in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province ― were labeled “unsatisfactory.” Three ― in Sejong City, Incheon and Gwangju ― were assessed to be “very unsatisfactory” and the remaining two were evaluated to be “average.”Among administrative organizations, the Defense Acquisition Program Administration, Military Manpower Administration and Public Procurement Service and now-disbanded National Emergency Management Agency received top marks, with none landing in the bottom group.The report showed that on average, local education offices scored 71.1 out of 100 in 2014, up 2.2 points from the year before. The average score for other government bodies were 80.1, improving marginally by 1 point compared to 2013.“We expected that the recent sinking of the Sewol ferry would have negative repercussions on how citizens perceived government bodies.

Announcing the interim outcome of their one-month probe, investigators at the Seoul Western District Prosecutors' Office said they have charged Cho Hyun-ah, the eldest daughter of Korean Air chairman Cho Yang-ho, with violating the nation's aviation safety law and criminal code.The charges against Cho include violations of aviation safety regulations -- changing flight plans and assault on a plane -- and coercion and interference in the execution of duty, according to the prosecutors.Cho resigned as a vice president of cabin service four days after a national uproar over her conduct aboard a Seoul-bound Korean Air flight from New York on Dec. 5.The plane had already been taxiing when she ordered the chief flight attendant to deplane over the way she was served macadamia nuts -- in an unopened pack instead of on a plate. She was angry because she believed the crew did not follow the proper procedure for serving nuts to first-class passengers.The flight was subsequently returned to the gate to deplane the purser, causing an 11-minute delay in its arrival at Seoul's main gateway, Incheon International Airport. More than 250 passengers were on board.The prosecution office said it had additionally brought charges of interfering in the execution of a government official's duty as she had allegedly exerted influence in the government investigation.Cho systemically interfered with the investigation carried out by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport following the incident, prosecutors alleged. ""Cho systemically interfered with the investigation by the government agency and prompted an insufficient investigation,"" said Kim Chang-hee, a prosecutor probing the case. Cho had already been detained since Dec. 30 after a local court issued a warrant, citing ""the gravity of the issue as well as the organized efforts to cover up her involvement from the initial stage.""A Korean Air executive, identified only by his surname Yeo, was also indicted on charges of ordering employees to delete an initial report of the incident, prosecutors said.A transportation ministry official, surnamed Kim, who leaked details of a government investigation into the case involving Yeo, will also be indicted, they added.Prosecutors said they will also continue looking into suspicions that government officials got free upgrades from Korean Air.

Between 2006 and April last year, the arms procurement agency designated more than 90 percent of 449 defense articles without demand analysis and due deliberation by letting its officials in charge of promoting the industry give permission arbitrarily.The authorities also failed to develop indigenous technologies to produce key parts, causing concerns over its possible negative impact on maintaining the country's combat power.""The DAPA and the commerce ministry failed to play its role of supervising and managing defense companies, while unjustifiably providing subsidies mostly to large companies,"" the auditor said.Apart from the audit, the government launched a massive probe into alleged corruption in the defense industry in November, after President Park Geun-hye denounced corrupt dealings in defense acquisition programs as ""actions serving the interests of the enemy"" and vowed to impose ""exemplary punishment"" to root them out.

Park Gwan-cheon authored and leaked the document.The document was then handed over to the president's younger brother, Ji-man, who is also the chairman of EG Group, an electronic materials producer, under the orders of former presidential secretary Cho Eung-cheon.Cho was indicted on charges of leaking confidential information, and violating the Presidential Records Management Act, prosecutors said.Prosecutors said they have also charged a police officer, surnamed Han, with copying the document and giving it to a Hanwha Group employee, who eventually leaked it to the media.Park Gwan-cheon had already been indicted with physical detention on charges of leaking confidential information, violating the law governing presidential documents, hiding official documents, and making false accusations, they said. The prosecution concluded that Chung, who holds no official position in the Park administration, had never met with a coterie of 10 key presidential aides since October 2013 to receive briefings on state affairs.Also, prosecutors said Park Gwan-cheon had authored the document alleging that Chung hired a man to follow the younger Park. The allegations of Chung's behind-the-scenes intervention in state affairs became a major scandal for the Park administration ahead of the start of its third year in power in February.

The prosecution concluded that the rumors were groundless. But the controversy intensified as allegations were brought by a local newspaper that disclosed a leaked presidential document reporting on Chung and his secretive meeting with Cheong Wa Dae staff. The scandal highlighted Park’s closed-off image, and internal conflicts among her secretaries at the nation’s top office. Some analysts also gave a negative outlook, saying that the scandal could give the president early lame duck status in the New Year.The trial hearings on the Seoul bureau of Sankei Shimbun came under the spotlight amid the Chung Yoon-hoi scandal involving an alleged power struggle among incumbent and former presidential aides.The prosecution had indicted Tatsuya Kato, the former bureau chief of the Japanese newspaper, on charges of defaming President Park Geun-hye “with a groundless report.”Its Aug. 3 article speculated that Park was not at Cheong Wa Dae when the ferry capsized on the morning of April 16, raising the possibility that she was privately meeting a male confidant at a location outside the presidential office.

NPAD members at the convention will select a new leader who will steer the party through the 2016 general election, and prepare it for the 2017 presidential election, making this a high-stakes convention.Reps. Moon Jae-in, Park Jie-won, and three others are in the race for the party chairmanship, while more are vying for seats on the party’s supreme council.But the focus is on who will become the party leader, as the new chair will have to tackle the party’s long-running problem: factional strife between the party’s powerful pro-Roh Moo-hyun group, which claims to have inherited the late liberal president’s legacy, and the rest. The simmering strife between the two factions has boiled over twice in 2014, causing the party to forfeit all legislative affairs both times and thereby paralyzing lawmaking activities at the National Assembly, which hurt their ratings in the polls.In 2014, the NPAD’s ratings never breached the 30 percent-mark in Gallup Korea surveys. December’s rating stood at 22 percent. Realmeter, another local pollster, measured the main opposition’s approval numbers at 22.7 percent in the same month.The strife has also led to the toppling of three chairs, as opposing factions pressured the leaders to resign after disappointing results in the July by-elections and prolonged negotiations with the governing Saenuri Party over the special Sewol bill.But the convention itself is a factional fight, as it pits Moon, the leader of the pro-Roh faction against Park, the leader of the opposing faction. Such a matchup could worsen internal strife or at best, distract attention from it, experts said.“Moon is taking up his role as a big brother for the pro-Rohs,” Chung-Ang University professor Choi Young-jin said. “He’s likely going to make the playing field for the pro-Rohs easier in the 2016 general election after he becomes party chair.”Moon has vowed to end factionalism for the party’s sake if he becomes chair. That promise will be all the more important for the South Korean left according to another expert.“2017 will be a good opportunity for the (NPAD) to defeat the conservative party in the presidential election,” said Yoon Pyung-joong, a professor at Hanshin University.“The public is likely to be jaded with the two consecutive conservative administrations,” Yoon said, citing the recent scandals in the Park Geun-hye administration and the preceding Lee Myung-bak administration.The NPAD will have about 34 months from the convention until the next presidential election to raise its public standing.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","next presidential election to raise ,the 2017 presidential election making ,since the 2012 presidential election ,the party long running problem ,until the next presidential election","['New Politics Alliance for Democracy , 2015', 'NPAD', 'npad', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Park Jie - won', 'pro - roh Moo - hyun', 'the National Assembly', 'NPAD ’s', 'Gallup Korea', 'Saenuri Party', 'Moon', 'pro - roh', 'Chung - Ang University', 'Choi Young - jin', 'NPAD', 'Yoon Pyung - joong', 'Hanshin University', 'Yoon', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'NPAD', 'Jeong Hunny']",0,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.82166576  0.40062889

The fine for smoking indoors at public restaurants or coffee shops is now 100,000 won, while shop owners who allow indoor smoking can now be fined up to 5 million won.But cigarette displays at local retail stores were already empty on the first day of the year, as smokers hoarded cigarettes before the price hike took effect. Local store owners saw it as a bad omen.“It’s not good for business,” a store owner in downtown Seoul said when asked about her empty cigarette stalls. “I wish I had some packs to sell, but they’re all out, and I won’t get any new deliveries until Saturday.”Other store owners reported only a few sales, or none at all, on Thursday.Tobacco industry officials were rumored to be warning local retailers to prepare for a cold winter, as the price hike was expected to depress sales and revenue and persuade more smokers to try to quit. But revenue could rebound later this year, as smokers who initially try to quit resume their habits, analysts said.Small retail shops across Korea generally depend on cigarettes for up to 60 percent of their revenue. But with the increase in prices, some local stores could shut down, or suffer hits in their sales.“Every time we sell a pack, we take about 3 to 5 percent of the entire cost,” one local 7-Eleven owner said. “But with the price rise, the increase in revenue will not make up for the loss in total sales.”There were also some price discrepancies. Products from British American Tobacco Korea and Japan Tobacco International Korea maintained their old prices.The two companies are taking longer to finalize new price arrangements, as their headquarters are outside Korea.A JTI Korea official said the company will need time to decide how much to raise their prices, as the recent tax hike was a ""crucial matter."" BAT Korea officials were not available for comment.Critics reportedly accused BAT Korea and JTI Korea of unfairly dodging the new regulations by delaying their price hikes.But officials from the two companies reportedly said they were actually playing a losing game, as they were subject to higher taxes while their revenues remained the same.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","thursday raising cigarette prices ,recent tax hike was crucial ,effect thursday raising cigarette prices ,taxes last month the fine ,thursday raising cigarette prices and","['Seoul', 'Korea', '7 - Eleven', 'british American Tobacco Korea', 'Japan Tobacco International Korea', 'Korea', 'JTI', 'Korea', 'BAT Korea', 'BAT Korea', 'JTI Korea', 'Jeong Hunny']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40553087  0.30672655
