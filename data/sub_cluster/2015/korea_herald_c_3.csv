The year had already been riven with conflicts over education, ideology, labor and other social issues that are likely to continue in the coming year.Social division is expected to only deteriorate as the nation enters major elections, starting with the April 13 general election, which is shaping up as a prelude to the 2017 presidential race. A major economic downturn alongside soaring government and household debt would further dim prospects of the country reconciling its ongoing conflicts. Participants in an antigovernment rally march in Seoul on Dec.5., protesting the government’s labor reform measures and reintroduction of state-authored history textbooks. (Yonhap)Protests are expected to continue over the Dec. 28 Korea-Japan agreement on settling the comfort women issue “irreversibly.” Groups representing the victims have vowed to fight on with the opposition parties joining the bandwagon of lambasting the government for the rushed negotiation that did not reflect the demands of the victims.The agreement amplified the surging dissatisfaction mainly among the younger and more progressive constituents against Cheong Wa Dae, which has continued to face criticisms of oppressing freedom of expression, retrogressing democratic processes and monopolizing decision-making procedures.The main opposition party’s bungled struggle to scrape together the support of dissatisfied moderates is also expected to dent its fortunes. At best, it will bolster alternative political forces’ stature. At worst, it will swell the number of those apathetic about politics. Education-related standoffs will become an issue from the get-go, as the government had been warning of the “child-care crisis” that will result in the failure of the Nuri program, which subsidizes kindergarten and day care centers. Local education offices have been refusing to allocate budgets for the program, expected to cost 2.1 trillion won ($1.8 billion) for 2016 alone, saying that the law states regional education budgets only cover educational facilities, under which day care centers do not fall.But another giant confrontation is being heralded concerning the Park Geun-hye administration’s much-disputed flagship education policy of reinstating government-issued history textbooks for secondary education. Professors from major universities including Seoul National University, Korea University, Yonsei University and Hanyang University have refused to participate as authors in protest, and the government has said they will keep the identity of participating authors under wraps to protect them from criticism. The textbook war stems from the left-right standoff over views of Korea’s modern history. Evaluation of conservative political figures such as ex-President Park Chung-hee -- the incumbent leader’s father -- and Rhee Syng-man --- the country’s founding president -- along with descriptions about Japan’s 1910-1945 colonialization of Korea and depiction of communist North Korea has been one of the most hotly contested issues in Korea. State textbooks were one of the main rallying points behind the three massive antigovernment rallies of November and December in 2015, but the other pillar of the protests was the contentious labor reform. Park had bemoaned, denounced and even threatened the National Assembly -- particularly the opposition -- for failing to pass bills that would allow her labor reform bills, accusing them of being “a proxy for the privileged.” The five-point law revision encompasses reduction of working hours, improvements in benefits for the unemployed, adopting the “wage peak” system, expanding sectors that employed temporary workers and extending the working period of temporary workers.The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, led by Han Sang-kyun who was arrested for leading illegal rallies, is among thousands of workers who, along with the opposition, say the reform will prolong the time of workers’ nonguaranteed contracts. They have also raised concerns that the new bill allowing companies to dismissed underperforming employees will allow “easy firing.”The government maintains that the reforms will improve labor conditions, such as by providing more jobs for young people via the wage peak system. The Finance Ministry said on Dec. 23 that implementing the wage peak system at state-run organizations has created over 4,000 new jobs. Park, who linked the high unemployment rate to the low birthrate, said that the older generation should “concede” to the younger generation.But Park’s rhetoric unwittingly touched on another thorny issue: intergenerational conflict that had emerged amid the economic slump, differences in political views and a shift in values.As Korean society has traditionally had its roots in Confucian values, respect for elders had been among the most important elements. The younger people are practically mandated to use different language and wear different attire when addressing elders. But frustration over the economic slump, intensified by the sense of deprivation, has driven the younger generation away from the older generation. According to Lee Shin-hye, a member of the Seoul city council, the Seoul Metropolitan Government allocated just 80.6 billion won for youth-related policies, while spending 1.2 trillion won on those aged 65 or older.The derogatory term “noseulachi,” a combination of “no” for old and “byeseulachi” for government official, represents the hostility youngsters have built toward the elderly.In a survey of 1,000 Koreans aged 13 or over, conducted jointly by the Presidential Committee for National Cohesion and local daily DongA Ilbo, 79.6 percent of respondents said Korea suffered from “severe” conflict between the older and younger generations. Over 60 percent of those in their 20s and 30s said they perceived elderly citizens in a negative way, citing stubbornness, obsession with the past and a supposed lack of respect for younger people.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","korea braces for year ,wartime sexual slavery issue ,nation enters major elections ,settle the world war ,wartime sexual slavery",['Japan'],3,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.78616136  0.13898264

South Korea agreed to end the dispute once and for all if Japan fully implements the deal.The victims, however, oppose the agreement saying that it lacks acknowledging legal responsibility.""When a case is not suitable for mediation, (the court) decides not to mediate (and open a trial),"" a court official said.Mediation is a way of finding solutions without former court trials. When an agreement is not reached amicably, former trials can be reopened.In 2013, a dozen elderly South Korean women filed for mediation to the court seeking 100 million won ($85,000) in compensation each.Still, Japan returned the relevant documents to the court, insisting that the South Korean court does not have jurisdiction over the Japanese government. The court set June 15 and July 13 as dates for mediation and asked the Japanese government to send its representative, but no Japanese official showed up.Two of the 12 elderly women have since died, lowering the number of plaintiffs to 10.After about two years of mediation efforts, the elderly women submitted documents to the court twice, seeking a formal suit against Japan. Now a trial has begun, but there is still the high possibility that the Japanese government will not respond to it, citing the Monday deal.Even without the participation of the Japanese government, the court can hand down a ruling.Still, even if the court rules in favor of the plaintiffs, a separate case needs to be filed with a Japanese court to execute the compensation decision.Only 46 former sex slaves, euphemistically called ""comfort women,"" remain, as many others have died over time.

The deal was in line with diplomatic efforts by U.S. President Barack Obama to form a united front with South Korea and Japan against China's increasingly assertive behaviors and North Korea's defiant pursuit of missiles and nuclear weapons. While the deal was welcomed in Washington, China's state-run media cast a wary eye on the deal, calling it insincere.

Tokyo has demanded to remove the statue as part of Monday`s South Korea-Japan settlement over the ""comfort women"" issue. Yonhap“The apology is rather vague and it’s hard to believe that Tokyo is being sincere,” the NGOs, including the House of Sharing and the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan, said in a statement.“If the motivations were sincere, Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe should’ve offered an apology himself, instead of sending the nation’s foreign minister on his behalf.”The NGOs also said they are “flabbergasted” at the South Korean government for accepting the “absurd” conditions of the settlement, including to consider it “final and irreversible” as long as Tokyo properly follows through on its promises, and agreeing to “find solutions” to Tokyo’s demand to shift the statue of a girl symbolizing victims from outside the Japanese Embassy in SeoulFollowing the statements by the NGOs, Rep. Lee Jong-kul, the floor leader of the main opposition Together Democratic Party, called for the resignation of Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and an official apology from President Park Geun-hye for accepting Tokyo’s conditions in the settlement.“Our party cannot accept this agreement,” Rep. Lee said. “The settlement shows that the government did not consult the surviving victims and NGOs at all before singing the deal.”Lee called the settlement just as “humiliating” as the 1965 South Korea-Japan Normalization Treaty, which was signed by former President Park Chung-hee, the father of current President Park Geun-hye. With the 1965 treaty, South Korea received a $300 million grant in economic aid. Despite Seoul’s repeated demands for an apology and legal compensation for the victims since the 1990s, Tokyo has said that all reparations in regard to “claims” -- including the issue of “comfort women” -- between the two countries were settled in 1965.In fact, Tokyo’s Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida told Japanese reporters after signing the deal on Monday that Japan still maintains the same legal stance about the “comfort women” issue, meaning it was legally and “finally and completely” settled under the 1965 treaty. He told reporters that Tokyo still has no plans to acknowledge legal responsibility and pay reparations, but instead decided to advocate the establishment of the government-backed fund for the surviving victims. “Our party is determined to ask the current administration at the National Assembly why it agreed to the settlement being ‘final and irreversible,’” Rep. Lee said. “We are also going to find out why the settlement even mentions the possibility of removing the statue that symbolizes the victims from outside the Japanese Embassy in Seoul.”Meanwhile, the Korean American Forum of California, a group of Korean-Americans supporting the surviving Korean sex slavery victims based in San Francisco, also issued a statement condemning the agreement between the two governments. “The ‘comfort women’ issue is an example of institutionalized sexual slavery and one of the largest cases of human trafficking and human rights violations in the world,” the organization said in a statement. “There are surviving victims of Japan’s wartime slavery in 10 other countries aside from South Korea. Tokyo mentioned nothing of them in the agreement, limiting the issue as something that only happened between Korea and Japan, while it should be recognized as a universal human rights issue.”The group also criticized Japan’s demands regarding the statue and the settlement being final. “The motivation is obviously to prevent the issue being talked about on the world stage anymore,” the group said. “And if Japan is truly sorry about what happened, they wouldn’t have any problems with having the statue in front of their embassy.”Some Japanese activists supporting Korean victims also expressed concerns over the settlement between the two nations. Watanabe Mina, secretary-general of the Tokyo-based Women’s Active Museum on War and Peace, said the agreement does not mention anything about educating the future generations on the issue. “One of the most important things about the ‘comfort women’ issue is to remember and educate so it does not repeat in the future,” she said. “Not only did Tokyo mention nothing about education, it demanded to remove the very symbolic statue, which will only help the public remember the war atrocities.”The General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, one of two main organizations of ethnic Koreans living in Japan and has close ties to North Korea, also heavily criticized the South Korean government for signing the deal in spite of Japan’s eyebrow-raising conditions, calling the agreement a “humiliation.”“It is humiliating because Seoul accepted Japan’s ‘irreversible’ apology that does not even say anything about national or legal responsibility,” said Ri Dong-je, a representative of the group’s affiliate organization consisting of North Korean sympathizers, in a statement. “The South Korean government should stop betraying its own citizens by giving in to Japan’s unreasonable requests. Japan, on the other hand, should take full legal responsibility of its inhumane war crimes in the past.” By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","tokyo apology for korean ,over wartime sex slavery ,apology for korean victims ,women issue drew angry ,resignation of south korean","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'korean', 'Koreans', 'south korean', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Tokyo', 'korean']",3,"[ 1.          1.          2.         ... -0.40467343  0.42579746

9,9,Chinese media cast wary eye on Korea-Japan deal on wartime sex slaves,"A newspaper published by China's ruling Communist Party on Tuesday took a wary and skeptic note on a landmark deal between South Korea and Japan on the issue of Korean victims of Japan's wartime sexual slavery, insisting that the deal will have ""little influence"" in Northeast Asia.

Both South Korean President Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said their bilateral relations entered a new era with the Monday deal. The United States praised the deal on the issue that has seriously plagued relations between the two key American allies for years. The deal was in line with diplomatic efforts by U.S. President Barack Obama to form a united front with South Korea and Japan against China's increasingly assertive behaviors and North Korea's defiant pursuit of missile and nuclear programs. The issue of Korean victims, euphemistically called ""comfort women,"" by the Japanese military during World War II has long been a thorn in diplomatic ties between Seoul and Tokyo as Japan's conservative politicians have not done enough to resolve the long-standing grievance regarding the Korean victims.In an editorial titled ""Comfort women deal will not aid Tokyo,"" the Chinese state-run Global Times newspaper stopped short of welcoming the deal. ""The comfort women deal has little influence on Northeast Asia.Japan's easing of tensions with South Korea doesn't mean it will gain more leverage in dealing with China,"" it said. According to historians, up to 200,000 women, mostly Korean, but other Asian women, including Chinese, were coerced into sexual servitude at front-line Japanese brothels during World War II. ""As the victim, China has been taking the initiative to resist Japan's denials of its history of aggression. South Korea is not a key factor in the Sino-Japanese relationship,"" the editorial said. Some Chinese analysts were also skeptical about the deal between South Korea and Japan. Wang Shaojin, a professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, said the deal is unlikely to help South Korea and Japan fully resolve history-related issues. ""The key point is whether Japan can face up to its history,"" Wang said. Su Zhiliang, a professor at Shanghai Normal University who is conducting research into Japan's wartime sex slavery, welcomed the deal, but it remains to be seen whether the Japanese prime minister's apology to the Korean victims is sincere or not. Under the Monday deal, Abe apologized to the Korean victims and Tokyo provided a 1 billion-yen ($8.3 million) fund for the victims. In return, South Korea will refrain from criticizing Japan over the issue. Still, critics in South Korea say questions remain whether Japan legally admitted its ""responsibilities"" over the issue. Japan had previously refused to resolve the grievance of the Korean victims, insisting that the issue was settled under a 1965 treaty that normalized bilateral ties.

What's important now is for Seoul and Tokyo to fight back nationalist pressure and sincerely carry out the agreement, they said.""The agreement between Seoul and Tokyo to finally resolve the issue of World War II-era sexual slavery or 'comfort women' is tremendously important, even historic,"" said Evans Revere, a former U.S. diplomat and senior adviser for the Albright Stonebridge Group.Earlier in the day, South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and his Japanese counterpart, Fumio Kishida, reached the agreement in Seoul, under which Japan will admit responsibility for the wartime crime and pay reparations to the victims.The deal came after President Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe held their first-ever one-on-one summit in early November and agreed to accelerate negotiations on the issue in a year marking the 50th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral diplomatic relations. ""At that meeting, and for the first time, the two leaders committed themselves and their governments to a speedy resolution of this thorny issue. In doing so, they each created a personal stake in a favorable outcome -- something that was essential to the compromises that made this breakthrough possible,"" Revere said.""Without their leadership, this agreement would not have happened.""The White House also praised the leaders of the two countries for ""having the courage and vision to forge a lasting settlement to this difficult issue."" National Security Advisor Susan Rice also said the U.S. looks forward to advancing trilateral security cooperation.Under the agreement, Japan formally acknowledged its responsibility for forcing Korean women into sexual servitude for its troops during World War II and agreed to offer 1 billion yen ($8.3 million) in reparations to the victims through a fund to be created by the South Korean government.South Korea promised to end the dispute once and for all if Japan fulfills its responsibilities.Bruce Klingner, a senior Korea expert at the Heritage Foundation, also called the deal ""a stunning success achieved through diplomatic perseverance as well as the courage by Prime Minister Abe and President Park to overcome seemingly insurmountable differences.""But he said the two countries should fight back nationalist pressure if the deal is to come to fruition.""Japanese ultra-right groups -- who deny Japanese imperial army involvement in wartime atrocities -- may seek to undermine support for the agreement. Korean non-government groups may argue the agreement doesn't go far enough in requiring Japanese contrition and demand additional Japanese concessions,"" Klingner said.The expert also said that the agreement allows Seoul and Tokyo to ""refocus attention from past differences to jointly focus on current security threats from North Korea and China"" and paves the way for greater trilateral security cooperation with the U.S.""Hopefully, South Korea will now be open to resurrecting an aborted 2012 military intelligence sharing agreement with Japan as well as integrating its national ballistic missile defense system into the more comprehensive and effective allied system,"" he said.Scott Snyder, a senior expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, also praised Park and Abe.""The agreement is a welcome step forward that should enable greater bilateral cooperation and trilateral cooperation with the United States. I believe it is good for both Korea and Japan and shows pragmatism and statesmanship on the part of both leaders,"" he said.Victor Cha, chief Korea expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that the agreement ""goes farther than most thought Japan would go in terms of admitting government responsibility,"" even though civic groups in South Korea may not be content.""This should pave the way, hopefully, for a normalization of political relations for the remainder of the Park and Abe terms, including enhanced trilateral cooperation with the United States on regional security issues including military information sharing agreements among the allies,"" he said.David Straub, a former State Department director for Korea and currently associate director for the Korean Studies Program at Stanford University, praised Park and Yun for ""their determination, skill, and courage in getting the best possible terms from a conservative Japanese government.""""I believe that this agreement fully vindicates the 'comfort women,' and, because Prime Minister Abe agreed to it, it makes it virtually certain that future Japanese governments as well, whether conservative or progressive, will uphold the position and the agreement,"" he said.""The agreement should result in the creation of a new, virtuous cycle in Korea-Japan relations. In future, both countries should be able to consider other issues in bilateral relations based on the merits of each issue, rather than having everything poisoned by a single issue,"" he added.Dennis Halpin, a researcher at the Johns Hopkins University's U.S.-Korea Institute, said that the agreement would allow Abe to project an image as statesman and supporter of women's rights on the world stage and to ""pursue Tokyo's long-standing elusive dream of a permanent U.N. Security Council seat.""It would also be good for the U.S. as the two key allies are now able to work together to support President Barack Obama's ""pivot to Asia"" and deal with the challenges of a nuclear North Korea and a rising China, the expert said.But South Korea could face tensions with nongovernmental groups if it tries to move the statue of a girl symbolizing sexual slavery victims set up in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul, Halpin said, pointing out that the statue has become something of Korea's own Statue of Liberty.(Yonhap)","experts the breakthrough deal ,japan wartime sexual slavery ,and japan on resolving ,korea japan deal shows ,japan deal shows leadership","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'China', 'North Korea']",3,"[ 1.          2.          0.         ... -0.17846616  0.62045085

""We look forward to deepening our work with both nations on a wide range of regional and global issues, on the basis of mutual interests and shared values, as well as to advancing trilateral security cooperation,"" she added.Secretary of State John Kerry issued a similar statement, saying the agreement will ""promote healing and help to improve relations"" between two of the most important U.S. allies. He also praised the leaders of the two countries and called for the international community to support the agreement.""We look forward to continuing to work with both countries on regional and global issues, including advancing our economic ties and security cooperation,"" he said.State Department deputy spokesman Mark Toner said he is aware that some Korean victims still feel aggrieved even with Monday's agreement, but it is for South Korea's government to work with them to address their concerns.The spokesman also said that it's incumbent upon the government of Japan to ""sell this agreement or to convince Japanese people that this agreement is in the best interest of Japan.""""This agreement will not necessarily answer or appease everyone's concerns going forward, but that said, we do support this agreement as a way forward to heal this wound,"" he said at a regular press briefing.A senior State Department official told reporters in a conference call that Monday's agreement will open a new chapter in cooperation between Seoul and Tokyo and is as important as the Trans Pacific Partnership free trade deal.""A region in which Japan and Korea are trading, are collaborating, are working together, are exchanging goods and services, ideas, culture, tourists, scientists, et cetera, without reservation, without hindrance, is going to be a more stable, secure and prosperous Asia,"" the official said.Under Monday's deal, Japan formally acknowledged its responsibility for forcing Korean women into sexual servitude for its troops during World War II and agreed to offer 1 billion yen in reparations to the victims through a fund to be created by the South Korean government.South Korea promised to end the dispute once and for all if Japan fulfills its responsibilities.The deal came after President Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe held their first-ever one-on-one summit in early November and agreed to accelerate negotiations on the issue in a year marking the 50th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral diplomatic relations. Historians estimate that more than 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during the war. Korea was under Japanese colonial rule from 1910 to 1945. The victims are euphemistically called ""comfort women.""South Korea demanded Japan offer a formal apology and proper compensation to the victims before they all die. Earlier this month, a former South Korean comfort woman died at age 96, reducing the number of surviving victims in the country to 46.Japan claimed it fulfilled its legal responsibility in a package deal under the normalization treaty of 1965, but South Korea insisted the comfort women issue should be handled separately as it constitutes a crime against humanity.Frayed relations between the two allies have been a key cause for concern for the U.S. as it seeks to bolster three-way security cooperation seen as a key pillar for President Barack Obama's ""pivot to Asia"" initiative aimed in part at keeping a rising China in check.

The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles delving into the reality and the country’s efforts to restrain the violence. This is the second installment. --Ed.It wasn’t too hard for Yoon Eun-ji -- not her real name -- to find out that her senior colleague had been bullied by one of the executives of her company earlier this year. It wasn’t difficult because the board member made it very clear that she was not happy with her pregnant colleague.“The executive humiliated her in front of everyone,” said the 29-year-old, who works for a local conglomerate. “She yelled at the pregnant woman. One of the things the executive said was that there was no reason for her to ‘suffer’ because of the colleague.”Yoon later found out that the reason why the female executive, in her 50s, was upset was because she received a disciplinary measure from the human resources department for overworking the pregnant employee. Under Korea’s labor laws, it is illegal for employers to make pregnant workers do night shifts. Workplace bullying against women is often linked to pregnancies and maternity leaves in South Korea. (123RF)The pregnant worker, who had no choice but to stay late in the office to finish her assigned tasks -- the company does not allow employees to take their work home for security reasons -- never reported her boss to the authorities. The human resources team found out through the company’s time-tracking system, which automatically calculates each worker’s time spent at work as they clock in and out.“My senior colleague ended up taking her maternity leave earlier than scheduled, mostly because of the stress (due to her relationship with the executive),” Yoon said. Alarming statistics The case of Yoon’s colleague reflects South Korea’s workplace harassment that is getting more rampant, complex and cruel. According to a report submitted to the National Assembly by the Korea Women’s Development Institute earlier this year, 16.5 percent of 4,589 surveyed Korean workers said they have been harassed at the workplace at least once in their lives. The state-run think tank claimed that the rate is about 1.5 times higher than the world’s average proportion of victims, which is about 10 percent.Some of the most high-profile workplace harassment cases in Korea include the “nut rage” incident, in which the former Korean Air vice president Cho Hyun-ah ordered a departing jet from New York to Seoul to return to the terminal gate at John F. Kennedy International Airport, after being dissatisfied with the way a flight attendant served her nuts on the plane last year. “There are many factors behind Korea’s workplace bullying situation,” said Lee Myung-sun, head of the KWDI, in her open letter to the Assembly, stressing that women and contract workers are some of the most vulnerable to the violence.“The (Korean) work culture that emphasizes competition and productivity, the increasing number of temporary and contract workers with limited job security, as well as the nation’s long work hours and hierarchal work relationships together contribute to this problem.”Among the surveyed Koreans who said they had been harassed at work, 58.4 percent said they were purposely given too much work, while 48.5 percent said they were constantly monitored by their employer to a degree where they felt an invasion of their privacy. Also, 44.1 percent said they have been purposely given work that was too easy as an insult, while 43.2 percent said they had been assigned to do a task that was either beyond their capabilities or control. Forty-one percent also said they had been either verbally insulted or humiliated at work. Meanwhile, 68.5 percent of the harassed participants said they were attacked by their bosses, while 32 percent said they had been harassed by their clients. Also, 31 percent said they were bullied by the executives of their companies.Other research reports have shown that the situation may be more serious. In a survey by the Korean Finance and Service Workers’ Union of its 3,065 members in June, 48.8 percent said they had been bullied at work. A 2012 survey by Saramin, an online recruitment website, showed 45 percent of the 2,975 working Koreans who participated had a coworker who was bullied. Among them, 61.3 percent said the bullying problem was very serious, and 58.3 percent said they saw a colleague quit after being bullied.Rep. Lee Jasmine of the ruling Saenuri Party said not many Koreans are aware that workplace harassment is a systemic problem. “The ‘nut rage’ incident has brought the issue of workplace harassment into the limelight,” she said. “But many Koreans still consider it as personal conflicts with people at work, rather than as potential illegal activities or a systemic problem.”Gender and job security A number of studies have shown that women, young employees and contract workers are more vulnerable to workplace harassment than those with full-time positions and male employees in Korea.A report by KWDI released last week, which surveyed 1,000 female workers in the nation’s service sector, showed that 45.9 percent of those working under a contract have experienced workplace harassment. Meanwhile, 29.2 percent of the workers who work full-time have endured the same. The report also showed that the younger workers were more vulnerable to workplace abuse. Among the surveyed, 46.3 percent of those in their 20s said they had been harassed at work, compared to 30.3 percent of those in their 40s and 36.5 percent of those in their 30s.In a 2014 study by Seo Yoo-jeong from the Korea Research Institute for Vocational Education and Training, 85.7 percent of the victims who participated in her research said their perpetrators were men, while only 9.6 percent of them said they were attacked by women at work. According to a 2011 research by local law firm Korean Public Interest Lawyers’ Group, which surveyed 1,633 women employees, 60.6 percent said they had been sexually harassed at work at least once in their lives. Last year, four full-time workers at Seoul Grand Park, a park complex run by the Seoul Metropolitan Government, received disciplinary action after it was revealed that they had been sexually and verbally harassing a female contract worker who was hoping to get a full-time offer at the time.The victim was junior to the four perpetrators -- three male and one female. Among the abuse she experienced included being forced to attend drinking gatherings and enduring unwanted touching and sexually explicit jokes. The victim, when reporting to the city government’s human rights office, said she did not resist in part as she was desperate to get a full-time position.The KWDI report also mentioned a sexual harassment case at Renault Samsung Motors, where a female employee was sexually harassed by her male superior for over a year starting in 2012. The report claimed that the victim and those who supported her faced additional harassment at work after her boss received a disciplinary measure from the company following her report to the authorities. According to the report, the human resources department spread false rumors about the victim, claiming she purposely seduced the perpetrator, a married man, first, and that sexual harassment in fact never happened, but she fabricated the facts to falsely report him. The victim, whose work performance had been stellar prior to the case, received poor grades in her work evaluation after she reported her boss. She was also abruptly told not to pursue the projects that had been originally given to her prior to the case, and instead assigned to do errands such as purchasing office items. One of her coworkers, who openly supported her when the victim reported the perpetrator, was also demoted allegedly for no specific reason and received very poor work evaluation.Workplace bullying against women is also often linked to pregnancies and maternity leaves. Last year, the Korean Health and Medical Workers’ Union revealed that among its 1,902 female members -- all nurses -- who are or have been pregnant, 17.4 percent have been encouraged by the employers to avoid pregnancy or get pregnant at a certain time so their maternity leaves do not coincide with their co-workers'. Also, 21.9 percent said they had to endure night shifts while pregnant, although the law prohibits it, and 18.7 percent experienced either miscarriages or stillbirths because of work-related stress and long work hours.  According to a 2011 research by a local law firm, which surveyed 1,633 women employees, 60.6 percent said they had been sexually harassed at work at least once in their lives. (123RF)In 2012, a former bank employee won a suit filed against her employer and coworkers, who bullied her after returning from a year of maternity leave. The banker, who had been in charge of accounts and mostly worked as a teller before taking the break, was asked to be an usher instead when she returned. Her desk was gone, and as an usher she had to stand the whole time. When she confronted her boss, he told her: “I no longer consider you as my employee. If you feel this is unfair, you should take the case to Cheong Wa Dae.” The KWDI report showed that her boss told all of the employees to “cooperate” in isolating her in the office, so she would eventually give up and quit. The victim suffered depression because of the experience.Labor issueIn October, representatives from labor, management and government reached an agreement that permitted employers to fire underperforming workers in exchange for hiring more full-time workers. Meanwhile, a number of bills to tackle workplace bullying have been proposed since 2013, but are currently pending at the Assembly.Lawyer Lee Jong-hee from the Korean Public Interest Lawyers’ Group, who also filed a report on the situation of workplace bullying to the Assembly, said limited job security resulting from being more vulnerable to getting fired may create more abuse cases at workplaces. “When you are on the verge of losing your job, you can’t report your boss for abuse,” the lawyer said in the report. “Research has shown that women workers are more unstable in the labor market and the change may make them even more vulnerable to workplace bullying than before.”Among the 360,000 who joined the temporary workforce in Korea over the past decade, 89 percent were women, according to the KWDI. Also, female temporary workers earned only 36 percent of full-time male workers’ average salary last year.“(Korean) women are constantly exposed to sexist behavior when they are in the workforce,” Koo Mi-young from the KWDI. “For example, married women are still often expected to do housework even they are working, while their husbands are simply expected to ‘help out’ when they can, rather than fully share the responsibilities. Such experiences can make women unaware of the problems, and make them incapable to recognize even when they are harassed by someone else.”Lawyer Lee said the laws should try to protect every worker’s dignity. “We need to talk about the system that makes it almost impossible for many workers to live with dignity,” the lawyer said in the report. “We need to talk about the system in order to tackle this issue (of workplace harassment).” Last month, Rep. Lee In-young from the New Politics Alliance for Democracy proposed a bill that newly defines workplace harassment and therefore make them punishable by the laws. It includes spreading malicious rumors and gossip that is not true; removing areas of responsibilities without reason for more than six months; insulting or criticizing a person persistently or constantly; assigning unreasonable or useless duties which are unfavorable to the person; and excluding or isolating someone socially at workplace. The bill also stipulated that in all lawsuits that involve workplace bullying, the accused must prove their innocence while the plaintiff does not have to prove the damages they suffered.However, along with a number of other bills tackling the issue, Rep. Lee’s proposal is currently pending at the National Assembly.According to a report by the Korea Research Institute for Vocational Education and Training released in June, a single workplace bullying case can cost a company up to 15.5 million won ($13,300), as it negatively affects the workers’ productivity and mental health.A number of countries, including Finland, Belgium and Canada, have legislations about workplace violence and harassment. In France, the Supreme Court held that it is an employer’s obligation to prevent workplace bullying and therefore renders them liable for bullying committed by their employees.

Another 237 Korean women, forced into sexual slavery for Japanese troops during World War II, followed suit, demanding a sincere apology and legal compensation from the Japanese government. Later that year, Kim and three other victims filed a lawsuit against Japanese authorities. But Japan’s highest court ruled against them in 2004. Twenty-four years on from that step up to the podium, a long-standing dispute between South Korea and Japan over the issue has continued to distress the now 46 Korean survivors, who are mostly in their 80s and 90s. Earlier this month, Choi Gab-soon died at age 96. Nine victims have died this year alone.Up to 200,000 “comfort women” were sexually enslaved by the Japanese Army before and during World War II. The surviving victims have maintained pressure on Japan by holding a demonstration every Wednesday outside the Japanese embassy in Seoul. South Korea has demanded an official apology and legal compensation from the Japanese government for the victims, while Japan has claimed it fulfilled its legal responsibilities under the treaty for normalization in 1965. Korea has claimed that the wartime human rights issue should be dealt with separately. The diplomatic standoff deteriorated in 2014 when Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called for the landmark 1993 Kono Statement to be revised, backtracking on its apology to the victims. The Kono Statement acknowledged that the comfort women had been coerced to serve as sex slaves, with the Japanese military’s systematic involvement in establishing and managing the frontline brothels.  In 1995, Tomiichi Murayama, then prime minister, issued a “heartfelt apology” for Japan’s “aggression” and “colonial rule” on the Asian mainland in a statement. That year, Japan also set up the privately run Asia Women’s Fund, which drew on donations, refusing to directly compensate the women. The move drew ire from Korean victims’ rights groups, including the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan, who viewed it as a gimmick by Japan to dodge its responsibility to directly apologize to the victims and compensate them. The operation of the fund was temporarily suspended in 1999 and disbanded in 2007 amid opposition from the victims. Of the victims, 12, including Lee Ock-seon, aged 86, filed for compensation from the Japanese government in August 2013 through the Seoul Central District Court. The case is currently pending at a mediation procedure. While the trial over the suit can begin regardless of the mediation process -- which aims to seek settlement before beginning the official trial -- the victims had been waiting for a reaction from the Japanese side that has repeatedly sent back relevant court documents citing the Korean court does not have jurisdiction over the Japanese government. Since then, two of the 12 have died.The international community has also pressured Japan. In 1996, the United Nations’ Human Rights Commission passed a resolution to accept the investigative reports covering comfort women forced into sexual servitude during the war, pressuring Japan to take legal responsibility for the atrocities.The U.S. House of Representatives in 2007 passed a resolution demanding Japan admit to its wrongdoing and issue an apology to the victims. In light of worsening bilateral ties, South Korea and Japan first held working-level talks in 2014 to settle the issue that has long posed hurdles in their relations. A total of 12 talks were held in the lead-up to the deal struck Monday. Japan expressed an “apology, remorse from the heart” to the victims of sexual enslavement and said it felt “responsibility” in the talks held in Seoul earlier in the day. But former comfort women showed mixed reactions after the deal was made public, as Tokyo did not make it clear whether it would be legal or ethical responsibility.Lee Yong-soo, an 88-year-old former sex slave, said in a press conference that she would ignore the results of the agreement. “The government doesn’t seem to care about the victims. What we cried for was an official apology from Japan and its legal responsibility.”Another 88-year-old former sex slave Yoo Hee-nam said in the House of Sharing, a shelter for the victims in Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province, that she would follow the government‘s decision. “We are not satisfied. Money is not an issue when we look back on our lives in the past,” Yoo said. “But, given the government’s efforts to resolve the issue within this year, I would follow what has been decided by the government.”By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","237 korean women forced ,her wartime forced prostitution ,sexual slavery for japanese ,korean women forced into ,another 237 korean women","['Kim Hak - soon', 'south korean', 'korean', 'japanese', 'japanese', 'Kim']",3,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.36398387  0.30060193

Job ads are displayed on a board in a college in Seoul. (Yonhap)Comparatively, only 5.1 percent of middle-school graduates and 22.9 percent of high-school graduates were classed as NEET.The report said that Korea tended to show higher NEET ratio among those with higher educational backgrounds, whereas other similar countries tended to show a high NEET rate among those with less education.In France for instance, the NEET ratio by education level is 19.0 percent (middle school graduates), 17.6 percent (high school graduates) and 11.0 percent (college graduates).The report suspected that many Korean NEETs have not given up on looking for jobs but are studying in nonregular education institutions such as national examination academies to find better jobs. “The reason Korea shows higher number of college graduates in NEET groups is that the well-educated young people tend to seek quality jobs by lengthening their job-hunting time,” report head Lee Man-woo said. The NEET numbers also include those preparing for state-run tests such as for public servants and bar exams.Overall, 18.5 percent of Koreans aged between 15 and 29 (regardless of education level) were NEETs, coming in at 8th after Turkey (31.3 percent), Greece (28.5 percent), Spain (26.8 percent), Italy (26.1 percent), Mexico (22.3 percent), Hungary (20.5 percent) and Slovakia (19.1 percent).The report divided the NEET into two -- those without jobs who are looking for employment and those who are economically inactive and are not seeking jobs. In case of Korea, over 80 percent of the NEET people belonged to the latter group, much higher than the OECD average of 54.4 percent, it added.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","young koreans with bachelor ,young graduates not in ,in four young koreans ,four young koreans with ,four young koreans","['Koreans', 'OECD', 'the National Assembly Research Service ’s', 'Korea']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.75516886  0.69712394

The exhibit featured 37 photos of some of the now-elderly Korean women forced to serve as 'comfort women' -- a euphemism for women forced into prostitution -- for Japan's military during World War II.Nikon, which had initially approved Ahn's proposal for the exhibition, unexpectedly cancelled the show three days after a newspaper article about it led to public complaints. The Tokyo District Court at the time, however, ordered Nikon to allow the exhibit to go on.""I'm happy that freedom of expression has been acknowledged,"" Ahn told reporters after the court ruling, according to Sankei Shimbun newspaper.Nikon had justified its decision to close down the show out of safety concerns, and the spokesman said the company felt the court's decision partially reflected an acknowledgement of its position.""We'll carefully consider whether to appeal or not,"" he said. The wartime forced sex issue is a sensitive and divisive one in Japan, which colonised the Korean peninsula from 1910-1945, while its military invaded parts of China and other areas of Asia during World War II.Many Japanese agree that young women from the Korean peninsula and elsewhere in Asia were systematically and repeatedly forced into having sex with Japanese soldiers during the war.But some argue that local pimps and businesses tricked the women into prostitution rings, with Japanese soldiers buying their services as customers with the military having no direct role in the running of brothels.The issue has been a major irritant between Seoul and Tokyo, with South Korea repeatedly asking for talks on compensation. Japan has consistently cited a broad 1965 compensation deal with Seoul that led to the normalisation of diplomatic relations as having settled all outstanding issues.But Friday's court decision came as Japan and South Korea announced that their foreign ministers will meet next week in a bid to reach a final settlement over the issue.","women photographer wins lawsuit ,japanese wartime sex slaves ,photographer wins lawsuit against ,japanese court on friday ,lawsuit against nikon tokyo","['AFP', 'japanese', 'Nikon', 'south korean', 'Tokyo', 'japanese', 'the Tokyo District Court', 'Nikon', 'Japan', 'Ahn Sehong', 'AFP.Ahn']",3,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.31757179  0.07410791

Currently, the Air Force Operations Command has geographically arranged units such as the Southern and Northern Combat Commands.The Air Combat Command, which is expected to be stationed in Daegu, will be in charge of running fighter jets, officials said. The Air Mobility and Reconnaissance Command, which is likely to be located in Osan, Gyeonggi Province, will be in charge of operating transport, reconnaissance and trainer aircraft.The need for an overhaul of the command structure has been raised for some time with officials and experts arguing that in the small operational zone of the Korean Peninsula, dividing the command structure according to region was not suitable for optimal aerial operations. In an emergency, F-15K fighters, based in Daegu, and KF-16s, based in Seosan, South Chungcheong Province, are to be mobilized for the same mission, which means the function-based command structure would better cope with aerial threats than specific commands for different regions. The change in the command structure has been caused mainly by Seoul’s recent and future procurement of a series of advanced Air Force assets, including airborne command and control aircraft, which have increased operational mobility and flexibility, and decreased the need to divide operational areas according to region. The South Korean military plans to introduce refueling tankers, high-altitude and low-altitude unmanned reconnaissance aircraft and stealth fighter jets, which will increase the need for a function-based command structure.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","air force reorganization plan ,said tuesday the plan ,air force will reorganize ,operations officials said tuesday ,oks air force reorganization","['the Air Force', 'Cabinet', 'Park Geun', 'the Air Force Operations Command', 'the Air Combat Command']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52462745  0.48074186

YonhapThe report also stated that although estimates on the total number of such victims vary, “most argue that hundreds and thousands of women were forced into these situations” by the Japanese during the war. According to the CDE website, the specific document is for the Modern World Chapter of the History-Social Science Framework for California Public Schools’ grade 10 students.Sankei Shimbun, the Japanese daily, said that California is the first U.S. state to include a section about Japan’s sex slavery in their public education curriculum. Although the CDE website does not specify, the Japanese paper reported that the U.S. state will finalize the revised proposal for the new curriculum in May next year, after reviewing public opinions on the matter.Scholars estimate up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea and China, were forced to work as sex workers for Japanese soldiers during the war. Despite Seoul’s repeated demands for an apology and legal compensation for the victims, Tokyo has repeatedly claimed that all reparations were settled in the 1965 South Korea-Japan Normalization Treaty. Of the 238 registered Korean victims of Japan’s wartime crimes, 192 had died as of this month, with 46 survivors remaining.In January, major U.S. publishing company McGraw-Hill rejected a request by Japan’s foreign ministry to “make changes” to specific passages in a history textbook about women sexually enslaved by the Japanese during World War II. When acknowledging it had contacted the New York-based publishing house in December last year, Tokyo said in a statement the textbook included “grave errors and descriptions that conflict with our nation’s stance,” according to the Japan Times.

The Administrative Court dismissed the steelmaker’s request to revoke the Environment Ministry’s action to allocate a set amount of carbon credits to the company. This is the first verdict released over the controversial carbon credit quota after a number of companies filed lawsuits against the state to nullify the carbon credit move earlier this year. In December last year, the government gave a certain quota for carbon credits to 525 companies, including 84 petrochemical firms, ahead of the opening of Asia’s first-ever carbon trade market in January this year. If companies exceed the emissions allowed, they are mandated to purchase the carbon credits. The business sector, however, has complained about the insufficient quota, claiming the ministry allocated only 80 percent of carbon credits they had requested. Earlier this month, the Korean government pledged in Paris to cut emissions by 37 percent from the expected business-as-usual level by 2030. The industry has raised suspicion over the efficacy of the carbon credit trading system. As of this month, the total trading amount in the market recorded 0.8 percent of this year’s allocated amount of carbon credits -- 543 million tons, officials said.

That followed the Japanese government's widely denounced demand that the American publisher alter the description of the sexual slavery issue in the text.  The latest statement by the right-wing Japanese scholars also came in response to a landmark statement issued in February by 20 American historians and later co-signed by nearly 500 scholars around the world in which the scholars denounced Japan's pressuring of the American publisher as an attempt to ""censor history.""  The Japanese scholars claimed in the latest statement that the McGraw-Hill textbook contains accounts that ""are completely without supporting historical evidence.""  ""We have to say that the credibility of the McGraw-Hill textbook as a whole should be seriously questioned as 8 errors of fact in only 26 lines, mentioned earlier, on the comfort women were found in the textbook,"" the Japanese scholars said in the statement.  McGraw-Hill has long said it ""unequivocally"" stands by what's written in the textbook.  Alexis Dudden, a professor at the University of Connecticut who has been at the forefront of efforts to denounce Japan's attempt to water down the crime, said that the Japanese historians' claims ""couldn't be farther from the truth.""  ""It's not natural that a government intervenes in academic publication. Imagine if Ambassador Caroline Kennedy sent three people from the American Embassy in Tokyo to various publishers of school textbooks to examine how Japanese textbooks portray the attack on Pearl Harbor,"" she said, referring to the Japanese ambassador to Tokyo.  Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mainly from Korea, which was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. But Japan has long attempted to whitewash the atrocity.  The sexual slavery issue has been the biggest thorn in frayed relations between Japan and South Korea, with Seoul demanding Japan take steps to address the grievances of elderly Korean victims of the atrocity and Japan refusing to do so.  Last month, South Korean President Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed to accelerate negotiations to resolve the issue.

Choi was the ninth Korean victim of slavery to die this year.The late victim was born in 1919 in Gurye, South Jeolla Province. When she was 15, Choi was taken by a Japanese officer who broke into her family house, initially to draft her father into the military or forced labor.  A funeral hall of the late Choi Gab-soon, who was forced into sexual slavery for the Japanese military during World War II. She died on Saturday. YonhapChoi was forcefully taken instead of her father, who had to support his family of eight. Choi was placed in a Japanese military base in today’s Manchuria, where she was enslaved as a sex worker until the defeat of Japan in 1945. She spent some three years as a beggar after being released, and eventually managed to return to her hometown Gurye where she spent the rest of her life as a farmer.“Time is running out for the surviving victims,” said a civic group the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan in a statement. “Tokyo should offer an apology and legal reparations as soon as possible to provide justice for the victims.”Scholars estimate up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea and China, were forced to work as sex workers for Japanese soldiers during the war. Despite Seoul’s repeated demands for an apology and legal compensation for the victims, Tokyo has been claiming that all reparations were settled in the 1965 South Korea-Japan Normalization Treaty.Of the 238 registered Korean victims of Japan’s wartime crimes, 192 have died as of Saturday.

According to OECD Better Life Index released this year, 2.09 percent of people reported falling victim to assaults and other types of crimes last year, less than the OECD average of 3.9 percent. It ranked sixth in terms of safety among the surveyed 37 countries. Gari L. Baki, police chief of Papua New Guinea, talks to a Korean police official at an outdoor exhibition held to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Korean police on Oct. 21, at Gwanghwamun Square, central Seoul. (KNPA)Korea established a “K-cop center” in April as part of its efforts to spread its policing techniques and know-how in various fields covering public safety, scientific investigation and cybercrimes to mostly emerging countries, according to the police. This year alone, the Korean police offered training to 189 officers from 25 countries including Indonesia and Guatemala, to share the nation’s policing system, field experiences and counterterrorism intelligence. The investment for “K-cop wave” projects has soared, with the number of Korean police officers and crime experts dispatched abroad having risen ninefold from 10 in 2014 to 89 this year. The budget also increased fivefold to $20 million over the four years. The police aim to send a total of 300 South Korean cops and experts abroad by 2018, the police said. On the back of the heightened interest in Korean policing, the country has seen a rise in exports of police gear including smart cars equipped with IT technology, water cannons and riot shields. Korean firms sold police gear worth $171 million abroad from 2005 to 2014, with the exports worth $58 million as of September. The government will provide financial assistance through the nation’s international cooperation agency of nearly $20 million to Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and the Philippines by 2018 to build policing infrastructure there. As Kim Jong-yang, commissioner of the Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency, was elected as one of the two vice presidents for Interpol executive committee, the police will also dispatch skilled officers to Interpol to help nurture policing capability for those from all over the world. “I think that Korea has become known for its exports of superior policing system and equipment to countries around the world, which we call ‘K-cop wave,’” said Kang Sin-myeong, general commissioner of the Korean National Police Agency. Exporting Korea’s policing skills, coupled with enhanced cooperation with other law enforcement agencies, could benefit Koreans abroad, he expected.“We plan to expand the Korean Desk to seven more cities in the Philippines and dispatch Korean investigators to the crime scene so that we can help Filipino police officers swiftly probe cases involving our citizens,” Kang said. Following a string of crimes targeting Korean nationals in the Philippines, the police launched a “Korean Desk” in 2010, setting up two offices in the two major cities of Manila and Angeles. The desk is aimed at better protecting its citizens abroad by dispatching Korean investigators to work together with Filipino authorities in criminal cases involving Korean nationals. In the last four years, a total of 38 Koreans were murdered in the Philippines where about 100,000 Koreans reside. According to the police, they plan to set up the Korean Desk in Vietnam next January. They are in talks with Indonesia to start one, too. The police chief said he has asked Japan and China to create a trilateral committee with Korea to bolster cooperation in policing, though both neighboring countries seem to be cautious in taking the proposal forward.

From autopsies and fingerprint recognition to DNA and psychological analyses, the Korean police have improved over the years.Korea Crime Scene Investigation agents demonstrate how they secure evidence and investigate a crime scene. (Yonhap)Among the technologies that have been developed, the advancement of fingerprint analysis is especially noticeable since its introduction to Korea in 1984.Fingerprints often provide crucial clues in many criminal cases. Over 120 distinguishing points exist on a single fingerprint. The police can identify a suspect with just 12. In June last year, Korea’s fingerprint recognition technology played a major part in a high-profile case. When the de facto owner of Sewol ferry Yoo Byung-eun -- who absconded after his ship sank off the southwestern sea in April, killing 304 -- was found dead in a remote village in South Jeolla Province, there were doubts whether the badly decomposed body was actually his.Simultaneously, with tooth identification, the police conducted a “high temperature-moisturizing method”-- which instantly expands fingers in 100 degree Celsius water so the fingerprints can be secured using adhesive fingerprint tape. The police were successful in securing one fingerprint.This advanced fingerprint technique was introduced by Korean police officer Yoon Kwang-sang in the early 2000s. It was widely recognized in 2004 when Yoon and some agents were dispatched to Thailand to support the relief operations during the Indian Ocean tsunami tragedy. They were able to identify 18 victims with this method.Yoon, who later acquired a patent for the “high temperature-moisturizing method,” received the top scientific investigation award from the police in 2014 in recognition of advancing scientific investigation technology. Since 2013, the Korean police have annually provided training on the fingerprint analysis to forensic experts from Bahrain and Guatemala, and the technology is also exported to countries such as the U.S. for use by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, according to the police.In Korea, the police have identified 1,157 bodies out of 3,032 mysterious deaths in the last five years with the fingerprint analysis method, the police said.Hand in hand with such advanced technologies, criminal profilers also play a crucial role in solving high-profile cases, especially in finding serial killers. Criminal profilers are criminologists who psychologically analyze a suspect’s behavior and motive for clues. In many cases, their work involves screening separate criminal cases and looking for a connection.Although patience, sharp observation and ability to meticulously analyze a suspect’s psychological mind are essential for profilers, there is one attitude that is crucial when questioning suspects, experts say.“Whenever profilers question suspects, they should not be dominated by a psychological game with suspects. Unless profilers have a firm belief and standards about good and evil, they can get confused over the difference between right and wrong in the game when listening to suspects,” said Bae Sang-hoon, the head of police studies at Seoul Digital University. Bae was one of the first profilers recruited by the government in 2005. He worked as a profiler until 2010. The role of profilers was not widely recognized until the murderer of 20 women over years, Yoo Young-chul, was caught in 2003. Yoo’s premediating plans and cruel murder methods raised public calls for the police to expand the pool of profilers.According to the police’s data, 26 profilers work across the country as of this year. They have tackled more than 2,200 criminal cases from 2011 to September this year. As crime skills evolve, the police’s focus is also changing. The government, nowadays, is injecting efforts to preventing cybercrimes, which are increasing in the country. As of last year, Internet fraud topped cybercrimes with some 56,600 cases, followed by online financial fraud with 15,600 cases. The government launched an anti-cybercrime department last year. It also expanded the number of officers with expertise in digital forensic science, computer programming and engineering. “The investigation skills are evolving with the changing profile of crimes. Internet crimes are growing in Korea, which has a well-developed IT infrastructure.

Nearly 50 years after repeated and failed attempts to revise the law, lawmakers managed to add religious workers to the taxable list despite vehement opposition from South Korea’s big churches, one of the most influential voting groups in Korea’s conservative bloc. Korea is the only country that exempts religious leaders from taxation among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development members.  Members of the National Assembly attend a plenary session on Wednesday. (Yonhap)But the prospects of implementing the bill remain to be seen as the big church groups and religiously conservative lawmakers continue to oppose the tax scheme. Mindful of the opposition, lawmakers decided to implement the law from 2018, a year after the 2016 general elections and 2017 presidential election. They also decided to exempt religious organizations from taxation and provide them with wider tax benefits than given to average taxpayers. For example, a religious leader whose annual income is less than 400 million won ($344,000) can enjoy an 80 percent tax credit. Their spending on student loans, food expenses and travel costs are classified as nontaxable income. The tax rate ranges from 6 to 38 percent depending upon their income brackets. But some Korea’s big churches dismissed the legislation as a “premature” move that neglects to acknowledge that most churches are struggling to finance their organization during the economic downturn. “(The government) should make churches voluntarily pay their taxes, as opposed to enacting a law that forces churches to pay,” said the Christian Council of Korea, one of Korea’s biggest church associations, in a statement released Wednesday. While urging the government to forgo implementation, the CCK threatened to launch an “anti-campaign” during the 2017 general election against those lawmakers endorsing the move. In a vote during Thursday’s plenary session, 195 lawmakers approved the bill, while 20 opposed and 50 abstained. Faced with pressure, some lawmakers who enjoy popularity among Christian groups upped their opposition. The coalition of lawmakers from the ruling Saenuri Party and main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy voiced their concerns over the negative impacts of the taxation scheme. Highlighting that Korean Protestants were the main supporters of the Saenuri Party in the past elections, Rep. Lee Jae-oh, who also works as a deacon in his church, asserted that the government should push for implementation after his party wins the 2017 and 2018 elections. Other Saenuri Party members hinted at the possibility the administration who took power after 2018 would scrap the legislation. Rep. Kang Suk-hoon noted that the Assembly would revisit the bill unless the general public reaches consensus on the bill. Rep. Lee Seok-hyun of the NPAD, vice speaker of the Assembly, went as far as to say that “if we as religious people, try to impose taxes on money that we have given to Jesus and Buddha, how could we see their face after we die?”  According to a survey by local pollster Mono Research in November 2014, 75.3 percent of respondents said that the government should impose taxes on religious leaders. Since 1994, religious figures in Catholic churches have paid taxes. Buddhist temples and most Christian churches have agreed with the move. By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@koreaherald.com)","late wednesday passed legislation ,taxes on religious leaders ,south korea big churches ,korean government in 1948 ,wednesday passed legislation","['the National Assembly', 'south korean', 'South Korea ’s']",3,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.09998736 0.42279324 0.0850153 ],Yeo Jun-suk,Politics,12,2015,"thursday plenary session 195 lawmakers ,some korea big churches dismissed ,general election against those lawmakers ,assembly late wednesday passed legislation ,big churches dismissed the legislation","['the National Assembly', 'south korean', 'South Korea ’s', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'the National Assembly', 'Korea', 'the Christian Council of Korea', 'Korea', 'CCK', 'christian', 'Saenuri Party', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'korean', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Lee Jae - oh', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kang Suk - hoon', 'Assembly', 'Lee Seok - hyun', 'Assembly', 'Buddha', 'Mono Research', 'catholic', 'buddhist', 'christian', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",4,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.09998736 0.42279324 0.0850153 ]

The 37-year-old claimed he was seeking national interest as the conflict-ridden country has a lot of sales opportunities.The court, however, ruled that the damage he could have incurred by getting involved in a dangerous situation is much larger than the profits he would have brought to the country by selling local products. It also pointed out that the company's sales outcome does not have a direct relation to national interest.In 2007, 23 South Koreans were abducted by the Taliban while traveling unescorted in Afghanistan on a medical aid mission. Two male hostages were killed and the rest were freed after more than 40 days.

It brought together leaders from more than 140 countries, including U.S.President Barack Obama, as well as U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.The conference is set to run through Dec. 11 to try to produce a deal that will be applicable to all countries and seeks to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius.""The Paris conference is not the final destination. It is a new beginning,"" Park said. ""Let us rally together for a new climate regime.""Still, negotiations do not appear to be easy as some countries are at odds over funds needed to tackle climate change.Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed that a new climate deal must include a clause on financial assistance to developing countries by advanced countries and that advanced countries must keep their promise to create US$100 billion each year.A total of 184 countries -- which account for 94 percent of global emissions -- have put forward climate targets for post-2020.In June, South Korea offered to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 37 percent by 2030 from 850.6 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalents, an amount Seoul says it would reach if it lets business run as usual.Park vowed to spearhead efforts to cut carbon emissions through new energy industries and meet South Korea's climate target.South Korea's southern resort island of Jeju ""will transition into a carbon free island by replacing its entire fleet of cars with electric vehicles and meeting 100 percent of its energy needs through renewable energy sources,"" Park said.She also said net zero buildings will be mandated in phases and large plants will eventually be transformed into smart factories that harness information and communications technologies.""These efforts will enable us to unlock a new market in the neighborhood of US$100 billion by the year 2030 and generate some 500,000 jobs,"" Park said.She also vowed to join discussions to set up a global carbon market with enthusiasm, saying the market for carbon will ""no doubt play a critical role under the new climate regime.""Also Monday, Park called for collaboration among countries to help make clean energy widely affordable.""No single nation can, on its own, succeed in tackling climate change and innovating clean energy technology,"" Park said in the text of her speech posted on the website of Mission Innovation.""More countries should join Mission Innovation to share their technologies and conduct collaborative research in promising new fields,"" Park said. South Korea joined hands with the United States, China and 17 other countries in launching Mission Innovation to reinvigorate and accelerate public and private global clean energy innovation to make clean energy widely affordable.Park also called for financial assistance and technology transfer to developing countries to ensure the new climate regime takes off successfully.The participants of Mission Innovation said in a joint statement that they will seek to double its governmental and state-directed clean energy research and development investment over five years.

The administration of President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo has streamlined immigration procedures that allow travelers to stay up to 30 days without a visa and knocked down clearance approval for foreign yachts, giving them easy entry through 18 ports. In addition, the cabotage principles were abolished to provide international cruises with wider access to the country’s five harbors.  Indonesian embassy minister Cecep Herawan. Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldLast year, more than 370,000 Koreans traveled to Indonesia out of 15 million who went abroad, making Koreans the sixth-largest national group visiting Indonesia. Some 500,000 Koreans are expected to have traveled there by the end of this year, according to the Indonesian Tourism Ministry, which held a press conference in Seoul last Tuesday. “As Korean tourists prefer outdoor activities, they have flocked to Bali and Lombok on honeymoons, family trips and golf tours,” Indonesian embassy minister Cecep Herawan told journalists. Tourism generates 5 percent of Indonesia’s gross domestic product, employing over 10 million people. To entice over 10 million tourists this year and 20 million by 2019, the government has upgraded infrastructures, hospitality services and promotional programs.Korean golf lovers have increasingly visited the archipelago’s 140 golf courses, spectacularly nestled between beaches, mountains and townships, said Noviendi Makalam, the international marketing director at the tourism ministry.  Noviendi Makalam, the international marketing director at the tourism ministry. Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldBintan Resort Cakrawala group general manager Abdul Wahab said: “Most international travelers are familiar with Bali, but our Riau Islands could rival Bali in offering.” Bintan Island, part of the Riau Islands Province in western Indonesia, was developed 20 years ago. Only an hour from Singapore by high-speed boat, travelers can get the best of Singapore’s cosmopolitan culture and Bintan’s tranquil nature in a package covering the neighboring island of Batam. During weekdays, five ferry trips connect Singapore and Bintan, with 10 trips on weekends. Some 2 million people come to the Riau Islands from Singapore each year. Bintan also offers incentives for conferences and exhibition facilities. “If you are planning a wedding, do it in Bintan,” Wahab highlighted, adding that visitors will get a once-in-a-lifetime experience on the picturesque island. Wahab turned attention to the removed clearance approval for foreign yachts entering Indonesia, stressing that it would benefit the 700,000 expatriates in Singapore, including a large number of Koreans. In Bintan, visitors can enjoy diving, snorkeling, scuba diving and jet skiing, as well as ride elephants, go hiking, take in the sights from a small aircraft, tour ancient sites and relax in spas. Bintan has 15 hotels in operation and 20 under construction. Bintan Lagoon Resort has Ian-Baker Finch and Jack Nicklaus golf courses; Ria Bintan Club Med and Spa has 310 rooms and a 27-hole Gary Player golf course; and Laguna Bintan and Nirwana Gardens has hotels, spas, restaurants, villas and beach clubs. The Plaza Lagoi shopping center sells traditional handicrafts and food. Visitors come to Bintan by sea, but an airport is currently being constructed to be operational by mid-2018, offering direct flights to Korea. Indonesia has five international airports ― Soekarno-Hatta in Jakarta, Ngurah Rai in Bali, Kuala Namu in Medan, Juanda in Surabaya and Hang Nadim in Batam ― in addition to seaports across its string of islands.

This workplace drudgery has become fodder for popular dramas such as “Misaeng,” which last year on tvN satirized the “incomplete lives” of the country’s salaried men and women.According to a November report by the Bank of Korea, the employment quality of a Korean worker -- measuring stability, salary, work hours, personal development and industrial safety -- was below the average of the 27-member OECD, dragging down the country’s productivity and growth. Korean employees were also among the least motivated in the world, and the country suffered seriously from emigration, according to the World Talent Report 2015. With soaring household debt, downward investment, weak employment figures and a low birthrate, pundits have urged overhauling the nation’s entire framework. (From left) CICI president Choi Jung-wha, Singapore Ambassador Yip Wei Kiat, Google head of Chromecast and TV at Asia-Pacific Mickey Kim, the Turkish ambassador’s spouse Pinar Okcal, Ambassador Arslan Hakan Okcal and Kuwaiti Ambassador Jasem Albudaiwi pose at the Corea Image Communications Institute’s “Korea CQ Forum” at the Singaporean ambassador’s residence Tuesday. Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldAt the Corea Image Communications Institute’s “Korea CQ Forum” on Tuesday, Google executive Mickey Kim talked about his experience in Silicon Valley from 2007-13, illuminating a path for Korean companies. “An immeasurable gap exists between the company cultures of Korea and America,” Kim said at the Singaporean ambassador’s residence. “Silicon Valley being home to Google, Apple, Facebook, Twitter, HP, Intel, Oracle and Yahoo, there is something special about this place.”The southern San Francisco Bay Area is a mecca of high-tech research and development, accounting for one-third of all venture capital investments in the U.S. The cluster earned its name in the 1960s and ’70s from the silicon chip manufacturers located in the Santa Clara Valley.Kim argued that the Silicon Valley enterprises gave workers autonomy over their initiatives, unlike in Korea, where the companies define and drive their projects. “Whereas Korean workers are bound by their ‘face time,’” Kim noted, referring to the time expected in office, “nobody cared what time colleagues arrived and went home in Silicon Valley.” Employees managed their schedules and meetings flexibly using software, and freed themselves from “face time,” he said. “The idea was to give workers maximum freedom, but with complete responsibility.” Kim quipped: “Whereas Korean executives would stress, ‘A crisis is coming! We’re on the brink of a precipice! Let’s tighten our belts and work harder!’ Silicon Valley executives would say, ‘We’ve come this far and are moving toward this goal. Let’s seize these specific opportunities.’” Silicon Valley workers evaluated their performances quarterly, identifying their objectives and results, which were assessed by peers and managers.The evaluation classified workers as “meeting,” “exceeding” or “failing” expectations, weighing heavily on their salaries, bonuses and promotion prospects, Kim revealed. By “meeting” the goals, he or she could continue in their current position, but not be promoted. Those consistently “exceeding” them were fast-tracked up the hierarchy, contrary to Korea, where it has largely been based on seniority. The managers also exercised great authority over their associates and projects, and executives assisted them as “mentors.” “When visitors come to Silicon Valley they are most surprised by workers playing beach volleyball, swimming and lying on the grass during work hours,” Kim said. “But what they do not see is the coldhearted evaluation underneath.” California having large populations of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, workers were “sensitive” about the diversities of religion, gender, race, age and marital status, Kim asserted. Furthermore, networking occurred year-round, creating new partnerships and friendships; firms encouraged different ways of reaching objectives through slow and strenuous consultation. Members of the Corea Image Communications Institute’s “Korea CQ Forum” pose at the Singaporean ambassador’s residence Tuesday. Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldSingaporean Ambassador Yip Wei Kiat said that Singapore’s corporate culture was a mix of international best practices and traditional local operations, particularly among start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises.Many of the SMEs in logistics, transport, construction consulting, retail, food and beverages were homegrown, he explained, noting that Singapore had always relied on foreign talent and capital to compensate for its lack of natural resources. “Singaporean companies may not be as liberal as the Silicon Valley firms, but they are definitely one of the most open in Asia,” Yip said, adding that family-owned businesses still followed the “Asian” or “Confucian” ways of business.“Our philosophy has been to bring in the best from abroad and adapt it locally,” he highlighted. “Promotion based on meritocracy and strict performance evaluation are very much how Singapore works now, both in the private and public sectors.”Touching on the launch of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Community, which was inked during the 27th ASEAN Summit in Kuala Lumpur on Nov. 22, Yip said Korean companies could penetrate the Southeast Asian market from Singapore. As opposed to having separate bilateral arrangements, the envoy said, Korean enterprises could set up operations in different countries covering product development, resource extraction, production and distribution, in an integrated market of 600 million consumers. “Those companies that are unfamiliar with business practices in ASEAN can undertake experiments in Singapore,” Yip pointed out. “For example, a Korean cosmetics firm can tweak and localize its product to the region’s humid climate and unique customs.”The ambassador underscored that the embassy supported collaborations between the SMEs on both sides, helping identify partners and establish incubators before commercialization.

According to Statistics Korea, the suicide rate in Seoul stood at 24.7, meaning 24.7 Seoul residents in 100,000 committed suicide last year, as the nation’s average suicide rate was 27. By age group, Seoul citizens aged 60 or over had the highest suicide rates, with 50.3 seniors taking their own lives last year alone. The suicide rate for those aged 45 to 64 was the second highest at 31.9, followed by those aged 25 to 44 at 27.9 and those aged 15 to 24 at 10.4.Poverty among the elderly has been blamed for the growing rate of senior citizen suicide here. According to the Korea Labor Institute, 48.6 percent of the country’s elderly were living in poverty in 2014, defined as living off of 50 percent or less of median household income.Experts have also pointed out that the elderly who commit suicide mainly fall into two groups: those who do not want to burden their children with financial issues and those who grow estranged from their families as they get older.By district in Seoul, those living in Jungnang District, one of the poorest districts in Seoul by household income, saw the highest suicide rate at 35.7, while residents in Seocho District, one of the richest districts in Seoul, saw only 15.3 people in 100,000 having killed themselves last year.According to Seoul Metropolitan Government, Gangnam District was the richest among 25 districts in Seoul, collecting 104 billion won ($89.9 million) in income taxes, while Jungnang District raked in only 3.6 billion won. Statistics from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development indicate that Korea has one of the highest suicide rates among its 34 member countries, with 29.1 Koreans per 100,000 people taking their own lives, compared to the OECD average of 12.1.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","seoul suicide rate highest ,the highest suicide rate ,suicide rate in seoul ,100 000 committed suicide ,suicide rate highest among","['Seoul', 'Statistics Korea', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Seoul']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54735678  0.49536097

The ministry said the airlines will be required to more stringently check prospective pilots to make certain they have no criminal backgrounds and no history of mental illness.""All medical and mental records will be protected to ensure utmost privacy,"" it said. ""Airlines will make certain excessive work schedules of pilots do not affect performance and safety.""Companies will, moreover, be obliged to fully support psychological treatment of their pilots.The ministry said that despite initial opposition from pilot groups concerned about privacy issues, the differences were resolved through open dialogue that helped all sides to reach on understanding.The latest move is in reaction to the apparent suicide of the Germanwings co-pilot that resulted in the deaths of 150 people in March. The pilot is suspected of having deliberately flown his A321 jet into the French Alps.According to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, eight of the 2,758 aircraft crashes from 2003 through 2012 involved pilot suicide.

We are finally back to the supersonic age,"" he told reporters as he inspected the ""Golden Eagle"" jets.Gazmin has said the aircraft could serve as both trainers and fighters, and that among the areas they would be posted will be the western island of Palawan, the country's closest point to the South China Sea where the Philippines has a territorial dispute with China.China claims most of the South China Sea even up to the coastline of its neighbours. Other countries have conflicting claims and the Philippines has been the most vocal in opposing China despite its overwhelming military superiority.The cash-strapped Philippines, which is also battling internal communist and Muslim insurgencies, has long neglected external defence, relying on ageing ships and aircraft to patrol the disputed waters.It retired the last of its supersonic fighter jets, US-made F-5 Freedom Fighters, in 2005 due to their age and since then has relied on propeller-driven planes and the Italian-made S211.The S211s are intended for training new pilots and are not capable of supersonic flight. But the military has been forced to use them for other roles such as patrolling territory and conducting bombing missions on insurgents.However, as the country's economy improved, Philippine President Benigno Aquino has been upgrading the military, acquiring two surplus frigates from the United States and new aircraft from different sources.","philippines goes supersonic again ,supersonic again with korean ,return to supersonic fighter ,country return to supersonic ,philippines goes supersonic","['Philippines', 'AFP', 'Philippines', 'south Korean', 'China', 'Manila', 'Seoul', 'south korean']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.6554541   0.57138669

The World Talent Report 2015 by the Institute for Management Development said South Korea came in at 54th among 61 economies across the world in terms of its employees’ motivation at work. Asia’s fourth-largest economy also saw a serious outflow of local talents, landing at 18th among the surveyed economies in terms of human capital flight. According to a 2014 survey by the state-run Institute for International Trade of 320 local candidates and graduates for masters and doctorate degrees, 73.1 percent of them responded they would be willing to look for employment abroad, with 90 percent of them saying they would certainly take a job abroad if it were offered. Half of them cited their desire to acquire advanced knowledge and technology behind the decision, while 48.6 percent of them responded seeking higher salary and 37 percent pointed to the unstable job situation here. The majority took issue with the closed, stiff office culture and long work hours in Korea’s research and business environment. South Korea’s business environment appeared to be less friendly to foreign talents, sitting in the 37th spot in terms of drawing highly skilled foreign workers to the country. The data showed that the country’s senior managers lacked international experience and its employees had insufficient foreign language skills. According to 2013 government statistics, the number of Korean students overseas stood at 144,000, 2.5 times more than the number of foreign students in Korea. The least affected country by the brain drain was Norway, which was followed by Switzerland, Finland, Sweden and the United States. The Switzerland-based management institute conducted a survey of business executives from 61 economies, including both the China mainland and its special administrative region Hong Kong, asking them about their perception of competitiveness in each nation. In the overall ranking, South Korea stood at 31st this year, up nine notches from a year earlier, and its highest in a decade. Among the three main factors in the ranking, the country placed 32nd in both investment development and its appeal to highly skilled workers worldwide, while snatching 31st place in terms of readiness to accept talents. Looking into details, the country received high scores in terms of personal income tax (13th), growth rate in the labor force (ninth), health infrastructure (16th) and 15-year-olds’ academic performance in PISA tests (fourth). But it fared poorly in female labor force participation (47th), pupil-teacher ratios in primary and secondary education (26th and 28th, respectively), cost of living (56th) and quality of life (40th). Switzerland topped the list for nine years straight, with northern European countries ― Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway and the Netherlands ― rounding out the top five. The United States came in at 14th, with Japan’s ranking at 26th and China at 40th. Singapore was the highest ranked Asian country, taking the 10th spot. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","korea suffers lack of ,work asia fourth largest ,korea suffers ,drain survey south koreans ,korea suffers lack","['South Koreans', 'swiss', 'the World Talent Report', 'the Institute for Management Development', 'South Korea']",3,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.78292     0.3803058

The device turned on the exhaust gas recirculation system in the indoor test to fake the emissions levels and turned off the system in actual outdoor driving conditions, meaning excessive emissions were not detected, it said. This is the first time that Volkwagen’s emissions rigging has been officially confirmed outside the U.S. (AP-Yonhap)The ministry launched its own test last month to check whether six types of the diesel-engine Volkswagen vehicles sold here -- two Euro 5 cars and four Euro 6 vehicles -- met the emission standards in outdoor and indoor driving tests. “(The ministry) has not found the defeat device in the EA288 engine-equipped vehicles -- four Euro 6 cars and Golf Euro 5 -- for now, but further probe will be conducted for a final check,” a ministry official said. The ministry suspended the sales of unsold Volkswagen cars equipped with the same engine as the Tiguan Euro 5 and ordered a recall of 125,522 cars. It also imposed a penalty of 14.1 billion won ($12.3 million). The models subject to the recall order include the Tiguan and Beetle of Volkswagen and the Q6, Q3 and A4 of Audi. The German carmaker has also been told to submit its recall plan and antiemission measures to the government by Jan. 6. To encourage customers to return their cars, the ministry said it would distribute stickers to be attached to vehicles that have completed the recall procedure to remind those who have yet to bring their cars in. Specific plans on how to fix the vehicles have yet to be decided.The environmental authorities said the global carmaker appears to have rigged the emissions to reduce the car production cost amid toughened emissions regulations. Controlling emissions requires more advanced technology that raises costs, they said. The ministry vowed to expand the probe to 16 other carmakers that sell diesel vehicles. They include Hyundai Motor, Kia Motors, GM Korea, Renault Samsung Motors Co., Ssangyong Motor, BMW, Mercedes-Benz Korea, Porsche, Jaguar Land Rover Korea, Volvo, Peugeot, FCA Korea, Ford, FMK and Nissan.The upcoming probe will also cover models of 3,000 cubic centimeters, it said. The ministry also announced that it would introduce an outdoor emissions test for all vehicles starting next year as part of its efforts to prevent emissions rigging. Vehicles weighing over 3.5 tons will be covered by the test starting from January and those under 3.5 tons from September 2017. Vehicles that fail to pass the outdoor emissions test will be taken off the market. Based on the Environment Ministry’s test results, the Transport Ministry will carry out three rounds of tests to look into whether the emissions rigging affected the fuel efficiency and safety of passengers, officials said. The Environment Ministry’s probe results will likely lead to more lawsuits against Volkswagen. The Korean brand of the German carmaker is currently facing a class-action lawsuit filed by over 2,000 customers who are seeking to nullify the purchase contracts and receive refunds. Law firm Barun, which is leading the collective lawsuit, has officially requested the carmaker provide vouchers worth $1,000 for each Korean customer just as it promised American customers. Volkswagen, however, has not yet responded, the law firm said. Last week, a Korean civic group also sued Volkswagen Korea CEO Thomas Kuehl for allegedly taking financial advantage by violating rules, causing environment problems and harming public health. This is the first time that a third party -- other than the automaker’s customers -- has filed a lawsuit against Volkswagen. By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","emissions rigging suspends sales ,cars sold in korea ,thursday confirmed that volkswagen ,volkswagen used software to ,sales the government thursday","['Volkswagen', 'Korea', 'the Environment Ministry', 'EA189']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.75750679  0.6237011

The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles shedding light on refugees in Korea, their hardships, the systematic fallout, the country’s own history and ways to go forward. The following is the fifth installment. ― Ed.Until asylum seeker Samuel (not his real name) spent several grueling months at the airport in South Korea, he was hopeful that the country would be at the forefront of protecting human rights and accept people like him with open arms. But his hopes were quickly squashed when he was left to languish at the airport’s deportation room in February after being denied asylum and entry into the country at Incheon International Airport.“I would have never come to Korea if I knew the county would treat asylum seekers like this. Does United Nations’ Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon really come from this country?” asked Samuel in his 20s. (Yonhap)He fled his homeland in West Africa due to religious persecution and described the conditions inside the deportation room located at one of the world’s best airports as “ironically worse than a prison cell.” “In the deportation room, lights are always on. We sleep on the wooden tables. We are provided with a blanket and mattress, but airport security guards take them away at 6 a.m. every morning. It is impossible to sleep there,” said Samuel, who spent eight months at the facility located in the international transit zone. “I was offered two small rolls of bread and soda for every meal. There was a toilet inside, but no toothpaste. My friend even used soap to brush his teeth,” he went on. “There was not enough heating or air-conditioning. I felt cold because I am from a warm country.” “When I complained or asked questions, the security guards shouted and swore at me. I was told to go back to my country several times. They treated me so badly,” he said.Hailed by the international community, the Seoul government enacted the Refugee Act in 2013 to guarantee humanitarian protection for asylum seekers. But testimonies about the conditions at deportation and detention facilities appear to lay bare the long road ahead for the country to live up to global standards. Under the new refugee law, all asylum seekers are allowed to apply for refugee status at the port of entry, unlike in the past when those arriving without a legitimate visa were simply repatriated to their countries of origin.The immigration office is supposed to decide within seven days whether to refer asylum seekers to the official refugee application procedures. During this period, they are housed at state-run facilities where relatively proper bedding and meals are offered.  Deportees sit or sleep on a makeshift platform at the deportation room inside Incheon International Airport. (NANCEN)But Samuel was refused his right to claim refugee status in Korea and faced a deportation order, with the immigration office claiming that he had no “clear reason” to seek asylum. Samuel was then transferred to the deportation room at the airport, where he filed a suit with the nation’s administrative court to fight the immigration office’s decision, with the help of refugee advocate organization NANCEN.While waiting for the result, he had no choice but to live at the facility designed only for a short-term stay. “If I didn’t have problems back home, I would have never stayed in the hell-like place for a single second. No one can stay that long under such appalling conditions.” Samuel said. “But I couldn’t go back. I would have been killed.”An official from the Justice Ministry told The Korea Herald that the room is equipped with things needed for basic living, dismissing Samuel’s claims as “untrue.” But it has refused to allow access to the media, citing “security reasons.” The Justice Ministry also said that no one was forced to stay at the facility. “We keep it open to anyone who wishes to come in and stay. They can leave the facility and return freely,” said a spokesperson for the ministry.Yet, Kim Yeon-joo, a human rights lawyer and NANCEN activist representing Samuel, called the deportation room “a de facto detention center,” given the asylum seekers have nowhere else to stay.Some of the long-term residents there reportedly fell ill due to sleep deprivation, poor quality of food and lack of sanitation, but they had no access to medicine. “Without any access to legal counsel or the outside world, the lives of the asylum seekers at the deportation facility are in the hands of airport security guards,” the lawyer Kim said. “But their illnesses are ignored until they show visible symptoms like seizures.” Such human rights violations shed light on the legal limbo in which asylum seekers are being kicked around by the government and airlines who seek to shift responsibility onto each other for the unexpected long-term residents.  A roll of bread and can of soda provided for a meal at the deportation room inside Incheon International Airport. (NANCEN)Under the Convention on International Civil Aviation, airlines that flew the deportees without properly checking documents should cover the costs of looking after them until they return to their countries. The Korean immigration law, meanwhile, stipulates that all deportees should be the responsibility of the Airport Operators Committee, a group of airlines managing and operating the deportation room.An airport official told The Korea Herald on condition of anonymity that the company is baffled by the rising number of those staying at the deportation room for a long time and tries to return them to their countries as soon as possible. “But the asylum seekers stuck in the deportation room should also be protected by the government within the legal framework,” Kim said. “It should be the government’s responsibility, not the companies, to take care of them.” Samuel finally stepped onto Korean soil in October ― the government considers the security zone of the airport to have a different status ― after the court ruled in his favor, saying the immigration office had no authority to decide whether to begin the process of refugee application. It also added that the decision to deprive asylum seekers of the chance to claim asylum should only be made in exceptional cases. Refugee rights activists here have accused the immigration office of abusing its authority to bar asylum seekers from pursuing their rights to apply and thus violating the international refugee law.The international refugee law stipulates the principle of non-refoulement, advising the member nations not to deport any asylum seeker who fears persecution back home. From January to June this year, only 38 percent of those seeking asylum at the port of entry were accepted into Korea and referred to the refugee determination procedures, according to data obtained by NANCEN. Kim pointed out that the Justice Ministry has been quite defensive in implementing the refugee law out of concern that it might prompt a mass inflow of migrants.“But once the government joined the international drive to take in refugees, it should help asylum seekers pursue their rights,” Kim said.In its defense, the Justice Ministry has underscored the importance of distinguishing those who can pose a threat to the national security from “real” asylum seekers. It said potential terrorists could enter in the guise of asylum seekers.“If we accept everyone into the country because they applied for asylum at the airport, we have no way to deny those who are not supposed to be in the country. So we are running the prescreening process to keep them out,” the ministry official said.Refugee activists in unison voiced concerns for incoming asylum seekers, following the deadly terrorist attacks in Paris on Nov. 13 that led to the government vowing to tighten immigration controls.“We think it could further lower the chances for asylum seekers at the airport to be referred to the application process,” Kim said. A Kashmiri man, who wanted to be only identified as Musa, experienced similar human rights violations at the immigration detention center in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province.Musa, a 33-year-old former politician fighting for independence of Kashmir, was handcuffed and transported to the detention center in late 2013 after being caught traveling to South Korea on a forged passport. Campaigning for the independence of Kashmir ― a flashpoint between India and Pakistan for more than six decades ― he claims he had to buy a passport from a Pakistani broker to escape political persecution. “I was not a criminal, but an asylum seeker. But I was locked in the detention center the whole time. In Korea, applying for asylum is a crime,” Musa told The Korea Herald. Since the enforcement of the Refugee Act, asylum seekers can apply for refugee status at detention centers, too. While the application process is underway ― which takes up to three years ― asylum seekers are taken into custody at the detention center without knowing when they will be released. “Prison would be better than the detention center. At least, criminals know how long they will stay there, but we just have to wait endlessly,” said Musa, who spent one year and seven months there.“We cannot go outside, move around and exercise. We cannot use the Internet or read newspapers,” said the man, who was detained with 16 people in a small room with iron bars. “The only way to connect to the outside world is to use a pay phone inside the room.” The detainees are taken outside the detention rooms only twice a week for 20 minutes each while immigration officers search their rooms. “But when I tried playing with a ball during the so-called exercise session, I was stopped,” Musa said. “We wake up early in the morning and spend all day just sitting in the prison cell,” he went on. “Some detainees fall mentally ill and attempt suicide.”A month after he was detained, he started to write a petition to the head of the detention center, asking for access to international news channels, the Internet and proper food. He even went on a hunger strike on multiple occasions, for as long as 57 days. But whenever Musa stood up for his rights, he was isolated in a separate room. “Without the right to access information and legal counsel, it is impossible to prepare myself to defend my case. Then, I become more likely to be rejected refugee status,” said Musa, who has been temporarily released from the detention center for health reasons. One can be released for medical treatment but the process to prove the illness is gruesome and costly. Therefore, Musa’s case is extremely rare, according to sources.The situation for Muslims could be even worse as they can only eat halal food processed according to Islamic law. A 30-something Bangladeshi detainee, who wanted to be identified as Amin and has been held for two months now, said that he now lives on kimchi (Korean cabbage dish), rice and water. “I spend all day doing nothing but praying,” Amin told The Korea Herald. “I just want to get out of here, pack my things and go to another country to find shelter.”Kim Jong-chul, a human rights lawyer for Advocate for Public Interest Law, addressed the need for the revised law to limit the length of stay of foreign detainees at the center. Currently, there are no legal clauses stipulating how long detention centers can house foreigners.“The detention center is to detain deportees only for a short term. It is not a place for people to stay for a long time. So life inside the center could be very distressful,” Kim, who began representing asylum seekers in 2007, told the Korea Herald. “There should be legal guidelines to limit how long foreign detainees can stay at the detention facilities,” he said. “Also, the ministry should speed up the lengthy refugee-screening process for asylum seekers being detained.” The Justice Ministry said, for its part, that it had its own difficulties in processing the growing number of refugee applications and foreign nationals trying to enter the country due to lack of staff members and budget. “There are certain people who illegally reside in Korea, get caught by immigration officers and all of a sudden apply for refugee status when they face deportation,” said Kim Young-jun, the head of the immigration office, citing the possibility that asylum seekers are abusing the system to extend their stay in Korea. “While the number of incoming and outgoing passengers has soared, the number of immigration officers dealing with border controls and refugee applications remains the same,” he added. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","on refugees in korea ,refugees in korea their ,refugees in korea ,in korea their hardships ,seekers in south korea","['South Korea', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea']",3,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.57168633  0.25026447

They deserve to be validated as pioneers in the history of Korea’s women, the Korean Nurses Association said.At least 33 female nurses and midwives fought for Korea’s independence at home and abroad from 1907 to 1945, according to the association. But only 13 of them have been awarded the Order of Merit for their works. The group cited a study organized by professor Kang Young-sim at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. According to Kang’s research, some 3 million Koreans, including nurses, worked as independence activists during the colonial era. However, only 13,000 of them have been recognized by the Korean government as people of national merit. Among them, only 241 are women.   Korea`s first nurses Kim Martha (right) and Lee Grace (Korean Nurses Association)In her research, Kang summarizes the lives of two nurses, who devoted their lives to independence activism after working as nurses. One of them is Park Ja-hye (1895-1943), who became a nurse after spending the first 10 years of her life as a child maid in the royal palace. She decided to become an independence activist after treating many patients who were injured while participating in the March 1st Movement, one of the earliest public displays of Korean resistance against the Japanese rule in 1919.To become more involved, she moved to Beijing, where she met her future husband and fellow independence activist Shin Chae-ho. After marrying Shin and giving birth to their first child, Park was forced to move back to Korea alone, as the couple was financially struggling. She was pregnant with her second child at the time. In Korea, she supported her husband’s activism in China, while fighting poverty and raising her two children alone. Shin died in 1936 while serving time in prison in Korea. In the same year, Park’s second child, who was 14 at the time, also died. Park died in 1943, two years before Korea was liberated.The other nurse described in professor Kang’s study is Jeong Jong-myeong, who was forced to quit her studies and get married at age 17 because of poverty and was widowed at age 19. Instead of living with and serving her in-laws, which was the norm for Korean widows at the time, she chose to become a midwife and became involved in the nation’s independence movement.In 1927, she established a women’s rights group called Geunwoohoe, which also functioned as an independence activism group. As a member, she also wrote for an independence magazine and gave speeches on women, labor and poverty.Since 2008, the KNA has been researching prominent Korean female nurses in history, especially those who also worked as independence fighters and those who were sent overseas, such as to Germany, during South Korea’s rapid economic development in the 1960s and ’70s. It’s also been also demanding the government build a special museum dedicated to the history of Korea’s women. The National Assembly approved the notion in 2013 and the current National Women’s History Exhibition Hall is scheduled to be renovated into a museum.Kim Ok-soo, director of the Korean Nurses Association, said learning about the history of Korean nurses resonates with today’s women.“During the colonial rule, almost all Korean women lacked access to education and were therefore illiterate,” she said. “They were not allowed to make their own life decisions. “But many of the nurses went against the social norms in spite of their class status and gender. They were the very first Korean women who voluntarily chose to have a specialized career that required very specific skills and training, while fighting for Korean independence.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","midwives fought for korea ,more korean nurses ,women the korean nurses ,more korean nurses should ,korean nurses","['South Korea ’s', 'japanese', 'Korea', 'the Korean Nurses Association', 'Korea']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63861328  0.60609663

Despite rapid changes, education has been criticized for failing to foster the talent that can most effectively contribute to society.Steven K. Lee, the newly appointed president of George Mason Korea, says higher education institutes need to be at the forefront in leading society, rather than taking a backseat, by providing a network through which students can accumulate invaluable experience that better prepares them for the challenges of the real world. “There has to be an interactive process in cooperation between colleges and government agencies,” he said. “I think it’s high time now that education take the lead and say we have highly prepared students in certain fields so the companies and government agencies make policies based on what is available: the (human) resources.” Steven K. Lee, the president of George Mason University Korea, speaks during his inauguration ceremony at the Incheon Global Campus concert hall Thursday. (eorge Mason University Korea)George Mason Korea takes advantage of being located in Songdo, Incheon, where offices of various international companies and global bodies reside. The university expanded to Korea in March 2014 at Incheon Global Campus, where three other foreign universities ― State University of New York, the University of Utah and Ghent University ― have set up Korean campuses. But the most distinct merit of Mason Korea, Lee pointed out, is that Korean students can access the U.S. curriculum without leaving the country. Because of this, students can maintain a connection with the local community and do not have to readjust to Korean culture when they graduate, as students who study abroad do.“Adjusting to (the culture of) Korea-based companies is pretty tough. We (as a university) are in a position where students are able to become fully bilingual and bicultural,” he said.By taking on a more active role ― instead of maintaining a passive approach ― Lee said students are able to make the jump from the classroom to contributing to society with greater ease. Lee, a U.S.-educated scholar who replaced interim chief Joy Hughes as the institute’s head, said that George Mason Korea is implementing various efforts to ensure students receive such a boost on campus, one of the key words being “experience.”“The traditional method of education is academic, test-centered and goal-oriented,” he said. While such experience encompasses cognitive and intellectual learning in the classroom, education must also provide experience outside the classroom, namely engaging in societal and community services, he said. “I want the students to fully utilize the time they have in college so that they are well prepared not only intellectually, but psychologically and mentally as well.”The mental preparation of students centers on what Lee called the “three C’s”: confidence, competency in discipline or profession and compassion for humanity. “I think it begins with confidence in oneself. Once you have that confidence, you can grow from that confidence to go and care for the world,” he said. Once one has sustained a certain level of confidence, along with competence in his or her respective field, then the student can become passionate about humanity, he explained. In a bid to provide experience that aids in fostering such values, Lee said George Mason Korea encourages students to engage in internship opportunities available to students of all grades via multiple memorandums of understanding with major organizations. These institutions include multinational organizations like the World Bank, the United Nations, Green Climate Fund, local firms like Kookmin Bank and education institutions like Chadwick International.“Being a college is an opportunity for us to network with the society. We cannot exist in isolation. We have to be able to blend in with people of organizations around us,” he said.George Mason Korea currently runs economics, management and global affairs programs, and plans to add conflict analysis and resolution, accounting and finance, system management and other courses in the near future. As much as activities outside the classroom matter, learning opportunities provided inside the classroom matter in students’ development, Lee stressed. “One of the key attractions and resources for GMU as a system is innovation. GMU Korea is no exception,” he said, explaining the university is set to move into a new seven-story building to be completed by the end of this year. The central theme of the structure would be to provide classroom experience rooted in integrated technology. The technology installed in the classrooms ― which the new president boasts the university has invested more effort in than any other part of the school ― will open doors to interactive lessons with not only students and lecturers at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, but also with partners across the globe.Just as it is important for schools to procure technology for smart education, having the proper lesson plans conducted via technology is crucial to achieving smart education, Lee said. “Having the perfect platform is one, how you use technology is equally as important. After all, learning is about human experience,” he said. “Beyond what, it is how.”But as George Mason Korea ventures into all the opportunities rolled out by the state-of-the-art technology, Lee stressed that the university has to be discreet about planning. This is to ensure that the new education methods do not become mere fads that fade into obscurity after a few years, but are established into long-term strategies. The key to achieving this, he said, is to recognize diversity in what students seek to accomplish via education, and cater to their respective needs by utilizing different methods of teaching.Lee claimed that the merit of George Mason Korea is not confined to the curriculum and faculty ― more than 50 percent of whom are from the Fairfax campus ― but also in the student body itself. “We have students from more than 20 different countries, based on where they attended secondary school. Global diversity in the classroom is a value that cannot be bought,” he said. Earlier this year, a local lawmaker complained that foreign education institutes in Korea have too many Korean students. Lee, however, pointed out that contrary to what the students’ lineage may suggest, most of the students at his university, even Koreans, have global backgrounds, contributing to diversity.“We live in a global world now. Many of us are more bicultural,” he said. “More individuals who are described by the experience, not by the origin of birth.”The diversity in its classrooms is the edge George Mason Korea has over even some of the prestigious colleges and universities, he said. “U.S. universities expect students to perform in an American way. We don’t bring that attitude here. When students come here, they are able to be supported by diversity.” The institution’s goal now, Lee said, is to utilize the unique position it has as a Korea-based U.S. university. “We are classified as American institution, but how we practice it has Korean elements. Our existence here is to balance the best practices of Korean education and American education, because no country’s education is perfect,” he said.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","korea says higher education ,rapid changes education ,bigger role for colleges ,korea head sees bigger ,newly appointed president","['Steven K.

Moreover, the book describes the United States as an ""enemy of Japan"" for using the term ""sex slaves"" to describe the atrocity.  Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mainly from Korea, which was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. But Japan has long attempted to water down and deny responsibility for the atrocity.  The sexual slavery issue has been the biggest thorn in frayed relations between Japan and South Korea, with Seoul demanding Tokyo take steps to address the grievances of elderly Korean victims of the atrocity and Japan refusing to do so.  Early this month, South Korean President Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe held the first summit talks between the two countries in more than three years and agreed to accelerate negotiations to resolve the issue.

President Park Geun-hye (right, back row) talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (left, back row) as they stand for a photo session at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Manila, the Philippines, Thursday. (Yonhap)Citing a Tokyo official, the Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun reported that Abe made the demand during his first-ever bilateral summit with South Korean President Park Geun-hye at Cheong Wa Dae on Nov. 2.Seoul’s Foreign Ministry said the report was “different from the truth.”“We would like to refrain from divulging the content of the summit,” ministry spokesperson Cho June-hyuck told reporters. “We express regrets over the fact that there have been reports from Japan that are not true or distorted.” According to the report, Abe called for the removal of the statue in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul and reiterated that the issue of the Korean victims -- euphemistically called comfort women -- has already been settled through the 1965 treaty that normalized bilateral ties.The report also said that Tokyo is considering establishing a follow-up to the botched Asian Women’s Fund that Japan set up in 1995 for Asian victims, many of whom were Korean. It has also considered sending a letter from the prime minister to each of the victims, the report said. The civilian-financed Asian Women’s Fund failed, as it was intended to show that Japan was taking “moral responsibility” for the past atrocity. It was dissolved as the victims called for “legal” reparations and apologies, not just financial compensation.The statue, also known as “Peace Statue,” was set up in December 2011 by civic groups including the “Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan.” The monument has been installed to highlight demands for Japan’s sincere apology and adequate compensation for the victims.Since April 2014, the two sides have held 10 rounds of director-general-level talks on the comfort women issue. But no significant progress has yet been reported. Japan has maintained the issue was already settled under the 1965 treaty. Article II of the treaty states the problem concerning property, rights and interests of the two contracting parties and their nationals has been settled “completely and finally.”However, Seoul claims the issue was not on the agenda for the negotiations over the treaty at the time, given it was only in the 1990s that victims and civil society began raising the issue. It also claims it is a wartime human rights issue that should be dealt with separately from the treaty.During the latest round of negotiations over the issue last Wednesday, the two sides failed to bridge their differences and decided to hold another round of talks “at an early date” in line with their leaders’ agreement to accelerate the negotiations over the issue.There are 47 known surviving Korean victims, who are an average of 89.2 years old.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","report thursday president park ,abe demanded seoul remove ,japan wartime sexual slavery ,news report thursday president ,seoul remove comfort woman","['japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'korean', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Park Geun - hye', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe']",3,"[ 0.          1.          2.         ... -0.38027546  0.71123284

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s willingness to play a constructive role on the Korean Peninsula situation, “including traveling there,” his spokesman said Wednesday.The remark by U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric was seen as a de-facto acknowledgment that talks are underway to set up what would be Ban’s first visit to North Korea, though the spokesman did not elaborate on those “discussions.”“The secretary-general has always expressed his willingness to play a constructive role on the situation of the Korean Peninsula, including traveling there, and discussions are ongoing,” the spokesman said at a regular press briefing.Dujarric, however, dismissed Xinhua news agency’s report that Ban is scheduled to visit the North next week.“Unless something is announced from this podium by myself or anybody else from my office who briefs or obviously by the secretary-general, the rest is pure speculation,” he said.Yonhap News Agency first reported earlier this week that Ban was planning to visit Pyongyang for a possible meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. China’s Xinhua reported Tuesday, citing information from the North’s official KCNA news agency, that Ban would arrive in the capital city next Monday and stay there for around four days. Ban’s office immediately rejected the report, saying Ban was tied up all week next week.A high-level U.N. source told Yonhap it was true that Ban was seeking to visit North Korea, and multiple “dates” are currently being discussed. One of those candidate dates was Nov. 23, which Xinhua reported, but that date was not chosen due to a scheduling conflict, the source said.The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also denied speculation that opposition from some U.N. member states may be affecting Ban’s trip, stressing that it’s purely a matter of coordinating schedules.Should Ban’s trip be realized, he will be the third U.N. secretary-general to visit North Korea after Kurt Waldheim in 1979 and Boutros Boutros-Ghali in 1993. Both Waldheim and Boutros-Ghali met with North Korea’s founding leader, Kim Il-sung, during their visits to Pyongyang.Ban, a former South Korean foreign minister, has repeatedly said that he will do everything possible to promote inter-Korean reconciliation and a resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue.In May, Ban planned to visit the North Korean border city of Gaeseong, where South Korea runs an industrial complex, but the trip was called off at the last minute because Pyongyang abruptly withdrew its invitation without giving a clear reason.","ban planning korea trip ,planning korea trip new ,korea trip new york ,planning korea trip ,his spokesman said wednesday","['NEW YORK', 'U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon ’s', 'Korean', 'U.N.', 'Stephane Dujarric', 'Ban ’s', 'North Korea']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.05453736  0.74597085

The ""caution"" level entails tougher measures against possible terror attacks, such as the stricter management of dangerous substances which can be used by wrongful hands and tighter security on the country's major public facilities and key systems, among others.The issuance of the stronger advisory came out of fear that South Korea could be a target of terrorists as the Islamic State pointed to the Asian country as one of ""the crusader coalition.""  ""No immediate signs of terror attack has been detected here, but the government feels the need to take precautionary measures,"" an official of the Ministry of Public Safety and Security said.

Kim Sung-ju of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, 476 Koreans who participated in such trials experienced adverse effects. Among them, 376 had to be hospitalized for treatment. Seven of them fell in critical condition but survived, while 49 died from the side effects.The report came out about three months after South Korea’s Health Ministry announced its plan in August to boost its clinical trials industry, to attract multinational clinical research organizations, as well as pharmaceutical and medical device companies to initiate their trials and partnerships here. 123RFAs of last year, South Korea ranked seventh in the world in the number of clinical trials conducted, making up 3.12 percent of all trials worldwide. The government aims to rank No. 5 by 2020. Back in 2007, the country ranked 19th in the world. By city, Seoul ranked first in the world in 2013, followed by New York and Houston. A total of 1.04 percent of all clinical trials in the world were conducted in Seoul that year. The city is a popular destination for multinational pharmaceutical companies, such as GSK, for its research infrastructure and government support for clinical trials. Last year, the Korean government approved a total of 652 clinical trials, 607 in 2013, 670 in 2012 and 503 in 2011. Chae Jin-byung, a 24-year-old university student, participated in his first paid clinical trial back in 2012. He had to stay as an inpatient at a hospital, taking drugs for high blood pressure three times a day for two days. For that, he was paid about 400,000 won ($341). “I was busy with extra-curricular activities and my schoolwork,” he told The Korea Herald. “There was an emergency and I needed cash immediately. Taking part in clinical trials seemed like a great option. I’d earn about 50,000 won a day by doing other part-time jobs, such as handing out flyers.”Since then, Chae has participated in such trials two more times. One was for drugs for benign prostatic hyperplasia, and the other for steroids. Although he did not experience any adverse effects during and after his hospital stays, he doesn’t remember being informed about potential risks of the trials, either. “I was simply told that since these drug aren’t ‘completely’ new, nothing is going to go wrong,” he said.Dr. Jeong Hyung-joon, the director of the Association of Physicians for Humanism, claimed that the government plans to deregulate the industry by sharing the personal information of participants in paid trials with pharmaceutical companies. “This is inhumane,” he said through PSPD.  “Many of those who participate in such trials are those with low income. Many do it without adequate information.”According to PSPD’s research, which surveyed 1,187 young Koreans in their 20s, 16.3 percent of them have engaged in dangerous part-time jobs, such as multi-level marketing, voice phishing and clinical trials. Among them, 35.8 percent they did it because they needed money urgently, while 26.4 percent said it was an easier and faster way to make money. Meanwhile, 18.1 percent said they did it to pay off their university tuition as soon as possible. “The government should do more to inform the public about possible adverse effects instead of promoting them as if nothing can ever go wrong,” said Jeong. University student Chae said he had been encouraging his friends to participate in trials to make easy money. “But after listening to what PSPD found, I don’t think I’ll ever do it again,” he said.

The Mahayana school of Korea’s Buddhism ― one of two main branches alongside the Hinayana school ― was introduced to the ancient Kingdom of Baekje (B.C. 18-A.D. 660) in 384 by monk Maranatha, native of Gandhara, the historical records say. The triangular tract largely to the west of the Indus River and bounded to the north by the Hindukush Mountains includes the Peshawar Valley, Taxila, Swat, Dir, Buner and Bajaur. In ancient times, it was a religious melting pot of Buddhism, Jainism, Zoroastrianism and Hinduism, whose coexistence was encapsulated in coins, sculptures and paintings. From left: Pakistani Embassy secretary Anna Kim, Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation managing director Kabir Ahmad Khan and Pakistani Ambassador Zahid Nasrullah Khan speak at a press conference on Nov. 9 to promote the Gandhara Civilization. Joel Lee/The Korea HeraldIn an effort to showcase the region’s trove of treasures, the Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation and the Tourism Ministry will hold the International Celebrations on Gandhara Civilization and Buddha Heritage in March next year. Buddhist monks, scholars, followers and journalists from Korea, Japan, China, Myanmar, Nepal, Bhutan and Thailand will tour the holy sites in Taxila, Swat and Northern Areas.To help promote the event in Korea, the Pakistani embassy organized a press conference on Nov. 9 that invited the country’s Buddhist communities, media and academia. Monk Jukgyeong of the Bonginsa Temple in Namyangju City, Gyeonggi Province, who visited the region in October 2014, recalled his experience. “What I saw was the mankind’s first ‘fusion culture,’” he told the participants. “It was apparent that Gandhara combined different civilizations’ ideologies, cultures and arts to a great degree, as I saw in one artwork the Greek mythological hero Hercules being portrayed as one of the Four Heavenly Kings of Buddhism.”(From left) Monk Jukgyeong of the Bonginsa Temple, Pakistani Ambassador Zahid Nasrullah Khan and the National Buddhist Council for the Security of Korea president Lee Gun-ho. Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldHistorians claim that the invasion of regional center Taxila by Macedonian King Alexander the Great in B.C. 326 led to the marriage of Hellenic and Buddhist cultures, which gave birth to the Greco-Buddhist art and the Mahayana Buddhist religion. Under the Indo-Greeks and the Kushans, the hybridized culture connecting the Occident and the Orient flourished in Gandhara before spreading southward to India, according to researchers. The Greco-Buddhist art also advanced northward to Central Asia, strongly influencing the art of the Tarim Basin, before reaching China, Korea and Japan.As an example, scholars claim UNESCO World Heritage List item Seokguram Grotto, which is part of Bulguksa Temple in Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province, is inspired by Gandharan art. Some highlight similarities between Korea’s gilt-bronze “Pensive Maitreya Bodhisattva in Meditation” and bronze statue “The Thinker” by French sculptor Auguste Rodin (1840-1917). Both works show men immersed in contemplation with their right arms resting on their knees ― the posture that harks back to Gandhara’s Bodhisattva sculptures.A diagram showing similar Buddhist sculptures by Professor Park Kyo-soon of Fatima Jinnah Women University in Rawalpindi, Pakistan.“Gandhara is a wellspring of research for soul-searching,” Jukgyeong said. “It is my hope that we see through these objects of art Buddha’s message: the love of humanity over divinity.” Mahayana Buddhism is today the world’s largest denomination with more than half of practitioners in Korea, Japan, China, Vietnam, Tibet, Malaysia, Mongolia, Bangladesh and other countries. Meaning “the Great Vehicle,” the school’s central tenet aspires to carry humanity from disorientation to enlightenment through learning.The region’s noted remnants include the first written manuscripts of Buddha’s teachings; Buddhist learning centers for Chinese pilgrims, monks and scholars; the Yogacara school, which trains the mind and consciousness; and the world’s oldest university in Taxila, dating back over 2,700 years.To this day, timeworn stupas, shrines and courtyards stand to represent the holy land of Buddhism. In particular, the familiar image of Buddha ― with his gracious facial expression, hair tied in a bun and body wrapped in monastic robes ― is unearthed.As an offshoot, the Bodhisattva sculpture, capturing Buddha’s exuberant youth before enlightenment, clads the holy figurine in lavish jewelry, headwear, loincloths and sandals, contrasted with the austere portraits of his post-metamorphosis state. Monk Jukgyeong of the Bonginsa Temple (center). Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldProfessor Park Kyo-soon of Fatima Jinnah Women University in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, said: “Korea’s underlying heritage comes from Buddhism, which comes from Gandhara. In today’s localized world, Gandhara can be a lynchpin for globalizing our culture and Buddhism.” Citing unmistakable resemblances in artifacts, dresses and folk melodies between Gandhara and Korea, Park stressed that the region could serve as an alternative channel for understanding Korea’s far-flung origins. Pakistani Ambassador Zahid Nasrullah Khan said: “We want to build cultural bridges with the Korean people. We want to inform our Korean friends that we have similar cultures, and also thrive on our diversities.”He added, “Seeing is believing. You must visit Pakistan to experience our warmth, friendliness and hospitality.” Aside from the religious treasures, the region boasts a wealth of ecotourism assets, including countless mountain peaks over 7,000 meters, glaciers, valleys, lakes, deserts, rivers and beaches. Some 100 Korean climbers visit the rocky mountains of northern Pakistan annually, and more than 500 Korean businesspeople work in the country.

65,65,North Korean workers abroad ordered not to meet foreigners: RFA,"North Korean workers abroad have been ordered to stay put and not contact any foreigners in an apparent effort by the North Korean government to stave off their defections, the U.S.-based Radio Free Asia reported Sunday.""The North Korean government has ordered workers dispatched overseas and employees residing abroad not to leave their assigned workplaces and residences, as well as not directly contacting foreigners ...","North Korean workers abroad have been ordered to stay put and not contact any foreigners in an apparent effort by the North Korean government to stave off their defections, the U.S.-based Radio Free Asia reported Sunday.""The North Korean government has ordered workers dispatched overseas and employees residing abroad not to leave their assigned workplaces and residences, as well as not directly contacting foreigners other than the locals,"" the RFA said in its recent report, citing North Korean sources.The North Korean government is keeping especially keen watch on its workers in China and Southeast Asian countries, whom the country dispatched for the national task of earning dollars.The workers in the regions were told, through North Korean Embassies there, not to contact South Koreans, as well as Americans and other Westerners, according to the RFA report. The recent government order appears to be aimed at tightening the government's control of North Korean workers living overseas amid a growth of defections, as well as the recently reported abduction of a North Korean doctor in Libya. Earlier this year, North Korean sources said that North Korea is dealing with a growing number of defections by overseas workers, who are under severe pressure to meet their monthly dollar-earning quotas. In May, a North Korean doctor and his wife were reported to have been abducted by an armed Islamic group in Libya. More than 50,000 North Koreans are currently working overseas to earn foreign currencies for the North Korean government, according to a human rights report submitted to the United Nations last month by Marzuki Darusman, U.N. special rapporteur on the human rights situation in North Korea.China, Russia, Cambodia, Kuwait, Ethiopia, Libya, Malaysia, Mongol, Myanmar, Poland and the United Arab Emirates are among the hosts of North Korean workers, he said.

South Korea demands Japan's formal apology and reparations for the victims. But Japan claims it has no more legal responsibility.On the Park Geun-hye administration's diplomacy, the document said the U.S. confirmed its support for Seoul's push for the ""harmonious development"" of its relations with Washington and Beijing.As to North Korea, it said leader Kim Jong-un continued efforts in 2014 as well to solidify his power through the reign of terror.The communist nation's economy failed to achieve substantive growth because of lack of fundamental reform measures, it added.

67,67,[Weekender] Internship: Tool and requirement,"Koreans often imply that our society is more competition-focused than comparable societies.

That statement, at least in terms of finding employment and the lengths the young people go to find “respectable” jobs, may be true. For some time now, internships have been a “standard” part of a job seeker’s resume, along with a good alma mater, high GPA, unnecessarily high English language scores, and a whole list of other qualifications.  (Bloomberg)And interns are everywhere. From newspapers and television stations to state-run companies and financial institutions, organizations in almost every field hire students and graduates as interns for varying lengths of time. For the employers, interns present a well-educated and eager workforce at low cost -- although they lack professional training. Large companies have also taken to hiring foreign interns, those who study here as well as from abroad, in an attempt to attract a wider range of potential new employees. For many Koreans college students, an internship is the only way to experience the “real world” before they become job seekers upon graduation. Internships also help students who are less clear about the career path they want to take. However, what began as an opportunity to learn, is taking strange turns on the part of all those involved; the interns, employers, and even the student interns’ universities. In a society that values education above almost everything else, many qualifications and certifications have lost much of their capacity as standards for discerning the able from the less able. As such, internships have become a new tool used by students and job seekers to distinguish themselves from the competition. Many undertake several internships before graduation, while most have one or two internship experiences under their belts on graduation. Even universities, which are meant to be bastions of knowledge, appear to have jumped on the bandwagon, rather than encouraging students to strive for knowledge for the sake of knowledge. Some universities not only encourage students to take time off for internships, but have made it a requirement for graduation. Despite criticism that universities are becoming vocational schools whose sole purpose is to aid the student in finding employment, such policies are welcomed by others. While many universities operate internship programs on reasonable terms, some require students to pay tuition if they want academic credit for the time they spend as interns. Even if a student takes a full semester off to undertake an internship. “It felt like they are selling credits. I interned last year, and although I worked the regular hours at the office and didn’t go to a single lecture during the semester I still had to get a student loan,” a student studying in Seoul said declining to be named. For graduates hoping to turn an internship into full time employment, the realities of being an intern are often laced with desperation and worry. Those interning at companies that use internship programs as recruiting tools are put through grueling schedules and intense competition. At the end of it all, only a lucky few gain the coveted prize -- employment. A significant chunk of companies that took on interns this year did not even specify whether the program offered a chance of being hired at the end. According to data released by the presidential committee on youths, about a third of intern recruiting ads did not provide any related details. “I thought I was going to be hired, but after eight months I was told that I had to take the entrance tests just like everyone else,” a 28-year old surnamed Choi said.

The Seoul Central District Court ordered Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp. to pay 100 million won (US$86,100) each to the plaintiffs, citing the illegality of the mobilization.""The defendant is what the company (in the colonial era) has been re-incorporated into, holding the liability of the acts in the past,"" Judge Ma Yong-joo said.The court did not recognize the Japanese company's claim that the plaintiffs' right to demand compensation expired with a 1965 treaty that normalized bilateral ties in return for an economic aid package from Japan.In July 2013, the Seoul High Court ruled against the Japanese firm in a similar case and ordered it to pay 100 million won each to four victims. The issue of forced labor is becoming increasingly urgent as most surviving victims are well over 80 years old and may die before they receive compensation or an apology from the Japanese firms.It is unclear how many people were mobilized for forced labor and died. Some civic groups claim the number of conscripts goes up to a million or more.The Japanese government, as well as the companies that used forced laborers, however, have refused to pay any compensation, saying all issues regarding its colonial rule, including sex slavery and monetary reparations, were covered by the 1965 package.

One of the key pending issues is a demand by former Korean sex slaves for an apology and compensation from Japan.Park warned that the issue would become ""a heavy historic burden"" on the Japanese government, as well as on future generations in Japan, unless it is addressed.The issue has gained urgency in recent years as the victims are dying off. In 2007, more than 120 South Korean victims were alive, but the number has since dropped to 47, with their average age standing at nearly 90.""I expect the Japanese government to quickly present a solution that is acceptable to the victims and deemed reasonable by the Korean people so that the Japanese government will help restore the honor of the 47 surviving victims and heal their wounds before they pass away,"" Park said in a joint interview with major news agencies in the Asia-Pacific region.The interview came days before Yonhap News Agency is set to host the executive board meeting of the Organization of Asia-Pacific News Agencies.Earlier this month, Park met with Abe in their first bilateral summit and they agreed to expedite consultations for the early resolution of the issue, without specifying a time frame.""I believe now is high time to make a decision to attend to the wounds from the past and heal them,"" Park said.Park's comments came just days after South Korea and Japan failed to produce any specific deal in their latest round of talks on the issue.The two neighbors plan to hold the next round of talks as early as possible. No specific date has been set yet South Korea demands Japan acknowledge its responsibility for the sex slaves, while Japan insists the issue was settled under the normalization treaty of 1965.Separately, Park offered a conditional summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.""There is no reason not to hold an inter-Korean summit if a breakthrough comes in solving the North Korean nuclear issue and progress is made in improving the South-North relationship,"" Park said.""But it will be possible only when the North comes forward for a proactive and sincere dialogue. What counts most is North Korea's sincerity and determination to act on its words.""Despite international pressure, North Korea has vowed to develop its economy and nuclear arsenal in tandem, viewing its nuclear programs as a powerful deterrent against what it claims is Washington's hostile policy.Park's two liberal predecessors held summit talks with then North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, the late father of the current leader, in Pyongyang in 2000 and 2007, respectively. Kim Jong-il died of heart failure in 2011.Park called on North Korea to faithfully implement what has been agreed upon and gradually build trust with South Korea.South and North Korea have agreed to hold high-level talks under the August deal that defused military tensions sparked by a land.

The Environment Ministry said Thursday it would accept requests for a health probe by the end of next month from those who had used the humidifier disinfectant in question. Since July 2013, the government has carried out two investigations into the causality between personal health problems and humidifier disinfectant use upon the users’ requests. In 2011, the health authorities discovered a “significant association” between lung damage and the humidifier disinfectant after four pregnant women consecutively died of a mysterious lung-related disease.Most of the victims were found to have used Oxy Ssak Ssak, a liquid humidifier disinfectant produced by British company Reckitt Benckiser. The product, which sold in Korea starting 2002, occupied a market share of about 80 percent among 20 other similar brands. It was withdrawn from the local market in 2011 after the health concerns were raised. Of 530 users who reported health problems to the government, 221 were confirmed to have suffered lung damage, the ministry said. If the health impact is confirmed, the state will cover all related medical and funeral costs. The third health investigation is underway following a request from 111 humidifier disinfectant users, officials said.Civic groups, however, raised concerns over the government’s decision to close the probe application period, claiming that there may be further potential victims. “We started to hold a campaign to encourage potential victims to request the probe since last month and about 140 already reported their symptoms to the ministry. There has been a lack of awareness that the state is receiving the health damage reports,” Asian Citizen’s Center for Environment and Health director Lim Heung-kyu told The Korea Herald.According to the government’s report in 2011, nearly 9 million Koreans were estimated to have been exposed to humidifier disinfectants from 1994. “As it’s been more than a decade since the humidifier disinfectant tragedy took place, many still do not clearly know how it might have affected them or whether it will affect them somehow soon. The government should not stop accepting the reports,” Lim added. “The government counts the damage cases only upon the reports from the victims, which is probably why there is a huge difference between the estimated number and the actual number of cases. The state needs to proactively find out the potential victims.”Currently, one can apply for the investigation via mail or visit with a paper application that is downloadable from the website. For now, the state does not have any plans to launch a probe into people who were exposed, the ministry said.Meanwhile, eight confirmed victims are seeking compensation against the state and the product maker. The government has reiterated that the humidifier disinfectant company is accountable for the health damage, not the state, and is responsible for any compensation beyond the government’s offer of health and funeral costs.

In September, Choe also visited Beijing for China's massive military parade.Choe's whereabouts have been under the intense spotlight among officials and analysts in South Korea and other regional powers as he was not named as a member of a funeral committee of a senior military official who died last Saturday.Choe also did not show up for the state funeral ceremony of Ri Ul-sol, marshal of North Korea's military, who died of lung cancer at the age of 94.Choe's conspicuous absence sparked speculation among some analysts that he might have been ousted from the party's key post.Still, the South Korean intelligence officials believe that Choe was not purged, though he is undergoing education at the Kim Il Sung Higher Party School for unspecified reasons.The officials, who spoke on conditions of anonymity, did not give any details on how Choe ended up in re-education at Kim Il Sung Higher Party School.A source familiar to North Korean affairs, meanwhile, said that the party secretary in charge of labor groups is on a farm in a rural area as part of his re-education apparently aimed to punish him for his poor performance in youth-related affairs.There is media speculation that it may be related to problems in building a dam near Mount Paektu, which Pyongyang claims is the sacred birthplace of Kim Jong-il, North Korea's late leader and the father of the current leader Kim.The South Korean officials said that re-education at Kim Il Sung Higher Party School is the most lenient punishment, compared with writing a letter of self-criticism at home or serving time in rural areas or coal mines.On Wednesday, North Korean state television aired footage of Choe when it aired a competition of ""ssirum"" -- a traditional Korean form of wrestling -- at a stadium in Pyongyang, the officials said.The intelligence officials said they believe that the ssirum competition was held Tuesday. The North Korean state television usually reports events a day after they take place.In 2014, the North's main newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, mentioned Choe's late father's case as an example of protecting the country's founder Kim Il-sung.Choe Hyon, who served as a vice defense minister, pulled a pistol during a key party meeting in 1956 on the opposition in a factional strife against Kim Il-sung. The senior Choe's move dampened the spirits of those who opposed Kim, who later purged his political opponents.

It would mark the first party congress in 36 years after the last such meeting was held in 1980, when Kim's grandfather and national founder Kim Il-sung was in power.The announcement spurred speculation as to why Kim decided to convene such a rare meeting.Ruediger Frank, a North Korea expert at the University of Vienna, said Kim could use the meeting for a ""declaration of his victory in the domestic struggle for power"" after massive purges in the past years or to announce a major policy change marking the departure down a path of true reform.Frank also noted that since Kim took power, the formal role of the Workers' Party has been restored, step by step, and such leading party organs as the central committee, the politburo and its presidium have been resuscitated.""We should also remember that all major reforms of state socialism -- be it in China under Deng Xiaoping, the Soviet Union under Gorbachev or Vietnam under the slogan of doi moi -- have been announced at such regular party congresses or related events,"" he said in an article contributed to 38 North.Unlike his father and late leader Kim Jong-il who pursued ""songun,"" or military-first, policy, the current leader pursues the ""byeongjin"" policy of seeking both economic and nuclear development simultaneously, the expert said.""Kim Jong-un has from day one of his leadership declared that he wants to improve the material living conditions of his people.He has tried to do that within the constraints of the existing system,"" Frank said. ""I had estimated that he would need about five years to find out that this does not work, that the system itself is the problem. The time is almost up.""As Kim has consolidated his leadership and the economic situation in the North is relatively stable, the emerging middle class and the growing inflow of information from the outside, in particular via China, have put the regime under high pressure for reform, the expert said.However, Kim could use next year's meeting only to signal a ""return to a new normal,"" he said.""Kim Jong-un might ... play it safe and, after having spent the last years cleaning the ranks of the party, military and government, will use the 7th Party Congress for a triumphant declaration of his victory in the domestic struggle for power. The country would return to a new normal and continue to muddle through,"" Frank said.In that case, the congress could only issue statements on internal cohesion and monolithic unity, celebrate the status of the country as a nuclear and space power, reshuffle a few posts, glorify the three Kims and emphasize the need for Korean unification, he said.

The agency is also pushing to put in place legislation to facilitate its future overseas dispatch of forces and participation in non-U.N. peacekeeping operations. Currently, some 320 soldiers of the Cheonghae Unit have been taking part in an international antipiracy campaign in the Gulf of Aden off the Somali coast since March 2009, operating a 4,000-ton class destroyer. In Abu Dhabi, the 150-strong Akh Unit -- meaning “brothers” in Arabic -- was dispatched in January 2011 following the UAE’s request to help train its special warfare troops. The terms of both contingents were due to end at the end of this year. “The role of the Cheonghae Unit is vital as the combined naval forces continue to face threats from pirates within their operational area, which calls for maintaining the current levels of antipiracy activities as a deterrent,” a ministry official said. “As for the Akh Unit, it needs to remain there, given our own need to secure a solid footing in the growing arms markets in the UAE and the overall Middle East. It also makes it easier to protect the 25,000 plus people residing throughout the region should a contingency break out.” The envisioned law on overseas military operations was proposed in June 2013 but has for almost a year been pending at a legislation and judiciary subcommittee of the National Assembly. If enacted, it will help lay a legislative groundwork for the country’s future multinational peacekeeping activities and defense exchanges with other countries as the current law is only confined to U.N.-led operations.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","extend troops in somalia ,wednesday citing persistent pirate ,korea seeks to extend ,troops in somalia uae ,emirates officials said wednesday","['the Defense Ministry', 'Somalia', 'the United Arab Emirates', 'middle eastern', 'non - u.n.']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38083312  0.75063974

The victims are euphemistically called ""comfort women."" The issue has gained urgency in recent years as the victims are dying off. In 2007, more than 120 South Korean victims were alive, but the number has since dropped to 47, with their average age standing at nearly 90.Both Seoul and Tokyo view the related dispute as ""the biggest obstacle"" to efforts to improve their ties.A sticking point is the divergent interpretation of a 1965 deal to normalize diplomatic relations with Seoul.The Abe administration maintains that the legal issue was settled at that time. But South Korea has stressed that the comfort women issue was not addressed in the agreement which focused on dealing with the economic side.The Park government is demanding a formal apology and compensation for Korean victims from Japan.     ""Our unswerving position is that (the issue) was not included in the 1965 deal between South Korea and Japan,"" Vice Foreign Minister Lim Sung-nam said in a radio talk show.

They have held talks since April 2014, but no significant progress has been made.Park Ok-seon who was forced into forced sexual slavery by Japan`s Imperial Army during World War II watches news on the summit between South Korean President Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Nov. 2, at a home in Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province. (Yonhap)Seoul’s Foreign Ministry said that Lee Sang-deok, director general of Northeast Asian affairs at the ministry, will hold talks with Kimihiro Ishikane, director general of the Japanese Foreign Ministry’s Asian and Oceanian Affairs Bureau, who recently succeeded his predecessor Junichi Ihara.Since the first round of the talks, Japan has maintained the issue was already settled under a 1965 treaty normalizing bilateral ties. Seoul claims the “humanitarian” issue should be separate from the treaty, and the issue was not on the agenda for the negotiations over the treaty at the time.The leaders of the two neighbors have presented their desire for an early resolution of the issue involving the sex slaves euphemistically called comfort women. There are 47 known surviving Korean victims, who are an average of 89.2 years old.Reiterating that Tokyo’s position over the issue remains unchanged, Abe told a parliamentary budget session that his government would exert efforts to settle the issue.“There is no change in our stance that (the issue of the comfort women) has legally been settled through the (1965) treaty,” he said. “During the summit (with Park), the two sides shared the understanding that (the comfort women issue) should not be a hurdle to bilateral efforts to forge a future-oriented relationship. (We also) shared the need to accelerate the negotiations aiming for an early resolution.”During a Cabinet meeting, Park renewed her calls for an early settlement of the issue.“During the bilateral summit, the two countries agreed to speed up negotiations over the Korean victims. (I) hope (the two sides) will strive to settle this issue at the earliest possible date,” she said.The major bone of contention is Tokyo’s refusal to take legal responsibility for the wartime atrocity. Tokyo has previously taken steps to take “moral responsibility” such as establishing the civilian Asia Women’s Fund, which Korean victims dismissed as insincere. But it has refused to offer legal reparations and apologies.The two sides have been struggling to gain more concessions from each other based on the three-point “Sasae proposal,” which was made by then Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Kenichiro Sasae in 2012. The three points were a direct apology by the Japanese prime minister, the Japanese ambassador’s delivery of a letter of apology to the victims and a compensation fund from the Tokyo government.

It seized $726,000 in proceeds from the sale of their residence in California and $500,000 in investment bonds.The move came after the prosecution launched a special investigation team in 2013 into the former military leader’s hidden money in a bid to reclaim illegally accumulated assets. In 1997, Chun, who rose to power in a military coup in 1979, was convicted on a number of charges, including bribery, and was ordered to return to the state 220 billion won ($190 million) he earned through kickbacks during his presidency from 1981 to 1988.The prosecutors confiscated half of the original amount over the past decade as the National Assembly passed a bill extending the statute of limitations on seizing assets from government officials who had failed to pay fines. The statute of limitations on Chun’s case was extended to 2020. The law also allowed the prosecution to collect the fine from his family members instead of Chun himself if the asset was proven to be originated from his illegally earned funds. The former dictator, who resides in western Seoul, drew the public ire as he refused to pay the money, claiming he was broke, despite the news reports on his family leading a life of luxury here and in the U.S. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","korea seizes ex president ,former south korean president ,korean president chun doo ,south korean president chun ,department returned 12 million","['the Justice Ministry', 'U.S.', 'south korean', 'Chun Doo - hwan', 'South Korea', 'the U.S. Justice Department', 'U.S.', 'korean', 'korean']",3,"[ 1.          0.          2.         ... -0.68348068  0.2964153

This installment looks into China’s threat perceptions and its military strategy and modernization. -- Ed.China’s “strategic culture” is a complex mixture of Confucianism, the revolutionary aspect and the West’s realist streak, raising uncertainties over its possible responses to security threats including one related to the ongoing South China Sea disputes, according to China expert Park Chang-hee.Professor Park Chang-heeStrategic culture refers to the orientation of a country’s perceptions and preferences regarding the use of force and its overall security stance.China’s historical experiences including its communist revolution and wars with Western forces have made its strategic culture “unstable and unpredictable,” the military strategy professor at Korea National Defense University said during a recent interview with The Korea Herald.“It is difficult to simply define China’s strategic culture in which these three elements clash together. The problem is the unpredictability of the strategic culture. Even Chinese cannot fully grasp their own strategic culture,” he said.“China could be confused about whether it should take a more generous approach in line with the Confucian strategic culture, or a tough stance in line with the revolutionary strategic culture.”Touching on the heightened tensions between the U.S. and China over the freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, the scholar did not rule out the possibility of a direct military clash between the major powers.“Should this war of nerves between the two persist, we cannot rule out the possibility of a military conflict. We witnessed a clash in April 2001 when the U.S. surveillance aircraft collided with China’s fighter jet off Hainan Island, causing the death of a Chinese pilot.”The following is the interview with professor Park.Korea Herald: What are your views on China’s perception of military threats?Park Chang-hee: China issued a 2014 defense white paper, entitled “China’s Military Strategy” in May this year. The document adopts a new expression -- “military strategic guideline of active defense in the new situation” -- in place of the previous term -- “military strategic guideline of active defense for the new era.” This change reflects a shift in China’s perception of the security landscape. The “new era” in the previous term refers to China’s pursuit of the operations of its forces under high-tech conditions. But the “new situation” refers to neo-hegemonism, power politics and neo-interventionism (which the white paper singled out as new threats). Here, neo-hegemonism means the strengthening of the U.S.-Japan alliance, while power politics refers to the U.S.’ military rebalancing towards the Asia-Pacific region and neo-interventionism to the U.S.’ intervention in maritime disputes involving the East and South China Seas. China appears to be concentrating on these issues as focal points for its construction of military power.KH: Since 1985, China has pushed for its military modernization. What have been the key points of the modernization scheme?Park: In 1985 when Deng Xiaoping presided over a session of the Communist Party’s Central Military Commission, there was a shift in China’s perception of warfare. Before then, China’s military prepared for a possible all-out, impending nuclear war. But at the CMC session, Deng and senior party members shared the recognition that the possibility of such an all-out nuclear war was little. Thus, they began pursuing the doctrine of “local wars” whereby China sought to secure its interests along its peripheral regions. A local war is of short duration that is a geographically limited yet of high-intensity. To pursue the doctrine of local wars, China should have elite forces equipped with high-tech weapons. But for the doctrine, China just reduced its troops by some 1 million and sought to enhance jointness among the armed services. But the Gulf War (in 1991) -- which some called the first space war -- came as a shock, underscoring the yawning technological gap between the U.S. and China. Since then, China started pursuing the technology-focused construction of military power in a departure from the manpower-centric strategy. Accordingly, the military doctrine of “local wars under high-tech conditions” emerged in 1993. As the world has moved into the era of informationization in the 21st century from the industrialization era, China has been transitioning to informationized warfare from mechanized warfare. In 2004, China’s defense white paper set its military objective as winning “local wars under informationized conditions.” Local wars under high-tech conditions means mechanized warfare in the industrialization era, while local wars under informationized conditions is informationized warfare.Under the military strategic guideline of active defense in the new situation, China will be preparing for local wars under informationized conditions until the mid-21st century, namely 2050. This objective was presented in the 2006 defense white paper. What this means is that China is pushing to secure military capabilities equivalent to those of the U.S.KH: A series of the military events have driven China’s projects to alter or improve its military strategy, doctrine, force structure, training and so forth. Those events include the Gulf War in 1991 and the Taiwan Straits Crisis in 1995-96 to name a few.Park: Yes, the Gulf War made China cognizant of the importance of the high-tech weaponry. But in the early 1990s, China focused on preparing for contingencies along its periphery rather than for an emergency involving the U.S. But after the Taiwan Straits Crisis, China pursued a shift in its military strategy, and the management and acquisition of weapons. During the crisis, the U.S. sent two aircraft carriers, which was quite a shock to China. Since then, it started to prepare for military operations with the potential clash with the U.S. in mind. China’s military preparations proceeded in two ways. Firstly, China has pursued the doctrine of local wars under informationized conditions to catch up with the U.S. based on the recognition that an emergency on its periphery could involve not only neighboring states but also the U.S. Secondly, China has sought to develop the “A2/AD” (anti-access/area-denial) strategy, which is an asymmetric military strategy. China would not pursue the A2/AD strategy for good. It is pushing for the A2/AD strategy as it is lagging behind the U.S. military power. Thus, its pursuit of the strategy is an inevitable choice. KH: China appears to be employing an offensive maritime strategy as it seeks to shift its focus to “offshore waters defense” to the combination of offshore waters defense and “open seas protection.” What would be the impact of this on the regional security?Park: China’s strategy can hardly be called offensive. It is almost impossible for China to execute an offensive strategy against its major competitors, the U.S. and Japan. If you call a strategy offensive, it should be aimed at extorting something from its competitors or anything to that effect. Thus, it is appropriate to call China’s strategy defensive. But it is not to say that there is no offensiveness at all in its strategy, or that it is not seeking to bolster its offensive capabilities. As China rises as a major power, it cannot help but strengthen its military power to protect growing national interests. In this respect, China has been trying to build its capabilities in the realms of sea, air and space. In the 2014 defense white paper, China used the expression, “open seas protection” that goes beyond the “offshore defense” that it has stuck to for two decades. This indicates that China would advance farther into the ocean in the future. The problem here is that even though it takes a defensive strategy, China would not make any concessions vis-a-vis core interests and could use force (to protect them). The core interests involve Senkaku Islands, Spratly Islands, Paracel Islands, Taiwan and even North Korea.  KH: Tensions have spiked in the South China Sea with the U.S. conducting freedom-of-navigation operations. What would be the likelihood of a military clash between China and the U.S.?Park: China’s defense white paper said the seas and oceans bear on the enduring peace, lasting stability and sustainable development of China. It also made it clear that it would strengthen its maritime military readiness to secure its interests. In line with this, China has apparently been constructing artificial islands in the South China Sea and deployed military assets there. The U.S. has said in response that China’s moves ran counter to the international law and would not be helpful for the regional stability. Should this war of nerves between the two persist, we cannot rule out the possibility of a military conflict. We witnessed a clash in April 2001 when the U.S. surveillance aircraft collided with China’s fighter jet off Hainan Island, causing the death of a Chinese pilot. A clash may not escalate into a full-blown military conflict, but such a war of nerves would undercut mutual trust and dampen the mood for cooperation that was forged during their summit in September.KH: How would you describe China’s strategic culture? Park: China’s strategic culture is based on Confucianism. Under the Confucian strategic culture, war is a means that is to be abhorred and should be used in an inevitable situation as a last resort. When a war breaks out, the scale and duration should also be minimized. This traditional strategic culture is different from the modern West’s notion about warfare. The West regards war as a means to achieve political objectives and the execution of warfare as part of political activities. This means that war is not a subject to be abhorred, but a justifiable means to achieve political goals. This is what differentiates the West’s notion from that of Confucianism.But China experienced a communist revolution, which has implanted a very extreme realist strategic culture in China. Through the revolution, China has come to see warfare as a means to achieve political goals -- a just and rational means to root out feudalism and imperialism.The problem is that after China succeeded in its communist revolution and established the People’s Republic of China in 1949, another strategic culture emerged. That came as China engaged in the international war and accepted the West’s strategic culture. That means a modern-day limited warfare aimed at securing national interests.As a result, China’s strategic culture is now an intricate mixture of Confucianism, the aspect of the communist revolution and the West’s strategic culture. Thus, it is difficult to simply define China’s strategic culture in which these three elements clash together. The problem is the unpredictability of the strategic culture. Even Chinese cannot fully grasp their own strategic culture. It is hard to know which cultural aspect could figure prominently in what case. In case of the South China Sea disputes, China could be confused about whether it should take a more generous approach in line with the Confucian strategic culture, or a tough stance in line with the revolutionary strategic culture. China could be grappling with its identity of strategic culture. In this respect, China claims multiple identities. For example, at the U.N. Security Council, China acts as a major power, while at a climate change conference, China claims to be a developing country.KH: Chinese leader Xi Jinping has announced the plan for a reduction of 300,000 troops. What is your view on the troop drawdown?Park: Before China renounced its concept of the imminent, all-out, nuclear war in 1985, China maintained some 4 million troops. As it pursued the doctrine of local wars, China curtailed its troop level by 1 million from 1985-89, then 500,000 from 1997-2000 and then 200,000 from 2003-05. Now, the number of the troops stands at around 2.3 million. China’s military modernization is the biggest reason for the troop reduction. As the military is getting mechanized and informationized, what has become crucial is not the number of the troops but the quality of its forces. Secondly, it is about jointness among the armed services, which has created the synergic effect. Enhanced jointness has allowed the military to eliminate the overlapping functions. The military has also sought to remove its roles that caused inefficiencies such as the socialist military establishment’s traditional function of employment.KH: How do you think the Sino-U.S. military competition will unfold?Park: China’s military can’t be a match for the U.S. yet. It can’t be for some two to three decades. Thus, China can’t think of a scenario of its military clash with the U.S. for the time being. But this does not mean that China would bow to the U.S.’ military threats. Therefore, it is taking a strategic approach to deal with the U.S.China’s strategy is formulated based on its analysis of the U.S.’ vulnerabilities. First, it knows that it would take some period of time for the U.S. to prepare for a war. In the case of the Gulf War, it took some five months of preparation. Secondly, it would also take time for the U.S. to deploy its military assets to a battle zone. Of course, the aircraft would come soon, but the aircraft carrier group or warships can’t arrive right away. Thirdly, China is aware that the U.S.’ war is susceptible to domestic public opinion.Thus, China believes it would win in a conflict should it effectively block the U.S.’ military power. Based on this belief, China has been pursuing the A2/AD strategy, and focusing on developing weapons systems required for the strategy. The problem for the U.S. is that neighboring states can raise doubts over the U.S.’ security commitment to them as the A2/AD strategy poses a threat to the U.S. Thus, the U.S. is pushing for its military rebalancing to maintain its alliance system in the region.The Sino-U.S. competition will continue. But China would not engage in some infinite military competition with the U.S. in the way the Soviet Union did during the Cold War. Rather than trying to maximize the number of warheads, it would take a smart approach such as increasing its submarine-launched ballistic missiles and strategic nuclear-powered submarines.KH: There has been talk here of China’s possible intervention in case of a regime collapse in Pyongyang or any contingencies in the North. How do you think China would intervene?Park: North Korea has historically been of core geopolitical value for China. Thus, what’s in China’s interest is to maintain a pro-China regime in the North. The worst scenario for China would be that a pro-U.S. regime emerges on the peninsula after reunification, posing a security threat to China. Under this scenario, it could be seen as being geopolitically encircled by Taiwan and the Korean Peninsula, which could make it difficult for it to fulfil the task of unifying mainland China and Taiwan.China’s intervention during the Korea War was based on such geopolitical calculations. At the time, all countries including the U.S. thought China would not intervene due to domestic political and economic difficulties, and the fact that China was not prepared to participate in yet another war. But it did. Should a contingency occur in the North, China would intervene in any form. Its intervention could occur in various ways, depending on situations. China could send a delegation of political and military advisers to back the North Korean regime, or send military assistance to block internal resistance (to the regime favorable to China’s interests), or intervene militarily in a direct manner, in the worst case.Russia has recently begun its military intervention to protect the Assad regime in Syria. Likewise, China could offer military support in case of the collapse of the North Korean regime. Currently, the document stipulating the alliance relations between China and North Korea still remains undestroyed. It appears that the document has not been discarded yet for the two sides to prepare for the possibilities (mentioned above).By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)**Park Chang-heePark, professor in the department of military strategy at Korea National Defense University, is noted for his extensive research and expertise on Chinese military strategy, national security, geopolitics and war strategy.  He has authored a series of articles and books on the Chinese military and various security issues.

The 4.95-square-kilometer airport, to be bigger than Jeju International Airport, will have a runway 3,200 meters long and 60 meters wide. Opened in 1968, Jeju International Airport has served as the only aerial gateway to the island, but studies showed that its runways will be completely saturated by 2018 with the explosive growth rate in flights. The ministry’s research forecast that the number of Jeju International Airport users will stand at 28 million in 2018 and rise to 40 million by 2025. “After carrying out preliminary feasibility studies, we decided that Sinsan was a suitable location for the new airport by taking into account the cost, impact on the environment and public opinion,” the official said. Previously, the government had mulled three options to expand capacities of airport infrastructure on Jejudo Island: expanding the existing airport, closing down Jeju International and building a completely new airport with two runways, or building a second airport at a separate location.“Expanding the existing airport would incur excessive construction costs as high as 9.4 trillion won and pose bigger environmental risks as it needs to reclaim land from the sea, while closing it down entirely is opposed by residents,” the ministry said. Construction work is expected to begin in 2018 after further feasibility studies by the ministry and detailed plans, such as for the terminal size and land compensation.

Over a week ago, she met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Seoul, and they agreed to accelerate negotiations to resolve the issue.South Korea and Japan have failed to produce any significant progress in their working-level talks on the issue. It remains unclear if the latest agreement will have any influence on upcoming negotiations on the issue.The sides have long been at odds over territory and other historical disputes stemming from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula.South Korea demands Japan acknowledge its responsibility for the sex slaves, while Japan insists the issue was settled under the normalization treaty of 1965.Park also reiterated that the issue of history textbooks for secondary students is not something that should be at the center of a partisan strife.She said top experts from various fields will join the panel for state history textbooks, noting that most of the authors of history textbooks are tilted toward a specific ideology, in an apparent reference to left-wing ideology.The government recently announced it will revise the current textbook publication system so that middle and high school students will learn Korean history through national textbooks starting in the 2017 school year.Currently, history textbooks for secondary schools are published by eight private publishing companies pending government approval.Park said the current history textbooks described South Korea's history negatively and minimized North Korea's provocations against South Korea. They also make it seem as if South Korea is to blame for the division of the Korean Peninsula.The Korean Peninsula was divided into the capitalistic South and the communist North after its liberation from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule. Tank-led North Korean troops invaded South Korea on June 25, 1950, starting the Korean War. The war ended in 1953 in a truce, not a peace treaty.Park also pressed lawmakers again to pass a set of free trade deals South Korea has clinched with its trading partners, including China, to boost Asia's fourth-largest economy.South Korea and China signed a free trade agreement in June, though the deal has yet to be ratified by the respective legislatures of Seoul and Beijing.Park and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang have recently met and agreed to cooperate to ensure the bilateral free trade deal will take effect within this year.South Korea has clinched a series of free trade agreements with major trading partners, including the United States, in recent years to boost growth in a country where exports account for about half of its gross domestic product.

It employs 33 letters that are pronounced exactly the same as in writing, being a phonemic alphabet “literally.”The Tbilisi government listed it as a national cultural heritage in March, and nominated it for the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List, which will be determined next year. The Georgian Embassy held a reception at Lotte Hotel on Wednesday to promote the cause and raise awareness in Korea.Georgian Ambassador Nikoloz Apkhazava. Joel Lee/The Korea Herald“The history of Georgia was one of survival,” Georgian Ambassador Nikoloz Apkhazava told The Korea Herald. “Being at the crossroads of Asia and Europe, with different conquerors and civilizations,” he added, “We have survived on the same land, as the same people, with the same language and culture, for over three millennia. We are proud of that.”Georgian historical records date the invention of the alphabet to the pre-Christian period, notably to the Iberian King Parnavaz of third century B.C. Another view points to a time after Georgia was Christianized in the fourth century A.D. No agreement to date has been reached on a common origin, but the writing was noteworthy from a research perspective, the ambassador explained, for being a relic of perished languages in forgotten histories. “With Georgia being the cradle of wine going back over 8,000 years, some scholars have suggested that our alphabet was closely tied to our viticulture, with the round characters resembling the wine trees,” he said.The alphabet, which predominantly uses the “Mkhedruli” version more than the sister variations of “Asomtavruli” and “Nuskhuri,” does not have capital letters, gender distinctions or articles. “It is the only language in the world where the word ‘mama’ actually means ‘father,’” Apkhazava highlighted, delighting the participants, comprised of diplomats and individuals close to Georgia. Georgian Ambassador Nikoloz Apkhazava (left) explains the Georgian alphabet to the Romanian Ambassador’s spouse Mihaela Fabianto (second from left), Polish Ambassador Krzysztof Ignacy Majka and his wife Zofia Majka. Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldThe Georgian language belongs to the Iberian-Caucasian linguistic family, separate from the Indo-European languages. Centuries of interactions with the Greeks, Persians, Arabs, Russians, Turks and Azerbaijanis have ingrained and imprinted their traces on the vocabulary, but not the script itself, the envoy noted. According to the Georgian Ministry of Education and Science, a modern Georgian can understand both the ecclesiastical and secular literature in the Old Georgian (5-11th centuries A.D.) and Middle Georgian (12-18th centuries A.D.) languages. Like Korea’s “Hangul Day” on Oct. 9, Georgia celebrates the “Day of the Georgian Language” on April 14. Young Georgians have increasingly opened their eyes and ears to the outside world, and many are comfortable with English, Apkhazava said. The Tbilisi Free University has a Korean language department, where around 25 Georgian students study each year with the help of a Korean teacher.

Marquez, the chief of the Philippine National Police.Since 2013, a total of 31 South Korean nationals have lost their lives to violent crimes in the Philippines. Earlier this month, a Korean man in his 70s was kidnapped in January by a terrorist group in the Philippines while visiting his son in Zamboanga Sibugay Province in Mindanao Island. The terrorist group, Abu Sayyaf, is known to have ties with al-Qaida and has been blacklisted by the United States.Currently, the KNPA runs two special teams dealing with crimes against Korean nationals in the Philippines, one in Manila and the other in Angeles. The KPNA plans to dispatch more officers in Filipino regions with a high Korean population.Kang of the KNPA and Marquez of the PNP also discussed ways to collaborate on crime investigations. Kang suggested the idea of dispatching Korean medical examiners when a violent crime occurs against a Korean national.Kang also met up with Albert del Rosario, Secretary of Foreign Affairs of the Philippines, to address the issue. The head of the KNPA also met with officials at the Bureau of Immigration to discuss ways to share information on criminal offenders in Korea and the Philippines who have fled overseas to avoid punishment.

With the law vocally opposed by an increasing number of sex workers, its efficacy has constantly been questioned. The Korea Herald will publish a three-part series shedding light on the hidden side of Korea’s sex industry. The following is the first installment. -- Ed.At first glance, he looks like an ordinary young man in his late 20s. Casually dressed in blue jeans and a black sweater, the man also exudes an athletic vibe. Most would believe him if he claimed to work at a fitness club, or as a professional athlete.The man, in fact, is a part-time sex worker targeting women. His job mostly involves meeting his female clients at a motel room, usually during the day, and offering “special” massage services, which includes intercourse upon request. “Almost a half of my clients are women in their 20s,” he said, when The Korea Herald met him posing as a potential client. “About 8 percent of them are pregnant ladies.”According to South Korea’s antiprostitution laws, what he does is illegal and both he and his clients may face a maximum of one year behind bars. But when it comes to male sex workers, South Korea’s Ministry of Gender Equality -- which is in charge of regulating the nation’s illegal sex trade business – currently has no statistics. “We’ve actually never had any data or reports on them,” said Choi Soo-young from the ministry’s Women’s Right Support Division.  Illustration by The Korea HeraldIt’s been more than 10 years since South Korea enacted its antiprostitution law, which criminalized both the buying and selling of sex. Yet the nation’s adult industry still flourishes, with new forms of the sex trade emerging.With or without the Gender Ministry’s willingness to tackle such sex services targeting women, these male “massage therapists” have existed for at least 10 years in Seoul, according to reports and sources. And the industry may be more thriving now than ever-- all behind closed doors. According to a 2005 investigative report by local weekly Ilyo Seoul, parlors that offer erotic massage services, including genital stimulation, were becoming increasingly popular among women in their 30s, especially in Seoul’s posh districts including Apgujeong and Cheongdam. Almost all services were given by male masseurs, who would sometimes use extra equipment, such as adult sex toys for women, upon request.Today, the services for women have become even more discreet in the country where sex services for men, on the other hand, have been relatively more common and therefore face wider crackdowns. “You don’t have to worry about getting caught (by the police) at all,” the male sex worker assured. “We either visit our client in her house (for the service), or meet her in a motel room. We are not doing this at a parlor. It’s all private. There’s no way the authorities are going to find out.”The man offers three massage options -- courses A, B and C. Course A is an hour-long service consisting of a regular aromatherapy massage. Course B adds “sensual touches” to the mix. Those who choose to get the Course C, which costs 200,000 won ($177) per single session, can make any request they want, including intercourse. “Almost every client chooses to get Course C,” he said. And it’s not even that hard to find such services online. Searching “yeoseong (women) massage” in Korean on popular search engines including Google and Naver, tens of thousands of results appear. One of the popular massage services for women is called the “Handsome Boy Massage,” while another is called “Luxury Aroma.” Some websites, upon logging in, offer seminude photographs of their massage therapists. The photographs remind one of bodybuilding competitions.“Women like getting facials done,” the sex worker said. “It’s almost like that. I think (our services) established itself as a part of leisure culture. A lot of our clients are young women (in their 20s). Some women would (go to a motel) together with friends and get the service at the same time, in separate rooms.”Shin Jeong-ae (not her real name), a 51-year-old married woman, has been receiving such massages, without intercourse, for the last four years. In 2011, she had a number of health issues, including chronic indigestion and leg pain. “I thought massage was a better option than working out,” she said. “My friend recommended it and I went for it.”Shin usually asks her male therapists visit her home for the services, which she describes as “similar to caressing between a man and a woman.” Most of her therapists are in their late 20s or early 30s. “It’s such a stress-reliever,” she said. “My body feels so light after getting the services. It also helps with indigestion.”Shin said she has a stable marriage with her husband, and does not feel bad about getting such services. “I don’t feel bad. It’s just massage,” she said. “But I once thought (while getting the service), oh, now I can sort of understand why people cheat.”Sung Kyung-won, an expert in sex education, said the idea that men usually have higher sex drive than women is largely a myth. “I think buying sex has to do with power. Those who do it want to assert their dominance through purchasing sex,” she said. “I think more women would’ve paid for sex in the earlier years if they had the power and financial means to do it. I’m not saying that it’s morally right. But such an industry obviously exists because there is a demand. And more women are becoming financially independent.”Indeed, the male sex worker said most of his clients are women with stable jobs and income. He said he also has an option of saying no to a client’s request to have intercourse. “If I really don’t like the client, I’d just finish the service by giving the massage only for the entire two hours. And then I’d lie that I don’t give the ‘special’ treatments and she would call someone else for such services,” he said. “But I can’t do this too many times because it will make my employer unhappy.”The services’ main clientele also includes female sex workers, who visit these women-only clubs as a way of releasing their work-related stress. “I’d assume many female sex workers, especially those who work in bars and drink a lot at work, would use those massage services,” said a former female sex worker, who spent almost 20 years in the industry and preferred to remain anonymous. “I know female sex workers who would visit those female-exclusive bars and clubs, and make the male workers go through exactly what they had to endure while serving their male clients, such as masturbating in public. The women would go crazy if they didn’t release their stress.”While the male sex worker could afford to mostly greet clients who are “physically attractive and financially stable,” the range of clients received by the former female sex worker was less selective, and sometimes included those experiencing sexual dysfunction. She spent most of her income as a sex worker paying off her family debt. She never married. The male sex worker, in the meantime, works as a freelancer in the health and fitness sector, and dreams of running his own business one day. He also dates women, keeping his part-time job a secret. “Of course they (his ex-girlfriends) didn’t know,” he said. “I can never let them know that.”By Claire Lee and Suk Gee-hyun(dyc@heraldcorp.com) (monicasuk@heraldcorp.com)","korea sex industry ,of korea sex industry ,korea sex industry th ,invisible male sex workers ,korea some 10 years","['South Korea', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea']",3,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.7677387   0.13803197

President Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe hold a summit at Cheong Wa Dae this week. (Yonhap)A Seoul official on Friday said it was Tokyo that should first propose solutions to the issue involving Korean victims of the colonial-era atrocity. His remarks came a day after Koichi Hagiuda, Tokyo’s deputy chief cabinet secretary, said in an interview “the ball is in Seoul’s court.”  “Japan should put forward solutions that could be understood and accepted by Korean victims, from the perspective that the one who created the problem should solve the problem,” a Seoul official told media, declining to be named.At the first-ever summit between President Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Seoul on Monday, they agreed to accelerate their negotiations over the issue. But they did not set a deadline for the settlement of the issue.  During his meeting Wednesday with Sadakazu Tanigaki, the secretary-general of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, Abe reportedly said it would be difficult to settle the issue if the two sides fix a deadline for the resolution. Observers said his remarks underscored the difficulty in reaching a solution in the coming months. Since April 2014, the two sides have held nine rounds of director-general-level talks on the issue of the “comfort women,” as the wartime sex slaves are euphemistically known. But no significant progress has yet been reported. Tokyo has long argued that the issue was already settled under a 1965 treaty normalizing bilateral ties. Seoul claims the “humanitarian” issue should be separate from the treaty, and the issue was not on the agenda for the negotiations over the treaty. After the bilateral summit, a flurry of Japanese news reports on possible solutions came out. One possible solution in the reports was a humanitarian financial support similar to the botched Asian Women’s Fund. Japan set up the fund in 1995 to offer “atonement money” to Asian victims, many of whom were Korean.Financed by civilian donations, the fund was intended to show that Japan was taking “moral responsibility” for the past misdeed. But it was dissolved as the victims called for “legal” reparations and apologies, not just financial compensation.Seoul and Tokyo refuse to divulge the contents of their hitherto working-level negotiations over the issue. Observers presume that they have been struggling to gain more concessions from each other based on the “Sasae proposal.”During his visit to Seoul in March 2012, then Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Kenichiro Sasae made a three-point proposal. The three points were a direct apology by the Japanese prime minister, the Seoul-based Japanese ambassador’s delivery of a letter of apology to the victims and a compensation fund from the Tokyo government. The negotiations failed as Seoul demanded Japan recognize its “state responsibility” for the sexual slavery. Currently the number of known surviving Korean victims stands at 47. Their average age is 89.2 years old.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","sex slaves south korea ,upcoming consultations president park ,seoul official on friday ,japan wartime sexual slavery ,dae this week seoul","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Park Geun', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Yonhap)A Seoul', 'Tokyo']",3,"[ 1.          2.          0.         ... -0.44382146  0.44515824

We hope there will be no repetition of such an incident.""  A total of 124 South Korean small and medium-size enterprises operate factories in the industrial park, the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation.  It has served as a major revenue source for the cash-strapped North, while South Korea has utilized cheap but skilled North Korean labor by hiring about 54,000 North Koreans workers.  Ending a months-long wage dispute, the two sides agreed in August to raise the minimum wage for the North's workers by 5 percent to $73.87 per month.  But the two Koreas will soon begin talks on how much the South Korean firms at the complex should pay as a land use fee with the decade-long exemption for the sort of ""tax"" expires this year.

The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles shedding light on refugees in Korea, their hardships, the systematic fallout, the country’s own history and ways to go forward. The following is the fourth installment. ― Ed.In April, Incheon Metropolitan Office of Education announced that eight school-age children from the refugee help center on Yeongjong Island would attend an alternative education institute for multicultural children. It was a bittersweet ending for the children dubbed by local media as “education refugees” after their attempt to enter local Youngjong Elementary School was thwarted by protests from parents. The parents of the school said they did not want their children to share the classroom with students of African and Middle Eastern decent. The IMOE decided it was unwise for the children to attend a 40-student school due to concerns over “cultural clashes.”In light of the increasing number of asylum seekers in South Korea, the country enacted the Refugee Act in 2013 to provide humanitarian protection for them. The law stipulates that foreigners who have applied for refugee status and their families are entitled to the same level of primary and secondary education as Korean citizens if they are underage.But even though the law seeks to provide the basic facilities for those forcibly displaced, the prevailing social prejudice and racism in the country remains a hindrance for the refugees as they try to settling down. Activists call for an end to racism during a rally in downtown Seoul on the occasion of the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination on March 21. (Yonhap)This is not the first time the refugee help center made headlines in relation to the anti-refugee sentiment. Back in July 2013 when the facility was about to launch operations, local residents of Yeongjong Island held protests against the center.“Is Yeongjong Island a prison? What is the deal with the refugee center?” read one of the placards hoisted by civic groups, who vowed to “oppose the center to death.” It was a not-so-subtle indicator of the prejudice some Koreans have for refugees and foreigners in general.Korea’s hostility toward foreigners appears to have been fueled by reports that the number of crimes committed by foreigners has increased. Rep. You Dae-woon of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy recently called for governmental countermeasures on the rising crime by foreigners, pointing out that criminal cases involving foreigners jumped from 22,543 in 2010 to 30,684 in 2014. The number of arrests per 100,000 also rose from 824 to 882 in the same period.But local experts say discrimination is one of the major reasons the foreigners commit crimes. Kim Jung-hyu, a professor of American Studies at Keimyung University, studied the cases of 800 immigrants in Korea and extrapolated that financial distortion, discrimination and mistreatment were the most important factors that lead to crimes by immigrants.“Immigrants feel greater pain from being victimized by crime than local residents, because social minorities suffer more from the same damage. ... This means victimized foreigners are likely to be angrier (than victimized Koreans),” he wrote in an article, “Foreign Migrants: symbolic violence and discrimination,” published in the journal Korean Criminological Review.Such discrimination has ailed Vincent ― not his real name ― who fled political oppression against minorities in his African home country in 2012. He is currently waiting for the Justice Ministry to approve of his application for refugee status. The ministry tallies the number of asylum seekers from 2010-2014 at 9,155, but roughly 1 in 30 have been accepted as a refugee. Vincent and the remaining thousands live outside the protection of the social welfare system, receiving medical treatment, and on the insecure G-1 visa ― a temporary residential visa for asylum seekers, foreigners involved in lawsuits, and others allowed to stay on humanitarian grounds. Three years, the birth of a child, and many nights of struggle have passed since Vincent first handed in his paperwork.“I am here with my family. My kid was born in Korea, but she does not have a document because of my current status,” he said. The Youngjong Elementary case had a particular meaning to Vincent, who says he is concerned about the education of his 2-year-old daughter.“The law seems to be very tight for children. There should be a way to make children feel that they belong to the universe,” he said. “I worry everyday (about my daughter) because she has to go to school soon. I don’t know how to handle that.”Another hurdle standing in the way of the 36-year-old African is his G-1 visa.“My former boss used (my status) to his advantage. He made me and my wife work overtime without providing food or anything. He used to call us (expletive) every day,” said Vincent.“His problem was that we’re Africans, we are refugees; we don’t have a choice.”One day, things got heated between Vincent and the employer, who terminated the contract. When he went to the labor office, the officials did not overrule the termination and told him to pursue legal action.Vincent now runs a small business on a porter truck he bought. “Getting a job is not easy,” he said.He said that even many who do not know that he is an asylum seeker give him a hard time because of his ethnicity.“When you have black skin, it doesn’t work well for you (in Korea),” he said. During his time working at a factory, he recounted there was a “caste system” among workers, even immigrants. Chinese, whose appearance and culture are relatively similar to Koreans’, were at the top while Africans were at the very bottom.“You get into a bar and there is only one seat left. And there is a Korean sitting near. You go sit there, and he just leaves. Nobody’s going to sit beside you. Same in the subway,” he said. Vincent said his wife came home crying one day because, Korean women who worked with her gave her a hard time, saying “Namsae! Namsae! (smell!).”“I understand it’s a culture that is not very familiar with foreigners, especially Africans. It’s very common practice,” he said. “Believe me, I don’t feel comfortable with that. But I don’t have a choice.”Despite the rising number of multicultural families, Korea remains a largely homogeneous society in terms of ethnicity and culture. According to Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, there are some 820,000 members of multicultural families in 2015, roughly 1.6 percent of the country’s 51.5 million population.There is a widespread belief that Korea is a country of single ethnicity. Up until 2007, the country’s high school history textbook stated that Korea was “one of the rare countries in the world that retains a tradition of a single-ethnicity society.”The strong sense of nationality by Koreans is well demonstrated in their interest and pride toward prominent foreign individuals of Korean descent, such as World Bank chief Jim Yong Kim, or celebrities like golfer Michelle Wie or retired footballer Hines Ward, whose mother is Korean.Such sentiment of “one nation,” however, also makes it harder for Koreans to accept people of foreign descents. But Seol Dong-hoon, a professor of sociology at Chonbuk National University, warned against vilifying the anti-refugee movement as collective selfishness.“We need to pay attention to what the people are complaining about. Many problems can occur from the government driving all the refugees into one place,” he said, pointing out that many of the people seeking refugee status are at the bottom of the social ladder. “Putting all the (refugee) children at one school can be difficult for teachers who have to take care of them. Local residents are also concerned over the possibility that the concentrated refugee population will convert their town into a slum.”He said that the authorities must take measures, which can include distributing the refugee children to several adjacent schools. “We have to approach the issue from a systematic point of view. We can’t just say ‘Oh, these people are selfish,’ and be done with it.”Experts like Seol say Korea need to find ways to persuade people of Korea to amicably accept refugees as part of the society. Refugees say an open-minded attitude is a precondition for this to happen.“I think Korea will be even better if some people could have an open mind for foreigners. Give a little leeway for foreigners to express themselves, get to know them even better. Because you judge me when you don’t know me,” said Vincent.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","makes refugee life tougher ,prejudice makes refugee life ,refugee life tougher with ,in korea their hardships ,refugee life tougher","['South Korea', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea']",3,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.64867908  0.25506625

Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, speaks during a meeting with reporters in Seoul on Thursday. (Yonhap)“Think of what has happened since the 1950s. You can think of big milestones of the history of your country,” Pierre Krahenbuhl, commissioner general of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, said in a meeting with Korean reporters in Seoul.“What you have achieved is a very strong message. Things are possible when the political environment, economic environment and human environment improve, and things change fundamentally,” he added, noting the abject situations of Palestinians suffering from “exclusions, humiliation and lack of the freedom of movement.” Following his visit to Tokyo, Krahenbuhl came here to meet with senior Seoul officials including Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and Korean International Cooperation Agency president Kim Young-mok to further strengthen the partnership between Seoul authorities and the agency.This year, Seoul, which has engaged in the support for innovation in the information and technology area in the conflict-laden region, has donated some $1.8 million to UNRWA activities. The organization spends between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion a year. The U.S. is the single largest financial donor with a yearly contribution of around $380 million, followed by the EU and Saudi Arabia with around $100 million each.Established in December 1949 after the end of World War II in 1945, the 30,000-staff UNRWA is currently providing support for some 5 million Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. The agency offers assistance in the fields of education, health care, social services and relief assistance in the war-devastated zones. Above all, the most crucial area that UNRWA has engaged in is education, the commission general said, calling it the “only factor of hope” for the refugees. The organization currently runs 700 schools in the Middle East to provide nine years of education to some 500,000 Palestinian refugees ages 6-16.“In a situation where the Middle East is filled with conflicts, risks of further radicalization, problems of opportunities and threats, and risks of displacement, education is, in a way, the only factor of hope in the lives of hundreds of thousands of young Palestinians for a better future,” he said.While talking of the importance of education, Krahenbuhl introduced a poem about hope, which was in a notebook found in a Gaza-based war-torn UNRWA school last year. The poem was handwritten by Rua Kheidh, a 13-year-old Palestinian girl who survived the armed conflict.The poem reads, “Hope is a friend that never betrays you. It may leave you for a while, but always comes back. One should not look for happiness in the neighbor’s garden. One should always look for happiness in one’s own garden.”After reading it out to reporters, the UNRWA chief said, “I promised that her notebook would travel around the world to convey her message. So we are very much looking forward to strengthening our relationship with Korea further in order to allow young girls like Rua to continue to study.”Asked to offer his views on the North Korean refugee crisis, he said that what he can relate to is the experience of refugees, though his agency’s mandate is clearly focused on the refugee issues in the Middle East.“I think if you think of what it means to be a refugee, it means to have fled your home, have abandoned most things that are important to you in your life. It means to have made a split set of decisions about where to go and where to stay,” he said.“I think what people have to understand is you cannot neglect such a community.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","hope for palestinians korea ,korean war is message ,for palestinians korea rise ,korea postwar rise message ,palestinians korea rise","['Korea ’s', 'palestinian', 'U.N.', 'Seoul', 'Pierre Krahenbuhl', 'the U.N.

Many Koreans were conscripted into the Japanese military or drafted to work in the military industrial sector, being deployed in Japan and other countries against their will.  Many of them returned home after the 1945 liberation of Korea, following Japan's defeat in World War II, but others remained. Many are believed to have died during the war.  It is unclear how many people were mobilized for forced labor and died. Some civic groups claim the number of conscripts goes up to a million or more.

In terms of the normalization of their relations, the summit itself carries considerable meaning,” said Lee Won-deog, Japan expert at Seoul’s Kookmin University.Lee also noted that Abe indicated he could make some concessions on the issue of Korean victims of Japan’s wartime sexual slavery. His position has been that it was settled completely through a 1965 treaty that normalized bilateral relations.“Abe agreed to accelerate the negotiations, although his consistent position has been that the issue has already been resolved. To put the outcome of the summit in a positive light, this could be an indication of some progress on the issue,” he said.However, the two leaders failed to set a deadline for resolving the issue. Some observers noted that Abe’s agreement to accelerate negotiations was just a diplomatic gesture to prevent Park, the host of the high-stakes summit, from losing face. “What Abe agreed to was something he did to cater to Seoul’s position as he came here as a guest. I believe the possibility of Japan taking relevant action on the sexual slavery issue that meets Seoul’s expectations is very slim,” said Nam Chang-hee, diplomacy professor at Inha University.“Unless Seoul offers something in return that matches the level of Japan’s potential concessions on the sexual slavery issue, Japan may not change its stance.”Since April 2014, the two sides have held nine rounds of director-general-level talks over the issue of the victims, euphemistically called comfort women. But no clear progress has been reported so far, indicating the difficulties addressing an issue that Seoul regards as the wartime human rights issue that goes beyond the bilateral issue.The comfort women issue is one of many issues that have long strained bilateral relations.Japanese conservative politicians have visited the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo that honors the Japanese war dead, despite strong protests from Seoul and Beijing. Tokyo has also stepped up its sovereignty claim to Korea’s easternmost islets of Dokdo, which Japan calls Takeshima.Japan’s distortion of history in school textbooks has also aggravated diplomatic friction. Japan’s moves to push the limits of its pacifist constitution to allow it to exercise the right to collective self-defense and expand its security role have also sparked security concerns to Japan’s onetime colony.Describing Monday’s summit as a bilateral step to widen the possibilities of settling an array of thorny issues, Nam of Inha University stressed the need for Seoul to employ a well-thought-out policy on Japan rather than applying “only pressure” on it to settle the issues.“Currently, Japan’s political landscape is not favorable for South Korean diplomacy as Japan’s opposition forces crumbled with conservative politicians dominating both chambers of Japan’s legislature,” he said.“Thus, to induce some change in Japan’s stance, Seoul needs to employ a smarter approach rather than being too straightforward and ratcheting up pressure on Japan to address the thorny issues. This will not work, even though it did to a certain extent in the 1990s when Japan’s Socialist Party held political influence.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","enslavement of korean women ,first summit between president ,thorniest bilateral issues japan ,of korean women analysts ,japan wartime sexual enslavement","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe']",3,"[ 1.          2.          1.         ... -0.51584357  0.2304735

One of the key pending issues is a demand by former Korean sex slaves for an apology and compensation from Japan.  Japan has so far refused to comply with the demand, insisting that the comfort women were recruited by civilian profiteers and its wartime military-led government was not directly involved.  The issue has gained urgency in recent years as the victims are dying off. In 2007, more than 120 South Korean victims were alive, but the number has since dropped to 47, with their average age standing at nearly 90.  Historians estimate that more than 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were sexually enslaved by Japanese troops during World War II.        The two leaders also agreed to continue to cooperate on North Korea's nuclear weapons program.  South Korea and Japan have been involved in the long-stalled negotiations, along with the U.S. and other regional powers, to try to coax North Korea to abandon its nuclear program.  On Sunday, Park and Abe held a trilateral summit with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in Seoul, and they agreed to make efforts for a quick resumption of the nuclear talks that also involve China and Russia.  Still, there are signs of progress in resuming the talks that were last held in 2008.  North Korea has recently hinted that it may conduct another nuclear test and vowed to launch a series of satellites as part of its space development program.

The state set legal limits on the use of packing materials and disposable products; imposed waste fees on manufacturers that make unrecyclable products; and provided support for the recycling industry. The regulation also included introducing a deposit refund system, which returns a deposit to the waste-generating companies once they collect back their waste. The rule targeted six types of industries -- food, detergents, batteries, tires, electronics and lubricants. A waste truck dumps unrecycled trash at a landfill in Incheon. (Sudokwon Landfill Site Management Corporation)Along with the recycling promotion law, the government initiated a volume-based disposal system in 1995 to encourage waste sorting and to cut down on garbage by charging citizens based on the amount of waste they throw out. All trash must be disposed in state-authorized plastic bags that are available at local stores. The price differs according to municipality and district, with Seoul City levying 413 won per 20 liters of trash on average. Busan imposes the highest rate, at 813 won per 20 kilograms as of now. The system sharply reduced household waste, as the daily trash amount dropped by about 10,000 tons to some 49,000 tons on average in 2013, compared to 1994, according to the Environment Ministry. This is equivalent to one person generating 0.94 kilograms of trash per day on average in 2013, which is down 360 grams from 1994, the ministry said. Starting from last year, the government also initiated a volume-rate disposal system for food waste. Each citizen pays according to the volume of their food waste measured by three types -- plastic bags, RFID reader or electronic chips. Collecting food waste was discretionally run by municipal offices for years until 2013. Most of the food waste is recycled as animal feed.In a bid to expand the product-makers’ recycling participation, the state revised the deposit refund system to the “Extended Producer Responsibility” system in 2003. The new scheme aimed to induce manufacturers to pursue greener choices during the entire production process from designing to disposing the product.Under the system, the Environment Ministry allocates a certain recycling quota to each industry every year based on the production level and waste management. If one fails to achieve the recycling goal, the company is fined. The push for the EPR system had a drastic impact as the recycling rate among the industries under the regulation surged by 64 percent to 1.54 million tons in 2013 from 2002. Thanks to such recycling measures, over 83 percent of the overall generated waste is being recycled as of now, with the rest either getting buried in the landfill site or incinerated, the ministry said. To further raise the recycling rate, the government expanded the recycling drive to the vehicle and metal industries in 2008 with a new rule that encourages them to reuse old cars, and replace natural metals with recycled ones for raw materials. In addition, the government has been moving to boost the trade of recyclable resources by connecting waste suppliers with recycling companies through an online market or mobile application starting last year. Individuals can take part in the market as both buyers and sellers. As of December last year, over 100,000 subscribed to the market service, making about 750,000 deals, the ministry’s data showed.The ministry is now seeking to use the waste as an energy source, with a particular focus on converting the combustible waste into solid recovered fuel. While only 1.5 percent or 58,000 tons are currently utilized as an energy source due to the lack of facilities and technology, the government is aiming to use 90 percent of the combustible waste as an energy source by 2020, which is equivalent to 3.4 million tons a year. Although the government is stepping up these green initiatives, the country also faces persistent conflicts over managing waste that is not recycled, especially over using the limited landfill space. Earlier this year, Seoul City, Incheon and Gyeonggi province were embroiled in a controversy over extending the use of a landfill site in Incheon. While the site was originally expected to become full and set to close by the end of next year, Seoul City and Gyeonggi Province asked Incheon to extend the period as the site was only half-full. About 48 percent of trash dumped daily at the Incheon landfill is from Seoul, while another 34 percent comes from Gyeonggi Province and the remainder from Incheon. Incheon at first rejected the demand, citing residents’ complaints, but later agreed to extend it by 10 years in return for the handover of the land ownership worth 1.8 trillion won ($1.6 billion) and the right to collect waste commission fees worth 120 billion won a year.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","korea systematic recycling drive ,decades korea has proactively ,systematic recycling drive boosts ,korea systematic recycling ,recycling drive boosts sustainability",['Korea'],3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68113285  0.24313664

The sex ratio indicates the number of boys born for every 100 girls. The team chose the period of the early and mid-1990s for their work as the technology for defining the sex of the fetus became available in the country around that time.A regression analysis found that an increase in the boys-to-girls ratio from 105 to 115 would be associated with an increase in women’s time spent on housework by 34 minutes per day during the period. For example, in 1990, the wives married into families from North Gyeongsang Province spent 65 minutes more per day on housework, compared to women married to men from Incheon, the research showed. The two regions showed a stark contrast in preference for boys, with the average sex ratio of North Gyeongsang Province being 131 compared to Incheon’s 112.Out of 16 provinces cited in the study, the highest sex ratio at birth was recorded in Daegu followed by North Gyeongsang Province, Ulsan, South Gyeongsang Province and Busan. “The research implies that the household gender disparity can only be tackled when husbands change their attitudes towards gender roles as socio-economic conditions for women continues to improve,” the professor said. He expected, however, that the gender imbalance in household could have narrowed at a faster pace in the 2000s as the preference for sons in the country has been constantly abating. The sex ratio in South Korea reached 116.5 in 1990, but the figure fell to 105.3 in 2014, the lowest ever. The average global sex ratio is between 104 to 106 boys per 100 girls, according to the United Nations Population Fund. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","wives do more chores ,chores south korean women ,korean women married to ,korean women married ,south korean women married","['south korean', 'korean', 'Gyeongsang Province', 'Lee Chul - h']",3,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.63589007  0.43559664

The report was written after analyzing government data on medical records of some 1 million Koreans aged 30 or older, from 2002-2010.The report found that underweight Koreans, defined as those with a body mass index of 18.5 or below, had a 2.2 times higher hazard ratio for death than those overweight -- who have BMI of 23-24.9. The hazard ratio for death in underweight Koreans was in fact higher than for obese Koreans (BMI of 25 or above) as well. Among Koreans aged 50 or older, this pattern was even more prevalent. The hazard ratio for death in underweight Koreans in the specific age group was three times higher than those overweight.  (123RF)“It is true that an obese person is at a higher risk of developing chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease,” said Dr. Kim Shin-kon, who participated in the research. “But our research findings may suggest that those who are overweight actually are more cautious about their health, as they know what their risks are and what to watch out for. They also tend to get medical check-ups more frequently.”Dr. Kim also said malnutrition and being underweight can be a serious health threat to those aged 50 or older, as the conditions can critically affect their immune system. Those with a weakened immune system are much more vulnerable to diseases such as pneumonia and Herpes Zoster, he said. “It is important for the elderly to remain in healthy weight ranges while trying to increase bone and muscle mass,” he said, recommending all senior citizens to invest 10 to 15 minutes daily in exercising.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","overweight koreans may live ,underweight koreans had higher ,overweight koreans may ,obesity is more ,overweight koreans","['south korean', 'Korea University', 'Koreans']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.58878034  0.58254385

He is also Japan's chief delegate to the now-suspended six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear program.Lee Sang-duk, director-general of the South Korean foreign ministry's Northeast Asian bureau, plans to hold an ""introductory meeting"" with him, the source said, adding that the comfort women issue is expected to be discussed.The timing is drawing keen attention. President Park Geun-hye of South Korea has offered to hold her first summit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Nov. 2 on the sidelines of a trilateral summit also involving Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, according to Cheong Wa Dae.Japan has not responded yet as Seoul and Tokyo are apparently staging a war of nerves over key agenda items. Abe's trip to South Korea next week seems guaranteed but his itinerary remains unconfirmed.Park wants Abe to clarify his view on the comfort women issue, while Abe hopes for a summit with no preconditions attached, multiple media reports said.South Koreans regard the conservative Japanese leader as reluctant to apologize for Japan's atrocities during World War II.Around 200,000 Korean and other nations' women were forced into sexual servitude for Japanese troops.Japan's major daily Yomiuri Shimbun reported that ""the South Korean side demanded Prime Minister Abe express his position on the comfort women issue while staying in Seoul.

A captain-led unit is scheduled to be launched on Dec. 1 to defend the base together with the Navy’s 7th Task Flotilla and part of the Submarine Force Command, which will move to the island from their current headquarters in Busan and Jinhae, South Gyeongsang Province, respectively, a Navy official said. When their relocation ends, the base located in the southern town of Gangjeong is expected to house more than 3,000 seamen and their families. With more than 91 percent of construction having been completed, a launch ceremony will take place in mid-December to early January, the official noted. “The stationed forces are tasked with guarding the port and nearby waters and maintaining facilities there,” the official said.  Priests hold Mass in front of the construction site on Jejudo Island on Oct. 12 in protest against the anticipated launch of a naval base. (Yonhap)Initiated in 2007, the project has repeatedly been postponed by vehement protests of activists and villagers who filed a lawsuit to foil the construction work on concerns over potential environmental degradation and militarization of the site famous for tourist attractions. The focal point was the proposed destruction of the “Gureombi” volcanic rock, which measures 1.2 kilometers in length and 150 meters in width and provides a habitat for endangered species such as striped shore crabs and narrow-mouthed toads.It kicked into high gear following the Supreme Court’s reversal of a lower court’s ruling that the job should be invalidated due to the absence of a prior environmental assessment. The top court, however, determined that the construction was legitimate because the Defense Ministry carried out the approval process again in 2010 after controversy broke out. The initiative is designed to set up a “military-civilian” compound on the island, 90 kilometers off the peninsula’s south coast, with piers and other facilities to dock a mobile fleet of up to 20 naval vessels and a number of 150,000-ton cruisers.The military has claimed that the installation is key to properly coping with contingencies in the southern sea area, securing the country’s maritime transportation routes and helping boost the regional economy.Military and local government officials have since stepped up efforts to soothe opponents’ jitters, holding various rounds of consultations and vowing to devise measures to minimize potential environmental damage. “The people consistently raise environmental concerns and we’re striving to take steps to appease them in cooperation with supervisory authorities,” the official noted, adding that the ongoing protest will not pose a major hurdle for the base’s takeoff. Though much of the public furor has died down, a mass organized by the Catholic Solidarity for the Realization of the Jeju, Peace Island, continues to take place every day at 11 a.m. in front of the entrance of the site in protest against the work. The association, established four years ago with more than 3,700 priests and ascetics from 15 Catholic groups, marked their anniversary on Oct. 12. Kang Eun-joo, an activist at the union, said the organization plans to carry on with their crusade even after the base opens, in partnership with other campaigners on the scene and those from St. Francis Peace Center in the village. “It may not be as fierce as our previous activities at the site and take different forms, but we will continue our work,” she told The Korea Herald. “Our desperation is no match for that of the residents. Rather than the base’s creation itself, we will focus on recovering the community as led by the center.”By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","navy to open jeju ,officials said monday captain ,ensuing delays the navy ,years of public protests ,navy to open","['Navy', 'Navy', 'the Submarine Force Command']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26868507  0.4045794

Moon Jae-in (center) browse through Korean history textbooks displayed at an exhibition opened at Bosingak park in downtown Seoul as part of the rallies to oppose state-authored textbook on Sunday. YonhapThey further said that the reinstatement of state-authored history textbook by the Seoul government was in line with its policies that have oppressed opportunities for free speech and liberty among the scholastic community for the past several years.The statement was signed by such renowned professors as Bruce Cummings of the University of Chicago and Don Baker of the University of British Columbia. Also joining were John Treat of Yale University, Ross King of University of British Columbia, Yoon Seung-joo of Carleton College, Kim Sun-joo Kim of Harvard University and Remco Breuker of Leiden University.Participants signed in from across the globe including the U.S., Singapore, Australia, the U.K., Japan, Denmark, France, Hong Kong, Spain, Israel, Romania, Russia and Norway.Their statement added that history did not entail precision as science does and that it is based on diverse insight of historians and that a single interpretation of history cannot make for good history.They warned the state history textbook would negatively affect Korea’s international reputation as a democratic society and weaken Korea’s position in fighting against Japan’s historical revisionism.  Ruling Saenuri Party chairman Rep.

The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles shedding light on refugees in Korea, their hardships, the systematic fallout, the country’s own history and ways to go forward. The following is the third installment. - Ed.From late President Kim Dae-jung to conscientious objectors and North Korean defectors, South Korea’s history has been dotted with marks of refugees since the country’s liberation in 1945. While stepping up efforts to embrace asylum seekers from across the border and around the world since the enactment of Asia’s first standalone refugee act in July 2013, Seoul has seen a constant rise in the number of its own citizens who obtained foreign citizenship for political and other reasons. As of December 2014, 481 refugees and 285 asylum seekers of South Korean origin live overseas, while 1,173 refugees, 3,489 asylum seekers and 204 stateless persons from abroad reside here, according to the U.N. Refugee Agency. Between 1951 and January 2013, 559 South Koreans were granted a refugee status, with another 186 undergoing screening. As for North Koreans, the figures reached 1,110 and 1,027 during the same period. The 1951 Refugee Convention outlines a refugee as someone who “owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.” Seoul signed the treaty in 1992. Civic activits stage a performance supporting conscientious objectors outside the Constitutional Court in Seoul in July, during a public hearing on whether to allow people to refuse mandatory military service based on their religious or personal beliefs. (Yonhap)Tokyo’s 1910-45 occupation on the peninsula in particular gave birth to various breeds of refugees who had to cross the border for forced labor, independent movement or other reasons. Now millions of ethnic Koreans -- the refugees’ descendants -- live across Japan, China, Russia and Central Asia. In 1947, the Japanese government demanded Koreans residing in Japan to register as foreigners in an apparent attempt to make them exempt from social security and other benefits, even though they did not have a nationality to inscroll because no government had yet been established on either side of the peninsula following its liberation. Even after the territorial division the next year, many did not choose a South or North Korean nationality, nor were they naturalized as Japanese. The number of stateless “Zainichi“ (meaning residing in Japan) is projected to stand at some 30,000 now, classified by Tokyo for administrative reasons as having Joseon citizenship. Their decades-long struggle is not confined to social discrimination at their second home. Their motherland, too, has been failing to facilitate what the people see as minimal civil liberty, such as freedom to visit.   Their lack of passports makes any overseas travel difficult, as they must acquire a reentry permit from the Japanese government on each return trip. To visit South Korea, they also need to apply for a travel certificate, but are often denied for unclear reasons or forced to change their nationality. In December 2013, Seoul’s Supreme Court ruled against Jeong Young-hwan, who raised a suit in 2009 against the South Korean consulate-general in Osaka for rejecting his request for a travel certificate. A “Joseon” national and university researcher on Korean studies, he had not had much difficulty traveling to Seoul until then, but the conservative Lee Myung-bak government denied it because he visited Pyongyang in 1999 and met an official of a pro-North Korea organization in Japan in 2006. The come-off of Jeong’s years-long legal battle came as a shock to many other Zainichi and activists. It also ran counter to the National Human Rights Commission’s 2009 recommendation to the foreign minister to correct customs that officials at overseas diplomatic missions urge or coax stateless Koreans in Japan to pick one nationality.  “The fact that South Korean nationality held concurrently with permanent residence of Japan is inadequate as a nationality has long been a contentious issue in Zainichi public discourse, especially during the intense confrontation between North Korea and South Korea against the backdrop of the Cold War,” said Moon Young-min, an art professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in the journal Japan Focus earlier this year. “Given the combination of the colonial past and contentious postcolonial involvement with Cold War politics by Zainichi Koreans, which virtually split the expatriate community into the North Korea-supporting camp and the South Korea-supporting camp, naturalization continues to carry a certain weight as a litmus test of one’s allegiance and integrity.” A more renowned exile is late President Kim Dae-jung, who had fought against political persecution as a prominent opposition leader during the dictatorship under Park Chung-hee. He took asylum twice -- in Japan in the 1970s and in the U.S. in the 1980s -- amid several assassination attempts, kidnapping, imprisonment, house arrest and other hardships. Long after democracy flourished on this soil and the Nobel laureate’s presidency ended, the country continues to struggle to transform into a safe asylum provider, due in part to the ongoing territorial division and inter-Korean face-off. In recent years, a growing number of North Korean defectors resettled in the South opt to leave for a third country such as the U.S., Britain or Australia. The primary rationale behind the exodus was to access a better social safety net and break free from social exclusion and cutthroat competition against more affluent, better educated South Koreans in an already saturated job market. Defectors here have reported a wide range of social and financial problems. Cultural and educational gaps could take years to overcome. Prejudice among South Koreans is another factor as politics and ideology frame them despite their common ethnicity. A 2011 survey on 8,299 defectors by the North Korean Refugees Foundation showed that more than 30 percent earn less than 1 million won ($890) a month. The jobless rate averaged at 12.1 percent -- 3.3 times the general population’s 3.7 percent.Critics have called on the government to set up a system to help defectors land a more secure job and plan for their later years.With all physically able young men being subject to compulsory military service for about two years here, meanwhile, Seoul has also been taking flak for incarcerating conscientious objectors despite the religious freedom enshrined in the constitution. In 2012, Lee Ye-da became the first conscientious objector to earn the refugee status in France. The 24-year-old has since been in the forefront of the campaign against the practice. He was one of the 5,723 people who have refused to serve in the military over the past 10 years, according to data submitted by the Defense Ministry to Rep. Jin Sung-joon of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy. Of the 5,215 who received a criminal penalty, 599 are currently in jail. Watchtower International, a Jehovah’s Witnesses nongovernmental organization, estimated that since 1950, 18,060 conscientious objectors have been put in prison in South Korea. The issue was once again highlighted in the U.S. State Department’s annual international religious freedom report released this month and a deliberation last week on Seoul’s implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in Geneva.“While absolved of any additional military commitment, after serving time in prison conscientious objectors had a criminal record that could affect future employment opportunities, including limitations on holding public office or working as a public servant,” the U.S. document said. To stem the outflow of refugees and preserve the right of the objectors, the U.N., the U.S. and other countries and civic groups have urged the Constitutional Court here to decriminalize conscientious objection and the government to devise an alternative service system. Seoul remains cautious given unsettled worries that any substitute measure may well be taken advantage of by potential evaders, though it apparently acknowledges the criticism. In January, President Park Geun-hye reduced sentences by one to four months for about 100 Jehovah’s Witness objectors in prison.“Military service is a national obligation under the constitution, and the Supreme Court and Constitutional Court have also ruled for punishment on vetoers,” Vice Justice Minister Kim Joo-hyun said during the deliberation in Geneva last Friday. “An alternative service system is an issue that can be considered as the security situation on the peninsula changes and public consensus builds.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","refugees in korea their ,on refugees in korea ,refugees in korea ,in korea their hardships ,refugees part of korea","['South Korea', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea']",3,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.65655541  0.1543009

Considering Boko Haram is based in the North, there is little possibility of being persecuted if he lives in Lagos,” the court said in its ruling. The militant group Boko Haram, whose name loosely translates to “Western education is a sin” in the Hausa language, has caused havoc in Nigeria and its neighboring countries through bombings, assassinations and abductions. It is fighting to overthrow the government and create an Islamic state. The court questioned his “sincerity” in the refugee application, noting that he expressed his intention to return home after earning money here earlier in 2007 when he claimed asylum in Korea for the first time.The Nigerian applied for refugee status in 2007 during his short trip to Korea on a tourist visa. Claiming to be the son of the chief of a tribe based in Bama, he argued that Boko Haram had attacked him and his family after he granted his tribe members the freedom of religion. But the immigration office did not accept his application at the time.The ruling reverses the lower court’s earlier decision that required the immigration office to revoke the deportation order. The court had seen a clear disadvantage for him if he is forcibly sent back home, saying that the Nigerian would likely get refugee status here if his claims were found to be true. The deportation order will be suspended while the application process is underway, which normally takes two to three years. He will be housed in the detention center for foreigners until a decision is taken. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","korea to deport nigerian ,to deport nigerian fleeing ,threats from the terrorist ,deport nigerian fleeing boko ,nigerian fleeing boko haram","['nigerian', 'South Korea', 'islamist', 'Boko Haram', 'Nigerian']",3,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.55325472 -0.00332452

""The cease-fire situation hampers sufficient cooperation between South and North.""Russia is a member of the now-suspended six-party talks that produced a deal in 2005 to end North Korea's nuclear program in exchange for economic and political concessions.As Pyongyang backtracked on the agreement, Seoul and Washington have demanded the communist country first demonstrate its commitment to its obligations to restart the negotiations.""I believe the resumption of the six-party denuclearization talks should not be linked to any preconditions,"" Timonin said.""That's why I think Pyongyang's proposal (for peace treaty talks) is worth taking note.

Security Council to take up the North's human rights issue as an agenda item, he said in the Sept. 25-dated report that was posted on the U.N. website on Wednesday.Ban also made a series of recommendations urging the North to take concrete steps to improve the situation, invite the U.N. special rapporteur to visit the country, engage meaningfully with all U.N. member states and provide unimpeded access to U.N. and humanitarian agencies.Last year, the U.N. General Assembly adopted a landmark resolution calling for referring the North to the International Criminal Court for human rights violations. The resolution led to the Security Council adopting the issue as an official agenda item for the first time.Sources at the U.N. said that South Korea, the United States and like-minded partners have begun drafting a new resolution that would also call for referring those responsible for the North's abuses of its hunger-stricken people to the ICC.Chances are not high for the Security Council to actually refer the issue to the ICC because China and Russia, which have friendlier ties with North Korea than any other countries, are expected to veto such a move. Still, such resolutions play a great role in drawing international attention to the issue.North Korea has long been labeled as one of the worst human rights violators. The communist regime does not tolerate dissent, holds hundreds of thousands of people in political prison camps and keeps tight control over outside information.But the North has bristled at such criticism, calling it a U.S.-led attempt to topple its regime.In June, the State Department said in its annual human rights report that the North's human rights record ""remained among the worst in the world"" last year with public executions, political prison camps, torture and other abuses.

115,115,Debate brews over talks of new retirement age in Korea,"The Korean government’s proposal to raise the state pension age from 65 to 70 in its attempt to save on the cost of welfare programs is facing fierce opposition from the elderly population as well as local experts and critics.　Once the proposal is implemented, those aged 65-69 will become ineligible to receive all state welfare benefits for the elderly, including state pension payments and free public transportatio...","The Korean government’s proposal to raise the state pension age from 65 to 70 in its attempt to save on the cost of welfare programs is facing fierce opposition from the elderly population as well as local experts and critics.Once the proposal is implemented, those aged 65-69 will become ineligible to receive all state welfare benefits for the elderly, including state pension payments and free public transportation. The proposal was recently released after the Korea Senior Citizens’ Association, one of the largest representative bodies of Korean senior citizens, publicly showed its support to the government’s plan to raise the retirement age back in May. Senior citizens protest against the Welfare Ministry`s policies for the elderly. (Yonhap)“We have decided that this is the right way to coexist with the younger generation, who are struggling with unemployment,” said Kang Se-hoom from the KSCA, which has some 3 million members. “We hope that the change of the retirement age can help the government create more (welfare) programs and jobs for young Koreans.”However, a man who has connection to the organization, who did not wish to be named, said the number of KSCA members in their 60s is very small compared to those currently aged 70 or older, and therefore the vast majority of the members won’t be affected even if the retirement age changes. The KSCA refused to give the exact numbers of members in the 60s and those aged 70 or older. According to the man, the KSCA has been receiving aggressive requests to support the government proposal from the public transit companies, who claimed that the exemption of public transportation fares among the elderly has been one of their major cases of deficits. The fares have been free for all citizens aged 65 or older since 1984. Last year, Seoul Metro, a public corporation that runs Seoul Subway Lines 1, 2, 3, 4 and 9, reported net losses of 158.7 billion won ($139.9 million), mostly caused by fare exemption for the elderly. The Health Ministry predicts that some 2.3 trillion won in welfare programs will be saved once the retirement age is raised to 70 from the current 65. However, Nonyeon Union, a group of elderly unionized workers, warned that raising the retirement age would result in more suicides among the elderly. Korea’s elderly suicide rate has more than tripled since 2000, almost four times higher than the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development average as of 2010. Almost 50 percent of the entire elderly population are living below the poverty line as of last year, partly because of inadequate public welfare programs. “One of the government’s reasons for proceeding with this proposal is that, more than 80 percent of the elderly population in Korea does not define those in their 60s as ‘senior citizens,’ according to their recent survey,” said Koh Hyun-jong from the union. “I’m sure one would feel flattered if she or he is told that they look younger than they actually are. But feeling flattered cannot compensate for what we need in order to survive during our postretirement age.”Professor Lee Geum-yong from Samgmyung University said changing the retirement age can have a critical impact on the lives of those aged 65-69, especially those who don’t have a postretirement plan.“(In Korea), the quality of one’s life can worsen significantly after he or she retires,” he said. “Getting a job that pays enough after retirement is not easy. The current welfare programs are not enough for one to have an income that he or she used to have before retiring from their job.”A recent report showed that transfer payments, such as social retirement benefits and public pension payments, only make up about 28.8 percent of the average income of the Korean elderly, while they account for almost 70 percent of the average income of senior citizens in many European countries, such as Denmark and the U.K.  The high elderly poverty rate and inadequate public transfer payments mean that most of the Korean elderly must stay employed, even if they don’t want to, or financially depend on their family members or children in order to live above the poverty line, the report claimed.

Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony from 1910-45.""I think South Korea and Japan should move toward a new future together based on the spirit of a correct recognition of history and friendship and good neighborliness,"" Park said in a video message to a South Korea-Japan friendship meeting at a Seoul hotel.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made a similar call in a separate video message, saying South Korea and Japan are the ""most important"" neighbors that share strategic interests.""I would like to further develop relations with South Korea,"" he said, adding that people-to-people exchanges are important.Park is set to host the leaders of China and Japan for a trilateral summit in early November.A trilateral summit has not been held since May 2012 due to tensions over Japan's attempts to whitewash its wartime atrocities and colonial occupation.It remains to be seen whether Park and Abe will hold their first bilateral summit on the sidelines. Park said last week that the three-way talks could be an opportunity to meet separately with Abe.However, South Korea recently denounced Japan for Abe's offering to a Tokyo war shrine and urged it to demonstrate by action its humble reflection and repentance.South Korea and China view the Yasukuni Shrine -- which honors over 2.4 million war dead, including 14 convicted Class-A war criminals -- as a symbol of Japan's past imperialism.

William Gortney, commander of U.S. Northern Command, said earlier this month he agrees with the intelligence community's assessment the North has the ability and technology to put nuclear weapons on rockets that can reach the continental United States.Lee, however, said North Korea has not mastered the miniaturization technology, citing South Korea's spy agency.

The basement will be used as an archive and for management purposes, the foundation said.The foundation said it hopes the building will serve as a bridge of friendship between the two nations.In 1891, King Gojong, the 26th king of the Joseon Dynasty and the first emperor of the Korea Empire, bought the building, currently located in the Logan Circle Historic District, some 10 minutes' drive from the White House, for US$25,000, a huge sum at that time.The Korean Empire was the name of the Joseon Dynasty during its final 13 years.The Victorian-style building was used as home for the Korean legation in the U.S. until 1910, when Japan took over the ownership of the building for just $5 as soon as Korea went under its colonial rule, and sold it to an American for $10.It is the only former overseas establishment of the Korean Empire that still has its original shape.The building has great historical value as a symbol of the Joseon Dynasty's pursuit of an independent diplomacy to escape from rising pressure from China, Russia and Japan to open up after the Treaty of Amity and Commerce was signed with the U.S. in 1882.""This is a scene of our historical independent diplomacy and the cradle of Korea-U.S. friendship,"" said O Soo-dong, head of the foundation, during a press briefing. ""This is a symbol of us overcoming the shameful history and realizing a proud Republic of Korea.""O said the foundation plans to formally open the facility to the public in early 2017.

The Park Geun-hye administration has been boasting that its bilateral relations with the U.S. and China are at their “best-ever.” After appearing alongside Chinese leader Xi Jinping at a massive military parade in Beijing last month, she took the podium with U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House over the weekend, showing off their rapport and voicing in unison against Pyongyang’s nuclear ambitions.  President Park Geun-hye (left) speaks as her U.S. counterpart Barack Obama looks on at a news conference at the White House in Washington on Friday. (Bloomberg-Yonhap)Yet, fueled in part by Japan’s extensive lobbying, concerns have risen since her swearing-in in February 2013 in the government and academic circles in Washington that South Korea was “leaning” toward China, while toughening its line against Japan, due to historical and territorial tensions, shunning the trilateral security cooperation sought by the U.S. Park’s address at the Center for Strategic and International Studies on Thursday demonstrated Seoul’s efforts to tackle the view. Unveiling its plan for a three-way summit with Beijing and Tokyo, she displayed her willingness to meet one-on-one for the first time with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to provide a chance for the two countries to “clear away obstacles hindering closer bilateral ties.” While some observers said her trip to the U.S. helped offset what critics have called “history fatigue,” the deepening quandary was laid bare once again at her joint news conference with Obama the following day as he urged Park to “speak out” if China fails to abide by international norms and rules. “Just as we do, because we think that both of our countries have benefited from the international norms and rules that have been in place since the end of World War II,” Obama said. “And we don’t want to see those rules of the road weakening, or some countries taking advantage because they’re larger. That’s not good for anybody ― including South Korea.” Though his remarks were accompanied by his support for a strong relationship between Seoul and Beijing, as well as the emerging power’s peaceful rise, they also indicated the potential of future friction between the longtime allies when the Sino-U.S. rivalry escalates, such as over trade, currency or maritime security. First and foremost at stake are conflicts in the South China Sea. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific Affairs Daniel Russel has also called for Seoul to voice out against Beijing’s ongoing construction of artificial islands and other provocative acts near the islands claimed by some Southeast Asian countries. After making the call at another CSIS forum last June, Russel once again said during a news conference one day before the Park-Obama summit: “It is a good thing for the leaders of China to hear directly from another democratically ― from a democratically elected president in a neighboring country” about its behavior regarding freedom of navigation and commerce. “As the U.S. presidential election draws near and contenders engage in ‘China bashing’ next year, Seoul may come under pressure to make a tricky choice over delicate issues such as a possible stationing of advanced U.S. missile defense assets here, as it did when joining a China-led development bank early this year,” a diplomatic source said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. For the Park government to better position itself between the two world powers, it should craft a long-term strategy and practice policy in a manner that is consistent and serves national interests, a foreign policy expert said.“I think the persistent criticism of her foreign policy stems from the lack of a grand vision and concrete action plans to realize it. Though it’s wise to sustain good relationships both with the U.S. and China, its policy should be consistent and persuadable to other countries,” he said, wishing to remain anonymous.

(123RF)Korea is not the first country in Asia to offer government-sponsored matchmaking services as part of the national measure to boost its fertility rate. In Singapore, the government’s Social Development Unit has been offering matchmaking services for its citizens, including dating games and an online speed dating service, as part of its population policies. “Dating is one of the most personal activities in anyone’s life,” said researcher Cho Sung-ho from the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs. “It’s questionable if it is appropriate for the government to get involved in the dating lives of its citizens. When the state is encouraging the young population to get married, what is it saying about those who opt not to get married?”As single parenthood, especially of unwed women, is often socially stigmatized here, Korea has one of the lowest out-of-wedlock birthrates in the world, marking 2.1 percent as of 2010. This was dramatically lower than the rates of other countries like Ireland (64.1 percent) and Norway (55 percent).  Paik Young-gyung, an anthropology professor at Korea National Open University said the government’s demographic policies -- encouraging people to get married -- do not guarantee one’s rights to become a parent regardless of his or her marital status. “It does not recognize it as a right, but rather something that is given out of benevolence,” she said. “It also applies to one’s rights as a citizen and his or her right to housing. (While the government wants to boost its fertility rate), not all pregnancies in Korea end up in childbirths.”Factors behind the increasing number of delayed marriages in Korea include the growing number of young Koreans who prioritize education or career over forming a family and the expensive cost of weddings, housing and child care. On top of encouraging young Koreans to get married, the government has come up with a number of population policies targeting citizens in their 20s and 30s, such as housing benefits and discounts on wedding venues.However, critics of the government’s population policies said the current measures are not conscious of the changing cultural and social situations faced by the younger generation. For example, not all Koreans who choose not to have children do it because they can’t afford to get married, said Paik Young-gyung, an anthropology professor at Korea National Open University. “We are living in a world where people have different values, such as individual happiness. When an individual wants to not get married or not have children, for whatever reasons he or she may have, that decision must be respected,” she told The Korea Herald. “If the government is giving housing benefits to those who get married only, we are faced with this question: ‘Do young people who wish to stay single not deserve that benefit as much as young married couples do?’”Korea first implemented demographic policies to boost its fertility rate in 2006. Yet the nations’ birthrate last year was exactly the same as that in 2006, indicating the policies have failed.If the current birthrate remains steady, almost 15 percent of the population will be 65 or older by 2018, and the figure will rise to 50 percent by 2100, according to government data. The number of Korean schoolchildren is expected to drop to 5.61 million by 2030 from the current 10 million. Such government predictions have deepened concerns over the country’s fiscal stability and productivity.  “The government needs to work on the issues that need to be solved now, rather than preparing for what’s going to happen in the future,” said professor Paik, who stressed that the demographic policies probably wouldn’t be effective if the government does not try to tackle some of the biggest social problems faced by Koreans today, including unemployment and social inequality. “What the fertility rates show us is that life is difficult for the majority of Koreans right now. Getting married and having children shouldn’t be such big deals as they are in Korea today. The ideal society is where an individual feels that getting married and having children are something natural, rather than something that requires a lot of work and sacrifice.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","government report released sunday ,priority seats for pregnant ,korea to offer matchmaking ,matchmaking to boost fertility ,boost fertility rate after",['south korean'],3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34328902  0.50500631

I can finally meet my husband,"" said Lee Soon-kyu, 84.Since parting with Oh In-se, 83, during the war 65 years ago, Lee has performed a memorial rite for her husband over the past 37 years, believing that he might have died.Lee's 65-year-old son, Oh Jang-kyun, said, ""If I meet my father, I'd like to tightly hug my parents at the same time."" There are more than 66,000 South Korean family members separated by the Korean War, which ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, leaving South and North Korea technically at war.The issue of the separated families is one of the most pressing humanitarian matters as most of the surviving family members are in their 80s and older. About half of the estimated 129,700 applicants for the family reunions have died.As more separated family members have passed away, finding parent-child relations and husband-wife ones has become rarer. For the upcoming event, most of the separated families are looking to meet their siblings or close relatives.The feasibility of the reunions remained in doubt until the last minute due to the possibility of North Korea launching a long-range rocket.The North has a track record of unilaterally delaying scheduled reunion events, including in September 2013.But North Korea forwent such provocative acts on the 70th anniversary of the founding of its ruling Workers' Party, which fell on Oct. 10.The North also has remained silent about the recent summit between South Korean President Park Geun-hye and U.S. President Barack Obama, during which they jointly called on North Korea to give up its nuclear and missile programs.Since the first inter-Korean summit in 2000, the two Koreas have held 19 rounds of face-to-face family reunion events. Seven rounds of video-based reunions also have been held.Only some 18,800 family members from both sides have been allowed to have face-to-face reunions so far.

Following the creed enforced by the country’s then-governing political group the National Party, apartheid separated the multiethnic state, communities and families of South Africa, gating white privilege while downgrading black and minority rights. The South African embassy, in collaboration with the Korean Cultural Association, held a film screening event Thursday at the Seoul Museum of History with the movie “Skin,” in an effort to shed light on South Africa’s dark history. “Skin” is a 2008 biographical film based on the true story of Sandra Laing, a South African woman born to white parents, whose race was classified and reclassified by the government as being “black.”The bulk of the plot takes place in the mid-1960s in the thick of a racially charged era, portraying the inner contradictions of segregation on multiple personal levels.  South African Ambassador Nozuko Gloria Bam at a film screening event at the Seoul Museum of History on Thursday. Joel Lee/The Korea HeraldIn an interview with The Korea Herald, South African Ambassador Nozuko Gloria Bam said that since the democratic election of late Nelson Mandela in 1994, South Africa has made “significant progresses” across comprehensive spheres, including legal and political institutions, education, health and housing. “South Africa walked away from the precipice of war and bloodshed to create a democratic state based on a progressive constitution,” she said. “The end of apartheid restored dignity to all South Africans, rolling back the shadow of history and broadening opportunities for all.” The ambassador stressed that despite the advances made in building an inclusive society, healing the wounds of the past and redressing decades-long inequalities remained government imperatives. As one of the most unequal economies in the world, the privileges attached to race, class, space and gender have not been fully reversed, she pointed out. As an example, blacks received inferior education that would ensure inferior positions in society, the ambassador said, as vividly depicted by protagonist Sandra in a segregated white school. From 1960 to 1983, 3.5 million nonwhite South Africans were forcibly removed from homes into segregated neighborhoods, a scene mentioned in the film. Japanese, South Koreans and Taiwanese immigrants, with whom South Africa maintained diplomatic and economic relations, were given an “honorary white” status out of “white,” “black,” “colored” and “Indian” racial classifications, while Chinese descendants of migrant workers from the late 19th century were labeled “colored.”John Redmond, a British freelance journalist and long-time resident of Korea who lived in South Africa in the 1970s, told The Korea Herald of his firsthand experience of apartheid. “It was very horrible and I hated it even as a privileged white guy,” Redmond said. “Many people were opposed to it for sure, including Afrikaners. The rich and powerful whites tended to be more vocal about it, either for or against, as they did not have to fear losing their jobs.” Redmond, who visits Cape Town each year, said that the younger generations born after 1994 had “no concept of apartheid whatsoever,” although the older generations still had “lingering doubts about things.” More tolerance is being seen in sports, music, art and fashion these days, he noted, indicating that black and white athletes perform well together in rugby, cricket and surfing.

The Korean History Research Association, the country's largest group of historians with nearly 800 members, has declared it won't participate in the writing process. Kang Sun-a, a spokeswoman of the opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, said that the directive to revert to state-issued history textbooks has ``instantly taken the country back to the Cold War period.''In announcing the controversial plans on Monday, Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea argued that the current history textbooks are too left-leaning and encourage views sympathetic to North Korea and urged for the need of school books that were ``objective'' and ``balanced.'' Park, the president, is the daughter of slain military dictator Park Chung-hee, who ruled South Korea in the 1960s and 70s, and whose legacy as a successful economic strategist is marred by brutal records of civilian oppression.Before leaving for her current trip to the United States, Park defended the move toward state-issued textbooks by saying history classes must inspire ``pride'' in students for being South Korean citizens.  (AP)","south korean scholars boycott ,korean scholars boycott state ,korean scholars boycott ,history textbooks out of ,scholars boycott state issued","['south korean', 'Park Geun']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24381201  0.36442

(Yonhap)Lunney was part of the crew of the S.S. Meredith Victory that brought North Korean refugees from the northeastern port of Heungnam to the South during the war.The mission of the U.S. vessel was to deliver war supplies. But the ship’s captain ordered the crew to dump all weapons overboard so that they could evacuate more Koreans at the crossroads of life and death. They were in great haste as the villages were being bombarded by the Chinese troops. The ship was the last ticket to freedom, Lunney recalled.“One word I always remember during the boarding is ‘palli, palli’ -- faster, faster. In that way, we got many people on board, who crowded our ships, on the floor, on the decks.“We took 14,000.” The December 1950 operation, known as the “Heungnam evacuation,” took place as the U.S.-backed South Korean forces began retreating from North Korea after China sent a massive number of troops to fight alongside the communist neighbor.The nearly forgotten operation recently came to the spotlight in the mega-hit film “Ode to My Father.” Lunney was one of 600 guests invited to the Korea-U.S. Friendship Night hosted by South Korean President Park Geun-hye to celebrate the countries’ bilateral ties on Wednesday evening.Earlier in the day, Park thanked Lunney during her visit to a monument honoring U.S. soldiers who served the war, calling him a hero.“You are the true hero.

Kumgang in July 2008. Speaking at a forum in Seoul, Hwang cited the Aug. 25 inter-Korean deal as a turning point. The two Koreas managed to end a military crisis with the agreement reached at rare high-level talks.  The North initially wanted to talk selectively about issues of its own concern but ""currently, the field (of exchanges) has expanded to religion, sports, and culture,"" according to the number two official in the ministry handling daily inter-Korean affairs.  ""Several (South Korean) teams are now visiting North Korea in connection with inter-Korean exchange,"" said Hwang. ""I think North Korea is making the right choice in a sense.""  The North has not fired a long-range rocket as it had previously threatened. Its leader Kim Jong-un placed an emphasis on the livelihood of the people in his speech on the 70th anniversary of the foundation of the country's communist party, Hwang noted.  The North's negative view of the South's humanitarian aid has subsided to some extent, he added.  The two sides are also scheduled to resume a family reunion event next week at Mount Kumgang along the North's east coast. Hundreds of Koreans will meet their long-lost family members who live on opposite sides of the tightly-controlled border.  ""According to the analysis of North Korean media's reports, Kim made a lot of public activities related to the military at an early stage. Of late, however, more than half of his activities are associated with the economy,"" Hwang pointed out.

The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles shedding light on refugees in Korea, their hardships, the systematic fallout, the country’s own history and ways to go forward. The following is the second installment. - Ed.


When Yiombi Thona, a former spy agent for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, finally stepped foot on Korean soil in 2002, he did not expect it to take as long as six years to gain refugee status and settle down here.

“When I first applied for asylum in 2002 with the Justice Ministry, officials said that they didn’t have any protection programs for refugees,” said Thona in an interview with The Korea Herald. He had escaped his motherland after being tortured and jailed for being a whistle blower on a dubious deal between the government and the rebel army. 

“I only had a small bag, small money, no house, no job ... literally nothing when I arrived. … But the ministry didn’t care at all and just told me not to work (illegally),” said Thona, who was recognized as a refugee in 2008. He now teaches NGO studies at Gwangju University. 

“But I had to survive. So I worked illegally at factories. Everybody needs to be fed, right?”

Back then, South Korea had no legal measures to protect asylum seekers’ basic rights, which forced them to work illegally for several years until the authorities decided whether their refugee claims were genuine or bogus.

Since then, the situation has improved to some extent, especially after the Refugee Act that came into force in 2013, although chronic problems linger.  
South Korea’s first engagement in the international refugee movement dates back to 1992 when it joined the U.N. Refugee Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. 

Since the country began to accept refugee applications in 1994, some 11,172 people have applied for asylum while only 496 were granted refugee status as of May. Its refugee acceptance rate stands at 4.4 percent, far lower than the U.N. average of 38 percent. 

Amid growing international criticism against the Korean government for its poor treatment of asylum seekers, the country enforced the independent Refugee Act in 2013 to guarantee a minimum level of humanitarian protection for the forcibly displaced. 

The Refugee Act largely notifies benefits for asylum seekers, with the government being obliged to offer them monthly living expenses and government-run housing in the first six months after their application. The applicants are also granted a work permit to get a job after the six-month period while their claims are being processed. 

Another significant accomplishment, experts said, is that asylum seekers are now allowed to apply for refugee status at the port of entry, unlike in the past when those arriving without legitimate visas were immediately deported to their countries of origin. 

The law also stipulates the asylum seekers’ rights to be given fair access to application procedures. They can ask for qualified translators, video recordings of application interviews and necessary procedural information. 

South Korea also participates in the U.N.-led resettlement program, with the government planning to take in 30 refugees from the border town between Thailand and Myanmar this year alone.

The Korean office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees called such improvements a step to become “an advanced country” in hosting refugees. 

“We think highly of the Korean government for enacting the independent refugee protection law despite the relatively low number of asylum seekers,” said Shin Hye-in, a spokesperson for UNHCR. “And the refugee law itself upholds international standards.”

The invocation of the law, coupled with the escalating conflicts in war zones across the world, drove up the number of those seeking asylum in Korea by 84 percent from 1,574 in 2013 to 2,896 in 2014, according to the Ministry of Justice.

The landmark law has potential elements to improve asylum seekers’ lives, but it continues to fail to be properly implemented and extended to those really in need of protection, experts said. 

“Most of the problems fundamentally arise from the lack of budget,” Ryu Eun-ji, a case manager for a refugee rights group NANCEN, told The Korea Herald.

While financial support is provided for the first six months under the Act, only 124 asylum seekers, 8 percent of the total 1,633 in the January-May period, received between 200,000 ($172) and 400,000 won per month, according to the report published by NANCEN.

Some 85 percent of the asylum seekers did not apply for the government subsidies at all because they either were not aware of the benefits or chose to forgo the fund that is lower than the nation’s monthly minimum wage of 1,116,220 won.

To better accommodate the rising number of asylum seekers, the authorities opened refugee aid facilities in February near Incheon International Airport, which scarfed up a major portion of the budget. 

The facilities, ironically, can only house 83 newcomers for up to six months, the report said. 

Ryu also took issue with the Justice Ministry’s “ambiguous” standards in deciding whom it grants a placement in the refugee help center and monthly living expenses. 

The Justice Ministry, for its part, argued that it has internal policies to decide recipients of living expenses and accommodation. 

“We make a decision depending on the applicants’ income, ability to support their family and their type of housing,” the official said, admitting the amount of support might not be satisfactory. “But we have no choice due to the budget shortfall.” 

A low understanding of refugees and asylum seekers in Korean society is another discouraging factor for them to claim their rights.

While the law enables the asylum seekers in legal limbo to work with a permit past the first six months upon application, the regulations do not reflect reality, a Bangladeshi asylum seeker said.

“Unfortunately, employers are not aware of the G-1 visa or what an asylum seeker means,” Nazmul Hossain, who applied for asylum in 2012, told The Korea Herald. “They are also not tolerant enough to let us go to the administrative courts and immigration offices several times a month during the refugee screening process.” 

When asylum seekers don’t speak fluent Korean or English, as in most cases, their request for a work permit is often refused, Hossain said. And the G-1 visa needs to be extended every six months, which further lowers their chance of securing a job. 

“Even I would hate to hire someone like us who needs to take time off work that often,” Hossain said, pointing to the need for grassroots government officials to fully understand the refugee law first.

Such technical problems persist among those who have been granted the refugee status.

“The biggest problem lies in the big gap between the authorities and those enforcing the law at the grassroots levels,” said a 35-year-old Ugandan, who wished to be identified as Daniel. “The law is in place, but officials at local governments have no idea about how to help me.”

“When I go to foreign countries, I cannot travel on a Ugandan passport and I need a travel document, but immigration officers just don’t know what to do during immigration control,” Daniel said.

“The authorities don’t seem to be interested in raising awareness on refugees’ rights or educating government officials,” he added. “Does South Korea’s refugee law only exist to please the international community?”

Despite the government hailing itself as the first Asian country to enact the Refugee Act, pro-refugee lawyers and activists mostly portray it as “incomplete,” calling on the parliament to add clauses and revise unclear ones. 

Kim Jong-chul, a public interest lawyer for Advocates for Public Interest Law, told The Korea Herald that many human rights violations take place when asylum seekers are taken into custody at detention centers to go through the refugee application process. 

With the refugee law enabling asylum applications at the port of entry, those applying for refugee status upon arrival or traveling on forged visas are locked at the airport’s detention center until the government decides whether to process their application. 

“Although many asylum seekers are held at detention rooms for various reasons, there are no legal grounds to limit the length of their stay or protect their rights at the deportation centers,” Kim said, citing detainees who are reportedly living on a chicken burger and Coke for every meal without proper bedding. 

The Justice Ministry is supposed to decide within seven days whether to refer asylum seekers to the legal application process in the country. But some asylum seekers, who are refused from applying, choose to endure the poor treatment hoping for a change in the decision.

“As the detention centers were designed only for short-term detention, asylum seekers there cannot have access to legal counseling or the outside world,” Kim said. “The procedures at the airport or harbors should be more articulate and systematic.” 

Another loophole can be found in the clause stating asylum applicants’ rights to record or videotape their interviews with immigration officers, according to a report published by APIL.

Despite the existence of the law, only 80 out of 1,770 interviews were videotaped last year.

The law stipulates that the interviewer “may not” refuse the request, but the lawyers’ group said recording should be mandatory for asylum seekers who would rather stay silent in fear that their request might upset the interviewers and adversely affect their application. 

“The recording and videotaping, however, are crucial for asylum seekers as they often don’t remember what they said during the interviews due to excessive pressure,” the report said, noting that “the consistency” in applicants’ testimonies is closely linked to their credibility in the refugee screening process.

As of May, a total of 713 Syrians sought asylum here, but only three of them have succeed in securing refugee status. Some 577 of them were allowed to reside and work in Korea on humanitarian grounds, which is valid until the conflicts abate in their country. 

While the statistics may sound promising, experts said that the government’s overuse of humanitarian status is one of the biggest controversies.

“The government is using the humanitarian status visa to dodge the burden to socially and financially support Syrian refugees,” said Lee Il, a human rights lawyer at APIL. “Many of the Syrian asylum seekers actually deserve refugee status, but the government sees all of them as a collective group fleeing the war-torn country.”

If applicants don’t qualify for asylum, but there is a well-founded fear of persecution or real risk of serious harm in their home countries, the Justice Ministry offers them a humanitarian status visa in accordance with the Refugee Act. 

But unlike its name, the visa restricts its holders from meeting their basic human rights, Lee claimed.

While refugee status holders are granted an F-2 visa, which entitles them to social welfare benefits and rights to bring their families and freely travel outside Korea, those allowed into the country on humanitarian grounds obtain a G-1 visa, the same visa granted for asylum seekers. 

“Humanitarian visa holders are locked in Korea like on an island without any rights to bring their family or travel outside Korea,” Lee said.

Lawmakers have proposed eight separate revisions to the refugee law so far.

Rep. Hong Il-pyo of the ruling Saenuri Party suggested in his bill that the recording of interviews be mandatory and translation be offered when necessary. 

The opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy’s Rep. Won Hye-young also put forward a bill clarifying procedures for those seeking asylum at the port of entry and enhancing health benefits for humanitarian status holders. 

But prospects for the passage of the bills remain bleak, with no discussion on any of the revised bills this year as the politicians remain largely distracted with the upcoming general elections next year.

Pro-refugee activists and lawyers The Korea Herald interviewed stressed one thing in unison: the need for raising awareness on refugees in Korean society. 

“There should be a broad consensus in Korean society that refugees are ordinary people like us facing troubled times, so we should protect them,” the lawyer Kim said.

The missile was first revealed during a parade to mark the centennial birthday of the North’s late founder Kim Il-sung in April 2012. Then, it was tipped with a pointy warhead. But the warhead looked round this time, indicating that some improvements or modifications have been made to it.While broadcasting the parade at Kim Il-sung Square in Pyongyang, the North’s Korean Central Television reported that the strategic rockets were equipped with “diversified, miniaturized” nuclear warheads that have “super-precision” strike capabilities.The KN-08, which measures 2 meters in diameter and 18 meters in length, is to be fired from a 16-wheeled road-mobile platform, called the TEL (transporter-erector-launcher). The North has yet to publicly test it, leaving its real capabilities still shrouded in secrecy.Seoul officials showed a cautious stance about the North’s ability to mount a warhead on the KN-08.“Whether the KN-08, presented at the parade, is a real one or not has yet to be verified. Thus, it is premature to judge whether the missile can carry a nuclear warhead,” a Seoul official told reporters, requesting anonymity.“And the round shape of the warhead could increase air resistance, thereby reducing the speed of the missile.”At the parade, the North also revealed its 300 mm-caliber multiple rocket launcher, called the KN-09, for the first time. The new system is regarded as a formidable one for wartime use, given that there are virtually no means for the South Korea-U.S. alliance to counter it.Seoul officials believe that the North made the rocket system based on a Chinese one, and that it has almost developed it. They believe its maximum range is around 140 km and thus, unable to reach the headquarters of South Korea’s Army, Navy and Air Force in the Gyeryongdae military compound in South Chungcheong Province.The South Korean military authorities first recognized the North’s push to develop the KN-09, as the reclusive regime was seen test firing the KN-09 system in May 2013.The new artillery system calls for Seoul to pay more policy attention to countering it. But its attention has been focused largely on developing counters to Pyongyang’s missile and nuclear arsenal, such as the Korea Air and Missile Defense program, and the Kill Chain preemptive strike system. Many ideas have been put forward to deal with the North’s artillery threats, though budgetary issues have always come in the way. Among them was purchasing a weapons system called, “counter-rocket artillery mortar,” or C-RAM.Despite the speculation that the North would use the parade to show off its submarine-launched ballistic missile, it did not unveil the SLBM, which analysts say would pose a formidable nuclear threat to the South and the U.S., should it be fully developed. Last May, Pyongyang claimed that it successfully conducted an ejection test of the SLBM from its new 2,000 ton Sinpo-class submarine. Seoul officials forecast it would take four to five years for the North to fully develop and deploy the SLBM. They also think that the North will be able to build a 2,000-ton Sinpo-class submarine capable of carrying the SLBM in two to three years. Meanwhile, U.S. Pacific Command chief Adm. Harry Harris said Saturday that North Korea and its leader are his command’s greatest worries, and that his military is “ready to deal with” the unpredictable regime. “The greatest threat that I face on a day-to-day basis is the threat from North Korea, because you have an unpredictable leader who is in complete command of his country and his military,” Harris said during a meeting with reporters.“At some point in the future, as he develops his capability, North Korea will present a very real threat to Hawaii and the rest of the United States. Now, I have to be ready from a position of strength to deal with North Korea.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","korea unveils new upgraded ,largest military parade ,an intercontinental ballistic missile ,new upgraded weapons north ,largest military parade to","['North Korea', 'Workers ’ Party', 'ICBM', 'U.S.']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48126864  0.27036062

To date, over 11 million cars worldwide are believed to have been installed with hidden software that can switch on pollution controls when it detects the car is being tested. Volkswagen`s logo. (Yonhap)Audi Korea, which is presumed to have sold some 29,000 of the rigged cars as part of the Volkswagen Group, issued a similar apology.The rigged cars sold by the two companies in the country is tentatively tallied at over 120,000.“I would like to take this opportunity to offer my sincere apology on behalf of Volkswagen Korea for breaking the trust of our Korean customers,” the company CEO Thomas Kuehl said in a parliamentary audit, after he issued the first official apology in Korea via newspaper advertisements. “I also want to apologize for the late response. Due to complexity of the issue and different emission standards in Korea, it took a long time to investigate how many cars were affected. Be assured we will do everything to clarity and solve this issue as soon as possible,” he said.He added that Volkswagen is fully cooperating with government officials worldwide including in Seoul to determine the exact cause of this issue. He emphasized, however, that none of the cars currently being sold across the country have the device in question, and that the rigged cars do not show any safety-related defects when driven.The companies were to send separate letters of apology to each of its customers. They did not mention the details about how to compensate the customers.Kuehl told the lawmakers that details of the follow-up measures would be revealed after the government investigation is complete. Seoul’s Environment Ministry last week launched an investigation into the suspected models over the emission rigging.Lawmakers also questioned him about the possibility of the product recall worsening the fuel efficiency of the cars, and if Volkswagen planned to compensate for it. Kuehl reiterated that he could not give a definitive answer yet, but vowed to address the issue after the probe is complete.Volkswagen Korea has launched a website that helps customers determine if their car has been rigged, and Audi plans to launch a website for the same purpose.The public apology was widely perceived as an attempt to address public discontent amid an ongoing investigation by the government. Some 40 Volkswagen owners entered a joint lawsuit against the company in less than a week, with hundreds more expected to follow suit.Volkswagen on Wednesday announced that it would launch a massive recall in January for vehicles affected by the emission tests scandal. Michael Horn, the U.S. head of Volkswagen, offered a “sincere” apology Thursday for the company’s use of rigging software ahead of his hearing with the House energy committee.He also admitted that he came to be aware of the emissions-related problem with the cars last year.

Ma was blamed for the terminal's failure to boost national character.He has re-appeared in the public eye for the first time since November last year when Kim instructed his officials to modify the terminal's interior to highlight North Korea's national identity.Under Kim's regime, Ma has been leading major construction projects such as the Masikryong Ski Resort on the North's east coast.An analysis of Ma's photos showed that he appeared to have been demoted to a major general from a lieutenant general following the purported purge.Meanwhile, Kim visited Rason, which was seriously hit by Typhoon Goni in late August, ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers' Party which falls on Saturday.The date of his visit was not specified, but it marked the second time that Kim toured the city to spur efforts for recovery.In September, the North's leader visited the city bordering China and Russia, about a month after he ordered the completion of flood recovery work there before the key anniversary.

The participants were asked to answer 20 questions designed to see if they had the Korean language skills required for higher education.On a 100-point scale, female students scored 60.27 while their male counterparts averaged 58.72. The results were consistent with that of most major exams in Korea, where girls have generally done better than boys. In last year’s annual college entrance exam, female students got 5.4 more points in standard scores on the Korean section. Foreign students take part in a Korean speech contest at  Ewha Womans University in Seoul on Tuesday ahead of Oct. 9 Hangeul Day. (YonhapIn the study, those who scored below 50 were considered to have only elementary language skills, the 50-74 group were seen as possessing basic skills and anyone getting 75 or more was regarded as being fluent in expressing their opinions while able to fluently come up with ideas for writing.For six of the 20 questions, less than half of the respondents got the correct answer. Humanities majors did marginally better than those studying sociology and natural sciences with a score of 61.85 compared to 60.52 and 58.04, respectively.The results indicate that many Korean college students lack sufficient Korean skills for higher education, Song said.“Generally, writing lessons in most high schools focus on preparing the students solely for college admissions rather than practical writing. As a result, many students enter college without procuring sufficient Korean skills needed in higher education,” she said.Most of the Korean language lessons in the country train students for exams that have them answer multiple-choice and short-answer questions after reading short excerpts from a literary piece. Students say that because of this, they are able to understand individual sentences, but have trouble grasping the topic of the whole text.Koreans have among the highest ratio of getting higher education in the world, with 70.9 percent of high school graduates entering college as of 2014. But data shows that even well-educated people lack adequate skills to use their native language.According to the Korean Educational Development Institute’s education and human resources index, the country had the lowest average document literacy for people with college diplomas out of all members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.Some colleges take the matter into their own hands to improve the less-than-satisfactory Korean skills of their students. Hankuk University of Foreign Studies has mandated a writing class for all students, starting with the freshman class of 2007.“Practical writing is very important, especially in college education,” Song said. “The curriculum should also be based more on the text, so that the student can comprehend the entire context rather than simply understanding the meaning of individual sentences.The study was published recently in the journal “The Education of Korean Language” by Korean Language Education Research Institute at Seoul National University.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","poor korean recent study ,students have poor korean ,south korean college students ,college students have poor ,korean college students","['south korean', 'Song Hyun - jung', 'korean', 'Jeju National University']",3,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.4933418   0.46141234

Once qualified, the job seeker would be able to receive the allowance for 120 to 270 days, whereas the payments are currently only doled out for 90 to 240 days.However low a job seeker’s previous income was, she or he will be guaranteed to receive a minimum daily allowance of 40,176 won ($34.38), according to the Labor Ministry. Korean job seekers look at job postings. (Yonhap)In spite of increased benefits, fewer job seekers will be qualified to earn the allowance if the bill is passed by the National Assembly.The stricter eligibility criteria for the out-of-work benefit is to prevent possible abuses of the welfare system, such as switching jobs too often, the Labor Ministry said.  Currently, one must have worked a minimum of 180 days in the course of 18 months before losing the job in order to claim the unemployment allowance. Once the revised bill takes effect, a job seeker will only be qualified to earn the benefits if he or she worked for a minimum of 270 days in the course of two years before becoming unemployed. Those who receive the allowance more than three times in five years, or those who stay unemployed -- either voluntarily or involuntarily -- for more than 90 days after receiving the benefits will be specially monitored by the authorities. While being monitored, they will be asked to actively engage in job searching at least once a week, while those who aren’t monitored are only required to do so once in two weeks.Currently, those who fail to show up at mandatory job training sessions can lose up to one month’s worth of their unemployment allowance payments. The revised bill stipulates that those who don’t attend required training will lose a maximum of two months’ worth of their allowance payments. Job seekers who have received the allowance more than once and missed more than two training sessions can lose up to 30 percent of their payments, according to the report. Meanwhile, elderly individuals who have lost a job in which they were initially employed at age 65 or older will be eligible to apply for out-of-work benefits should the bill take effect. Currently, the elderly in the specific circumstances are not qualified to earn the benefits. The Labor Ministry predicts that some 13,000 elderly workers, especially janitors and cleaners, will benefit from the revised bill when their work contract ends and they are looking to be employed elsewhere.According to a study by the Labor Ministry, the vast majority of Korean job seekers do not apply for out-of-work benefits. The study, which looked at some 1,000 unemployed Koreans, showed that 88.7 percent did not claim the allowance. The largest portion of them, 48.7 percent, said it was because they found another job right away, while 26 percent said it was because they voluntarily left their jobs.In Korea, jobseekers are eligible to apply for unemployment allowance only if they were forced to leave by their employers. According to Kim Seong-eun from the Labor Ministry, some exceptions apply to those who voluntarily quit their jobs. “For example, if one quit his job because his office moved to another region and required him to commute for six hours a day, we’d consider him as someone who is qualified for the allowance,” he said.Even if the new bill does take effect, those who voluntarily left work will have to file an additional application should they want to apply for the allowance, Kim said. Only those who had to quit their jobs because of unfortunate circumstances will be given the benefits, he said.However, only 2 percent of all recipients of unemployment benefits were those who voluntarily left work but who were recognized by the government as deserving the allowance, as of 2012. Almost 50 percent of them were female workers who left work after becoming pregnant.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","korean job seekers will ,higher unemployment benefits for ,south korean job seekers ,receive higher unemployment benefits ,newly revised labor law","['south korean', 'the National Assembly', 'the Labor Ministry ’s']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49282485  0.37904102

The thesis also highlighted the importance of firming up internal unity and socialism, calling for a ""thorough consolidation of the monolithic leadership.""The reunification of two Koreas is yet the biggest task for the party, Kim said, stressing it should be achieved without any interference from foreign countries.

We want North Koreans to have that in their own language,” Damon, a presenter of World Update on the BBC World Service, said in a recent interview with The Korea Herald.  Daniel John Damon (Song Sang-ho/The Korea Herald)Currently, the British broadcaster is working on creating a 30-minute program using shortwave or AM frequencies, or both, he said. The program is likely to consist of 10 minutes of news, 9 minutes of English education and 10 minutes of features on business, technology, culture, sports and other subjects.The Korean language team is expected to have seven people ― six of them in London and one somewhere else. “They will be using BBC materials as the basis for the international news, but they will also find the news in the region and from the Korean Peninsula,” he said.The program, when fully operational, could lead to some change in the tightly-controlled North Korean society, observers noted. Yet, Damon said that the program was not about “regime change” that may result in chaos, albeit temporary, as witnessed in the collapse of the communist bloc decades ago.“We are not about regime change. We are simply about the truth,” said Damon, a veteran journalist who covered the collapse of the communist bloc involving the former Soviet Union, East Germany and others, and conflicts including those in Croatia and Bosnia“Getting people to hear the truth. That is what we are about.”Damon’s interest in North grew after he found that the Western media coverage did not seem to capture the whole picture of the communist regime.“I realized our reporting, Western reporting of North Korea is very bad,” he said. “It is either jokey about haircuts or only focused on one thing, about the nuclear issue. North Korea is a much richer place than that in terms of its culture and variety.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","pushing to open korean ,north korea the bbc ,mainly target north koreans ,help north koreans hear ,target north koreans who","['BBC', 'korean', 'North Koreans', 'BBC', 'the Korea Herald', 'Daniel John Damon', 'North Koreans', 'BBC']",3,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.77371097  0.49302417

General Assembly, stressing that for older generations ""even a delay of one or two years means that their chance of seeing their relatives may be lost forever.""Since the first-ever summit of their leaders in 2000, the two Koreas have held temporary family reunions on an irregular basis.Such reunions were sometimes long suspended when political and security tensions rose. The last family reunions were held in February last year.Last month, the two Koreas agreed to hold a new round of reunions in late October. But its prospects were thrown into doubt after Pyongyang later threatened to scrap the agreement citing Seoul's criticism of the North.""As of May 2015, of the 129,668 applicants for the reunions arranged by the Red Cross societies of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea since 2000, only 1,956 had benefited from face-to-face meetings and 279 from video reunions,"" Darusman said in the report.""Most strikingly, nearly half of the applicants (62,028) have passed away during the past 15 years owing to their advanced age.The special rapporteur finds the situation very disconcerting and sincerely hopes that regular family reunions will resume without delay,"" he said.Darusman urged the North to allow separated families to reunite without delay and use unmonitored communication facilities, such as telephone, mail and e-mail.In the Sept. 8-dated report, which was posted on the U.N. website this weekend, the special rapporteur also renewed his calls for the U.N. Security Council to refer the communist nation to the International Criminal Court for human rights abuses.""Efforts must be undertaken to ensure the accountability of those responsible for human rights violations, including through referral by the Security Council of the situation in the country to the International Criminal Court, while continuously seeking engagement with the authorities to bring relief to the people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,"" he said in the report.The report included the latest developments in the North's human rights abuses, such as summary executions, abductions, arbitrary detention and exploitation of its people working overseas. ""More than ever, the international community should stay the course in its efforts to address the human rights situation in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea profoundly and meaningfully,"" the special rapporteur said.""Victims and their relatives, both inside and outside the country, have suffered for far too long, and their demands for justice and accountability cannot go unheeded,"" he said.Darusman said the General Assembly should reiterate its condemnation of the ""long-standing and ongoing systematic, widespread and gross violations of human rights"" in the North and reaffirm the international community's responsibility to protect North Korean people from crimes against humanity.He also urged Pyongyang to immediately halt all human rights violations, dismantle all political prison camps, allow all abductees to return to their countries and engage genuinely in bilateral talks with South Korea on issues of mutual interest.

""At this moment, diplomatic efforts are on the hosting of the Korea-China-Japan summit and any bilateral summits like one between South Korea and Japan should have more discussions,"" the top diplomat noted. The comfort women negotiation is not a precondition for the leaders' summit, but it would still be very helpful to successfully arranging one, Yun highlighted. ""From a broader perspective, South Korea is open to hold summit meetings with any country,"" he added. Since its launch in April 2014, the bilateral negotiation on compensating South Korean women who were sexually enslaved by the imperial Japanese army during World War II has not make any meaningful headway.Against this backdrop, Yun's remarks come as diplomatic pressure on the Japanese side to move ahead in the negotiation.""Compared with the initial stage, there has clearly been some development,"" Yun said of the negotiations without specifying. Currently, the negotiations are slightly stalled, but once it overcomes that stage it may gain pace, he noted.Touching on North Korea's prospective launch of a long-range missile, Yun said that ""no signs of imminence have been shown.""Still, the North's willingness for a launch looks unwavering as leader Kim Jong-un and some nuclear experts have vowed, he said. If the North goes ahead with the launch, it will be followed by ""additional important measures"" on the basis of resolutions by the United Nations' Security Council, the foreign minister noted, adding that ""countries with like minds are already discussing the content, timing and scope of"" the measures.

The three-day trip from Thursday by Parliamentary Vice Defense Minister Kenji Harada came after Tokyo shelved its initial plan to send Minister Gen. Nakatani. The visit was chiefly designed for the Military World Games in Mungyeong, North Gyeongsang Province, but had boosted anticipation that he would hold talks with his counterpart, South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-koo. The two top defense policymakers met for the first time in about four years in May on the sidelines of an international security conference in Singapore. “(Nakatani) had apparently sought to come himself, but changed his plan due to internal matters, such as a possible cabinet reshuffle, and for our part, there is a parliamentary audit underway here,” a military official said on customary condition of anonymity. The decision appears to have also reflected the sensitivity surrounding Japan’s recent overturn of the pacifist constitution to allow its military to fight overseas that has triggered concerns over the Shinzo Abe administration’s ongoing revisionist push. Japan is a member of the International Military Sports Council, the organizer of the quadrennial multisports event, but did not dispatch any players given the unique, noncombat status of its Self-Defense Forces. About 120 countries are set to compete during a 10-day run starting Oct. 2.

General Assembly.The two Koreas have agreed to stage the reunions for 100 separated family members from each side on Oct. 20-26 at Mount Kumgang, a scenic mountain resort on the North's east coast. The reunions are a key part of a recent deal that defused military tensions on the Korean Peninsula.North Korea said Tuesday that the upcoming reunions have been ""put at serious peril,"" due to what it claims is Park's ""reckless confrontation row.""In an address to the U.N. on Monday, Park called on North Korea to embrace reform and openness rather than carrying out a long-range rocket.She also said a rocket launch would harm the hard-won mood for inter-Korean dialogue and undermine the efforts to resume the long-stalled talks on ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program.There is speculation that North Korea could launch a long-range rocket in October to put a satellite into orbit as part of its celebrations of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Workers' Party. Park also urged North Korea to improve its dismal human rights record by heeding to international concerns.The North's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea denounced Park's speech as ""an unpardonable provocation"" and called on South Korea to apologize over slandering North Korea.""If the South Korean authorities let loose a string of confrontational invectives as now, the event may prove completely abortive,"" according to the committee, which handles inter-Korean affairs.Family reunions have long been affected by political situations on the Korean Peninsula. The two Koreas last held family reunions in February 2014.Family reunions are a pressing humanitarian issue, as most separated family members are in their 70s and 80s, and wish to see their long-lost relatives before they die.

Security Council has begun studying stronger sanctions that could be imposed on North Korea in case the communist nation goes ahead with provocations, South Korea's top diplomat said Tuesday.Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se made the remark to reporters in New York after three-way talks with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida amid growing concern Pyongyang could conduct a long-range rocket launch or a nuclear test.""The Security Council has begun working-level studies into measures that would be stronger than before and sure to be painful to North Korea,"" Yun told reporters. ""We have to wait and see when and in what form (the measures) will be taken, but North Korea will be further isolated not only economically, but also diplomatically as well.""Yun did not elaborate, but the remark is believed to be the most specific warning yet against North Korea not to forge ahead with provocations. Pyongyang strongly suggested earlier this month it could conduct a long-range rocket launch or its fourth nuclear test, possibly around the Oct. 10 anniversary of its ruling Workers Party.North Korea was also a top topic for Tuesday's trilateral session.""North Korea presents an ongoing security challenge to everybody. We will talk about that here this morning,"" Kerry said at the start of the talks held on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly.Yun said the ""eyes of the world"" are set on major challenges in Northeast Asia, ""especially the publicized address from North Korea on possible strategic provocations in the coming weeks."" He said it is important for the three countries to send a clear message to Pyongyang ""so that there will not be any misjudgment and misbehavior.""Seoul's Foreign Ministry said the three ministers issued a strong warning to the North.""With regard to North Korea suggesting a long-range rocket launch, the three foreign ministers expressed serious concern and strongly urged North Korea to refrain from provocations that threaten peace and stability in the region and the international community,"" Seoul's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.""The three ministers also made clear that North Korea would face further significant measures from the international community if it goes ahead with provocations despite repeated calls for restraint from the international community, including China and Russia,"" it said.The ministers also urged North Korea to return to meaningful denuclearization negotiations, it said.Yun told reporters that the three ministers discussed deterring North Korean provocations and shared a common position that the international community will take ""swift and stern"" action if Pyongyang forges ahead with provocations.""We have sent clear messages to North Korea through a series of summit meetings, including the U.S.-China summit, that North Korean provocations are unacceptable,"" Yun told reporters, referring to last week's summit between U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping. After Friday's summit, Xi issued an unusually strong warning to Pyongyang, saying China opposes any actions that might ""cause tension in the Korean Peninsula or violate U.S. Security Council resolutions."" Obama also said North Korea won't be accepted as a nuclear weapons state.Officials say North Korea is more likely to conduct a long-range rocket than a nuclear test. That's a typical pattern of Pyongyang's provocation cycle: Conducting a rocket launch and using international condemnations and sanctions for it as an excuse for a nuclear test. North Korea says its rocket launches are aimed at putting satellites into orbit, claiming it has the right to peaceful use of space. But Pyongyang is banned from such launches under U.N. Security Council resolutions as it has been accused of using them as a cover for testing intercontinental ballistic missiles. Experts say long-range rockets and ICBMs are basically the same with differences only in payloads.Meanwhile, Yun said that the three ministers also reconfirmed that Japan's exercise of its collective self-defense right should be carried out in a way that is transparent and respects South Korea's sovereignty.The recent passage of security legislation in Japan has empowered the country's Self-Defense Forces to fight overseas in the name of aiding allies. The move sparked concern that Japanese forces could enter the Korean Peninsula in the name of helping the U.S. in the event of war with North Korea.Japanese boots on the peninsula are one of the last things South Koreans want to see due to painful memories of Japan's colonial rule of Korea from 1910 to 1945. South Korea has said Japanese forces cannot enter the peninsula unless there is explicit consent from Seoul.

The session was co-presided by Park and her Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.Cheong Wa Dae, South Korea‘s presidential office, said the move demonstrated South Korea’s leadership in discussing the major agenda of the international community.On Friday, member states of the U.N. adopted a new sustainable development agenda and set 2030 as the target year for achieving the goals that call for, among other things, ending poverty, protecting the planet and providing quality education.Park also stressed the importance of the government‘s leadership in setting up an effective and reliable system, citing South Korea’s government-led economic development in the 1960s.Park plans to attend a luncheon meeting on climate change to be hosted by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for leaders of major countries.The meeting is designed to drum up support for a deal on cutting down greenhouse gases at the U.N.

For women in all age groups, it was the third most common cancer, following breast and thyroid cancer. According to National Cancer Center of Korea, the number of female colorectal cancer patients has been on the rise from 1999-2012, with an average annual increase rate of 4.3 percent. Colorectal cancer was the most common cancer among Korean women aged 65 or older this year. (Yonhap)In Korea, the particular cancer has been generally regarded as a disease that is more common in men. Korea in fact had the third highest rate of colorectal cancer in men -- 58.7 men per 100,000 -- in the world back in 2012. In the same year, Korea had the fifth highest rate of colorectal cancer in women -- 33.3 women per 100,000 -- in the world, following Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and New Zealand. “What many are not aware is that aging women are more vulnerable to this particular type of cancer,” said Dr. Kim Kwang-ho from the hospital. “One of the reasons why so many elderly women develop the disease is because not a lot of them get screened regularly for colorectal cancer thinking it’s more prone in men. But this has to change now.”From 1993-2012, the five-year relative survival rate for Korean women colorectal cancer patients (65.9 percent), was significantly lower than their male counterparts (70.5 percent). While colorectal cancer is the most prevalent cancer in women aged 65 or older, it is the third highest cancer among Korean men in the same age group.According to Dr. Kim, women in and post-menopause are more vulnerable to the cancer because estrogen is what protects women from gaining excess belly weight which is significantly linked to colorectal cancer. Most women gain excess belly weight, especially inside the belly, as they go through menopause, as their estrogen levels drop. When women’s menstrual cycle ends, body fat is often redistributed from the hips, buttocks and thighs to the abdomen. And those with excessive amounts of visceral fat have a higher chance of developing colorectal cancer.According to the hospital, 44.5 percent of Korean women who went through menopause develop abdomen-obesity, while only 32.1 percent of who are in their pre-menopause phase experience the same. “One’s risk of developing colorectal cancer increases with increasing waist circumference,” said the report. “A woman’s chance of developing the disease increases by 16 percent per 10 centimeter increase in her waistline.”To prevent the disease, Dr. Kim recommended that those aged 50 or older get regular screening, such as colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy, every five to 10 years. People with a family history of colorectal cancer should begin testing at younger ages, he said. According to Kim, one can reduce their chance of developing the disease by 90 percent just by getting screened regularly. The doctor also recommended women aged 50 or older to be physically active, get enough calcium and avoid smoking. There is a good evidence that getting enough calcium helps protect against colorectal cancer. The doctor also stressed the importance of not smoking. “Women who smoke have a 20 percent higher chance of developing colorectal cancer than those who don’t,” he said.

According to a survey conducted by the Seoul Metropolitan Government, women spent about 3 1/2 hours on daily housework on average, while men spent only 43 minutes last year, showing a 4.6-fold difference.For women, the housework time accounted for 41 percent of their daily duties -- hours they spend on obligatory activities such as career work or domestic affairs. The women’s duty time recorded eight hours and three minutes last year.Men, however, spent less than 10 percent of their duty time on household affairs. The overall daily duty time of men was seven hours and 51 minutes. Men tended to spend half of their duty time on their career, while women spent only about 20 percent of their duty time on jobs. The perception toward traditional gender roles also differed by gender. More than 40 percent of men approved of traditional gender roles, while only about 28 percent of women did so. The rest of the women opposed the increasingly old-fashioned perception of gender roles. Husbands, however, interestingly, spent more time cooking than ever before.The surveyed men said that they spent about eight minutes a day on average cooking last year, three minutes longer than 2013. Wives, on the other hand, spent 71 minutes a day on average, up only one minute on-year. About 65 percent of total respondents said they did not have enough time to rest and enjoy hobbies.

""The amount of money given will depend on the extent of reforms with those that make sweeping changes to get more.""  The remarks reflect a widespread view that the country's higher educational institutions are unable to train students for their future jobs, contributing to high unemployment among young people.  The jobless rate for people between the ages of 15 through 29 stood at 8 percent in August, much higher than the 3.4 percent for the country as a whole.  The government set aside 236.2 billion won ($198.5 million) in next year's budget aimed at facilitating restructuring and consolidating departments and even schools. This program envisions providing 5-20 billion won worth of support to each school that carries out reforms.Choi also said that while state debt will surpass 40 percent of the nation's gross domestic product in 2016, there is no need to be overly worried. He pointed out that in the first seven months of the year, the government collected 135 trillion won in taxes, up 11 trillion won compared to the year before.  To maintain the overall fiscal health of the country, Choi stressed the government is committed to moving forward reforms that restrict excessive spending and cut back on tax breaks.  The fiscal strategy coordination committee, meanwhile, said measures will be taken to improve the way state funds reach cash-strapped small and medium enterprises.  There has been growing criticism that support is not distributed evenly among qualified companies, causing many to go bankrupt.  Key among the changes to be made will be to allocate 30 percent of all state funds available to companies that have been in operation for 3-7 years, which are usually at a crossroads of making the next leap forward or forced to close for lack of appropriate funding.  The committee said at present 22.9 percent of such funds go to the companies.

The North said final preparations are under way to send rockets and ""multiple satellites"" into space, CNN reported.  North Korea is seeking to launch what it claims is a satellite around the 70th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers' Party, which falls on Oct. 10. Outside experts view it as a cover for ballistic missile tests.  But a government source said that there is no sign of an impending launch at the North's rocket launch facility in Dongchang-ri on its west coast.  ""The movement of people and equipment has not increased when compared with last year,"" said the source, asking not to be named.  North Korea is seen as having completed the upgrade of its rocket launch facility, which experts say can be used for the launch of long-range missiles twice the size of the 30-meter Unha-3 that was sent into orbit in December 2012.  Covers have been draped around the gantry and the railway station in Dongchang-ri, to which newly-made rockets would be moved from a factory in Pyongyang, the source added. A railway has been laid from the station to the launching site.  North Korea has reiterated its resolve to launch a satellite, calling it a sovereign right, in a show of defiance against growing international calls against the provocation.  South Korea, the U.S. and China have warned that North Korea's missile launch would be a grave violation of the U.N. Security Council resolutions banning its nuclear and missile tests.

The Korea Herald will publish a series of articles shedding light on refugees in Korea, their hardships, the systematic fallout, the country’s own history and ways to go forward. The following is the first installment. – Ed.The afternoon was sunny and peaceful, as the crisp wind signaled the coming autumn in South Korea. But the story told by CH Govera, a 30-something man from Ethiopia, in an interview with The Korea Herald at a cafe in Seoul, was worlds away from the tranquility of the day.“I could have been stopped at the airport if it wasn’t so early at 5 a.m. in the morning,” said Govera, choking up with emotion. “I managed to sneak out of the country and I burst into tears when I boarded the plane.”Govera, who was granted refugee status last month after several attempts over the past seven years, had taken a lead in establishing the opposition Coalition for Unity and Democracy back home, also known as Kinijit, ahead of the 2005 election to stand up to the government that had ruled his country for 25 years.“The opposition bloc saw the biggest-ever gains, but the government wouldn’t leave,” Govera said of the election, which triggered chaos that killed nearly 200 people in the postelection violence.“I was soon arrested, jailed and tortured until officials from Red Cross and the United Nations made a visit to my prison,” he said. While living in fear that he might be persecuted, Govera grabbed a rare chance to come to Korea for missionary training in 2008. “I didn’t want to leave as I was only demanding my political rights. But I had to get out of my country to survive,” he said. “I had no luggage, I didn’t tell anyone that I was leaving.”Like many other asylum seekers in Korea, his first choice of destination was not Korea. “My first choice was England or Germany, but I just had to seize any chance to leave the country.” Govera explained that Ethiopians would have to pay brokers a commission fee of $2,000 to $4,000 to secure a legitimate visa to enter Korea. The costs depend on the popularity of the destination, with the visa for the U.S. hovering around $200,000.After twists and turns, Govera was able to apply for asylum, but it took seven grueling years to finally be granted refugee status. “Now, I feel like I am born again.”Syrian refugees participate in a rally calling for the Korean government’s help in front of the National Human Rights Commission in downtown Seoul on Sept. 13. (Yonhap)Govera is one of the 522 refugees as of July who have earned the status in Korea since the country began to accept refugees in 1994.  Korea joined the U.N. Refugee Convention in 1992 and became the first Asian country to enforce the Refugee Act in 2013 to provide international refugees with social protection and residence.The number of those seeking asylum in Korea has surged since the law took effect, with the figure jumping from 423 in 2010 to 2,896 in 2014, according to the Ministry of Justice. But the government has granted refugee status to only a small portion of applicants, with 331 out of 9,155 asylum seekers having won legal status for resettlement during the five-year period.Korea’s refugee acceptance rate stands at 3.6 percent, much lower than the average rate for U.N. member countries, which sits at 38 percent.According to the data, the largest numbers of migrants recognized as refugees were from Myanmar followed by Ethiopia, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Iran, while the biggest portion of refugee applicants were Pakistanis and Egyptians.Nearly half of the asylum seekers applied for refugee status for political or religious reasons. Amid the escalating conflicts within Syria, Korea saw a soaring number of Syrian asylum seekers here, but only three of the 740 applicants have succeeded in securing refugee status so far. Most of the Syrian applicants were granted humanitarian status instead of refugee status, which allows them to work and reside here until the war abates in their country. But those on humanitarian status are guaranteed a lower level of social protection than of refugees.Govera knew he would have to escape from the country to survive, but many others have arrived in Korea for other purposes without knowing they would end up applying for refugee status here.A 23-year-old Ethiopian, who only wanted to be identified by her nickname Mimi, told The Korea Herald that she had never considered herself an asylum seeker. “I meant to go back to Ethiopia to continue my career and activities back home, as there is still so much to be done,” said Mimi, who has been heavily involved in human rights activities and worked for the Ethiopian office of the World Bank for rural development projects before coming to Korea. “While I was in Korea for a two-week human rights training course at a university in Seoul, I found out that the government arrested my father, brother and fellow activists to hunt me down,” said Mimi. “As the government sees me as ‘terrorist,’ my return could put not only myself, but also my family in jeopardy.”Mimi received much-needed help from Refuge pNan, a Seoul-based human rights organization, to process her application for refugee status in January. She is waiting to be interviewed by immigration officers. Mimi herself admitted she was one of the extremely “lucky” cases discovered and helped by human rights activists. Otherwise, she would not have known what steps to take next. Many of the asylum seekers, however, don’t even know whether they are entitled to refugee status, said Kim Jong-chul, a lawyer for Advocates for Public Interest Law. Asylum seekers, thus, are poorly prepared for the application process involving document screening and interviews, which lowers the possibility for them to earn the status.“Once the refugee application is rejected, it seems difficult to reverse the decision in the following stages,” Kim said. Even if migrants know they are in a situation where they can seek asylum, they face difficulties in proceeding with the application due to language barriers, lack of information and financial problems.“When I first arrived in Korea, I didn’t know what to do. I spoke no Korean. Everybody in the immigration office seemed unkind, even angry, and didn’t explain the situation to me,” said a 32-year-old Bangladeshi man, who only wanted to be identified by Amin. Amin fled Bangladesh in 2009 after leading student activists against the government. He entered Korea on a tourist visa with the help of his uncle married to a Korean woman here.“I financially relied on my uncle at first, but I had to leave his house after I saw him and his wife arguing about me,” said Amin, who even spent some time in the streets, homeless. The language barrier hindered him from acquiring information about the application process here, which left him with no option but to stay and work here illegally part-time until someone came to rescue him.  “I didn’t know what to do, but I still had to survive. I knew I wasn’t allowed to work without a work permit, but what options do I have? I cannot go back to my country. I will get killed there,” Amin said.  The Refuge Act stipulates that those who have applied for refugee status are entitled to find employment with a work permit issued by the government six months after the process begins. But the work permit is difficult to get, Amin said.  “I cannot afford to take time off work to apply for a permit and go back to check whether I got it and explain all the process to my boss,” Amin said. Lawyer Kim also pointed out that asylum seekers are on a G-1 visa, which technically doesn’t allow them to work. Despite the enforcement of the Refuge Act, many employers remain unaware that they could hire asylum seekers without any legal problems. “If the work permit is complicated to get, the government should provide asylum seekers with greater social protection,” Kim said. “Without such a measure, it is an irony that the government only tries to track down those forced to illegally work here and deport them.”Just a few days after Amin had the interview with The Korea Herald, he was caught by immigration officers and detained at a foreigner protection center in Hwaseong, where those ordered to leave Korea spend their final days before being sent back to their home countries.“What will happen to me next? I am so scared ...” Amin’s last text message read.Nazmul Hossain, who founded the Refugee Community to help asylum seekers pursue their rights, said that the Refugee Act hasn’t changed the “miserable lives” of asylum seekers here. “I had to go back to the immigration office almost five times to finally get the work permit,” he said in fluent Korean. “Wouldn’t it be more difficult for those who cannot speak Korean and don’t understand the law to practice their rights?”“The slow legal process prompts many of the asylum seekers to give up on asking for a work permit and just get a part-time job illegally, trapping them into a vicious cycle,” he said.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","on refugees in korea ,refugees in korea their ,refugee status in korea ,refugees in korea ,in korea their hardships","['South Korea', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea']",3,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.60747057  0.2178767

Jeong Kyeong-doo said in response to Rep. Kim Kwang-jin of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy during a parliamentary audit at the Air Force’s headquarters in the Gyeryongdae military compound in South Chungcheong Province, referring to the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense. THAAD is designed to shoot down short-, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles in the final stage of their flight.But he did not provide details on the estimate, saying the figure is an approximate one and was also mentioned in news reports.Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Jeong Kyeong-doo speaks during a parliamentary audit on Tuesday at the Air Force’s headquarters in the Gyeryongdae military compound in South Chungcheong Province. (Yonhap)Jeong’s remarks represented a rare assessment by a South Korean military executive because the government has shied away from giving numbers, saying it will not have to shoulder any costs even if Washington eventually decides to bring in the asset, as it will do so on its own. A THAAD battery, which consists of six truck-mounted launchers, 48 interceptors, an air-transportable radar system and a fire and communications element, had widely been valued at 1 trillion won to 2 trillion won, and no more than two units would likely be put in place here. For its part, Seoul is seeking to develop the L-SAM, a long-range surface-to-air missile with similar interception capabilities as part of its initiative to establish an independent missile defense system, called the Korea Air and Missile Defense.Jeong also remained cautious about THAAD, saying the Air Force is pursuing the KAMD program and adopting the U.S. system may entail other problems such as bringing in necessary intelligence surveillance reconnaissance assets to operate alongside it. “There are various conditions in order to operate THAAD,” he said. “The Defense Ministry will carefully review its stationing taking into account various security factors. ... On the military aspect, a THAAD deployment has pros and cons. It has merits and limits.” The former vice Air Force chief of staff and Joint Chiefs of Staff head of strategic planning took office last week. Controversy has repeatedly brewed over the issue in recent months after top Washington officials including Secretary of State John Kerry and U.S. Forces Korea commander Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti raised the need for future discussions between the allies on a THAAD deployment. The U.S. has activated four THAAD batteries in the mainland and Guam and plans to complete the deployment of the other three by as early as 2019 including on overseas locations that may include South Korea, Japan and the United Arab Emirates.During the session, the issue also precipitated spats between senior ruling and opposition lawmakers. Rep. Yoo Seong-min of the Saenuri Party lambasted as “deceiving” Jeong’s plan to defend from North Korean missile attacks with the KAMD system and homegrown mid- and long-range ground-to-air missiles. In contrast, New Politics Alliance for Democracy chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in opposed a THAAD stationing, saying it is not cost-effective and Seoul will ultimately have to share a greater burden in other ways.

Following a postmortem examination, the Ugandan government announced that the cause of death was heart failure, according to news reports.  However, during a memorial service for the late minister last week, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni reportedly blamed South Korea for denying Aronda proper medical care due to his lack of health insurance even though he had complained of a stomachache and dizziness.  A South Korean government official refuted the claim.  ""We are in the process of determining the relevant details,"" he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Pyongyang also said its bomb-making nuclear facilities have returned to normal operation and could conduct a nuclear test if necessary.  North Korea has conducted three underground nuclear tests so far, in 2006, 2009 and 2013. The country has also conducted a series of long-range missile or rocket launches since 1998. In its most recent launch in late 2012, the North succeeded in putting a satellite into orbit.  Analysts have warned that it is only a matter of time until the North develops nuclear-tipped missiles. Some experts have recently warned that the communist nation's nuclear arsenal could expand to as many as 100 bombs by 2020.  Other agenda items for this week's summit are expected to include thorny issues, such as territorial disputes over the South China Sea, cyber-hacking, China's foreign exchange policy, climate change and human rights.  ""We are steadily and methodically expanding the breadth and depth of our cooperation with China. Our story is, overwhelmingly, one of progress. Still, the reality is we face difficult challenges. And, we never shy away from pressing our concerns,""Rice said.  She said the U.S. has urged China to carry out market reforms that level the playing field for foreign firms and refrain from competitive currency devaluation. She also noted that Obama has made clear to Xi that ""state-sponsored, cyber-enabled economic espionage must stop.""  ""This isn't a mild irritation. It is an economic and national security concern to the United States,"" she said of cyber-hacking.""It puts enormous strain on our bilateral relationship, and it is a critical factor in determining the future trajectory of U.S.-China ties.""  Speaking of martime territorial disputes, Rice also said that the U.S. takes no position on competing territorial claims, but will continue to stress the importance of preserving ""freedom of navigation and commerce through some of the world's busiest sea lanes.""  ""The United States of America will sail, fly and operate anywhere that international law permits,"" she said.

(Yonhap)Amid the growing angst over Japan loosening its postwar stricture on the use of force, the issue of whether the country is really a potential security threat to Korea, as it was in the early 20th century, has been the subject of public debate.Some experts say that with the export-driven economy sticking to international norms and rules, it can hardly become a security threat, and that Japan expanding its role in support of the U.S. military would be helpful to cope with contingencies on the peninsula.Others, however, talk of the possibility that Japan could revert to the militarism of its past, particularly when nationalist policymakers are leading state affairs, and refuse to fully atone for their country’s wartime misdeeds.With the divergent views, observers say Japan’s pursuit of what it calls a “normal” state with a full-fledged military, which goes beyond the hitherto exclusively defensive security role, will be a double-edged sword.“Japan’s security policy is obviously a double-edged sword for South Korea as it would be helpful in handling North Korea-related security contingencies, and it would also fan public fears about potential security challenges,” said Park Hwee-rhak, political science professor at Kookmin University.“What is important for now is that instead of continuing to talk about the double-edged sword, Korea should think more deeply about how it can actually use the sword for its own benefit.”Public worries over Japan’s new security legislation have reaffirmed that many Koreans still perceive Japan as a possible security threat, a reason why Seoul officials have repeatedly called on Tokyo to carry out its defense policy in a “transparent” manner that promotes regional peace.Seoul’s Defense Minister Han Min-koo reiterated Monday that without Seoul’s request or consent, Tokyo cannot send its forces to the peninsula, even if the U.S. requests the deployment of Japanese forces here.“The wartime operational control is exercised in accordance with the guidelines from leaders of both South Korea and the U.S. Thus, if our president rejects (the U.S. request for Japan’s troop dispatch to Korea), the troops cannot enter South Korea,” he said during a parliamentary session.Analysts say that Japan’s security legislation should be more thoroughly examined to identify aspects that would help South Korea’s security in a crisis, although security concerns seem inevitable, with many Koreans still harboring animosity toward Japan that colonized Korea from 1910-45.“If you check the 11 security laws in detail, there are many elements to strengthen the U.S.-Japan security cooperation to deter North Korea’s military provocations,” said Park Young-june, political science professor at Korea National Defense University.“The laws ensure stepped-up security cooperation on the part of Japan … for instance, Japan’s enhanced rear-area support in case of contingencies involving the Korean Peninsula. The strengthened alliance between the U.S. and Japan, in fact, would help the Korea-U.S. security collaboration in many aspects,” he added.Lee Won-deog, a professor of international politics at Kookmin University, noted that given Japan’s current economic status and aged population, it is highly unlikely for Japan to adopt any militaristic external policy as it did during World War II.“The 20th-century Japan is different from the current 21st-century Japan, although we still have suspicions as to its militaristic past,” he said. “Realistically speaking, Japan does not have the strong economic foundation now to pursue any imperialist policy. Its population is old and shrinking, and it is not in a position to jack up its defense spending to push for any unilateral military policy. That is unthinkable for now.”To prevent a set of worst-case scenarios, including Japan unilaterally intervening in peninsular affairs on the grounds that they could affect its own security, experts say that Seoul needs to strengthen dialogue channels with Tokyo and should seek to establish multilateral security cooperation mechanisms.Regional cooperation mechanisms would help prevent Japan from taking destabilizing military steps and lead the archipelago state to remain committed to its stated goal of making a “proactive” contribution to global peace. “While looking at Japan’s security policy, South Korea needs to take into consideration all possibilities and scenarios. It should not be naive and should remain cool-headed,” said Nam Ki-jeong, a professor at the Institute for Japanese Studies at Seoul National University.“What it can do is to work up diplomacy to lead Japan to move in the right direction within the multilateral security cooperation mechanism. The U.S., China and Russia can also get involved in the mechanism to promote the overall regional peace.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","emergency japanese prime minister ,controversial legislation to expand ,will in korean emergency ,angst over japan loosening ,in korean emergency japanese","['Japan', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'korean', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Japan']",3,"[ 0.          2.          1.         ... -0.57486498 -0.04675961

The group is a collaboration of 54 education-related bodies, parents’ groups and advocates of Hangeul, the Korean writing system.Members of civic groups opposing the use of Chinese characters in elementary school textbooks hold up placards during the Education Ministry’s public hearing held at Korea National University of Education in Cheongju, North Chungcheong Province, on Aug. 24. (Yonhap)Over 400 education professors across the country also released a statement on Sept. 9 to bash the government’s move, while a survey conducted by the Korea Teachers and Education Workers’ Union showed that 78 percent of elementary school students opposed it.The ministry’s policy is centered on using both Hangeul and Hanja for elementary school textbooks, which goes hand-in-hand with teaching the Chinese characters for elementary school students. In Korea, Hanja teaching has been restricted as an optional course for middle and high school students since the 1970s. But the ministry announced last year that it is mulling use of Hanja in elementary schools, a year after President Park Geun-hye’s public address stressing the need to enhance Hanja education. Key issues surrounding the policy are if learning Hanja can actually help students and whether or not implementing Hanja education will add to students’ academic stress. Park Yong-gyu, the head of the executive committee at the HMAHES, said reinstating Hanja use is an “outdated” concept. He raised concerns that the additional learning could make life painful for elementary school students, who already face a heavy academic burden.“The government implemented English classes at elementary schools a few years back, and now students are suffering the consequences,” he said. Korea introduced English classes for elementary school students in the mid-1990s. Two decades later, the Park administration has rolled out policies to reign in what the president has described as “excessive English education.”Park of HMAHES pointed out that effects of the Hanja use will have rippling effects. “Imagine what would happen if they started using Hanja around third grade? It won’t affect just older students; first, second graders, even kindergarten students will be learning Hanja as part of ‘advanced learning,’” he said. “Advanced learning” refers to students studying material for older students. Although Korea recently passed a bill banning it, it does not apply to private education institutes.But proponents of Hanja use say that concerns about a surge in private education is exaggerated. “A ‘moderate’ use of Hanja will not add significant stress to students. Let’s say students in grades 4-6 would learn about a couple of characters a week, and they are not tested on their learning. Would that be burdensome?” said Kim Dong-seok, the spokesman for the Korea Federation of Teachers’ Association.Kim added that there are already significant demands among Koreans for Hanja education. “Our statistics show that over half of those taking Hanja certification tests are elementary school students. This means there is a demand for Hanja education among parents,” said Kim. Jin Tae-ha, the chairman of the board at the Korean Association of Hanja Education Promotion, wrote in his recent column that use of Hanja is deeply rooted in Korean language.“Over 90 percent of academic books in colleges across the country use both Korean and Chinese characters. Over 70 percent of Korean words use Hanja. Exclusive use of Hangeul for nearly half a century has sparked many problems, which can be addressed with the ministry’s policy,” he wrote.While both sides agree that words composed of Hanja account for a large portion of Korean vocabulary, opponents point out that the majority of these words are spelled out in Hangeul in everyday use.“Take for example the word ‘sa-gi (fraud)’ in Korea. Everyone knows what that means. They don’t have to know how to write it in Chinese characters,” Park of HMAHES said. “If it’s not broken, why fix it?”Park added that the only ones gaining from the new policy would be organizations that run Hanja certification tests. He pointed out that the privately run Korean Association of Hanja Education Promotion ― one of the most outspoken proponents of the policy ― is one of the cosponsors of the annual Hanja tests, raising suspicion over the motive behind the organization’s consistent calls for Hanja education.The group said the sponsorship had nothing to do with financial gains, and that it was purely for the promotion of Hanja education.Taking notice of the fierce controversy, the Education Ministry recently postponed the decision on Hanja use for primary education and vowed to conduct further research on the policy. The ministry was originally to announce its decision on the implementation Wednesday, as part of this year’s sweeping revision of the education curriculum. By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","elementary schools stirs dispute ,south korean education ministry ,demand the ministry abandon ,textbooks held press conference ,korean education ministry year","['the south Korean Education Ministry ’s', 'chinese', 'Headquarters for Movement Against Hanja in', 'Jongno', 'Seoul']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42111033  0.47568685

It marks the first time the Korean government has ever rolled out a comprehensive measure for modification of the official English names.Officials have been discussing the potential new English names and working on the guidelines since March, in response to criticism about the accuracy of the names. A special advisory committee ― which included native speakers ― reviewed all administrative organizations’ English names and came up with 231 suggestions for new names, 141 of which have been accepted by the respective agencies. The guidelines suggest changing English names that sound strange to native speakers, having consistency when depicting functions of the organizations, refraining from using “Korean,” “National” or “the” in the official name, making sure the abbreviated names include organizations’ main functions and distinguishing the names of offices based on the size of their jurisdiction.The sweeping changes starts with the Home Affairs Ministry itself, which will be shortened to Ministry of the Interior.

The main purpose of the new names is to help foreigners understand the functions of organizations at first glance, officials said. The Welfare Ministry-affiliated “National Mang-Hyang Cemetery” is a resting place for overseas Koreans who were forced to flee the country during Japan’s 1910-1945 colonial rule, but it is virtually impossible for a anyone who is not a Korean-speaker to realize that as the word “mang-hyang” is merely a Romanization of a Korean word meaning “to miss one’s home.” To avoid the confusion, the institute will be called “Office of National Cemetery for Overseas Koreans.”The guideline also presented standardized English translations for various government positions such as “policy advisor to the minister” and “inspector general.”By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","korean government said thursday ,will amend english names ,revised the south korean ,new names of four ,government said thursday","['south korean', 'the Ministry of Government Administration', 'Home Affairs']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56994385  0.48976499

It was in 1943 in colonial Korea, and Kang had just returned home from school. Her parents weren’t home.　“They said, ‘Put on your shoes and come out,’ and I obeyed,” Kang said in an interview with local media outlets Monday. “I could not resist.

It was in 1943 in colonial Korea, and Kang had just returned home from school. Her parents weren’t home.“They said, ‘Put on your shoes and come out,’ and I obeyed,” Kang said in an interview with local media outlets Monday. “I could not resist. Resisting against Japanese officers meant risking your life at the time. They could kill you at any moment.”Kang’s life as the darling youngest daughter of 12 siblings changed instantly. She was forcibly taken to China to work as a sex slave for frontline Japanese soldiers stationed there. Until Japan’s defeat in 1945, Kang was forced to work in military brothels, enduring both sexual and physical abuse by the soldiers.  Kang Il-chul, a former sex slave for the Japanese military during the World War II, poses for a photo at the House of Sharing in Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province, Monday. (Ministry of Gender Equality and Family)According to Kang’s past testimonies, she was forced to have sex with about 10 to 15 soldiers daily during her years as a slave. When the war nearly ended in 1945, she developed severe typhoid fever. The Japanese placed her outside of the military base to be cremated alive with corpses, thinking she would soon die from the disease. Kang was eventually rescued by Korean independence soldiers stationed in China. The 87-year-old still has scars on her head from the experience. “I still wake up in the middle of the night and cry,” she said. “I can’t control the tears. Sometimes I can’t even sleep.”Some 200,000 women were forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese during World War II, and a handful of the surviving women, including Kang, are spending their final years in the House of Sharing, a special shelter and museum in Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province. In South Korea, most of the victims have already died from old age. There are now only 47 registered survivors, including Kang and nine other women residing at the House of Sharing.Among the victims, Kang is considered one of the most active and vocal women in the movement asking for an official apology from Japan. Last month, she flew to New York to speak at the Holocaust Memorial and Tolerance Center of Nassau County about her experience as a sex slave in an attempt to raise awareness of Japan’s wartime atrocities. Kang is also scheduled to visit the museum again next March to celebrate the opening of a special exhibition featuring her and other victims’ stories. “It’s not always easy to share my story,” she said. “Sometimes I don’t want to do it because I don’t want to cry in front of others while talking about it. But I understand the importance of it now. I have to share it so what I had to deal with does not repeat in the future.”In spite of the victims’ activism and Seoul’s repeated demand for an apology and legal reparations, Tokyo has claimed that all compensation was settled in the 1965 South Korea-Japan Normalization treaty.For Kang, it is not only the abuse she endured that she wants to be compensated for. It also has to do with the loss of her youth, her home, her family and her country, she said. “I don’t know if anyone can even imagine what it means to lose everything like that,” she said. “It was better to be dead.”Kang remembers the Japanese being violent and inhumane toward Koreans in Sangju, even before she was abducted to China. Many, including Kang’s parents, lost their harvest and food to the Japanese officers, who would break into homes abruptly and randomly with swords. “If you resisted, you would be beaten to death on the spot,” Kang said. As children, Kang and her friends would run to the nearest farm and hide by lying with their faces down, whenever they saw Japanese officers. “We never knew what they would do to us,” she said. “I will try my best to live as long as I can to ensure that people remember what I had to endure.”After World War II, Kang married a Chinese man and worked as a nurse in China’s Jilin province until she returned to Korea in 2000. The first place she visited upon her return was her family house in Sangju. The house, which was once filled with her favorite childhood memories, was empty as all her siblings and parents had passed away. As the youngest child of her family, Kang would often sleep next to her mother in the same room. Her parents would save dried persimmons and jujubes from their tree just for her. Even on the day she was taken away by the Japanese in 1943, she rushed home from school to see her mother as soon as possible. Kang never got to say good-bye. “I collapsed on the floor and wailed (the day I returned to my old house),” she said, tearing up. “I’ve always missed my mother. I still miss her terribly.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","abducted by three japanese ,three japanese military officers ,1943 in colonial korea ,home from school her ,three japanese military","['Kang Il - chul', 'japanese', 'Sangju', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'Korea', 'Kang', 'Kang', 'Japanese']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24481653  0.1943136

Noting that the size of the vent of an explosion facility in the North was found to have been reduced, a Seoul official said that this could mean the need for additional tests has decreased.“Given the change in the size of the vent and the absence of additional tests, the North might have concluded that it does not need to conduct explosion tests often, as it has already reached a considerable level of the miniaturization technology,” the official said, requesting anonymity.During the audit, the ministry made it official that it would adopt offensive operations for border defense in the wake of a set of North Korean provocations last month including the Aug. 4 land mine detonation.“We will carry out offensive operations in the Demilitarized Zone and establish specific operational postures based on various scenarios of possible (North Korean) provocations,” Seoul’s Defense Ministry said in its written policy report submitted during a parliamentary audit.The statement marked a shift from the hitherto defensive operational tactics that were designed to fend off North Korean forces’ infiltrations across the border. The shift came amid growing calls for the South Korean military to respond more proactively to North Korea’s limited attacks. The mine detonation inflicted serious injuries to the legs of two South Korean troops, followed by an artillery attack on Aug. 20. “We will focus on formulating specific plans to prepare for various types of provocations and making them applicable through specific combat procedures,” the ministry report said. “After the North Korean provocations (last month), we also keep a cooperative mechanism with the U.S.”As for the possibility of North Korea’s additional provocations, the ministry did not rule it out, noting that Pyongyang could launch a missile around Oct. 10, when the communist state is to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the foundation of its ruling Workers’ Party.But there has not been any clear sign yet that the North is going to launch a rocket on Oct. 10, Seoul’s Defense Minister Han Min-koo said.On the same issue, Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, in a separate parliamentary audit, said that the North could launch a “strategic” provocation around the anniversary.“Despite the Aug. 25 bilateral agreement, (we) cannot rule out the possibility that the North would launch a strategic provocation such as a long-range rocket launch, disguised as a satellite launch, around the time when they mark the anniversary of the party’s foundation,” Yun said.“We are closely watching the situation. We will strive to forge the international opinion that would prevent the North from setting off additional provocations.”The Foreign Ministry said in its parliamentary report that should the North launch a strategic provocation, it would “sternly and promptly” deal with it through bilateral and multilateral mechanisms including the U.N. Security Council.Meanwhile, the Defense Ministry said that since 2010, Pyongyang had launched provocations on 64 occasions, including 13 land-based provocations and 47 cases at sea. During the period, Pyongyang violated the Military Demarcation Line eight times and fired artillery shots across the border five times. The MDL violations, which did not occur between 2010 and 2013, began last year, the ministry noted.North Korean patrol ships’ violations of the Northern Limit Line, a de facto maritime border, took place twice in 2010, five times in 2011, twice in 2012, nine times in 2013, 13 times last year and 10 times so far this year.By Song Sang-ho(sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","nuclear warhead this year ,warhead this year seoul ,miniaturize nuclear warhead ,to miniaturize nuclear warhead ,defense ministry said thursday","['North Korea', 'Seoul ’s Defense Ministry', 'Pyongyang', 'Cho Bo - geun', 'the Defense Intelligence Agency']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.98617023  0.7883212

On average, the wages for local workers across the OECD bloc was 15 percent higher than their foreign counterparts.In the report, the OECD underscored the role of “skills” in narrowing the wage inequality, noting that a difference in skills accounted for over 70 percent of the wage gap between native and foreign-born workers.It is particularly “important” to invest in teaching skills for those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds to reduce the gap, it said. In fact, Korea’s wage gap between locals and foreigners would lower from 55 percent to 36 percent if foreign workers were equipped with the same skills, the report added. The difference would further narrow to 21 percent if foreign laborers were paid the same as locals for retaining the same skills. But South Korea’s inequality in wages between locals and foreigners would still remain the highest among OECD countries even if foreign laborers had the same skills, according to the report. Kim Jong-jin, a researcher for Korea Labor & Society Institute, pointed out that the wage gap shed light on the deeply rooted discrimination against foreign workers and the lack of a legal system to protect their rights. “It is a trend that migrant workers in advanced countries do dangerous, dirty jobs left vacant by native laborers,” Kim told The Korea Herald. “Whether a country has institutions and laws to protect migrant workers makes a difference in pay gaps across the OECD bloc.”“Korea still doesn’t have a law stipulating migrant workers’ rights and institutions allowing them to stand up against employers to resolve the pay difference,” Kim added.“The wage gap is only likely to grow as there seems to be no social discourse over the migrant workers’ rights.”In Korea, some 825,000 migrant workers are legally working in the country, a large portion of whom are doing unskilled jobs typically in labor-intensive sectors such as construction, manufacturing and agriculture. According to government data released last year, 45 percent of the foreign workers here are employed at factories, with 31 percent working at construction sites and 12 percent hired in the service industry. Only 12 percent are white-collar workers, according to the statistics.The data also showed that more than 60 percent of the foreign laborers in Korea had received less than 2 million won ($1,700) in monthly wages, while half of them worked more than 50 hours a week.But the wage gap between locals and foreigners in Korea is merely the result of the unique structure of the Korean labor market, another expert said. “Unlike other OECD countries, a large portion of the foreign workers in Korea (represented in the statistics) are those working low-skilled jobs, which consequently come with lower salaries,” Lee Kyu-yong, a senior researcher at the Korea Labor Institute, told The Korea Herald.“Thus, the wage gap is inevitable and it shouldn’t be seen as discrimination against migrant workers.”By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","55 percent higher wages ,korea has the biggest ,the biggest wage gap ,local foreign workers largest ,percent higher wages than","['South Korea', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'the Employment Outlook 2015', 'Paris', 'OECD']",3,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.65916395  0.49986574

The two Koreas will exchange the final lists on Oct. 8.The upcoming event, the first reunions since February 2014, is the outcome of an inter-Korean deal clinched following heightened tensions over land mines planted near the inter-Korean border by the North in early August.The issue of the separated families is one of the most pressing humanitarian matters as most of the surviving members are in their 80s and older. About half of the estimated 129,700 applicants for family reunions have died.More than 66,000 South Koreans are currently living without being able to meet their loved ones across the border following the Korean War, which ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, leaving South and North Korea technically at war.

According to Rep. Jasmine Lee of the ruling Saenuri Party, the national standard on sex education, which cost the government 600 million won ($499,000), was cowritten by a total of 19 individuals. Of them, nine had degrees in nursing, six in public health and four in education. But the writing staff did not include any experts in humanities, such as philosophy, sociology or gender studies, the office added.Lee also revealed that the Education Ministry did not consult with the Gender Equality Ministry when coming up with contents for the guidelines. “Over half of the contents in the guidelines are relevant to philosophy, society, culture and law,” the lawmaker said in a statement. “And it makes no sense that the manual did not include a single expert in humanities as its authors.” A South Korean schoolteacher is preparing for her class in an empty classroom. YonhapThe guidelines, prepared as a manual for sex education for teachers nationwide, have been fiercely criticized by civic groups and experts for its misleading and sexist remarks. Among the criticized statements is “males’ sexual desire can arise quickly on impulse, regardless of time or place,” and that “people of the opposite sex should not be alone together by themselves.” The manual also stated that “date rape can occur in situations where a man spends a lot of money on dates, as it is natural for him to want a commensurate compensation from the woman.”Lee suggested the Education Ministry come up with a new version of the manual to include input from the Gender Equality Ministry and humanities experts. By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","controversial sex ed guideline ,guideline had no humanities ,guidelines on sex education ,controversial guidelines on sex ,korea lawmaker the education","['the Education Ministry ’s', 'Jasmine Lee', 'Saenuri Party']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54819137  0.44292822

President Park Geun-hye speaks at a reopening of a historic building, used by Korea`s provisional government during Japan`s 1910-45 colonial rule, in Shanghai on Friday.(Yonhap)Wrapping up her trip to China, Park also attended a reopening ceremony of the headquarters of the Korean Provisional Government, a building that had served as an overseas base against Japan‘s aggression.Park called the historic building a symbol of friendship between South Korea and China, and a living proof that the two share the same values and history of struggle.“This showed that South Korea and China share the historic meaning and value of sites of our independence struggle,” she said. The provisional government was formed on April 13, 1919, as the Korean government-in-exile, a month after Korea launched an independence movement against Japan.The Korean Peninsula was later divided into the capitalist South and the communist North after its independence from Japan in 1945.Park expressed her gratitude to the Chinese government as it has helped preserve the building and other sites related to Korea’s independence movement against Japan.“Our people remember well that the Chinese people provided support” to Korea’s independence movement, Park said in an interview with the People’s Daily, a state-run Chinese newspaper. “We are thankful to our old friends,” she said.Before Shanghai, she held a summit in Beijing with her Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in which the two reaffirmed the strengthening ties between the two. The South Korean leader also attended a rare military parade seen as China’s show of military strength. In the summit with Park, Xi stressed that Koreans and Chinese fought against Japan’s aggressions when expressing his gratitude for her visit to China for the celebration. They also agreed to hold a trilateral meeting with Japan in late autumn for peace in the region.South Korea, Japan and China are trading partners but tensions still persist over territorial and other history-related issues. Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony and controlled much of China in the early part of the 20th century.Park said that only correct recognition of history can heal sufferings of the past.“The countries in the region need to make joint efforts to move toward a new future based on a correct recognition of history,” Park told the People’s Daily. “On that premise, sufferings of past history can be healed and overcome.”Before returning home, Park also called for an early ratification of a free trade deal between two countries at a business forum. On her trip, Park was accompanied by the largest number of South Korean business representatives this time to expand business ties with China, Cheong Wa Dae said.

KFS, the state agency for afforestation and forest resources, has been seeking ways to secure more green spaces around the living spaces in urban areas, which fall far below the global standards. Korea’s minimum area of urban living forest per capita turned out to be approximately 8.5 square meters, lower than the World Health Organization’s recommended minimum of 9 square meters. Yeouido Park in Seoul, an urban forest in Korea (KFS)By cities, the area of urban living forest per capita stood at only 4.35 square meters for Seoul, 5.29 square meters for Gyeonggi Province and 5.95 square meters for Incheon. This is far lower than London’s 27 square meters, New York’s 23 square meters and Paris’ 13 square meters. “With the rising interest in well-being and healthy leisure, the nationwide demand for sustainable green services has been on the increase,” a KFS official said. According to the KFS data, about 85.8 percent of Korean citizens and 95.5 percent of experts expected the demand for urban green areas to continue to increase. However, the dwindling government budget for urban green projects has fanned concerns that the state funding will fail to meet the ever-rising demand for environmental rights. The KFS’ urban forestation operation takes full account of the Park Geun-hye administration’s “Government 3.0” slogan, which calls for enhanced communication through the spreading of information to the public.As part of the ways to undo the informational divide between the government and the people in the afforestation sector, the KFS has broadened the communication channels to heed the people’s voice about green city policies. This includes strengthened cooperation with the civil organizations and the business enterprises that actively support corporate social responsibilities. The KFS has encouraged many socially aware businesses to participate in the urban city-making operations. The state forest agency incentivizes corporate contributors by offering promotional opportunities, such as displaying corporate names and trademarks or setting up commemorative indicators in the contributed green zones. Another big step was the addition of urban forests and street trees to the government’s list of carbon-reducing businesses.The KFS’ cooperation with civil organizations and citizen participants has also seized the eyes of urban administration experts. The KFS now has 20 operations of urban forest trusts that collect and manage voluntary donations for urban forestation. The KFS has also organized many urban forest events to encourage urbanites in Korea to enjoy a green environment amid the busy bustle of their city lives. Earlier in June 2014, “Bio Blitz,” an event for children and adults, successfully attracted about 4,000 visitors from across the country. The “Saving the Bees Together” event of May 2013 also attracted 15 environmentally friendly operations, in which participants were encouraged to share their experiences and knowledge of living creatures through social network services. Internet-based environmental operations have been gaining support from a wide range of participants, the KFS said. Thanks to the shared passion for a healthier living environment, the urban forestation operations saved some 16.2 billion won ($13.7 million) of government funds. The urban forestation budget for 2014 was 65.5 billion won. With people’s passion and participation in the urban forestation operation, the nation’s area of urban living forest per capita has steadily increased to 8.32 square meters as of 2013, up from 7.76 square meters in 2009 and 7.95 square meters in 2011. “We are confident that larger green space in the urban areas will contribute to enhancing people’s healthy lifestyles,” an KFS official said. Lee Yong-seok, a director at the KFS, said that the “in-city forest” project is an exemplary case in forestry policies to show the government’s effort for openness, sharing and cooperation, and aims to expand green spaces in our residential areas.

The appeal was made Monday to the Defense Ministry by about 100 people living on Gyodong Island in Ganghwa County, Incheon, located just south of the Northern Limit Line, the skirmish-prone maritime border with North Korea. “They have apparently been feeling anxious because the North Korean military threatens to shoot down the equipment,” a ministry official said, adding that the agency will come up with a solution taking public safety and the military’s psychological warfare strategy comprehensively into account. After being pulled out in 2004 as a result of inter-Korean military dialogue, the loudspeakers were reinstalled at 11 places along the Military Demarcation Line following the North’s 2010 fatal attack on the Cheonan corvette, but had remained idle until the South Korean military restarted the broadcasts last month.The broadcasts, which came in retaliation for the North’s Aug. 4 land mine attack that inflicted serious wounds on two soldiers, prompted the communist regime to launch artillery shells across the border, but again ended after 15 days following high-level inter-Korean dialogue.

The findings would help maximize the effectiveness of Korea’s knowledge aid for these countries,” officials from KDI School said.The respondent group -- consisting of civil servants, scholars and experts in development policies from international organizations -- were asked: “If you were the policymaker of your country, which of Korea’s development policy would you like to learn the most?” The participants were asked to pick out of eight sections related to the country’s development: macroeconomics policy, trade, finance, industry and technology, territorial development-national land development plan, environment, social development, government and law. These were then divided into 45 subcategories. Participants were allowed to pick more than one category.Of the subcategories, education from the social development section was found to be the most popular subject as it was selected by 11 percent of the respondents. It was particularly popular among respondents from Asia-Pacific, Africa, Middle East and Europe. Those from the Americas were most interested in social infrastructure section, encompassing education, welfare and health. Social infrastructure from national land development plan section was the second most popular category with 10 percent of respondents picking it, followed by international trade from the trade section at 9 percent.Internal conflict from the government and law sections were the least popular of all subcategories.In general, government officials showed interest in policies related to the economy. African civil servants were most interested in macroeconomic policy, while officials from the Americas picked international trade. Officials from Asia-Pacific and Middle East respectively found economic development and economic planning most appealing.But green growth was the No. 1 category among European officials.Researchers, on the other hand, were more interested in the environment section. Those from Africa put energy on the top of their list, while researchers from the Americas showed high interest in green growth.The survey was conducted to update the content for K-Developedia(www.kdevelopedia.org), an online database on information related to Korea's development developed by the KDI School of Public Policy and Management in 2012. “It is a global development experience-sharing platform that systematically organized material on knowledge resources regarding Korea's seven decades of development experience,” according to KDI School officials.K-Developedia provides more than 30,000 resources on Korean development experience with data published by organizations such as the KDI, World Bank and the OECD, and has users from 155 countries around the world.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","education as favored korean ,korean policy civil servants ,korea most appealing development ,south korea most appealing ,favored korean policy civil","['South Korea ’s', 'KDI School of Public Policy and Management', 'the KDI School']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4748227   0.26286572

Judge Kwak Hyung-sub of the Seoul Central District Court ruled that the suit was filed after statute of limitations expired, making the suit null and void. The suit was filed in 2013, more than four years after the sisters’ suicide. According to local regulations, compensation suits must be filed within three years of an incident. In 2004, the older sister began working as a bit-part actor on the suggestion of her sibling, who was hoping to become an actress. The older sister, who was an introvert and had a record of receiving counseling, was soon subjected to sexual harassment by employees of the company managing bit-part actors. The harassments turned to assaults, and the management company’s employees allegedly confined her in a motel room and raped her on numerous occasions. Her assailants are also alleged to have threatened to kill the victim’s mother and to sell off her sister if she resisted. The alleged assailants are also reported to have been aware that others were sexually assaulting the victim, and used the knowledge to force her into performing further sexual acts. The victim filed a police report in December that year, but dropped the charges saying that the facts of the case would be hard to prove and that she was in too much pain recalling the ordeal. She then went on to receive treatment for a number of years, until she killed herself in 2009.A month after the victim’s suicide, her sister followed suit.By Choi He-suk (cheesuk@heraldcorp.com)","rape victim mother sparks ,daughters who committed suicide ,victim mother sparks outrage ,mother sparks outrage seoul ,rape victim mother","['Seoul', 'Kwak Hyung - sub', 'the Seoul Central District Court']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49761504  0.16361728

Han Sun-kyo of the Saenuri Party, the number of Chinese nationals obtaining Korean driver’s licenses surged to about 4,700 last year, jumping by 30-fold in two years. The rate of car accidents involving foreigners also rose by 2.6 times to nearly 2,000, the report said.  A driver’s license test agency is crowded with driving test applicants in Gangnam, Seoul, on Aug. 17. (Yonhap)The surge was especially noticeable on Jejudo Island, where over 1,100 Chinese obtained driver’s licenses in the first half of this year. In 2012, only two Chinese nationals acquired a license there.In the meantime, car accidents involving foreigners also increased in Jeju from six to 40 cases between 2012 and last year. “Over 40 percent of last year’s accidents involved Chinese visitors,” Jeju police agency said.The quick and simple process of obtaining a driver’s license in Korea contributed to the surge in numbers, officials said. As the Korean driver’s license rules were eased in 2011, would-be drivers are able to obtain the license in 4-5 days by taking 10 hours of classes and passing a set of driving tests. The cost is also relatively cheap at around 500,000 won ($420). The Korean driver’s license is as valid as Chinese ones as long as the drivers pass a simple written test back in China.In China, on the other hand, getting a driver’s license takes at least several months, with the cost ranging from 5,000 yuan ($790) to 10,000 yuan. Han pointed out that the lax regulations on driver’s licenses should be strengthened in order to prevent misuse and tighten road security.The visa-free entry policy for Chinese sightseers to Jejudo Island from 2008 has likely affected the number increase as well, the authorities said. Acknowledging the easy access of Korean driver’s licenses, some Korean driving academies have offered driving lessons and courses in Chinese for the tourists. Some have even hired Chinese interpreters to better draw Chinese customers. As more Chinese nationals opted to acquire Korean licenses, Beijing has also taken issue, citing safety concerns.The Chinese government asked Seoul late last year to impose restrictions on Chinese visitors seeking driver’s licenses. The Korean police, however, reportedly replied that there was no legal basis to do so. In June, Shanghai discretionally suspended accepting Korean driver’s licenses for short-stay visitors.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","korean driver licenses surged ,chinese acquiring korean driver ,driving test attracts chinese ,nationals obtaining korean driver ,number of chinese tourists","['korean', 'chinese', 'Han Sun - kyo', 'the Saenuri Party', 'chinese', 'korean']",3,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.67329812  0.54015303

Its operations had been stopped for some time due to cross-border tensions. (Yonhap)On Saturday, a day after Seoul proposed the Red Cross talks, Pyongyang agreed to hold them to determine the time, venue and the scale of reunions at South Korea’s Peace House in the truce village of Panmunjeom, according to Seoul’s Unification Ministry.The talks were arranged four days after the two Koreas agreed to hold the working-level talks early next month. After the four-day marathon talks last Tuesday, the two agreed to seek the reunions on the occasion of Chuseok, a major Korean holiday that falls on Sept. 27.The family reunions are expected to be held in early October given preparatory procedures including a survey of the surviving members of the separated families. The reunions have not been held since February 2014 amid high cross-border tensions.Pyongyang’s relatively easy acceptance of the proposal for the Red Cross talks signaled its will to mend fences with Seoul, observers said. In the past, Pyongyang often made counterproposals to reject Seoul’s offers of dialogue or unilaterally canceled the talks.Last Friday, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un indicated his desire to improve ties with the South, evaluating the agreement of the latest high-level talks as a “significant turning point” to bring cross-border relations on a path toward reconciliation and trust.Amid the emergent mood for dialogue, the two Koreas were seen downgrading their vigilance posture to a peacetime level.As agreed upon during last week’s high-level talks, Pyongyang has lifted its “quasi-state of war” and reportedly withdrawn its special vigilance directives. Seoul has also revised downward its military readiness posture, according to reports.Despite these positive developments, Seoul officials cautioned against excessive optimism over the prospects of inter-Korean ties, noting that a series of pending issues could derail the two neighbors’ reconciliatory and trust-building efforts.“We never know what would happen during the future talks with the North. We are not yet at the stage to predict (a positive development of inter-Korean relations), and we thus maintain a calm position,” a senior Seoul official told media.Indeed, a number of tough issues including Pyongyang’s unceasing pursuit of nuclear arms are expected to fuel cross-border tensions. In particular, the issue of the lifting of Seoul’s so-called May 24 sanctions against Pyongyang remains a daunting challenge with both sides refusing to budge.Seoul is adamant in its position that should it want the sanctions to be lifted, Pyongyang should apologize for its 2010 torpedo attack on the corvette Cheonan that killed 46 sailors, while Pyongyang continues to deny its responsibility.Apart from the pending issues, the North’s possible additional provocations could bring the two Koreas back on a collision course. Analysts presume that the reclusive state could set off provocations such as a long-range rocket launch around Oct. 10, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party, to strengthen its internal unity and show off its military presence to the outside world.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","gangwon province on sunday ,abated over the weekend ,on sunday its operations ,reunions of separated families ,border tensions further abated","['North Korea', 'Red Cross', 'DMZ', 'Daemari Station in Cheolwon', 'Gangwon Province']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46034548  0.85012907

Each drum can hold 200 liters of waste material, while the heavily reinforced silo is built 130 meters underground and is connected to the surface by a 1,415-meter service tunnel. The six silos are expected to be filled in 10 years.According to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, the key facilities are all earthquake-proof, with the shutter doors of the service tunnel even being designed to withstand a tsunami. The repository is located close to the East Sea so nuclear waste can be brought in by ship from other parts of the country.Over the past year, the Korea Radioactive Waste Agency, the repository's operator, has secured various permits and conducted numerous tests and trial runs to make certain it is safe to move and store nuclear waste on the 2.14-million-square-meter site. The repository started to temporarily house nuclear waste in 2010.Highlighting the importance of safety, Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn said at the dedication ceremony that the utmost attention will be paid to safety.""There will be no compromises when it comes to safety issues,"" he said, expressing gratitude to Gyeongju citizens for agreeing to host the repository. The project had been held up repeatedly due to opposition from residents who did not want a radioactive waste site near their homes.Gyeongju, a historic city 371 kilometers southeast of Seoul, has been promised over 3.22 trillion won in compensation from 2007 to 2035 for hosting the repository, with 1.71 trillion won having been provided as of 2014.Work on the repository began in July 2007, with major construction being completed in June last year.After the opening of the first part of the repository, the government will now seek permission to start the second phase, which can accommodate another 125,000 drums of nuclear waste, the ministry said.These facilities are to be built on the surface and should be completed by December 2019, although it could be delayed.South Korea, which relies heavily on nuclear power, has been hard pressed to find storage space for its nuclear waste. The nation now operates 24 nuclear reactors, which generate about a third of the electricity for Asia's fourth-largest economy.The country has yet to resolve what it will do with its high level radioactive waste coming from nuclear power plants. At present, such wastes are held in temporary holding areas at nuclear power plants, but such facilities are nearing full capacity.

It did not say when the meeting was held, but the communist nation is known to often report events a day after they take place.The meeting ""dismissed some members of the WPK Central Military Commission and appointed new ones and dealt with an organizational matter,"" the KCNA said in an English dispatch, monitored in Seoul. Kim Jong-un (Yonhap)It did not elaborate on the reasons for the dismissals, but the report has prompted speculation here that it may be related to the Aug. 4 land mine explosion inside the Demilitarized Zone that maimed two South Korean soldiers.North Korea initially insisted that it did not place the land mines but later expressed ""regret"" over the incident in a landmark deal sealed between the Koreas on Tuesday.South Korean military officials said they are closely monitoring the situation.""The fact that the North expressed regret over the land mine attack can be seen from Kim Jong-un's perspective as a terrible defeat,"" said one official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.""Kim Jong-un has an impulsive and aggressive character, so he won't overlook it.""The official said he believes someone will have to take responsibility for the land mine attack.""Once we know who was dismissed, it will be possible to make a fair assumption, so we are closely following the situation,"" he said.Kim spoke in detail about the agreement, saying ""under the touch-and-go situation the WPK displayed correct leadership art by steering the whole country, all the people and the service personnel, and made resolute decisions and set forth strategic policies for putting the difficult situation under control.""The deal averted a military clash between the Koreas as tensions flared up over the land mine attack and South Korea's resumption of anti-Pyongyang loudspeaker broadcasts along the border.On Aug. 20, North Korea fired artillery shells across the border in apparent anger over the broadcasts, leading to a rare exchange of fire between the sides.That day, Kim ordered the military to move into a war footing as he presided over the same enlarged session of the party's central military commission.""Kim Jong-un analyzed and reviewed the preparations for military operations made by the frontline units which had been in the state of war, and the work done in various fields in the areas where the semi-war state had been declared and how the north-south high-level urgent contact was made and appreciated them,"" the KCNA said.Kim credited his nation with defending peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in the region by proposing the inter-Korean talks first.Peace was restored because of the North's ""tremendous military muscle with the nuclear deterrent for self-defense,"" he noted, ""underscoring once again the need to channel top priority efforts into bolstering up the military capability for national defense.""Kim ""specified strategic tasks and ways for doing so,"" but the KCNA did not elaborate.The North Korean leader also ordered recovery work in the aftermath of a flood that killed more than 40 people and destroyed many houses in the northeastern border town of Rason.The recovery should be completed before the 70th founding anniversary of the party, which falls on Oct. 10, he said.On Kim's remarks, South Korea's Unification Ministry said it ""assesses"" the fact that the North called the agreement a turning point toward inter-Korean reconciliation and trust.""We expect North Korea will abide by the agreement and urge it to faithfully implement it,"" spokesman Jeong Joon-hee said during a press briefing.Asked whether South Korea plans to provide flood relief to the North, Jeong said the government will review the issue from a humanitarian stance if the North requests help.

Shim and Baek, who, as part of their mandatory military service duty, served at the police unit guarding South Korea's easternmost islets of Dokdo, which Japan has long laid claims to, said they became interested in the sexual slavery issue after watching an animation film about victims.Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mainly from Korea, which was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. But Japan has long attempted to water down the atrocity.The sexual slavery issue has been the biggest thorn in frayed relations between Japan and South Korea, with Seoul demanding Tokyo take steps to address the grievances of elderly Korean victims and Japan refusing to do so.Earlier this month, Abe issued a statement commemorating the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, but failed gain to offer a clear apology of his own for the sexual slavery issue. ""He lost another opportunity to solve the issue by choosing to skirt blame and the responsibility of giving an apology,"" Lee Jung-sil, president of the Washington Coalition for Comfort Women Issues, said during the rally in front of the Japanese Embassy.

(Yonhap)The latest talks, however, indicated a notable change in the North’s attitude: Pyongyang, despite its incorrigible denial of provocations during and after the rare talks, consistently displayed its will to settle the issues, according to Seoul officials.The change, indeed, boded well for the future of inter-Korean relations, which have been deteriorating with the North sticking to its nuclear program and setting off military provocations that, in turn, triggered stern reactions from the South, analysts said.“The change in the attitude stemmed from Pyongyang’s desire for a turnaround in the current situation, in which sanctions persist while Seoul and Washington have raised pressure on it to give up its nuclear program,” said Koh Yoo-hwan, a North Korean studies professor at Dongguk University. “The North appears to have judged that should it fail to make any turning point this time amid the escalating military standoff, it would not be able to disentangle inter-Korean ties and its relations with the international community in the coming years.”After the four-day talks that ended Tuesday morning with a rare expression of regret from Pyongyang over the Aug. 4 land mine attack, a mood emerged for bilateral cooperation in the civil and public sectors, which would, in the long run, help Pyongyang shore up its economy.During the protracted talks, the two sides agreed to hold further government talks on a regular basis to discuss pending issues that are expected to range from the long-stalled tours to Mount Geumgangsan to the lifting of Seoul’s economic sanctions against Pyongyang.Although the two sides remain measures apart over how to settle those issues, their commitment to dialogue as a key means to tackle them marks a meaningful change for the better, observers noted.While the outcome of the talks is being trumpeted here as a feat of Seoul’s “principled” approach toward the recalcitrant regime, Pyongyang was seen trying to downplay what could be seen as losses in the latest negotiations, apparently for internal propaganda purposes.Holding a press conference after the talks, Hwang Pyong-so, director of the North Korean military’s General Political Bureau, who attended the talks, repeated the North’s denial of the mine provocation, saying the incident was fabricated by the South. The conference itself drew attention in the South as it has been rare for the North Korean leadership to try to explain their position to the general public. While outcomes of talks with the South have often been announced via state-controlled media, it is unprecedented in the North for its chief negotiator to directly explain the process on television, observers noted.After the message that was seemingly intended for a domestic audience, Hwang also said that it was a relief to see the two Koreas’ joint efforts having created fresh grounds to improve the relations.South Korea, for its part, began preparation for the envisioned inter-Korean talks as agreed upon at the border talks. Seoul’s Unification Ministry also said that the May 24 sanctions, imposed after the North’s sinking of a South Korean warship in 2010, could also be discussed at the talks. As for the sanctions, the ministry reiterated that the North should take “responsible measures” to address the issue of the deadly sinking, should it want them to be lifted.Meanwhile, the latest confrontation with the North allowed a broader peak into the regime under the leadership of Kim Jong-un.Above all, Pyongyang revealed the set of initial military steps it would take in case of an armed conflict with its southern neighbor backed by the U.S.After declaring what it calls a “quasi-state of warfare,” the North got its aerial defense radar up and running, and forward-deployed its artillery forces that put Seoul and its surrounding area within striking range.The North was also spotted preparing for the launch of short- and mid-range missiles and transporting its special commandos toward the frontline regions. Its navy deployed some 70 percent of its submarines from their bases, while it also put into combat position a number of hovercrafts to be used to infiltrate South Korea’s border islands.All these movements indicated that the North might try to launch surprise attacks to secure a victory in a rapid and decisive manner, should a contingency occur.South Korean and U.S. military authorities are reportedly considering reflecting on their observations of the North’s military movements as they seek to reorganize their wartime operations procedures in line with shifts in the security environment.Observers say Pyongyang’s latest employment of the brinkmanship tactic also yielded an unwanted phenomenon in the South: strengthening the unity among South Koreans, who have often been deeply divided over North Korea issues, and as a result pushing up public support for President Park Geun-hye. The brinkmanship has also strained Pyongyang’s ties with Beijing, analysts say, given that the spike in cross-border tensions could have dampened the festive mood in China ahead of its ceremony to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.

(Unification Ministry)However, the two sides reached an agreement through their determination to defuse tensions, which sharply rose after the North forward-deployed a majority of its submarines and artillery assets and the South vowed stern retaliation.“The North Korean side repeatedly said that they came all the way there to resolve pending issues. They showed their determination to do so,” the official at Seoul’s Unification Ministry, who was informed of the negotiation process, said on the customary condition of anonymity.“The fact that Hwang Pyong-so, one of the top military officers, traveled all the way to the Peace House on the South Korean side of the border village of Panmunjeom also showed their seriousness to resolve the issues. It is rare for the top military official to come here in times of heightened military tensions.”Hwang, the director of the North Korean military’s General Political Bureau, and Kim Yang-gon, a secretary of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party, represented the North Korean side during the talks. Their South Korean counterparts were Kim Kwan-jin, chief of Cheong Wa Dae’s National Security Office, and Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo.At one point during the negotiation, the air turned especially serious when Pyongyang tried to shift the focus to the future in its apparent attempt to avoid discussing its past provocations. This, in turn, struck the nerve of Kim, the former defense minister, the official said.“Kim blurted out that our young soldiers with a bright future got injured in the detonation of land mines in the Demilitarized Zone. But the North reiterated that the two sides needed to look toward the future,” he said.To counter the North’s denial of its responsibility for the Aug. 4 land mine attack, the South Korean side also reportedly presented evidence.The toughest part of the negotiation was ensuring that the North would not stage future provocations, the official said, noting that getting the North to express “regret” over the land mine incident was less difficult.Meanwhile, over the course of the lengthy talks, the two sides kept their distance, including by having meals separately. The North Korean officials traveled back to their building a few minutes away while the South Korean officials dined at the Peace House.By Song Sang-ho  (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","nerves during marathon talks ,marathon talks an intense ,during marathon talks ,of nerves during marathon ,seoul official said tuesday","['South Korea', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'Koreas', 'South Korea ’s', 'inter - korean']",3,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.46032169  0.66578704

The two sides began the talks on Saturday evening.Kim said South Korea made a persistent demand for the prevention of recurrence of provocations to break a vicious cycle of North Korea's provocations.For decades, North Korea has a track record of carrying out provocations against South Korea, including the sinking of a South Korean warship and the shelling of a South Korean border island, both in 2010 that killed 50 South Koreans.In return for the North's expression of regret, South Korea agreed to stop anti-Pyongyang broadcasts along the heavily fortified border as of 12 p.m. Tuesday unless an abnormal situation occurs, Kim said.South Korea resumed the propaganda broadcasts earlier this month for the first time in 11 years in retaliation against North Korea for the landmine attack.North Korea has repeatedly called for the end of the broadcasts critical of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, viewing them as an insult to its dignity. The isolated country is also concerned that an influx of outside information could pose a threat to its young leader.In a sign of defusing tensions, North Korea said it will lift the semi-war state it had imposed on its military during the latest standoff.The United States also hailed the breakthrough deal.""We support President Park's tireless efforts to improve inter-Korean relations, which support peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula,"" State Department spokesman John Kirby said at a regular briefing.South and North Korea also agreed to hold talks in either Seoul or Pyongyang at an early date to improve inter-Korean relations, said Kim, Seoul's top negotiator, noting the sides came up with a basic framework for development of inter-Korean ties.""We expect the two sides will implement the agreement in good faith and create trust through dialogue and cooperation,"" said Kim.Still, Kim declined to comment on whether he discussed with his North Korean counterpart on an inter-Korean summit.In January, Park held out the prospect of a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, days after Kim said he is willing to hold summit talks with Park, if proper conditions are met.Park's two liberal predecessors held summit talks with then North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, the late father of the current leader Kim, in Pyongyang in 2000 and 2007, respectively.The two Koreas also agreed to hold Red Cross talks early next month to arrange for reunions of families separated since the 1950-53 Korean War.The two sides hope to stage the reunions around Chuseok, the Korean equivalent of Thanksgiving Day, which is celebrated in both Koreas and falls on Sept. 27.Park said the two Koreas should ""heal the pain of separated families.""U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon welcomed the agreement.""I highly appreciate the agreement to hold regular inter-Korean dialogue, and hope that this will serve as a mechanism to effectively manage any problems that may arise on the Korean Peninsula,"" Ban, a former South Korean foreign minister, said in a statement.Millions of Koreans remain separated since the Korean War, which ended in a cease-fire, not a peace treaty.Family reunions are a pressing humanitarian issue on the divided peninsula, as most of the separated family members are in their 70s and 80s, and wish to see their long-lost relatives before they die.There are no direct means of contact between ordinary civilians of the two countries that remain divided by a heavily fortified border.In 2014, the two sides held a series of temporary family reunions for the first time in more than three years.

Uncertainties were growing across the border as the North Korean military was seen sharply building up frontline artillery and sending out an unprecedented number of submarines for unidentified operations since leader Kim Jong-un declared a “quasi-state of war” on Friday. The North has forward-deployed hovercraft and 76.2-milimeter artillery guns, Seoul officials said, with frontline troops adopting full combat readiness. “While constantly monitoring the crisis situation on the peninsula, South Korea and the U.S. are flexibly looking into the deployment timing of U.S. strategic assets,” Defense Ministry spokesperson Kim Min-seok said at a news briefing. “The first is to deter a possible provocation by North Korea through the alliance’s robust readiness posture, and then we respond rigorously, to the degree where (the North) would regret it, if it indeed commits a provocation,” he said.  Military transport vehicles carrying Army troops move past the Unification Bridge, close to the Demilitarized Zone, in Paju, Gyeonggi Province, Monday. (Yonhap)Kim did not elaborate on details of the possible incoming weapons, but a nuclear-capable B-52 Stratofortress appears to be the most likely option given its military clout, the allies’ past practices and its relatively short flight time of about four hours to reach the peninsula.  During joint military exercises early last year, the U.S. sent B-52 and B-2 bombers and an F-22 stealth fighter over the peninsula and brought in a nuclear submarine, drawing Pyongyang’s repeated threats of nuclear war. The allies have also deployed powerful warships, bombers and fighters including the formidable nuclear USS George Washington aircraft carrier and the F/A-18 Hornet fighter jet in a display of force against North Korea’s major provocations. Kim’s remarks came one day after the ministry unveiled that front-line North Korean units have placed in ready position twice as many gunners as detected Friday, and that it was being unable to locate about 50 undersea vehicles, or 70 percent of the North’s submarine fleet, which have apparently left their bases.The move is likely to be aimed at securing the upper hand in the inter-Korean negotiations which have been taking place at the border village of Panmunjeom since Saturday, while gearing up for an additional provocation in case of a breakdown of the talks, military sources said. To better counter North Korea’s maritime threats, Washington has strengthened antisubmarine and other maritime warfare exercises with South Korea, a U.S. Defense Department report said.“In Northeast Asia, the department conducts several regular maritime exercises with Japan and South Korea focusing on enhancing our combined capabilities to counter provocations and manage the changing Northeast Asian security environment,” the Asia-Pacific Maritime Strategy report said. “Though its original purpose was to counter special operations forces, the annual bilateral Key Resolve/Foal Eagle exercise with the ROK now includes amphibious operations and antisubmarine warfare in recognition of the importance of the maritime domain in defending South Korea.”By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","mobilize 52 strategic bomber ,send 52 bomber nuke ,seoul officials said monday ,attacks by north korea ,to send 52 bomber","['South Korea', 'U.S.', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'Kim']",3,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.40672597  0.40585586

Following disappointing economic data, the surprise move triggered fears of a currency war because a weak yuan helps boost Chinese exports overseas, while deepening worries over the health of the world's second-largest economy. Before last week's major devaluation, the yuan's value against the U.S. dollar had been barely changed, but the yuan lost about 3 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar. In July, China's exports plunged 8.3 percent from the same month last year, while imports dived 8.1 percent year-on-year. China targets this year's economic growth rate at 7 percent, marking the slowest expansion in 25 years.

Lee said he had spurned the offers.At that time, North Korea accused Lee of malignantly hurting the North's regime, insisting that his book is ""peppered with lies.""""The rumor about Won being purged has not been confirmed,"" said a government official.Jeong Joon-hee, spokesman at the Unification Ministry, said at a regular press briefing that the ministry cannot officially confirm intelligence about North Korea.South Korea's spy agency earlier said that the North Korean leader has tightened his grip on his power base in a brutal way, including the execution of about 70 senior officials, including the North's former defense chief, Hyon Yong-chol.

And she also seems to agree that the Abe statement contains enough to warrant further open doors, not slam and shut,"" Evans Revere, senior Director at Albright Stonebridge Group, said at a Heritage Foundation discussion.Revere was referring to Park's Liberation Day address in which she positively assessed Abe's statement despite criticism that the nationalist Japanese leader failed again to offer a clear apology for the country's sexual enslavement of Korean women for its troops during World War II.In the address, Park said Abe's statement falls short of expectations, but said it's still worth noting that Abe promised that positions of previous cabinets will remain unshakable. The remarks were seen as an expression of her willingness to improve relations with Japan.""Prime Minister Abe's statement appears to have given Koreans just enough to work with as the two sides explore ways to try to improve ties and settle various pending issues between them.Without question, the Abe statement could have been better and certainly more could have been said to assuage Korean sensitivities,"" Revere said.The expert said that Abe should have made ""a stand-alone reference"" to the suffering of the Korean people, instead of merely including them in a list of the many in the region. The Japanese leader should have also made a specific reference to the sexual slavery issue, he said.Revere said he believes it was also a mistake by Abe to talk about the apology burden of future generations.""For Japan to be relieved of the need for future apologies, it's important that today's expressions of remorse and regret are seen as genuine, credible and sincere. To do so, Tokyo is going to have to make further efforts to reconcile with its Korean neighbor,"" he said.Revere said it is too early to tell whether Seoul and Tokyo will be able to make progress on thorny issues.""But what seems clear at this point is that in the aftermath of the Abe statement and thanks to what I believe is President Park's very wise and very prudent and very statesman-like reaction to it, the two sides seem prepared to try,"" he said.Sheila Smith, senior fellow for Japan studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, also praised Park's address as ""measured and thoughtful,"" saying it left room to work with Abe if the two governments decide that is what they want to do, just as the Abe statement left room to work.The two leaders at least ""did not present an additional hurdle,"" she said.Smith also expressed hope for the realization of a trilateral summit between Park, Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of China's war anniversary event set for next month.""I hope that this fall will be an occasion for the three leaders to meet and I hope that Seoul and Tokyo will find a way to make that meeting a positive opportunity for the relationship,"" she said.U.S. experts also expressed opposition to either Park or Abe attending China's military parade.""Speaking very frankly, how appropriate would it be for a Korean president to be at a military parade, if that's an option, that is hosted by the last country to have invaded Korea?"" Revere said, referring to China fighting alongside North Korea during the Korean War.He said the military parade should be separated from visits to Beijing.Michael Green, the Japan chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that Park and Abe should visit Beijing only after the Chinese parade.""I think it's better to go after than before because then you know what happened in the parade and you can put it in context.

The sides held talks at the Gaeseong industrial complex at the North Korean border city on Monday. Under the deal, the monthly pay, which includes insurance fees and other benefits, will increase to $73.87 from $70.35 and apply retroactively from March. An inter-Korean committee tasked with the operation of the business district will continue to discuss ways to improve the fundamental wage structure, a ministry official said. “The two sides also agreed to have businesses adjust incentives according to the employees’ participation, contribution to production and attitude at work, while ensuring stable labor supplies,” the official told reporters on condition of anonymity. “We resolved the most pressing issues at hand but still have a long way to go. We will work through dialogue to come up with a reasonable wage system in a way that helps enhance productivity.” The row broke out in February as the North declared a 5.18 percent wage hike as part of a sweeping regulation amendment, unilaterally rescinding the existing 5 percent annual ceiling that has ruled for years. The negotiations kicked off in July with the joint panel and Pyongyang’s General Bureau of the Special Zone Development Guidance but had made little progress in the face of the North’s unwavering demands. With other compensation taken into account, the total salaries for the some 55,000 workers will likely rise more than 5 percent, according to an official at an association of the 124 South Korean firms operating factories in Gaeseong. Nestling just north of the heavily fortified border, the complex was launched in 2004 and has since been the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean rapprochement.  In 2013, the complex saw an unprecedented four-month freeze after Pyongyang suddenly barred South Koreans’ entry to the district and withdrew its workers in apparent protest against U.N. sanctions and Seoul-Washington military exercises.(heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","unification ministry said tuesday ,months of grueling negotiations ,monday under the deal ,said tuesday following months ,raise the minimum wage","['Shin Hyon - heeThe', 'Koreas', 'north korean', 'the Unification Ministry', 'Gaeseong', 'north korean']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39701921  0.48728186

It also comes as last week's speech by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe stopped short of directly mentioning the Japanese military's sexual enslavement of women during the war.According to the documents, the Japanese military forced dozens of Korean women to work as sex slaves when it set up military brothels in northeastern Chinese regions, including Mudanjiang, in October 1941. The women were among about 2,000 Korean women who were forcibly recruited by the Japanese military in the 1940s, the state-run China News Service reported, citing the documents. Historians estimate that more than 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were coerced into sexual servitude at front-line Japanese brothels during the war. From 1910 to 1945, the Korean Peninsula was a Japanese colony. Those sex slaves were euphemistically called ""comfort women"" by the Japanese military.Japan has long attempted to water down the atrocity.Abe's Cabinet, for example, angered South Korea last year with its attempt to ""review"" a 1993 statement of apology, known as the Kono Statement. Though Japan later said it still stands by the apology, the move was seen as an attempt to undermine the apology's credibility.

The paper said similar justifications are made at the Yasukuni Shrine's museum in Tokyo that glorifies Japan's wartime past.""Far from liberating Asia, Tokyo exercised totalitarian control over its colonies, forcing subjects to adopt Japanese names, language, culture and history,"" the editorial said.""We and other friends of Japan share Mr. Abe's desire to see it become a normal nation not shackled by its past, not least so it can be trusted to stand with other democracies against potential Chinese aggression.

It showed that 17.8 percent of Korean teens whose parents both smoke were smoking as of last year. Meanwhile, only 4.3 percent of teenagers with nonsmoking parents were smoking.The study also found that Korean teen smokers are more influenced by their mothers than fathers. A total of 13.6 percent of teenagers with smoking mothers but without smoking fathers were smoking last year, while only 6.4 percent of those with smoking fathers but without smoking mothers were doing the same.Korean teens who smoke were also significantly influenced by their friends and siblings. While only 0.8 percent of Korean teens whose close friends don’t smoke were smoking last year, 13.5 percent of those whose friends smoke picked up the habit. Also, 15.8 percent of teens whose siblings smoke followed suit, compared to 4.27 percent of those without smoking siblings.  A South Korean teenager whose parents are both smokers is more than four times as likely to smoke as a teenager with nonsmoking parents, a government report showed. (123RF)The report also showed that the smoking rate of teenagers who attend schools that focus on job training was significantly higher than those who attend schools that concentrate on academics. The smoking rate for students who attend vocational schools was 25.6 percent, while that of students at academic schools was 10.9 percent.Other correlations were found in socioeconomic status of the parents and academic performance. While 11.8 percent of teens who declared a low household income level were smoking, 7.2 percent of those in high-income homes were doing the same. Also, the proportion of smoking teens who said their school performance was low (15.2 percent) was four times higher than those who said they are doing well in school (3.8 percent).Teen smoking was also associated with mental health and teen drinking. The number of teenagers who both drink and smoke was 6.4 times higher than those who drink but don’t smoke. Smoking teenagers were also 1.9 times more likely to be depressed and 1.4 times more likely to skip their breakfasts than nonsmoking teens. According to the U.S.’ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, teen smokers are more likely to use illegal drugs, and about one-third of them will continue to smoke and die later in life from a smoking-related illness.South Korea is home to almost 10 million smokers, and an estimated 57,000 die each year due to smoking-related diseases including lung cancer. Last year, it had one of the highest smoking rates for adult males among the nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development at 43.7 percent, surpassing the OECD average of 26 percent. The parliament last year approved an 80 percent increase in the price of cigarettes in an effort to curb smoking.

""South Korea plans to take necessary measures to ensure the seamless operation of the factory park.""A total of 124 South Korean small and medium-size enterprises operate factories at the park, which employs about 55,000 North Korean workers. The industrial complex, which opened in 2004, remains the most salient outcome of inter-Korean rapprochement.The North's decision has pushed back all entries by South Korean businessmen into the complex by half an hour, which also leads them to start and finish later than in the past.The two Koreas used to use identical standard time, set under Japan's colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula.South Korea has voiced concerns that the time difference could cause some logistical problems, such as the timetables used at the Gaeseong Industrial Complex.Seoul said that South Korea's choice of the present time zone is based on practical benefits, such as daylight savings, rather than colonial history.

224,224,Following footsteps of pioneers in women’s history,"When Chinese-born Oh Hee-ock moved to Korea in 1946, a year after her country was liberated from the Japanese colonial rule, she was determined to continue her education and get a job.

Born in 1926 to China-based Korean independence activists in today’s Manchuria, she had studied English and Chinese as well as Korean, while participating in her parents’ fierce military activism starting at age 14.Now 89, Oh is a retired teacher and a recognized independence activist. “My father emphasized the importance of education for me and my sister. Even when he was imprisoned by the Japanese, he would send my mother letters from jail to make sure she sent us to school no matter how difficult the circumstances were,” she said. “Not many girls at the time had the privilege of having a father like that.”Oh’s life story ― the former activist worked as a teacher full-time for 37 years from 1954-1991 while raising her three children ― contrasts and resonates with the younger generation of today’s Korea, where twice as many women as men still experience career disruptions. Only 50 percent of all women participate in the workforce, in spite of their high levels of education. According to scholar Joo Jae-seon’s latest research for Korea Women’s Development Institute, the number of Korean high school girls who enrolled in post-secondary education increased dramatically by 40.3 percentage points, from 34.3 percent in 1965 to 74.6 percent last year.  Korea`s first nurses Kim Martha (right) and Lee Grace (Korean Nurses Association)Despite their rising education levels, Korean women’s employment rate increased by just 15.2 percentage points in 1963-2014, from 34.3 percent to 49.5 percent. The average amount of hours a married woman spent on domestic affairs daily also decreased by only 32 minutes since 1999 until last year, from four hours and 30 minutes to four hours and 18 minutes.“As South Korea experienced rapid economic development, Korean parents very quickly embraced the idea that they should educate their daughters as much as their sons,” said Joo.“But the idea of their daughters getting a paid job was a different matter. Even until the 1990s, the general notion was that a woman’s primary duty, regardless of her education level, was to nurture her children well. As the statistics show, Korea is not making good use of its high-equality human resources because of the still-existing gender inequality.”Activist Oh’s life story, along with the ones of other women advocates for Korean independence, is being featured at a special exhibition commemorating the 70th anniversary of Korea’s liberation in Seoul. The women’s achievements are not only important to Korea’s modern history, but also give a significant meaning to today’s Korean feminism and the pursuit of gender parity, experts said. “Korea’s gender equality certainly still has a long way to go,” said Lee Sung-sook, the director of the National Women’s History Exhibition Hall. “But without figures like Oh ― there were many remarkable women who fought against inequality in this country ― we wouldn’t have the foundation for changes that need to be made in the future.”As Lee pointed out, Oh wasn’t the only pioneering woman in Korea’s modern history. Almost 20 years before Oh was born, Kim Martha, a former abused housewife, became the first Korean nurse in history. Before her husband disappeared on her with their two children, the fingers of her right hand and her nasal bone were cut off by her jealous spouse with a knife. Lee never got to see her children after her husband left her. Despite her disabilities, she managed to get a job as a maid at a hospital run by American doctors and missionaries, and was eventually admitted as a student at Korea’s first nursing school and became a nurse upon her graduation in 1908. Her colleague, Lee Grace, had been a servant for an aristocratic family and had been walking with a hobble after suffering a childhood disease that was left untreated. Lee’s leg fully recovered after treatment by American surgeons, and she decided to study nursing. She became Korea’s first nurse, along with Kim after graduating from the Pogunyogwan Training School for Nurses, which is now the division of nursing science at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. “The two women’s achievements are monumental,” said Kim Ok-soo, director of the Korean Nurses Association. “At the time, almost all Korean women lacked access to education and were therefore illiterate. They were not allowed to make their own life decisions. But Lee and Kim went against the social norms in spite of their class status and disabilities. They were two of the very first Korean women who voluntarily chose to have a specialized career that required very specific skills and training.”In 1952, Korea welcomed its first woman lawyer, Lee Tai-young (1914-1998). Throughout her life, she fought against domestic violence against women, and called for the abolishment of Korea’s now-defunct, male-centric family registration system, which did not allow women to register their children under their own family name. This meant the children’s names could not be changed even if their mother was remarried after being divorced or widowed, and therefore weren’t allowed to be added as dependents to their stepfather’s insurance plan and other social benefits. The old system was abolished in 2005, more than 50 years after Lee spoke out against it for the first time in 1953. Four years after Lee passed her bar exam, Korea’s first fashion designer, Nora Noh, held the country’s first fashion show in Seoul in 1956. Noh, whose initial first name was Myung-ja, changed her name to Nora at age 19, after ending a marriage of convenience that helped her avoid becoming a “comfort women” to Japanese soldiers. Her inspiration was the protagonist of Henrik Ibsen’s 1879 play “A Doll’s House,” named Nora, who leaves her children and husband to discover herself. Since her launch of Korea’s first ready-to-wear clothing line in 1963, countless high-profile women have worn Noh’s design known for its simple lines and elegance, including Yuk Young-soo, the former first lady and mother of current Korean president Park Geun-hye. One of Noh’s many achievements in her remarkable career that lasted more than three decades since the 1950s was the introduction of miniskirts in the 1960s which became a national sensation. When a female congresswoman asked her, “Shouldn’t women whose legs aren’t pretty avoid wearing miniskirts?” Noh famously replied: “Should women hide their faces with a veil if their faces aren’t pretty?”Yet Noh, lawyer Lee and nurses Lee and Kim were exceptions in their times, and still are today. According to an annual Gender Gap report released last year by the World Economic Forum, Korea ranked 117th out of 142 countries, scoring worst of all in terms of women’s participation in the nation’s political sector. The number of women in the National Assembly, which stood at 47, accounted for just 15.7 percent of all lawmakers 2012.Lee from the National Women’s History Exhibition Hall said leadership education for women could help combating Korea’s still-existing gender inequality, which is most prevalent in the nation’s labor market and in politics above all else. “I think leadership hasn’t been emphasized as a core value in schools, especially among young school girls in Korea,” she said. “But it’s one of the most important skills once you are out of school and participate in the workforce. More young women should be trained as future leaders. And once more women are in managerial and administrative positions, more changes are likely to be made.” By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","women history when chinese ,manchuria she had studied ,china based korean independence ,pioneers in women history ,korean independence activists","['Chinese', 'Korea', 'japanese', 'China', 'korean', 'Manchuria', 'chinese', 'korean']",3,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.499089    0.37163916

The country’s series of transformations throughout its history are mirrored in changes witnessed in the education system. In the midst of the country’s rapid development, Koreans sought education as the way to dig their way out of poverty.South Korea is now famous for having one of the fiercest education fevers in the world. About 67.1 percent of those aged 25-34 have received tertiary education as of this year, the highest rate in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.A competitive social atmosphere and overzealous parents with the conviction that a good college diploma is a prerequisite to a good life has led to the mushrooming private tutoring culture here that threatens the integrity of public education.But in 1948, three years removed from the country’s liberation from Japan’s 1910-1945 colonial rule, the fledgling South Korean government’s priority in education was to get rid of Japanese influence. Under Japan’s rule, students were prohibited from learning Korean language and history, and instead were taught about values and knowledge promoted by the Japanese government, according to “A Study on 100 Years of Korea’s Modern Education” by the Korean Educational Development Institute.Korea’s own modern education system was finalized on March 20, 1951, consisting of six years of elementary school, three years each of middle school and high school, and four years of higher education.In the early stages, the focus was to provide as many educational opportunities as possible. In 1945, there were some 1.67 million students in South Korea, which marked over a 60 percent increase from the year before.A compulsory education plan, which at the time targeted children aged 6-12, was suggested in 1946 and implemented by 1954. The rapid increase in students resulted in packed classrooms, forcing schools to conduct their classes in double shifts. The issue of overpopulated classrooms lingered on, and only in 1995 did the average number of elementary school students per class drop below 40 to 36.4. The higher education sector also grew. The number of colleges more than doubled from 19 in 1956 to 42 three years later, and rose to 86 by 1961.  Students participate in an abacus class in this 1950s file photo (Photo courtesy of Gyeongsangbuk-do Education Research Institute)Then-President Park Chung-hee, who rose to power after a 1961 military coup, retained firm control over the education system during his 16-year rule, particularly over higher education. Pedagogy that was not in keeping with the administration’s views was quickly banned and their practitioners were reprimanded by the officials, according to Chun Sung-eun, a veteran educator and former principal at Geochang High School and Geochang, South Gyeongsang Province.Nationalism and patriotism were emphasized, and in 1968, the Education Ministry mandated anticommunist lessons to be conducted for all students for an hour each week. Such emphasis was intended to ensure the stability of the Park’s rule, the KEDI report said. The policies conducted during the 1960s and 1970s had also fixated on the system based on control, supervision and the top-down ordering of the authorities, the report added.But these were also the times when the government set out to abolish the school pecking order. From 1969 to 1971, the government abolished the middle school entrance exam, and banned high schools from conducting their own entrance exams in 1994. The 1980s and 1990s paved the way for a movement that is still ongoing today ― provincial autonomy of education.While Park’s assassination in the 1979 was only followed by iron-fisted leader Chun Doo-hwan, the democratization movement that raged on throughout the decade had eventually forced Chun to reinstate direct presidential elections.Teachers, for their part, also set out to claim their rights. In 1986, the Secondary School Teachers’ Conference of the YMCAs of Korea demanded that teachers should be free from political pressure while education bodies should be given autonomy from the government. In 1991, legislators passed a law that allowed education autonomy for local education offices. There are currently 17 education offices in major cities and provinces in Korea that act as the highest education authority in their respective regions, although they are still under the authority of the Education Ministry.Former President Kim Young-sam initiated the “5.31 Education Reform” in 1995, which stressed education to be more “consumer-based,” and emphasized competition and autonomy.“The basic idea behind the reform was to induce competition among each schools to produce a quality education service, based on the autonomy,” Ahn Byung-young, who was an education minister for two years during the Kim administration, wrote in his 2015 book. But he added that the reform had inherent limitations as the push toward autonomy was ironically carried out in an authoritarian, top-down method. The policies were fragmented and not coherent enough to fulfill the general purpose of the reform, and the government failed to provide sufficient incentives for teachers and public officials in the ministry, who were to be the main drivers of the reform.Among the notable education policies by the following Kim Dae-jung administration was its attempt to overhaul the college admissions process by banning three of its major elements in 1999: ranking high schools, admissions based on financial donations, and schools conducting their own admissions tests for major subjects. It was introduced in pursuit of equality for students, but was criticized for hampering higher education institutes’ autonomy.In 2008, the “admissions officer program” was introduced, which encouraged universities to evaluate students on not just exam scores but various other qualities including extracurricular activities.But with each administration coming up with new plans to revamp the higher education system, new policies only piled more academic pressure onto the students. In addition to the tests and interviews, students were now forced to prepare for other activities as well.Chun Sung-eun, who headed the presidential committee under former President Roh Moo-hyun that devised the admissions officer program, said this was because the policy was hurriedly pursued. The committee had suggested at least eight years to prepare and implement the system, but the idea was realized almost right away by Roh’s successor Lee Myung-bak.Throughout history, authorities’ attempts to bring equality and diversity in education have often ended up having the opposite effect.Foreign language high schools began to pop up in the 1980s as the government pushed to foster students excelling in foreign languages.In 1992, the government designated them and science high schools the status of “special-purpose high schools,” subsequently granting them the right to hold their own admissions processes. By handpicking their own students, these schools gradually rose to the top of the academic pecking order.Autonomous private high schools, introduced in 2010 in pursuit of educational diversity, used the relative freedom to increase the percentage of subjects directly related to college admissions in their curriculum.Since taking the helm last year, Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea under the Park Geun-hye administration has emphasized integration as the next frontier for Korean education. “Integration (between fields) is the reality for many of today’s jobs, but the schools teach only individual subjects. The goal right now is to establish a curriculum that will connect all technologies to humanities,” he said in a recent interview with local media.As part of the integrated course, all high school freshmen will have to study science and social studies with a new integrated textbook.But civic groups like World Without Worries About Private Education said the combined textbook is more difficult than the previous ones, fueling concern that the new policy will put more academic pressure on students. While experts agree that further change is needed, they say the government needs to sufficiently prepare policies before implementing them.“The Education Ministry’s plans for improving the high school education are more than sufficient in blind passion, but lack long-term vision,” said Hong Hoo-jo, an education professor at Korea University. He pointed out that the reason the government’s school reform policies failed was because it lacked clear direction, and that reforms in the future would need to pursue diversity in education without discrimination.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","underpins korea rapid growth ,education underpins korea rapid ,rapid growth south korea ,country rapid development koreans ,korea rapid growth south","['South Korea ’s', 'Koreans']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57351971  0.39628953

Upbraiding Pyongyang for rejecting Seoul’s repeated overtures for dialogue on its denuclearization and carrying out provocative acts including the recent land mine blasts in the Demilitarized Zone, the minister warned that the communist regime would “pay the price” for the provocations.Touching on the South Korea-U.S. summit slated for October, Yun said that Presidents Park and Barack Obama would present their shared recognition of North Korean issues including the evolving nuclear problem. Addressing the persistent military threats from the North, which have further escalated ahead of the South Korea-U.S. joint military drills, the summit will also reaffirm the “firm and unwavering U.S. commitment” to the defense of South Korea, and affirm the shared vision of peninsular reunification, Yun said.Commenting on the maritime disputes in the South China Sea that have been escalating with China constructing artificial islands equipped with military facilities such as an airstrip, Yun reiterated Seoul’s position that differences should be resolved peacefully in accordance with internationally established norms of conduct.“The South China Sea is one of the world’s major sea lines of communication. Therefore, maintaining the peace and stability of the South China Sea, including the freedom of navigation and overflights, is clearly in the interest of all the countries in the region,” he said.The following are the excerpts of the interview with Minister Yun.Korea Herald: The thorniest issue between Seoul and Tokyo for now are the Korean victims who were forced into sexual servitude by Japan during World War II. President Park Geun-hye has mentioned the bilateral negotiations over the issue are at the “final stage.”Minister Yun: This year alone, eight Korean victims have passed away. Given their old age, the resolution of the matter is urgent. Recognizing the urgency, we have made various efforts to address it. We have so far held eight rounds of intense director general-level talks with Japan since April last year, and our assessment is that there has been some meaningful progress.I cannot elaborate in detail about the content of the ongoing consultations at this point. But from a broad perspective, we can say that clearly, there has been considerable progress compared to the initial phase of the talks.Prime Minister Abe said in his speech to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II that Japan wishes to be a country embracing the women whose dignity and honor were hurt during the war. In this respect, we hope that Japan shows sincerity in resolving the matter of comfort women as well.KH: Amid reports about the prospect of a China-Japan summit, analysts point to the need for a Korea-Japan summit. When do you think the summit can be held and under what conditions?Yun: Basically, we are open to holding the Korea-Japan summit. Although there remain a number of tough issues, continued bilateral efforts to resolve them wisely and with patience would contribute to improving the relations, thereby creating an environment where the summit talks can actually take place.Also, as the chair of the trilateral cooperation mechanism of South Korea, Japan and China, Seoul has been continuing diplomatic efforts to hold the trilateral summit at the earliest possible date in the latter half of this year. When the three leaders meet, there would naturally be a bilateral contact. It may be too early to talk about when the trilateral summit will be held, but we hope the meeting to take place within this year at a not too late time.KH: You have stressed the need for Seoul and Tokyo to work together to create a virtuous cycle for the bilateral relations. What do you think each side should do to entrench such cycle?Yun: We have been making diverse efforts with determination to make this year -- the 50th anniversary of the normalization of bilateral ties -- a pivotal moment for improvement in relations. I believe that such an atmosphere is being created to a certain extent.The leaders of both countries each attended events on June 22 to mark the 50th anniversary and expressed their intentions to improve the relations. A total of seven foreign ministerial talks took place including my first visit to Japan in June since I assumed post. The two sides have also settled the issue of Japan’s bid to secure world heritage status for its Meiji-era industrialization facilities through dialogue.While there are some aspects of the statement delivered by Prime Minister Abe on Friday that fell short of our expectations, we take note of the fact that he clarified how the preceding administrations’ historical recognition of remorse and apology for the colonial rule and aggression will remain unshakable. We plan on watching with keen interest how Japan will execute such position into concrete actions.Although there are still quite a number of outstanding issues, I believe that should the Japanese government step forward with more enthusiasm to resolve them, the bilateral relations can evolve into a virtuous cycle.Seoul has been principled in addressing the issue of how history is viewed, even as we intend to actively push ahead with bilateral cooperation that serves our mutual interests, such as in the security, economic, social and cultural realms. KH: The maritime disputes in the South China Sea have been escalating with China constructing artificial islands equipped with military facilities there. Calls have been growing for Seoul to play a role with regard to the South China Sea disputes. Yun: The South China Sea is one of the world’s major sea lines of communication. Therefore, maintaining the peace and stability of the South China Sea, including the freedom of navigation and overflights, is clearly in the interest of all the countries in the region. In this context, my government has been closely following developments in the South China Sea with concern. My government is of the view that differences should be resolved peacefully in accordance with internationally established norms of conduct and this position was reiterated at the recent ARF and EAS Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in Malaysia. In this regard, we believe that the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of the Parties in the South China Sea, adopted by China and ASEAN for the maintenance of peace and stability in the South China Sea, should be implemented effectively and in its entirety, and hope that the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea will be concluded at the earliest possible time. My government takes positive note of the recent dialogues and consultations between ASEAN and China to this end, and looks forward to substantive progress being made toward the early conclusion of the COC. KH: You have mentioned that there would be a “signification agreement” during the South Korea-U.S. summit slated for October with regard to North Korea. Can you elaborate?Yun: As this year marks the 70th anniversary of Korea’s liberation from Japan’s colonial rule and 70 years of division, we have made multifaceted efforts to achieve substantive progress on North Korea’s denuclearization. But Pyongyang has not only rejected our overtures for dialogue, but also held fast to its “Byungjin” policy line while continuously advancing its nuclear capabilities. The North has rejected all talks related to its nuclear program with all five parties of the six-party talks.(With North Korea’s continued threats and provocation) I anticipate that the leaders of South Korea and the U.S. will share their evaluations of the overall security situations on the peninsula including North Korea’s nuclear issue and hold in-depth discussions on how to manage and tackle the current situation and use the occasion to declare their shared perspectives.I believe the leaders will share their overall view of the region’s situation in its entirety and offer their common understanding on how to resolve the problems of North Korea and its nuclear weapons development.KH: The issue of the U.S.’ potential deployment of THAAD to Korea is expected to be a tough diplomatic issue. What do you think will be a wise way to address it?Yun: I understand that internal discussions within the U.S. government are still ongoing and Washington has yet to make any request to Seoul for official consultations. Thus, I think it is inappropriate for me to make a comment based on a hypothetical situation.This issue should be approached from the perspective that the root cause of the problem is North Korea’s evolving nuclear and missile threats.

The disease chiefly affects middle-aged and elderly individuals, and is known to be associated with a deficiency of the neurotransmitter dopamine.Among the surveyed caregivers, 20 percent said they were forced to quit their jobs to care for the patients, while almost 70 percent of them said they were under financial distress because of the cost of medical treatment, which mainly provides relief from the symptoms.  Parkinson’s disease chiefly affects middle-aged and elderly individuals, and is known to be associated with a deficiency of the neurotransmitter dopamine. (Yonhap)Almost 60 percent of them said they found caring for the patient stressful, and 42.6 percent said they were emotionally exhausted. Also, 18.2 percent of them were clinically depressed. According to government data, the number of Korean Parkinson’s disease patients aged 60 or older increased from 14,636 to 26,344 from 2010-2014. The total cost to treat the patients rose dramatically from 91.6 billion won ($77.7 million) to 233.9 billion won in the same time period. “It can be despairing for both the patient and his or her caregiver, because you know that no matter what you do, you cannot cure the disease and it will only worsen as the condition progresses over time,” said Lee Hyun-joong, a caregiver for his wife, who has had Parkinson’s disease for 20 years. The numbers are expected to soar as the nation’s baby boomers ― those born 1955-1963 ― enter their 60s this year, and the current elderly demographic is predicted to double to more than 7.2 million in the next five years.Among the surveyed caregivers, 66 percent were spouses of the patients, while 10.7 percent were the patients’ children. Fourteen percent were other relatives of the patients, while 9.1 percent chose not to reveal their relationship with the patients.Symptoms during the early stages of the disease, such as tremors of the hands and stiffness, can be easily managed with prescribed medications. But patients may not be able to perform any physical movements in the final stage of illness and therefore must live with a caregiver or in a facility that can provide one-on-one care. On top of advanced motor symptoms, patients at this stage may experience hallucinations and greater speaking and memory issues, such as Parkinson’s disease dementia. In Korea, family member caregivers experience greater financial and emotional stress after 10 years, the study showed.Sixty percent of the caregivers who have provided care for more than a decade said they have fewer life options because of their family member’s illness. Also, 75.4 percent said they were struggling financially, while 64.3 percent of those who were caring for patients with mild symptoms said the same. More than 60 percent of them said they were worried about household debt. The study also showed that caregivers feel that there was not enough support available. Almost 40 percent of them said they could not access any information necessary for caring for Parkinson’s disease patients, while 52.1 percent said medical experts were “not helpful at all” with their questions and requests. “Patients with Parkinson’s disease are required to take medicine for the rest of their lives,” said Choi Jin-kyung, the head of the Korean Movement Disorders Society. “There should be more educational and therapy programs for caregivers and more research is needed on why the number of patients of the disease is rising in Korea.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","121 korean caregivers whose ,pain of parkinson patients ,patients families south korean ,parkinson patients families south ,parkinson disease patients","['south korean', 'the Korean Movement Disorders Society', 'korean']",3,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.58929056  0.43045703

Kim Yong-chol, who has been leading the North's reconnaissance bureau, is found to have been recently re-promoted to a four-star general after serving as a lieutenant general for about four months, according to the sources.  His promotion largely coincides with the explosion of three North Korean wooden-box landmines on Aug. 4, which were buried in the southern side of the heavily fortified demilitarized zone that bisects the two Koreas.  South Korea blamed North Korea for the blast, vowing to make it pay the price for its provocation. Two South Korean staff sergeants were severely injured in the incident.  The sources said that the South's military is closely checking Kim's movement in a bid to find possible clues to link his promotion to the recent landmine blast.  Kim, known as a hard-liner, is believed to have orchestrated Pyongyang's two deadly attacks on the South in 2010 -- the sinking of the Cheonan warship and the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island. The two attacks killed a total of 50 South Koreans, including two civilians.  Since 2009, Kim has led the North's Reconnaissance General Bureau tasked with intelligence operations in foreign countries and cyber warfare. He was first promoted to a general in 2012 but later underwent repeated changes in his title.

NHK, Japan’s national broadcasting organization, reported Monday that Abe plans to include such expressions as “apology” and “aggression” in the draft statement, upholding the position of previous governments on Japan’s conduct during the war.The report contradicted earlier coverage by Japanese national newspaper Asahi Shimbun that said the draft of Abe’s statement does not include the word “apology” to Asian countries, which was included in two past landmark statements, according to the draft that he showed the executives of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and junior coalition partner Komeito.Abe, currently discussing the draft, is set to release it for endorsement by the cabinet on Friday.Abe’s speech is to be closely watched by South Korea, China and other neighboring and involved countries to see whether the ultra-right premier will acknowledge his predecessors’ statements on Japan’s wartime aggression.Abe’s speech is expected to set the tone of bilateral ties with Korea as well, as the two countries have been cautiously moving to mend ties frayed by historical disputes.“We hope that Japan will show a mature attitude to start anew its relations with neighboring countries” including South Korea, Park said.Park also pressed Japan to address the issue of the elderly Korean women who were forced to serve as sex slaves for Japan’s World War II soldiers ― one of the knottiest issues.“We may lose an opportunity forever to resolve the issue unless we address it now,” Park said, noting that time is running out as the number of victims still alive is dwindling.In 2007, more than 120 South Korean victims were alive, but the number has dropped to 47, with their average age standing at nearly 90.By Song Sang-ho and news reports (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","former tokyo governments apologies ,monday urged japanese prime ,urges abe to apologize ,governments apologies for japan ,tokyo governments apologies","['Park Geun - hye', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'japanese', 'Abe', 'Tokyo', 'Japan']",3,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.09894684  0.50440001

The explosion nearly severed the right ankle of 23-year-old Kim and a larger part of both legs of 21-year-old Ha.In retaliation, the South Korean military restarted loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts in more than 11 years, on an irregular basis in two frontline regions as of 5 p.m. Related equipment was pulled out in 2004 in line with an inter-Korean agreement and then reinstalled at 11 spots after the North’s 2010 sinking of the South’s corvette Cheonan, but had since remained idle. “The enemy’s act this time was clearly a deliberate provocation that directly defies the truce and inter-Korean nonaggression pacts,” Defense Minister Han Min-koo told the troops during a visit to a guard post 750 meters away from the blast site. “I will have the enemy pay a severe price of its provocations. … In case of its provocation, you must not hesitate and resolutely and firmly respond with confidence, under the command of the GP chief.”  In this image dated June 16, 2004, South Korean troops remove a loudspeaker from the Odusan Unification Observatory in Paju, Gyeonggi Province, in line with an agreement between the two Koreas’ militaries. (Yonhap)Following a two-day joint probe through Aug. 7 with the United Nations Command, the JCS has concluded that steel springs, firing pins and other perceived debris of the detonated devices retrieved from the scene corroborate with the wooden-box mines used by the North Korean military.The JCS ruled out the possibility that the equipment had drifted south with the soil, such as by torrential rains, citing the lack of dirt around the mines, their buried position until the detonation and the “strong odor” of pine resin that exuded from the wreckage. “The incident has been found to be a clear provocation in which North Korean soldiers illegally breached the Military Demarcation Line and intentionally emplaced wooden-box mines,” said Koo Hong-mo, a two-star general in charge of operations at the JCS, issuing condemnation over what he called a “nasty act that any normal military cannot even think of.” The UNC issued a separate statement lambasting Pyongyang’s violation of the armistice agreement, calling for general-level talks with its military.“The investigation determined that the devices were recently emplaced, and ruled out the possibility that these were legacy land mines which had drifted from their original placements due to rain or shifting soil,” the UNC said. In a video clip of the second detonation filmed through a thermal observation device and unveiled by the JCS, a cloud of dust suddenly soared into the air, sending several soldiers flying. They were rushing to rescue Ha who was injured in the first explosion about five minutes before. Despite the series of accidents and their colleagues’ wounds, the servicemen managed to retreat and evacuate in a calm manner. The probe’s results mark a fresh setback in already strained cross-border ties days before the two Koreas celebrate the 70th anniversary of the peninsula’s liberation from Japanese colonial rule. The latest border intrusion appears to be aimed at interfering in the Ulchi Freedom Guardian, an annual South Korea-U.S. military exercise expected to kick off later this month for a two-week run, another JCS official said. “It apparently sought to interrupt the forthcoming UFG by obscuring the instigator of the provocation and creating discord inside the South,” the official told reporters on customary condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. Given Pyongyang’s longstanding disapproval of the loudspeaker program, tension is set to only escalate and concerns over another provocation ahead of the anniversary of the founding of its ruling Workers’ Party in October.The blast also triggered concerns over the seemingly porous defense posture around the highly tense area given that the mines were embedded just underneath a gate to the DMZ, which is watched by the South Korean Army, 440 meters south of the demarcation line. The North Koreans are likely to have come down between July 23 and Aug. 2, said Army Brig. Gen. Ahn Young-ho, who lead the investigation. The Kim Jong-un regime is believed to have tightened border controls to curb a constant defector outflow since he took power in December 2011. Its military has also been staging more drills for surprise attacks and ambush infiltrations into the DMZ areas, while nearly 1,300 wood or concrete markers have been set up every 200 to 300 meters along the border.Yet the Army has been closely tracking the North’s recent mine-planting activities and thus strengthened surveillance, Ahn said, though noting that weather and other factors posed hurdles for their efforts.“The area is easily eclipsed by the iron fence and surrounded by trees, making it difficult for us to monitor if the enemy enters north of the fence, which I believe the enemy took advantage of,” he said at a news conference.“And as the gate area is where we always come and go by, we might have somewhat neglected detection activities, assuming that there would not be any mines there.” More than 1 million M-14 and M-16 antipersonnel and antitank mines are expected to be scattered throughout the DMZ area. A 2008 U.N. report said land mines kill 15,000 to 20,000 people every year.Global efforts to stem the fatalities resulted in the 1999 Ottawa Convention, which prohibits the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of antipersonnel land mines. But the treaty has yet to be endorsed by the two Koreas, the U.S. and other countries including Russia, China and India. According to an August 2014 report by the Human Rights Watch, only 11 countries around the world still produce the weapons or sustain the right to do so, four of them are thought to be actively churning them out ― South Korea, India, Pakistan and Myanmar. The U.S. has not produced antipersonnel mines since the late 1990s and pledged last year to destroy its stockpiles not required for the defense of the southern part of the peninsula.

Additionally, Beijing has been increasingly assertive in territorial disputes with its neighbors.   Another embarrassing point is that the military parade will be staged at Tiananmen Square, where the Chinese Communist Party crushed pro-democracy demonstrations in a bloody crackdown in 1989.   South Korea and China are former battlefield foes as China fought alongside North Korea in the 1950-53 Korean War, while the United States and 20 other allied countries fought on South Korea's side under the U.N. flag.   But Seoul and Beijing have steadily improved ties since establishing diplomatic relations in 1992.

The countries who rated lower than Korea on the index included Slovenia (18 percent), Greece (19 percent) and Poland (25 percent). South Korean President Park Geun-hye (Yonhap)“Trust in government represents the confidence of citizens and businesses in the actions of governments to do what is right and perceived as fair,” the report said. “Changes in trust levels could be affected by many factors, including the economic outlook, political changes (e.g. elections), or other major events such as disasters or major scandals (e.g. corruption cases).”Although Korea’s latest confidence rate was low, it marked an increase by 10 percentage points since 2007. Meanwhile, the average confidence level in governments across OECD countries dropped by 3.3 percentage points in that period, from 45.2 percent to 41.8 percent from 2007-2014. The steepest declines took place in Slovenia (down 30 percentage points), Finland (29 points) and Spain (27 points).“Restoring trust in governments is essential to reinforce and consolidate the foundations of modern states,” the report said. “It is also a necessary condition for governments to successfully carry out public sector reforms.”The report also showed that only 29 percent of Koreans were confident in their judicial system as of 2013, much lower than the OECD average of 54 percent. Korea’s rate in fact dropped by two percentage points since 2007. According to the OECD, one’s confidence in his or her country’s judicial system is both “an outcome and a key governance dimension, most closely related to integrity.” Absence of a strong rule of law -- the idea that no one, including the government, is above the law and justice is accessible to all -- makes it difficult for states to cultivate peaceful and inclusive societies, the report said. Countries with low confidence in judicial systems are also more likely to generate either speculative investment or low-capital investments, which can threaten national growth and development, it noted.The report also showed that 53 percent of Koreans are satisfied with the country’s education and school system, which is below the OECD average of 67 percent.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","majority of koreans distrust ,koreans distrust government oecd ,koreans distrust their government ,majority of koreans ,of koreans distrust government","['South Koreans', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'OECD', 'Koreans']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.30124676  0.31666136

Colonial India’s last viceroy, Lord Louis Mountbatten of Britain, chose the second anniversary of Japan’s surrender in World War II in 1947 as the date to transfer power to the new Republic of India, ending 90 years of dominion. Unlike Japan, which forsook its 36-year occupation of Korea following a military defeat, Britain relinquished its colonial grip voluntarily as escalating anti-British uprisings threatened the viability of its imposed rule. Like Korea that was divided into the communist North and democratic South, India was partitioned into Muslim-dominated Pakistan and Hindu-dominated India in 1947, with nearly 1 million killed in the process.India’s Independence Day is celebrated relatively simply with a guard of honor for the prime minister, who delivers a speech on the ramparts of the Red Fort in Delhi ― a symbolic site of the Moghul Empire and the place where the Indian national flag was raised immediately after independence was gained. The speech is an address to the people and an agenda for the government for the year ahead.  Indian Ambassador Vikram Doraiswami Joel Lee / The Korea Herald“In last year’s address as a newly appointed prime minister, Narendra Modi set forth his vision of how he wants to transform the country,” Indian Ambassador Vikram Doraiswami told The Korea Herald on Wednesday at the embassy. “It included a number of special focus areas ― the ‘Clean India’ public health campaign, the ‘Make in India’ manufacturing campaign with foreign investment, the ‘Digital India’ campaign for the information technology sector, education and safety for the less privileged and women, job creation for youths, peaceful relations with neighbors, tourism and global economic partnerships ― all of which are highly relevant to the India-Korea relationship.”The newly appointed ambassador stressed that Modi has regarded Korea as a key partner for development “much more than Korea has given itself credit for.” When asked some seven years ago, when he was the chief minister of the Gujarat state in northwestern India, which country he viewed as a role model for India, Modi pointed to Korea, the ambassador noted. “Our prime minister has always believed that our partnership had not been tapped even to a partial degree given our potential,” Doraiswami said. “Modi is keen to engage Korea, which has begun to look beyond its immediate alliances with the U.S., China and Japan. If Korea looks further afield, logically, India would be one of the nearest strategic countries.”Doraiswami pointed to Modi’s “Act East” foreign policy, which aims for deeper integration with Asian countries to the east, inheriting the “Look East” policy initiative announced 20 years ago. To this end, Modi visited Korea in mid-May after China and Mongolia. “India and Korea have shared stakes in establishing a peaceful, stable and rule-based order in Asia and beyond, to allow safe and free flows of commerce in the maritime and aviation domains,” he argued. Regarding the legacy of the British Raj, Doraiswami said that although Indians’ view of the past was not always positive, they currently do not blame the British government or people through a prism of gloom, instead cherishing the partnership through the Commonwealth and international community based on the shared values of democracy, free market and rule-based world order. The Indian envoy emphasized that comparing the India-Britain relations and India-Pakistan relations to Korea-Japan relations and South Korea-North Korea relations should be done with caution and consideration of the different histories and circumstances. “Following Mahatma Gandhi’s message, we wanted the British to leave as friends,” he noted. “They left amicably, and we did not dwell on the past. We wanted to deal with Britain with a measure of our own confidence that we did not need history to tell us who we were.”The early development of the modern Commonwealth in the 1950s and ‘60s granted countries formerly under Britain’s tutelage equal footing and voices in an evenhanded power-sharing mechanism. This created a sense that the once-colonized and the colonizer had now become partners in liberating countries in Asia and Africa from their colonial shackles, according to the envoy. “We have excellent relations with Britain through diplomacy, commerce, culture and sports,” he underscored. “The U.K. government provided valuable guidance and assistance in setting up our democratic institutions and norms. India did not seek colonial reparations.”On the India-Pakistan relations, Doraiswami emphasized that “there is no desire to reverse history” of the partition, which took high human tolls on both sides. Unlike North and South Korea, which seek to reunite on their own terms, only marginal extremist groups in India and Pakistan endorse the reunification idea, he said. At the same time, the ambassador added, India is committed to a peaceful, stable and economically integrated regional order through the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation established in 1985, which includes India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives and Afghanistan. “Full utilization of the SAARC will increase trade between India and Pakistan substantially ― currently between $2.5 billion and $3 billion a year ― and form constituencies on both sides invested in peace and prosperity,” Doraiswami said. “Creating better trade avenues and access to each other’s markets and peoples is the best way of forging trust, which is the best way of resolving problems. This is similar to the Korean government’s efforts to enhance trust with North Korea.”By Joel Lee (joellee@heraldcorp.com)","second anniversary of japan ,korea following military defeat ,india last viceroy lord ,anniversary of japan surrender ,aug 15 colonial india","['India', 'Korea', 'Colonial India ’s', 'Louis Mountbatten', 'Britain', 'Japan', 'Republic of India', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Britain']",3,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.35085821  0.43003717

As twentysomethings have gained more spending power, some universities have rented space within their grounds for commercial establishments such as cafes and convenience stores. Such implementations have sparked debate over whether commercial facilities are there for the students, or to help the universities make more money. Yonsei UniversityThe biggest changes, however, may be those visible in the students. Once, university students were the driving force behind social change, and universities were the epicenter of democracy movements. It was not long ago that university campuses and surrounding areas were enshrouded in tear gas the police deployed to bring demonstrations under control. Chiefs of student bodies were often wanted by the authorities for actions against dictatorial governments; some spent months hiding at religious facilities. These days, students are more concerned about their so-called “specs” -- or specifications, like qualifications and certificates deemed desirable by potential employers -- than social issues. “Back in my day, we were almost required to take part in demonstrations. I think we cared about the country more than today’s kids,” said Park, who attended a university in Seoul in the mid-1980s and declined to be identified further. He added that although he was jailed for a number of months for organizing demonstrations, which led to certain disadvantages in life, he regrets nothing about his actions. “Today’s kids seem to care only about getting a job after graduation. We had the same worries, but still we did more than just look out for ourselves. Universities seem to have lost the romance, and turned into vocational schools.”Ewha Womans UniversityThose who studied even earlier seem to consider students of both today and of the ‘80s self-absorbed. “I considered student activists to be ‘talking on a full stomach,’” said retiree Lee Young-cho, who attended university in the early 1970s.The Korean expression “talking on a full stomach” implies a person’s opinion is formed without actual knowledge of hardship. “Ideals are good, but for people in our time, real-life concerns like graduating as soon as possible to help the family was the bigger concern. Today’s kids, though, seem to be thinking just about themselves.”While older generations may have varying degrees of disdain for university students now, “today’s kids” also have much to say.One recent graduate says there is no romance in university life, saying that she and all of her friends spent their vacations doing internships and getting certificates to prepare for the tough labor market. Still others say that the times dictate how students act. “For us, the future is uncertain, whereas older people knew that better things were in store for them,” a student of a Seoul-based university said, declining to be named. “So, although students focus (on academics and qualifications), if we are not fully engaged in each moment, there is little meaning to day-to-day life. That’s why (today’s students) try very hard to find small pleasures.” By Choi He-suk (cheesuk@heraldcorp.com)","country economy grew university ,economy grew university education ,economy grew university ,korean war universities ,university education became more",['Korea'],3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3726539   0.29550555

The Korean Society of Infectious Diseases encouraged foreigners to receive five vaccines -- Japanese encephalitis, hepatitis A, MMR, chicken pox and DTaP, which protects against tetanus, diphtheria and whooping cough. This is the first time Korean doctors have released a list of recommended vaccines for the growing number of expat residents here. As of this year, more than 32 million foreigners have either entered or left Korea while over 1.7 million are residing in the country.The move also came after the Middle East respiratory syndrome recently hit the country, infecting nearly 190 people and killing 35. Korea has had the second-largest number of MERS cases after Saudi Arabia, the originating country. On Thursday, the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a nationwide Japanese encephalitis warning as over 500 mosquitoes carrying the Japanese encephalitis virus were found in Busan. The health agency issued the advisory once the Japanese encephalitis virus-borne mosquito was spotted. The alert level will be raised if over 500 mosquitoes are detected in 30 regions across the country or a case of infection is officially reported. This year, the advisory was raised in April. Since 2005, 114 Japanese encephalitis cases have been confirmed, with 26 reported last year. While 95 percent of the cases do not show disease symptoms, some can have fever, headache, diarrhea or even fall into a coma, the authorities said.Free Japanese encephalitis vaccines are available at public health offices for children aged 1 to 12.The number of hepatitis A cases has sharply decreased in the country since the 1970s, but started to rebound in the 2000s. MMR -- measles, mumps and rubella -- expanded to Korea after it became prevalent in some Southeast Asian countries. Korea was designated as measles-free in 2014 by the World Health Organization.  Whooping cough has also been on the rise with about 230 people infected in 2012, jumping fourfold in three years.

But President Park Geun-hye did not accept the resignation.Talks among labor, management and government failed in April after the Federation of Korean Trade Unions, one of two major labor umbrella groups, walked out of the negotiations in protest of the businesses‘ demand to ease criteria for firing underperforming workers.The three parties have also locked horns over major issues including the “peak wage“ system. With the official retirement age set to rise by two years to 60 next year, the government has pushed for adopting the peak wage system under which companies will extend workers‘ retirement age in return for gradually slashing their wages after a certain age.But labor unions opposed the scheme, saying it would only give leeway to companies to reduce salaries without extending their retirement age. The return of the panel head came a day after President Park persuaded him to take the job again Thursday. Park delivered a rare public address, vowing that she would press ahead with labor reform to create new jobs for struggling youths.Setting the labor reform as the nation‘s top priority in the second half of this year, Park said the reform measures will help boost the nation’s faltering economy. ”The trilateral talks will continue in line with what has been discussed until April,“ Kim said, pledging to serve as a mediator to draw a conclusion that can satisfy all the relevant parties for a ”grand social compromise.“ Kim, however, is likely to face the daunting task of persuading the labor circle to return to the dialogue, with laborers refusing to discuss a few contentious agenda items at the negotiating table. The trade unions have voiced concerns over the government‘s plan to curb regulations to hire and fire workers, saying that such a plan cannot be on the bargaining table in the first place. The FTKU said earlier this month that it would boycott the talks unless the committee scraps the proposal. Rival parties also remained at odds over Park’s labor reform initiatives.The ruling Saenuri Party leader Kim Moo-sung hailed Park, asking the labor bloc to make a “great” decision to return to the dialogue to achieve “harmony” between the young and old generations. However, main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy chairman Moon Jae-in lashed out at Park for unfairly demanding labor to make sacrifices for reform agendas.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","seoul will meet representatives ,to resume stalled talks ,market reform will resume ,and management said friday ,in seoul will meet","['Kim Dae - hwan', 'Seoul']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.71864849  0.63469601

Kim Moo-sung, who said during his U.S. trip last week that his party would push for all schools to use government-published textbooks to address what they consider to be a “biased view” imposed by some private publishers’ progressive textbooks. “I think that left-wing flanks have a wrong sense of history and they are trying to instill their biased view in the young people who will lead our country,” Kim had said.Currently, eight private publishing companies print history textbooks for middle and high schools after getting approval from the government. The schools then can choose any of the eight publishers’ textbooks. Elementary schools have been using state-authorized history textbooks throughout.Hwang said the government could set up a body to publish Korean history textbooks, if necessary. And the body would select the writers of the history textbooks and a separate deliberation committee would review their contents to see if they are fit to print, according to the Education Ministry.At issue are certain omissions in some of the eight history textbooks on topics such as the 1950-53 Korean War, the ministry explained. Some of the history textbooks did not mention the killings of civilians by North Korean soldiers while stating similar killings by South Korean and U.S. troops, said Kim Yeon-seok, a ministry official handling the matter.The government plans to decide by September whether to set up the publication review body.The government was in charge of publishing history textbooks from 1973 to 2009. In 2010, it began allowing approved private publishing companies to print history textbooks.The rival parties, meanwhile, showed mixed reactions to the plan.“While in theory there are eight history textbooks available, in reality, from each student’s point of view, they are only learning from one textbook,” said Rep. Kang Eun-hee of the Saenuri Party.“When one specific textbook is chosen, it is still difficult to learn various views regardless of the textbook being biased or not,” she said, adding that in such a case, gathering diverse experts into creating one textbook with balanced contents may be more efficient.To concerns that state meddling could become more convenient, Kwon rebuked by saying that attention paid to one textbook instead of eight would disable full interference by a specific political party or ideology.Main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy Rep. Youn Kwan-suk, on the other hand, criticized the move as a highly political tactic using the “remnant of the ’70s and the Yushin era,” referring to the dictatorial government.“The remarks (by Hwang and Kim) are aimed to instigate a battle of ideologies, not to deliver the history as it is,” Yoon said.Claiming that state-authorized textbooks at high schools rarely exist in developed countries, Youn said that while any biased contents should be fixed, it is wrong to overhaul the entire textbook system just for that reason.From news reports","textbooks in korea political ,history textbooks in korea ,korean history textbooks history ,korean history textbooks ,of korean history textbooks","['Hwang Woo - yea', 'korean']",3,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.41106939  0.49778005

Some 50 years later in 2013, the average height has grown to 173.9 cm, and weight to 69.6 kg.Women were also shorter five decades ago at 156.9 cm, and lighter at 51 kg, compared to 2013’s 161.3 cm and 56.7 kg.These points and other data were gathered by the Seoul Institute, a research center for the Seoul Metropolitan Government, on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of Liberation Day this month.The main causes of death also drastically changed during over the 60 years, the report said.While the largest number of deaths were caused by pneumonia (12.6 percent) and infant diseases (12 percent) in 1947, cancer (31 percent), cerebrovascular diseases (8.7 percent) and heart problems (7.9 percent) caused the most deaths in 2013.Life expectancy, meanwhile, greatly increased, from 42.8 years for men and 47.1 years for women in 1942 to 78.5 years and 85 years, respectively, in 2013.The number of births in Seoul, on the other hand, declined, from 37.3 per 1,000 in 1947 to 8.4 in 2013.Infant mortality reduced from 83.4 of 1,000 babies dying before the age of 1 to 3 of 1,000 in the same time period.While nearly all, or 99.3 percent, of babies were born at home in 1947, most, or 98.8 percent, were born at hospitals 66 years later.From news reports","seoul citizens grow taller ,men living in seoul ,seven decades since liberation ,seoul stood at 163 ,163 centimeters weighing in","['Japan', 'South Korea ’s', 'Seoul']",3,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.80686581  0.55170792

""When Prime Minister Abe came here in April, we had expected him to make remarks on historical issues, but we generally feel that (what he said) was a little insufficient,"" a senior South Korean official said on condition of anonymity. ""In a statement around the 70th anniversary, we anticipate to hear what would represent a step forward.""Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mainly from Korea, which was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. But Japan has long attempted to water down the atrocity.Such efforts have intensified after the nationalist Abe came to power.Abe's upcoming statement will be watched closely as it is considered a second chance for him to resolve historical tensions with South Korea after failing to do so during his U.S. visit in April.The sexual slavery issue has been the biggest thorn in frayed relations between Japan and South Korea, with Seoul demanding Tokyo take steps to address the grievances of elderly Korean victims of the atrocity and Japan refusing to do so.

The victims have demanded $20 million in punitive damages each, for the wartime atrocities committed by Japan and its firms, and also for their continued denial of forcing South Korean women into sexual enslavement.“The Japanese government is practically insulting those victims by calling them voluntary prostitutes,” said Kim Hyung-jin, a lawyer for the victims, at a news conference held in Washington. “It is like calling the prisoners in Auschwitz as ‘voluntary workers,’” he said.The victims are among a dozen Korean victims who had announced in June that they would take Japan to court in the U.S. if Tokyo did not make a sincere apology by the end of that month.U.S. lawmaker Mike Honda (left), a longtime supporter of the victims of Japan’s wartime sexual enslavement, and Lee Yong-su, one of the Korean victims, hug at a ceremony to mark the eighth anniversary of the passage of a U.S. congressional resolution on former sex slaves, in the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington on Tuesday. (Yonhap)They planned to take legal action in the U.S. because their previous attempts to make Japan apologize failed in South Korea and Japan. Victims have won similar cases in Seoul, but South Korean courts have no execution power to force Japan to deliver an apology or provide compensation. Also, they can hardly win the case in Tokyo, the lawyer told a local newspaper. Though the U.S. court has no jurisdiction over crimes committed by Japan, the suit in itself has significance as they were illegal acts against humanity that goes beyond jurisdiction or statute of limitation, the lawyer had explained.The legal case was filed at a court in California on the same day U.S. lawmakers marked the eighth anniversary of a landmark 2007 House of Representatives resolution urging Japan to acknowledge and take responsibility for its atrocities committed during the World War II.On the 8th anniversary of the landmark resolution, Rep, Mike Honda urged Japan to learn from Germany by institutionalizing a legal tool that makes it a crime to deny wartime historical facts.“We know that German Chancellor Merkel has told Abe when he visited Germany, ‘You know, we faced our past and we made our apologies. In fact, I think we even have a law in Germany that if you say that the death camps did not exist, you will be fined for a violation of a law there,’” he said during an event held to mark the resolutions anniversary.During a weeklong visit to the U.S. in April, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe failed to apologize to victims of Japan’s wartime atrocities.The Japanese leader is expected to issue another statement next month to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.“Prime Minister Abe has the historic opportunity to take leadership and doing something and saying, ‘You are right. We were wrong. We apologize. We will pass a law that says our textbooks will teach our youngsters what happened in the past so it won’t happen in the future,’” said Honda.U.S. House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi also said Abe should make a clearer statement on the country’s sexual slavery of women during the war. In a meeting with South Korean lawmakers, Pelosi said she regrets that Abe has not made a clear statement on the issue, according to Rep. Na Kyung-won, chairwoman of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee.

(Yonhap)The decision was made as the joint fact-finding committee, established July 11, held its first plenary meeting at South Korea’s Defense Ministry building in central Seoul.Maj. Gen. Jang Kyung-soo, director general of the policy planning bureau at Seoul’s Defense Ministry, represented the South Korean side, while Maj. Gen. Robert F. Hedelund, U.S. Forces Korea assistant chief of staff for policy and plans, led the U.S. side.Consisting of the on-site technical assessment team and bio-defense cooperation procedure team, the committee will investigate how the anthrax sample made it to the biological research lab at the base and how the sample was dealt with after its entry into the base.During the planned on-site probe, officials from both sides plan to demonstrate exactly what happened with the sample, Seoul officials explained. “We believe the on-site investigation will help address our citizens’ concerns about the anthrax sample, as we will see all processes from the sample’s entry into the military installation to the handling of the sample and its disposal, and check whether all these took place in accordance with the international and domestic safety rules,” a Seoul official told reporters, declining to be named.After the joint probe, the committee is to report its investigation results to the Seoul-Washington Status of Forces Agreement Joint Committee, which will convene in December.The committee was established after the controversial revelation in late May that a U.S. lab in Utah mistakenly sent a live sample of anthrax bacteria to a lab in Korea, which had been using dead anthrax spores for its military research.The U.S. authorities confirmed that live anthrax samples had been mistakenly delivered to 86 military labs in 20 U.S. states, Washington and seven foreign nations -- South Korea, Australia, Canada, Britain, Japan, Italy and Germany.Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Frank Kendall has admitted that the shipment was a “serious and inexcusable mistake.”By Song Sang-ho(sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","seoul officials said wednesday ,gyeonggi province next thursday ,wednesday maj gen jang ,live anthrax sample to ,said wednesday maj gen","['South Korea', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Pyeongtaek', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Seoul', 'Jang Kyung - soo', 'Seoul ’s Defense Ministry', 'Robert F.

It is part of the government’s plan to tackle the youth unemployment issue, which has become so severe that the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy leader Rep. Moon Jae-in called it a “national crisis.” As of June, the unemployment rate for those aged 15-29 was 10.2 percent. It marked a 10 percent increase from the year before.The plan’s focal point is the Program for Industry Needs-Matched Education, or PRIME. The program will provide about 5 billion won-20 billion won ($4.3 million-$17.3 million) to each university or college conducting a restructuring process. Each university is encouraged to freely upsize or downsize their departments and even swap department size quotas with other institutions. “How the reform will be carried out is basically up to each school. The ministry will provide the data on the number and type of jobs expected to be needed in the future, while colleges and universities will decide how to revamp their academic structure,” said a ministry official. But education circles are concerned that the reform will ultimately result in colleges downsizing their humanities departments, whose graduates have struggled to gain relevant employment.“The ministry appears to be saying that it will increase support for departments and universities that have high employment rates,” said a professor from a Seoul-based university, suspecting that the ministry has given in to demands of the industry.The ministry itself appears to be mindful of the criticism that the new program is overly focused on the corporate sector. It even tweaked its original name from “higher education program to meet industry’s needs” to avoid such suspicion.While the name change may have saved face, the essence of the program has virtually stayed the same since it was introduced in June. Boosting the function of colleges and universities to better aid students’ job-seeking efforts was a key point emphasized by Han Seok-su, head of the ministry’s university policy office, and it remains so in the finalized plan.  Students at a Seoul-based university are studying in the university library in this March 2 file photo. (Kim Myung-sub/The Korea Herald)Over the past few years, such emphasis on employment has led to the demise of the humanities department. One of the major criteria used by the Education Ministry’s college evaluation since 2011 is the employment rate of their graduates. The universities who finish poorly in the evaluation are restricted from participating in state-funded projects. Government subsidies such as the state scholarship program can also be reduced.Such focus on the employment rate has pushed local universities and colleges to trim their humanities departments, which have traditionally done poorly in the employment category. According to data from private education firm Haneul Education, the employment rate of humanities majors was 42.1 percent in 2015, lower than departments related to medicine, engineering, social studies, business, education, natural sciences and even arts. The employment rate for medicine-related and engineering majors were the highest of the lot at 66.8 percent and 66.7 percent, respectively.From 2003 to 2013, the number of departments rose from 9,542 to 11,126, according to Education Ministry data provided by Rep. Kim Tae-nyeon of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy. During the same time, the number of departments related to humanities decreased by 1.7 percent. In his recently released book, “Colleges That Became Monsters,” Pak No-ja, a Russian-born professor at the University of Oslo in Norway, criticized the rush to discard humanities departments. He said getting rid of a department just because not enough students applied is unprecedented anywhere else in the world.The Education Ministry claims it can address the expected side effects by introducing measures to promote humanities, which it will implement in the latter half of this year to carry out in a two-track approach along with PRIME. Humanities classes will be provided as general education courses to all students, while humanities students will get basic technology and science-related education. The officials said it will introduce humanities-related jobs that are expected to be prominent in the future. But academics point out the plan lacks any incentive for universities and colleges to keep open their humanities departments. If anything, it practically invites colleges to slash them by enabling, and even encouraging the restructuring process with cash incentives, they said.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","korean government new education ,government new education policy ,education policy stirs controversy ,prep school for job ,south korean government new","['south korean', 'Education Ministry']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.21550664  0.2751472

""The main reason North Korea is taking part in the ARF meeting is for its economic interests as it seeks to secure more imports of natural resources from Southeast Asian nations.""North Korea has bristled at any mention of its human rights situation despite reports of gross abuses, including public executions, torture and holding hundreds of thousands of political prisoners in concentration camps.Last month, the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights opened a field office in Seoul to monitor and document human rights violations in the North, to which Pyongyang responded with threats of war. In protest, it boycotted the Summer Universiade held in South Korea earlier this month.North Korea claims the human rights allegations are part of a U.S.-led campaign to topple its regime.The two Koreas held foreign ministerial talks at ARF meetings in 2000, 2004, 2005 and 2007, after which there were only brief encounters between the ministers in 2008 and 2011.Aside from a possible meeting between the Koreas, the ARF gathering will also be watched closely for other bilateral meetings, such as between North Korea and China.Relations between Pyongyang and Beijing have soured over North Korea's nuclear weapons program, which Pyongyang has continued to develop despite opposition from its biggest ally and benefactor.South Korea and the U.S. have repeatedly called on China to play a bigger role in reining in North Korea's nuclear program.Those calls have grown since the U.S. and other world powers struck a deal with Iran earlier this month to curb its uranium enrichment program in exchange for extensive sanctions relief.Hwang Joon-kook, special representative for Korean Peninsula peace and security affairs, told reporters Tuesday after meeting with officials in China last week that now is an ""important time where North Korea stands at a crossroads between completing its development of nuclear weapons and coming to the negotiating table to discuss its denuclearization.""

North Korea has already said it is not interested in Iran-style nuclear talks.

""A recent drought that hit the North may be blamed for that, but more probing is needed.""A joint survey on the pine trees kicked off at the request of the North, which has been grappling with what it called the worst drought in 100 years.Sitting on the east coast near the heavily fortified inter-Korean border, Mount Kumgang is famous for its scenic views, including impressive peaks and thickly grown pine trees.Hyundai Asan kicked off a joint tour program at Mount Kumgang in 1998, a symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation, attracting some 2 million South Korean visitors until it was put on hold.Seoul suspended the tour program in 2008, after the shooting death of a South Korean female tourist by a North Korean solider at the resort.Pyongyang has called for the resumption of the tour program, which once served as one of the few legitimate revenue sources for the cash-strapped country.Jeong Joon-hee, the ministry spokesman, said that Seoul's approval for their visit to the North was made out of the belief that Mount Kumgang is an asset that the two Koreas need to protect together.""North Korea has not accepted the South's offer for cooperation in the area of forestation, but I think that the North could have a positive response to Seoul's proposal (when conditions are met),""Jeong said at a regular press briefing.But the government made it clear that the probe into the trees has nothing to do with a possible resumption of the joint tour program.""I believe this is an separate issue,"" said another ministry official.

258,258,U.S. lawmakers urge Abe to offer sincere apology for sexual slavery,"U.S. lawmakers urged Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday to offer a sincere apology for the country's wartime sexual enslavement of women as two surviving victims sued Tokyo for damages for insulting them as prostitutes.The victims, both in their 90s, filed the suit with a federal court in San Francisco, demanding $20 million in damages each.Named as defendants were the Japanese government, the late Japanes...","U.S. lawmakers urged Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday to offer a sincere apology for the country's wartime sexual enslavement of women as two surviving victims sued Tokyo for damages for insulting them as prostitutes.The victims, both in their 90s, filed the suit with a federal court in San Francisco, demanding $20 million in damages each.Named as defendants were the Japanese government, the late Japanese Emperor Hirohito, former Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi and seven Japanese companies, including Mitsui and Mitsubishi.""The Japanese government is practically insulting those victims by calling them voluntary prostitutes. It is like calling the prisoners in Auschwitz as 'voluntary workers,'"" said Kim Hyung-jin, a lawyer for the victims, during a news conference in Washington.In Congress, lawmakers stepped up calls for Japan to apologize for the atrocity as they marked the eighth anniversary of a landmark 2007 House of Representatives resolution urging Japan to fully acknowledge and take full responsibility for the issue.In particular, Rep. Mike Honda, who wrote the 2007 resolution, urged Japan to learn from Germany, which even enacted a law that makes it a crime to deny wartime historical facts.""Prime Minister Abe has the historic opportunity to take leadership and doing something and saying, 'You are right. We were wrong. We apologize. We will pass a law that will say we apologize, we accept historical responsibility. We will pass a law that says our textbooks will teach our youngsters what happened in the past so they won't happen in the future,'"" Honda said during an event marking the resolution's anniversary.""We know that German Chancellor (Angela) Merkel has told Abe when Abe visited Germany, 'You know, we faced our past and we made our apologies. In fact, I think we even have a law in Germany that if you say that, the death camps did not exist, you would be fined for a violation of a law there. That's how serious they were,"" he said.Those attendinng the event included Lee Yong-soo, one of the suriving victims.Honda, who has long been at the forefront of efforts to get Japan to admit and apologize for the sexual slavery, wrote the landmark resolution (H.R.121) and helped it pass through the House unanimously. The resolution urged Japan to acknowledge its actions, apologize and accept historical responsibility in a clear and unequivocal manner. In April, Abe failed to apologize when he made a visit to the U.S. that included an address at a joint session of Congress. Abe's upcoming statement, expected to be issued next month to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, will be watched closely, though chances of an apology appear low.Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mainly from Korea, which was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. But Japan has long attempted to water down the atrocity.Such efforts have intensified after Abe came to power.Abe's cabinet, for example, angered South Korea last year with its attempt to ""review"" a 1993 statement of apology, known as Kono Statement. Though Japan later said it still stands by the apology, the move was seen as an attempt to undermine the apology's credibility. His government also came under strong criticism last year after pressuring an American publisher to revise a description of the sexual slavery issue in a school history textbook in an apparent attempt to water down the atrocity.""Prime Minister Abe has been hearing from scholars, saying, 'It did happen, prime minister. Don't change the history books of other countries,'"" Honda said. ""Prime Minister Abe has to learn that to be a good leader in a democratic country, you have to accept historical responsibility. You have to do the hard things.""The congressmen also stressed that time is running short for the surviving victims.""We only have 49 halmonies (grandmothers) that are at the House of Sharing in Korea and there are others in other countries that are waiting for an apology from the government of Japan. The government of Japan through Abe owes an apology to return to the200,000 comfort women their dignity, their spirit,"" he said.Reps. Bill Pascrell, Adam Schiff and Judy Chu made similar appeals.""We are so disappointed with the Japanese government report released last year on the Kono Statement, stepping back from taking full responsibility for the immeasurable pain and incurable wounds suffered by the comfort women,"" Pascrell said.""No one should ever be subjected to human rights abuses they faced. As a member of the congressional human rights caucus, I will continue to work every day to ensure our children and our children's children can inherit a world where these types of atrocities are a thing of the past,"" he said.Schiff said such a ""dark chapter"" of history won't be closed and healed until there is a full and forthright acknowledgment of responsibility by Japan, while Chu said Japan's sexual enslavement is the ""largest case of human trafficking in the 20th century and there needs to be an apology.""

""We cannot help expressing grave concerns that some lawmakers from Japan's ruling party are trying to whitewash its history following Japan's review of its previous apology over the sex slaves,"" the ministry said.Last year, Japan irked Seoul and Beijing, victims of Japan's wartime aggression, by reviewing its 1993 apology over the sex slavery issue, known as the Kono Statement. Japan claimed the statement was the outcome of a political compromise between Seoul and Tokyo.South Korea demands that Japan show sincerity by settling the sex slave issue ""in a way that is agreeable to the living victims,"" including through a sincere apology and compensation.""The coercive nature of Japan's sex slavery is undeniable.

Then, the scammers would transfer the victim to another group member pretending to be the original lender and steal the money sent to pay off the original loan. Victims would sometimes borrow money from people around them to pay off the original loans.  The scammers even disguised themselves as a wine sellers and an electronics store.Some 2.14 billion won ($1.84 million) in total from 423 victims was siphoned off by the swindlers between October 2012 and June 2015.The rare cooperation between South Korean and Chinese police came after a senior South Korean police officer visited China in May to seek a joint probe on telephone-based financial scams.South Korean and Chinese police arrested five suspects by raiding their call center in China's eastern city of Qingdao on June 19, according to the South Korean police.The arrest came about three months after obtaining details on the call center and its members from six others, who were detained for allegedly withdrawing money or providing bank accounts for the scammers.Police said they later arrested 30 other scammers when they came to South Korea.""Local authorities' support is crucial to arrest the leaders of the phone-based scam groups as they often stay abroad,"" said a spokesman for the SMPA, adding they are expecting further collaboration. A total of 35,859 voice phishing cases occurred in 2014, compared with 22,351 recorded in 2012, according to the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

In 2007, more than 120 South Korean victims were alive, but the number has since dropped to 48, with their average age standing at nearly 90.Historians estimate more than 200,000 women, mostly Korean, were forced to work at front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during the war.South Korea demands Japan acknowledge state responsibility for the sex slaves, while Japan insists the issue was settled under the normalization treaty of 1965. The sex slaves have been one of the knottiest issues between South Korea and Japan.

(Yonhap)Only three other countries -- the U.S., Chile and Mexico -- had lower government spending on health care expenses than Korea. With its growing elderly population, Korea’s increase rate for health care costs has been rising significantly in recent years. The costs increased by 4.9 percent in 2012 from the year before, which was more than three times higher than the OECD average increase rate at 1.6 percent. Jeong Mi-ya, who participated in the research, said more health conditions should be covered by the national health insurance program to reduce the economic burden of illness or injury in Korean households.The World Health Organization states that the provision of adequate financial protection -- “from the costs of seeking and using medical care” -- is a significant marker of the effectiveness of a health care system.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","care subsidies among lowest ,korea spends the least ,among lowest in oecd ,subsidies among lowest ,subsidies among lowest in","['South Korea', 'OECD', 'the National Assembly Research Service', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperati']",3,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.7748363  -0.04030956

It has already resumed its flights bound for Narita, Kagoshima, Aomori and Okayama, with flights bound for Komatsu to be back in service on Aug. 2.   Some of its China-bound flights, including the Incheon-Nanning and Jeju-Guiyang routes, are expected to be normalized from mid-August, company officials said.  Asiana Airlines, the No. 2 flag carrier, also followed suit by planning to resume all of its affected flights from early August except a few bound for China. The Incheon-Haneda route will be back in service starting Aug. 7.  Eastar Jet Co., a local budget carrier, has joined the two major airlines by resuming its flights bound for Shanghai, Dalian and Harbin on Tuesday.  In a bid to brace for a spike in passengers during the summer vacation season, the budget carrier also said that it has launched the Incheon-Phuket route, while planning to expand its flights for Osaka, Bangkok and Kota Kinabalu until end-August.

South Korea has kept a small police detachment on the islets since 1954.  ""The territorial issue over our sovereign territory of the Northern Territories and Takeshima still remains unresolved,"" the paper said, using the Japanese names for the Kuril Islands and Dokdo.  It is the 11th straight year the annual paper has included such claims together with maps marking Dokdo as Japanese territory.  Shortly after the report's release, South Korea's defense ministry called in Army Col. Nobuhisa Goto, a defense attache at the Japanese Embassy in Seoul, to lodge a protest with the Japanese government.  ""The Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of Korea strongly remonstrates about the 2015 defense white paper which projected our own territory of Dokdo as Japan's territory and marked it as part of Japan's domain on the related map while also drawing an unagreed-upon line for the Exclusive Economic Zone there,"" the ministry said in a statement.  It ""resolutely urges prompt action to correct them and measures not to repeat such unjust behavior,"" it added.  The Foreign Ministry also issued a statement denouncing the latest report as a ""provocation"" in the year the two countries mark the 50th anniversary of the normalization of bilateral ties.  The renewed claim amounts to ""an act denying the history of invasion of the Korean Peninsula of Japan's past imperialism"" and Tokyo's own admission that it has an incorrect perception of history, the statement said.  ""Our government will respond firmly to any provocation by Japan with regard to Dokdo, which is clearly our sovereign territory historically, geographically and under international law,"" it said.  The ministry delivered its own protest to Kenji Kanasugi, a minister at the Japanese Embassy, after calling him in to meet with Lee Sang-deok, director-general of the Northeast Asian affairs bureau.  During the meeting, Lee demanded the Japanese government delete the references to Dokdo from the white paper and prevent similar actions in the future, according to a ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity.  ""(He) pointed out that continuing such actions is of no help to South Korea-Japan relations at an important time when we are working to improve bilateral ties and called for Japan's prudent response,"" the official said.  Tensions between the two countries have eased somewhat in recent weeks, spurring speculation of a trilateral summit with China in the coming months.  Last month, Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se visited Tokyo to mark the 50-year anniversary and hold talks with his Japanese counterpart, Fumio Kishida. It was the first visit to Japan by Seoul's top diplomat in more than four years.  Earlier this month, Japan listed a package of early industrial sites as UNESCO world heritage after accepting South Korea's demand that it acknowledge its use of Korean slave labor at some of them.

""The country has one of the lowest birthrates in the world, and is the fastest-aging society among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development member states.""   Such changes can have an enormous impact on the economy by reducing the country's workforce down the road, he said.  ""The government plans to unveil the new plan around the end of this year to tackle the problems of the low birthrate and aging population,"" Joo said.  The country announced two sets of measures in the past, including giving cash support to families that have many children, helping to provide more comprehensive child care services and expanding welfare for senior citizens.  South Korea's total fertility rate, or the average number of children that would be born to a woman over her lifetime, stood at 1.21 last year, down from 1.47 in 2000.   The country is already an ""aging society"" with 7 percent of the population over 65 and will become an ""aged society"" with 14 percent of all people over 65 in 2018.

People drink water from the tap, swim in city harbors and ride bicycles everywhere. The world’s happiest nation is also one of the greenest, not accidentally, and aims to create a “fully green economy” by 2050. In a lecture on July 11, Danish Ambassador Thomas Lehmann said Denmark and Korea should invigorate their partnership for a shared sustainable future by turning the threat of climate change into resourceful opportunities. “Our experience shows that through persistent and active policies prioritizing renewable energy, it is possible to sustain high economic growth,” Lehmann told students of the Hugh O’Brian Youth Leadership Foundation Korea at Kyung Hee University. “It is critical for the young generation to lead the future of green growth by setting the direction of development.”  Students of the Hugh O’Brian Youth Leadership Foundation Korea listen to a lecture by Danish Ambassador Thomas Lehmann at Kyung Hee University on July 11. Joel Lee/The Korea HeraldGreen growth does not have to come at a cost to business, asserted Lehmann, adding that jobs could be created by promoting green technologies and protecting the environment. Since signing the “Energy 2020” agreement in 2012, which aims for a 100 percent green economy, 4,700 jobs were created in Denmark by the end of 2013. By 2020, the archipelago nation would produce half its electricity from renewable sources through additional 6,000 to 8,000 “green jobs.”“The transition required a broad consensus and political will,” the ambassador stressed. “Public opinion has been very important, with our nongovernmental organizations engaging in debates, setting agendas and shaping policies.”The role of cities has been equally essential. As more than 70 percent of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions come from cities, Copenhagen has committed to be the world’s first CO2-neutral capital by 2025.The Kingdom of Denmark -- which consists of Denmark, The Faroe Islands and Greenland -- has a long tradition of investing in and developing resource-efficient solutions for energy, environment and climate. As a market leader in green technologies, Danish companies have exported their innovations worldwide, spearheading the global sustainable effort. Denmark aims for over $15 billion in exports of green technologies by 2020. The country’s transformation followed the 1973 global oil crisis, which doubled the price of oil and raised alarm bells about national energy security. The first national energy plan was formulated in 1976 with a focus on reducing energy consumption and oil dependence, and after the second oil crisis in 1979, an energy ministry was inaugurated. Denmark set a plan to “decouple” energy consumption and economic growth in 1981. Since then, the country’s economy has grown by 80 percent, while energy consumption has remained the same and carbon dioxide emissions have decreased. The Nordic nation now has one of the lowest levels of per capita energy consumption in the developed world, with the highest efficiency. Wind power produces 20 percent of total energy, and is expected to generate half of its electricity by 2020. “Where Denmark has been a ‘first mover’ in the green transition, Korea has proven to be a ‘fast mover,’” Lehmann noted, referring to the Korean-Danish Green Growth Alliance established in 2011 for increased cooperation in government, research and trade. “Our alliance shows that we can share our experiences and draw upon each other’s strengths.” On the “green transition index,” Denmark outperforms Korea in energy, environment, diplomacy, commercialization, investment, innovation, agriculture, tourism, biodiversity and climate adaptation; and Korea tops Denmark in fisheries, forestry, transport and construction. The fifth meeting of the KDGGA will be held this fall in Denmark, and the Global Green Growth Forum will host a summit in Copenhagen next year. Denmark has taken a nonnuclear path since the 1980s following a parliamentary decision. Sweden’s nuclear plant across the sea from Copenhagen triggered public debates about the safety and security of nuclear power.“Looking directly at a nuclear plant across the sea raised doubts about having the technology at home,” the ambassador explained, adding that civilian resistance had been forceful. “Nuclear energy will always pose challenges in safety and cost, as its wastes must be contained for over 100,000 years.”Lehmann claimed that the nuclear debate was related to the price of electricity, which he argued was a “political matter” as much as an “economic matter.”“The price of electricity was determined socially and politically in Denmark,” he emphasized. “This is where public debate can happen. Despite opposition, we set in motion priorities and incentives for change.”Raising the price of electricity would incentivize companies and people to save energy, the ambassador argued, while pointing out that electricity in Korea was cheaper than in many other countries. “The question is how cheap should it be? This is a political question for Korea,” he said. “In Denmark, there was much skepticism in the beginning, but people stuck to their visions and policies, because they believed it was the right thing to do.”The Scandinavian country is currently a global leader in the “circular economy,” which runs on recycled biological nutrients. The Kalundborg Symbiosis in Denmark trades residual industrial products -- steam, dust, gas, heat and slurry -- through public-private partnerships. Danish company Grundfos is a world-leading pump manufacturer in heating, air-conditioning and sewage. It provides circulator pumps to 90 percent of Korea’s skyscrapers. Wind power generator Vesta supplies over 48,000 turbines in more than 70 countries, covering 70 percent of plants in Korea. In the ocean industry, the Maersk Group, the world’s largest containership and supply vessel operator, has strong cooperation with Korean companies. Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering ordered 20 Maersk Triple-E Vessels in 2011, which emit half the carbon dioxide of competitors.

The number of people diagnosed with MERS in the country remained unchanged at 186, and the MERS death toll also stayed flat at 36.Kwon Deok-cheol, head of the central MERS task force, told reporters in Sejong that while the government accepts recommendations made by the World Health Organization, it is in the process of outlining its own assessment of the situation to the U.N. agency.""We plan to adhere to WHO's position, but at the same time, policymakers are contemplating a move to independently lower the MERS alert status from the current 'caution' to the lowest level of 'attention,'"" the official said. ""Such a move will be the same as announcing the end to the respiratory disease.""He did not give dates but hinted that the downgrading of the alert status may be carried out on or around Aug. 2. The date will mark the 28th day after the last confirmed MERS cases was diagnosed in the country on July 4.The government's criteria for taking this step is slightly different from those set by the United Nations health organization that is expected to announce the end of MERS four weeks after the last infected person has tested negative for the illness-inducing coronavirus.Under this system, South Korea can only be declared a MERS-free country after the middle of next month.The Ministry of Health and Welfare said earlier in the day there are 258 people in isolation as suspected cases following possible exposure to the MERS virus, down 64 people from the day before.  Out of the nearly 16,700 people who have been subject to isolation since May 20 when the first MERS case was confirmed, 16,432 have been released after showing no symptoms for more than the known maximum incubation period of 14 days for the disease.Out of those diagnosed with MERS, 133 have been discharged from hospitals following complete recoveries.Of the remaining 17 receiving treatment in hospitals, four are in unstable condition, while 12 have already tested negative for the MERS virus, a sign they have overcome the disease, according to health authorities. They added that the government will pay for the medical bills of people suffering from the side effects of MERS.MERS is a viral respiratory disease that is still fairly new to humans. The disease has claimed over 530 lives globally, posting a fatality rate of over 36 percent.In South Korea, the fatality rate stands at 19.4 percent, with most of the people succumbing to the illness having had underlying medical conditions.

Project,” at Seoul Museum of Art in central Seoul next Tuesday. The exhibition, which runs until Sept. 29, features a wide variety of artwork including oil paintings, posters and stamps, which were made by North Koreans and collected by one South Korean and two Dutch collectors.The organizers also plan to use the piano for a musical performance with the National Chorus of Korea on Aug. 15, Korea’s Liberation Day. They are in talks with the chorus to determine how the piano will be used for the commemorative performance.GongMyoung, a renowned Korean performing arts group and producer of creative musical instruments, has undertaken what was initially seen as an impossible process -- building a piano made of rusty, pointy wires that were collected in cooperation with a frontline army unit.The group has built two pianos with the border wires . All of the wires used in the piano for display are from the border fence while some changes were made to one of the pianos to allow it a greater range and sound accuracy.“Though it was a challenging undertaking for us to create a piano with the barbed wire, it was a rewarding and very meaningful process given that we could create a musical harmony for unification through the barbed wire of the truce line, a symbol of the tragic war and longstanding cross-border standoff,” said Park Seung-won, the leader of GongMyoung.Established in 1997, GongMyoung has undertaken a series of challenging tasks to make unique instruments such as an electric “janggu” (an hourglass-shaped Korean drum). The projects were born out of their hopes to “internationalize” Korean music.However, the creation of a piano using barbed wire was a physical challenge, Park noted.“The tension of the border wire is very strong, not to mention the rough, sharp points of the barbed wire. Everybody who was involved in the making of the piano has suffered cuts on their fingers,” he said.“The toughest part was to get the piano to produce the exact sounds we needed. We initially aimed to give the piano a range of a little over one octave. But we have given it up to two octaves and produced a very unique sound,” he added.The project to make the piano was first proposed by Cheil Worldwide Inc. as part of the firm’s efforts to advance its cause of corporate social responsibility. The firm is to release its promotional materials about the piano later this week.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","korea herald the piano ,of unification piano made ,piano of unification piano ,unification piano made with ,unification piano made","['the Unification Ministry', 'Cheil Worldwide Inc.', 'Samsung Group', 'inter - korean', 'the Korea Herald', 'the Piano of Unification', 'Korea', 'Japan']",3,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.66651118  0.27573952

Monday appealed a South Korean court's ruling against the Japanese firm to compensate one family and four former South Korean employees for forcing them into labor decades ago when Korea was under Japan's colonial rule, court officials said. In November 2013, the Gwangju District Court ordered the firm to pay a combined 680 million won (US$613,000) to four women and a fifth plaintiff whose two deceased family members were forced into labor during the 1910-45 colonial rule.In June, the Gwangju High Court upheld the lower court ruling and ordered the Japanese company to pay three women 120 million won each, another victim 100 million won, and the fifth plaintiff 102 million won.Legal representatives of Japanese firm submitted the request for an appeal with the Gwangju High Court, the officials said, adding that the case will go into the Supreme Court. The issue of forced labor is becoming increasingly urgent as most surviving victims are well over 80 years old and may die before they receive compensation or an apology from the Japanese firms.The Japanese government as well as the companies that used forced laborers, however, have refused to pay any compensation, saying all issues regarding its colonial rule, including sex slavery and monetary reparations, were covered by a 1965 package.

The remark was also surprising as Park has rarely used her right to give clemency ahead of the national holidays like Liberation’s Day, Chuseok and Lunar Holiday. Despite repeated calls from politics and business, the president said she would administer the law strictly and treat all criminal offenders equally. Cheong Wa Dae also has expressed concerns over public criticism as the president granting pardons on high-profile businessmen is still widely viewed as government favoritism to conglomerates. In May, Park also lashed out at the special pardons granted by her two predecessors to deceased businessman Sung Woan-jong, saying such decisions undermined the rule of law. She even said the system of granting special paroles should be fixed to break the chain of corruption.However, Park’s planned use of presidential pardons next month suggests that she may seek a change in her leadership as well as her image of an “obstinate and uncommunicative” president. Park enters a halfway point in her five-year term in August, in which many fear that she would start losing momentum in her drive on state affairs as public attention shifts to the general election in April next year, and also to the presidential election in 2017.By issuing special pardons, Park is seen trying to become more sympathetic toward the public at a critical time when the nation suffers from sluggish economy.Park has granted special paroles once so far, and only for minor crimes committed by those living in poverty on Lunar New Year’s Day last year. She has not granted presidential pardons for any politicians or businessmen in prison since taking office in early 2013.If exercised, Park will be issuing special pardon for the second time. Under the law, South Korean presidents are not required to seek parliamentary endorsement for their exercise of special pardons.The ruling Saenuri Party and the business community welcomed Park’s plan.The Federation of Korean Industries said the president’s decision was “very encouraging” for businesses struggling with unfavorable economic conditions.Some business insiders have been calling for the release of key members of families that run conglomerates, saying keeping them in jail could delay the companies’ key operations. Politicians have also argued that the government should release businessmen to revive business investments and prop up the nation’s slowing economy.SK Group chairman Chey Tae-won has been in jail for more than two years on charges of embezzlement. CJ chairman Lee Jae-hyun was also sentenced to three years in jail on charges of tax evasion and accounting fraud last year, but was granted a stay of execution due to health problems.

The mine is known to have been operated by the Japanese industrial giant Mitsubishi.Kim said he found the document at an undisclosed Japanese museum Saturday.The three-page document calls for the construction of a 210-centimeter-high and 255-meter-long barbed wire fence on the wall surrounding the dormitory of Korean workers at the coal mine to prevent them from climbing over it.""This can be seen as clear proof that Koreans suffered from forced labor while practically being in a state of detention,"" said the expert who leads a research institute on Korean-Japanese culture.The document also stated that the barbed wire construction was scheduled to begin on March 1, 1944, for completion on March 31, the same year.The find came as Japan seeks to water down its statement about what happened at the Meiji-era industrial sites, which were inscribed on UNESCO's World Heritage list last Sunday.After Tokyo accepted Seoul's demand to acknowledge that Koreans were forced to work at seven of the sites during World War II, Japanese Ambassador to UNESCO Kuni Sato admitted in an English statement during the annual session of the World Heritage Committee that there was ""a large number of Koreans and others who were brought against their will and forced to work under harsh conditions in the 1940s at some of the sites."" The South Korean government put the number of workers at around 57,000.But Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga later said during a regular press conference that while Koreans were forced to work at several sites, they were not ""forced laborers."" Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida also told reporters in Japan that the acknowledgement of ""forced to work"" does not mean that the labor was forced.

It hopes to connect rail and road networks from South Korea's southern port city of Busan to west Europe.The upcoming Eurasia Express expedition is expected to help raise public awareness of South Korea's vision both at home and abroad, officials here said.Under the slogan, ""One Dream, One Eurasia,"" participants will gather at Seoul Station on Tuesday from various cities in South Korea by train.They include government officials, lawmakers, artists, academics and businessmen.Split into two groups, they will fly to Vladivostok and Beijing later in the day, respectively, with a cross-peninsula train tour blocked by the heavily-armed border between the two Koreas.With nearly 200 people on board, a train will run from Vladivostok to Berlin, Germany, passing through several other Russian cities and Warsaw, Poland.The other is scheduled to travel from Beijing to Irkutsk, Russia, then the passengers will transfer to the main train for the rest of the tour.The journey is to end in Berlin on Aug. 2, covering a total of 14,400 kilometers, or 8,948 miles, over six countries including Mongolia and Belarus. (Yonhap)""The Eurasia Express project is not a mere show. It is a program to reflect the strategic importance of a Eurasia railway,"" Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said in a written interview with Yonhap News Agency.His ministry is co-sponsoring the expedition together with Korea Railroad Corp.Yun plans to join the tour on the Warsaw-Berlin leg of the route.""South Korea hopes for the creation of an economic block for peaceful exchanges and co-prosperity through the Eurasia Initiative,"" he said. ""Taking advantage of its geographical location as the east gate of Eurasia, South Korea needs to play a catalyst role.""The minister said the train event will serve as an important chance to publicize Seoul's vision and effort for a new Eurasia era.Indeed, South Korea is seeking to join several related rail projects such as the Trans-Siberian Railway, Trans-China Railway and the Trans-Mongolian Railway.The biggest hurdle is military tension between South and North Korea. No train is allowed to run through the demilitarized zone bisecting the peninsula.Yun pointed out South Korea has been like an ""island"" for the past seven decades, a legacy of the Cold War.A railway between the two Koreas was briefly reconnected in 2007 for cargo services, riding on the mood of reconciliation at that time.It was severed again, however, in late 2008 after the launch of the conservative Lee Myung-bak government in the South and the North's provocations including a nuclear test and a long-range rocket launch.Experts agreed the Eurasia Initiative is a pipe dream without improvement in inter-Korean relations.""Pushing for such an initiative is good itself, but we have to see a bigger picture. In the end, South Korea should open the way to run through North Korea,"" Hong Hyun-ik, senior research fellow at the Sejong Institute said.Lim Eul-chul, a professor at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies at Kyungnam University, said the Eurasia Express expedition is meaningful itself as an opportunity to demonstrate South Koreans' aspiration for rapprochement with North Korea and re-connection of the railway with Europe.It coincides with the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II and the liberation of Korea from Japan's 35-year colonial rule.South Korea also marks the 25th anniversary of diplomatic relations with Russia and Mongolia.

""The Committee does not consider that government-to-government payments would suffice as appropriate relief to the victims.""Despite the ILO's clear view, the Japanese government is stepping up diplomatic efforts to publicize its claim through its diplomatic missions abroad, according to Japanese media.   Speaking to a local broadcaster, a foreign ministry official argued that the government wants to curb the spread of what Tokyo claims to be a ""misunderstanding"" over the issue.    During a parliamentary meeting, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe defended his foreign minister, Fumio Kishida, who claimed earlier this week that the phrase ""forced to work"" is different from the term ""forced labor.""   The expression ""forced to work"" was inserted to convey that some of the laborers were conscripted against their will, Abe said.   ""The South Korean government never said that Foreign Minister Kishida's words during the press conference were wrong,"" he said at the meeting.   South Korea has dismissed the controversy surrounding the wording, stressing that the English version of the Japanese statement is official.   Japan's campaign heralds a new round in the diplomatic row with South Korea on the global stage.

Koryolink, North Korea’s tourist-only data service launched in 2013, the same year that the use of mobile phones by foreigners, was finally permitted within its borders. Internet access is not cheap: A prepaid 3G SIM card costs $80 and data costs extra, with some reports putting it at $200 for 2 gigabytes. Access to Instagram was briefly blocked last month in what North Korea watchers think was an attempt to cover up the fire at the Koryo Hotel in Pyongyang. The platform is now accessible again.  Locals dance in Moranbong Park in Pyongyang (Simon Cockerell)Not many people are active on Instagram while exploring North Korea. The few that have banded together to form the project @EverydayDPRK, a collective account where a number of verified Instagram users collate their photographs, which has attracted 56,800 followers. The collective was founded by David Guttenfelder, a National Geographic Society Fellow who helped open the Associated Press bureau in Pyongyang in 2011, and contributors include the operators of Koryo Tours and Uri Tours, as well as expats living and working in North Korea. Simon Cockerell, the general manager of Koryo Tours, is due to visit North Korea for the 144th time this month. His Instagram account, @simonkoryo, depicts his many encounters throughout his travels across the country, with pictures of streetscapes, public spaces like parks and squares, and locals going about their jobs. In addition to current images, the company has recently launched @koryotours to publish their archive of photographs taken since tours began in 1993. Each of Cockerell’s photographs is eagerly dissected by his followers, intrigued by the latest chance at sighting the commonplace in the DPRK. Many of the posts are also met with surprise, with people blanching at the portrayal of North Koreans going about everyday activities. “I think people simply don’t expect to see a picture of anything looking at all like ‘normality’ from North Korea,“ he said. “If they see anything a little more mundane, such as someone eating an ice cream, some children playing, someone riding a bike … while what we see is far from all there is that exists in the country, it is still a side of life being lived, and when we see it we realize that the many millions of people in the country do other things than march in uniform.” A North Korean soldier poses with a camera. Koryo ToursShin Choi has also faced these reactions. A Canadian lecturer who spent six months teaching English at Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, Choi posted images of his experiences in the city on his account @shinchoi. “Some of the comments that I get are critical of my photographs … because of the hyper exposure of the same types of images we see in the mass media: poverty, or the regime, or the military. And when we don’t see that, we ask, why isn’t that there? Well it is powerful, it is there, but people still live day-to-day lives within that system, as anyone else would in the world.”Foreigners posting photos inside North Korea are by no means roaming freely. They are accompanied at all times by a guide, and only have access to certain areas of the country. While the photographs that people are able to capture are limited to what has been deemed appropriate for foreigners to see, the account holders maintain the value in sharing these rare images.Cockerell reflects that some access is far better than none. “We see one side of life and not the deepest, darkest parts of the country. But what we see is not a performance made for foreigners; we see real life and real people going about their real business. It’s a tiny glimpse, but it is a real glimpse.”By Louisa Studman, Intern reporter (louisastudman@heraldcorp.com)","instagram adds to trickle ,korea photo sharing app ,instagram has become valuable ,photo sharing app instagram ,app instagram has become","['Instagram', 'North Korea', 'North Korea ’s']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.92265397  0.26707911

The results show that the high cost of education and poor work-life balance of young parents were among the reasons behind the nation’s low fertility rate, the researcher said. The study, organized by Kim Mee-sook at the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, analyzed how parents in nine different countries viewed parenthood in 2012.  Koreans feel burdened by the cost of child care, a study showed.(Yonhap)The 18,063 participants were asked to rate their agreement on a scale of 1 to 5 -- 1 being the least and 5 being the most -- on a total of six statements on parenthood, on top of a number of basic questions. The countries surveyed were Sweden, South Korea, the U.S., Japan, Taiwan, China, France, the U.K. and Germany.Among the countries, Korea had the lowest fertility rate in 2011 after Taiwan, marking 1.24 births per woman. Ironically, Koreans wanted the largest number of kids among the nine countries, claiming it would be ideal for a household to have an average of 2.72 children.Koreans also marked 4.26 out of 5 on a statement that said “watching children grow up is life’s greatest joy,” which was lower than the average of the nine countries, which was 4.34. Also, it was Koreans who most strongly felt being a parent required sacrificing one’s personal freedom, rating 3.3 out of 5. The average of the nine nations was 2.84.Korean parents also rated higher than the average on statements that said “children are a financial burden to their parents” and “having children restricts the employment and career chances of one or both parents.”Kim said the results showed that Koreans chose not to have children not because they don’t want them, but because they feel there isn’t enough support for child care. “There should be more welfare programs for child care,” she said. “Programs that ensure parents’ leisure time also seem to be necessary.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","south koreans feel burdened ,poor work life balance ,koreans feel burdened by ,koreans feel burdened ,koreans burdened by child","['South Koreans', 'Kim Mee - sook', 'the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37768215  0.25714841

""Uncertainty surrounding the Greek debt talks has also increased.""The ministry said the slow pace of the global economic recovery and its effect on South Korean exports have hurt industrial output and business investment in May, dealing a blow to the automobile, semiconductor and machinery sectors. Exports fell 10.9 percent in May and were down 1.8 percent on-year in June.Investment in machinery, a key barometer of growth, contracted in May compared to the month before, although construction-related investment rebounded from minus territory.The ministry said that low international oil prices are contributing to low inflation numbers. The country's consumer prices grew less than 1 percent from January to June fueling deflation worries.On the plus side, the ministry said 379,000 jobs were created in May up from 216,000 the year before. Housing prices rose 0.4 percent on-month in June, along with modest gains in land prices.Despite a drop in exports, the country's trade surplus soared to US$36.5 billion in the first five months of this year, from $14.5 billion the year before.Retail sales for May stayed flat on-month after growing 1.4 percent in April, but gained 3.5 percent compared to the year prior. For the first quarter, private consumption rose 1.5 percent on-year and was up 0.6 percent from the fourth quarter of 2014.For June, department store sales nosedived 10.7 percent on-year, with discount chain sales dropping 9.7 percent. The losses reflect the impact of MERS on consumption, the ministry said.Sales of domestically produced passenger vehicles, on the other hand, jumped 9.4 percent on-year in June, with sales of gasoline and diesel fuel, another barometer of spending, falling 2.9 percent, according to the report.

Japan won the U.N. cultural body's approval on Sunday to have some of its early industrial sites be granted UNESCO's World Heritage status. The approval came after South Korea lifted its opposition against the bid by Japan, which acknowledged at the Sunday meeting that many Korean and other people ""were brought against their will and were forced to work"" at some of the sites in the early 20th century. Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters in Tokyo that the acknowledgement of ""forced to work"" does not mean that the labor was forced.Asked about the remarks by Kishida, China's foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular press briefing, ""As we all know, the forced recruitment and enslavement of laborers were heinous crimes committed by the Japanese military during its aggression and colonial rule."" ""Japan plays a word game on the serious history issue which only reveals itself of a lack of minimum credibility on the history issue,"" Hua said. ""We urge Japan to take a responsible attitude, look squarely at and properly handle the relevant history issue."" Japan occupied the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945 and parts of China during World War II. Tens of thousands of Korean people and Chinese prisoners of war were brought to the Japanese industrial sites at that time. China had voiced support for South Korea's opposition against the Japanese bid because Chinese people were also forced to work at the Japanese industrial sites from the mid-19th to early 20th century.

The specifics for the government plan will be finalized by September. The Korean government will also provide ways for students already in Korea for language courses to be able to transfer to degree programs. In addition, Korean schools outside of the country will now admit foreign students -- up to 30 percent of their quota -- so that the foreign students can become more interested in pursuing higher education in Korea, the ministry said.More state-run foreign student service centers will be set up to support foreign students’ stays, while “integrated dormitories,” where students of various colleges and universities in a certain region can stay and form a community, will be built.Via these measures, the ministry is planning to increase the percentage of foreigners among students in higher education to 5 percent by 2023, up from 2 percent in 2014.According to the ministry, the number of students around the globe studying abroad reached 4.5 million in 2012, jumping more than fivefold from 800,000 in 1975.But the figure of students coming to Korea has slowly declined since 2011, when it peaked at 89,537. There were 84,891 foreign students in Korea last year, dropping from 85,923 in 2013.“Countries across the world are engaged in efforts to host foreign students to expand their higher education industry and bring talent from outside their borders.

The examination is being conducted in all areas where North Korean laborers are working.The remarks came as the North Korean ruling party and government officials are reported to have sought to defect out of fears over possible executions or punishments due to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's so-called reign of terror.South Korea's state spy agency earlier said that since taking power in late 2011, Kim has had about 70 senior officials executed in an effort to establish himself.

Twenty-three Japanese wartime industrial facilities were listed as UNESCO World Heritage sites Sunday, following a compromise that Tokyo stipulates that it forced Koreans to work at some of them and plans to honor them in the final document. In a footnote enshrined on the text, Japan said it was “prepared to take measures that allow an understanding that there were a large number of Koreans and others who were brought against their will and forced to work under harsh conditions in the 1940s at some of the sites.” It also vowed to “incorporate appropriate measures into the interpretive strategy to remember the victims,” such as establishing an information center. Seoul officials touted the outcome as it marked the former occupier’s first-ever official acknowledgement of forced labor at the sites. Yet Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida instantly downplayed the language after the decision was made at a World Heritage Committee conference in Bonn, Germany, saying that it did not mean “forced labor.” A tentative Japanese version of the document distributed by the Shinzo Abe administration to local media simply stated that the victims “got to work” at the sites, apparently undermining the coercive nature of their recruitment.  South Korea`s Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se (left) poses with his Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida before their meeting in Tokyo on June 21. (AP-Yonhap)Some degree of strategic ambiguity or discrepancies in interpretation may be inevitable given the sensitivity of the matter and public sentiment at home, especially so because Tokyo has long insisted that the issue was already resolved through a 1965 agreement that normalized the bilateral ties.Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga also reaffirmed Kishida’s remarks on Monday, adding that they confirmed during the negotiations with Seoul that Japan’s statement will not be “used” in the context of the 50-year-old pact. “Our position has not changed at all,” he said at a news briefing.Seoul officials dismissed the minister’s claim, stressing such expressions carried in the decision as “against their will” and “forced to work” indisputably indicate the forcefulness. “The official text, written in English, is the original ― there’s no room for misinterpretation,” presidential foreign affairs and security secretary Ju Chul-ki told reporters. A senior Foreign Ministry official reiterated the stance, adding: “The most crucial point is how to comprehend Japan’s statement on the outcome in light of international norms and customs, rather than commenting on every news conference that takes place in Japan.” Despite the budding war of words, the two countries will likely refrain from further escalations as they are seeking to mend ties severely stifled by historical and territorial spats and arrange a long-delayed summit between President Park Geun-hye and Abe later this year. Officials here said they would closely watch how Tokyo follows through on its pledges, including the information disclosure, and thus demonstrate its sincerity. Under the plan, Tokyo is supposed to devise a follow-up mechanism and report development to the World Heritage Center by the end of 2017, which is expected to be reviewed by the World Heritage Committee at a meeting the following year. The measures should be in line with the committee’s request for an “interpretive strategy” that will enable an understanding of the “full history” of each site. It also recommended Japan seek advice from the UNESCO advisory panel International Council on Monuments and Sites. “The decision was made and will be carried out with certain formalities,” the ministry official added. “After all, it’s something that the Japanese government publicly declared in the international community, and its implementation will be monitored through the U.N. mechanism.”By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","three japanese wartime industrial ,twenty three japanese wartime ,world heritage sites sunday ,breakthrough on tokyo unesco ,three japanese wartime","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'UNESCO World Heritage', 'Japan', 'korean', 'japanese', 'UNESCO World Heritage', 'Tokyo', 'Koreans']",3,"[ 1.          2.          1.         ... -0.3877579   0.38010308

The decision made at a World Heritage Committee conference in Bonn, Germany, marked a breakthrough between South Korea and Japan following grueling two-month negotiations over how to address the appalling chapter of the archipelago country’s history that eclipsed its stellar postwar industrial transformation. After Tokyo initiated the campaign in January 2014, Seoul staged a strong protest, claiming that in seven of the proposed 23 sites, hundreds of thousands of Koreans were forced into slave labor under Japanese colonial rule.In a footnote enshrined on the final document, Japan said it was prepared to take measures to promote understanding that there were “a large number of Koreans and others who were brought against their will and forced to work under harsh conditions in the 1940s at some of the sites.”It also pledged to “incorporate appropriate measures into the interpretive strategy to remember the victims” such as setting up an information center. The statement was “taken note of” by the committee as it will promote the understanding of the “full history of each site.” Tokyo is mandated to formulate a follow-up mechanism and report progress to the World Heritage Center by the end of 2017, which is expected to be reviewed by the committee at its meeting the following year.  Hashima undersea coal mine off Nagasaki, known as “Battleship Island,” one of the 23 properties of “Japan’s Meiji Industrial Revolution” which were newly listed as World Heritage sites on Sunday. (Yonhap)Seoul welcomed the outcome, saying it “sufficiently reflects our rightful concerns.” “Japan’s statement has significance in that it virtually represents its first formal mentioning before the international community that Koreans provided labor against their will during Japanese colonial rule,” Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said after the decision.“I believe we have achieved two feats this time: We had managed to carry through our principle and position that historical facts ought to be reflected as they are, while avoiding an extreme confrontation with Japan and resolving the problem through dialogue, which could contribute to a stable development of the bilateral relationship.” In May, Japan secured the endorsement of the International Council on Monuments and Sites, a UNESCO advisory panel better known as ICOMOS, for the registration of 23 sites of Japan’s Meiji Industrial Revolution, built in the late 19th to early 20th centuries. They represent the “first successful transfer of industrialization from the West to a non-Western nation,” based on iron and steel, shipbuilding and coal mining particularly to meet defense needs, the panel wrote in its recommendation. Yet it also requested an “interpretive strategy” for the nominated properties to enable an understanding of the full history of each one. Among them are the Hashima undersea coal mine off Nagasaki, known as “Battleship Island.” The workers, mostly conscripted from Korea and China, had to work more than 12 hours a day, isolated from the outside world and facing frequent tunnel collapses, gas explosions, falling rocks and other harsh work conditions. Koreans were also mobilized to build warships, torpedoes and other military supplies in the Nagasaki shipyard run by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Many of them died, either in the U.S.’ atomic bombing in 1945 or while carrying out reconstruction work afterward. Tokyo, which refused to budge during initial negotiations, has apparently decided to opt for a compromise in the face of mounting pressure not only from Seoul but also council chair Berlin and other member states and souring international sentiment.“Japan’s statement is virtually unprecedented at an intergovernmental organization,” a senior Foreign Ministry official told reporters on customary condition of anonymity. “As a result of our omnidirectional diplomatic efforts, the international community including the council member countries now have a better understanding of the issue.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","sunday with tokyo conceding ,grueling two month negotiations ,conference in bonn germany ,listing japan major wartime ,slavery in unesco listing","['Japan', 'World Heritage', 'Tokyo', 'Koreans', 'World Heritage Committee', 'Bonn', 'Germany', 'South Korea', 'Japan']",3,"[ 1.          2.          0.         ... -0.56002915  0.6254701

The ambassador urged the participation of Asian countries in China’s ambitious New Silk Road project, which he argued would facilitate regional security cooperation and cultural collaboration. While mentioning the signing of the Korea-China Free Trade Agreement on June 1 and Korea’s membership in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, Qiu added that the two countries would push forward their economic cooperation beyond their bilateral markets to the Asia-Pacific region. Qiu also noted that annual two-way tourism had surpassed 10 million, with 6.3 million Chinese tourists visiting Korea last year, a nearly 40 percent on-year increase.

Instead of rice seedlings standing in flooded paddies, the baked earth is cracked. A big lake that used to supply surrounding farmland with water is almost completely dry. There has been almost no rain in this part of the country, an hour's drive from the capital Pyongyang and one of the country's main rice-growing regions, according to farmers and local officials interviewed by The Associated Press. While the situation in this area visited by the AP looks grim, it is unclear how severe the drought is in the rest of the country.   ""Because of the drought continuing from last year, lots of land has been damaged,'' said Sin Ung Hyon, chairman of the Unpha County Farm Management Committee. North Korea severely limits outside access, so state media's recent claim of the worse drought in a century has faced widespread skepticism. Pyongyang, eager for the possibility of outside assistance, has used similar phrasing to describe past droughts, and officials in rival South Korea have said there's no way to confirm exactly what's happening. North Korean authorities agreed to a request by the AP to revisit this area, which the government had highlighted previously as particularly hard-hit. An AP video journalist was accompanied by local officials.  Outsiders worry that that there could be trouble ahead for the country, which has a long history of poverty and mismanagement. Critics say the authoritarian government is more willing to spend huge sums of money on its missile and nuclear programs than on infrastructure and basic welfare. The United Nations has warned that the lack of rain this year could cause further hunger. Hong Yong-pyo, South Korea's minister of unification, told lawmakers this week that Seoul was willing to consider providing aid to North Korea to help with the drought, although Pyongyang has yet to make any official aid request.  Farmers interviewed in this part of North Korea said they are turning away from rice farming, and are planting corn and trying to tap underground water sources to keep what rice seedlings there are wet and healthy. But no rain would mean grim prospects even for the corn.  ""With the hardship this year, farmers have a lot of difficulties in trying to make the farm work, because we haven't had this kind of experience before,'' said Kim Gyong Nam, a work team leader at Unpha town farm. ""This year, because of the severe drought, we could not do rice farming, so we ploughed the land again and had to plant corn.''  Jane Howard, a spokeswoman for the World Food Program in Rome, said North Korea has faced water shortages since late last year because of low rain and snowfall. This could cause serious problems later this year because so much of the country's food production normally comes from crops planted from June to July. Seoul's Unification Ministry said that North Korea's rice and potato production could decline by as much as 20 percent compared to average years should the rain shortage continue. While North Korea's precipitation last year was its lowest since 2000, the country avoided a significant drop in food production because of its strong supply of irrigation water and the lack of floods in the summer, the ministry said.North Korea's food production is regularly affected by droughts or floods that expose the inefficiencies of its agricultural system, which is heavily reliant on foreign aid, artificial irrigation and terraced fields that are vulnerable to torrential rain.  A devastating North Korean famine during the mid-1990s is believed to have killed hundreds of thousands of people, though the exact number is disputed.

(The Commission on Verification and Support for the Victims of Forced Mobilization under Japanese Colonialism in Korea)At least 846 Koreans were forced by Japan to work in overseas locations including Sakhalin, the island off the far eastern end of Russia, during the 1910-45 colonial period, a government fact-finding panel said Friday.The Commission on Verification and Support for the Victims of Forced Mobilization under Japanese Colonialism in Korea under the Prime Minister’s Office said that it had put these Korean victims on its official “list of forcibly mobilized Koreans” for the first time.  Based on its analysis of some 135 historical documents from two state historical archives in Sakhalin, the commission discovered that at least 846 Koreans were forced to work for more than 10 Japanese companies in at least 18 locations including Sakhalin. Those victims were put on the wanted list of the then-Toyohara Police Station in southern Sakhalin from 1941-44 as they fled the sites of slave labor in the 18 locations including those in Japan, the committee said. “The victims that we discovered fled and were put on the wanted list afterwards. We secured a considerable amount of these wanted lists, and this would help prove the forced nature of Japan’s state entity (with regard to slave labor),” an official of the panel said, declining to be identified.  “This is the very case in which Korean victims actively opposed and resisted slave labor.”The committee’s list of these victims is expected to be used as crucial evidence in ongoing or future court procedures involving Korean victims and Japanese firms for which they worked.Last month, an appeals court in Gwangju, southwestern Korea, ruled in favor of five Korean victims of colonial-era forced labor, ordering Japan’s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to give a combined amount of 500 million won ($445,990) to the victims in compensation. The victims that the committee has confirmed were found to have worked in Sakhalin and 17 Japanese prefectures including Hokkaido, Yamanashi, Shizuoka, Hyogo, Aomori, Akita, Iwate, Fukushima, Kyoto and Kanagawa. The issue of forced labor recently returned to the public spotlight as Japan pushed to put 23 sites of its Meiji-era industrial revolution on the UNESCO World Heritage Sites List without explaining that slave labor took place at seven of the sites.This weekend, the World Heritage Committee will make its decision over the fate of the sites during its session in Bonn, Germany.Seoul and Tokyo have engaged in negotiations over the issue, with Seoul demanding that if the sites are designated as World Heritage sites, Tokyo should clearly present the historical facts about the slave labor.The two sides are nearing an agreement to reveal the dark side of the sites’ history should the sites gain World Heritage status, Seoul officials have said.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","846 koreans were forced ,japanese colonialism in korea ,at least 846 koreans ,least 846 koreans were ,846 koreans were","['the Commission on Verification', 'Koreans', 'Japan', 'Russia']",3,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.0969621   0.43980554

""The Japanese have agreed with us in principle but the devil is in the details.""  South Korea has demanded that Japan acknowledge its use of forced Korean labor at some of the early industrial sites shortlisted for the UNESCO World Heritage list. Korea was under Japanese colonial rule from 1910-45.  A final decision on the bid is expected to come Saturday during an ongoing meeting of the World Heritage Committee in Bonn, Germany.  ""We agreed to settle the issue in a fairly reasonable way and made various forms of progress, but slight difficulties were raised in the final negotiations, so coordination between the sides is under way,"" Ju Chul-ki, the senior presidential secretary for foreign affairs, said during a parliamentary meeting.  Among the possible solutions is attaching an annotation on the Korean slave labor to UNESCO documents, according to diplomatic sources.  Tokyo, meanwhile, has proposed the two sides fine-tune Seoul's position on the candidate sites' registration before South Korea expresses its view at the committee meeting, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported Thursday.  ""There was a broad agreement when the minister visited (Japan), so unless someone breaks that agreement, it will be resolved smoothly,"" said another government official, requesting anonymity.  The issue is expected to set the tone for the future of the two countries' ties, which have long been marred by disputes over their shared history.

Human Rights Council in January 2014, the North claimed that capital punishments are given in extremely limited cases. But death penalties have still been given for a wide range of crimes,” the whitepaper said.“Especially in several recent years, death penalties have been given for watching and distributing (South) Korean films and trading or smuggling drugs.” Some defectors, who were interviewed for the whitepaper, said that those who were caught receiving money from South Korea’s National Intelligence Service, carrying bibles or helping North Koreans defect to the South were also executed for “antistate activities and treason.”According to a survey of North Korean defectors that was conducted between 2008 and 2014, the total number of North Koreans reported by the defectors to have been publicly executed was 1,382, the whitepaper said. The annual report also pointed out that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s directives or instructions appear to be “supralegal” as at some public court hearings, death-row inmates are set free under Kim’s “generosity.”“In some cases, death sentences were canceled, according to witness accounts. It appears that Kim Jong-un intends to highlight his image as a leader caring for his people, and this shows that his directives go beyond the law,” the whitepaper said.The paper also underscored that no improvement has been made regarding North Korean’s rights to food and health, due to Pyongyang’s discriminatory way of distributing food that has limited ordinary citizens’ access to food. The continuing economic debilitation and military-first policy has also led to the uneven distribution of resources, the paper said.In recent years, the international community has been increasing pressure on the North to improve its woeful human rights record. Last year, the report by the U.N. Commission of Inquiry said that human rights abuses in the North amount to “crimes against humanity.”The KINU plans to publish an English version of the whitepaper in late August.By Song Sang-ho(sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","petty crimes north korea ,crimes north korea ,for petty crimes north ,crimes north korea has ,government report said wednesday","['North Korea', 'south korean', 'Whitepaper on Human Rights', 'North Korea', 'Korean Institute for National Unification']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65435308  0.4455601

It would also mark the first time for a sexual slavery victim, known euphemistically as ""comfort women,"" to hold a rally front of Japan's embassy in Washington.  ""Even if Abe didn't do it and the emperor did it, he should ask for forgiveness for what his ancestors did because it is him that is now holding power,"" Kim told reporters at a news conference, urging the Japanese leader to offer a legal apology and compensation and restore the honor of victims.  Kim also took a swipe at the U.S. president.  ""Let me talk about the U.S. president. If he's president of this big country, he should guide a friend onto the right path,"" she said, criticizing Obama for embracing Abe's nationalist agenda, such as the new bilateral defense guidelines calling for Japan's military to take on greater roles.  Kim, who was born in 1926, was forced into sexual slavery at age 14 and had to provide sex for Japanese troops in China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. It was when Korea was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945.  Kim said she was told she was going to a military uniform factory, but ended up at a Japanese military-run brothel. In an attempt to cover up the sexual slavery at the end of the war, Japanese authorities also had victims work as nurses, Kim said.  Kim said she even had to donate blood for Japanese troops.  ""Those who even stole my blood are now denying this,"" she said.   Kim said she thinks Korea has not been liberated from colonial rule yet as the sexual slavery issue has not been resolved.  Before Washington, Kim attended a United Church of Christ workshop in Cleveland and spoke about the hardships she went through.  While in Washington, Kim also plans to attend a George Washington University seminar on the issue and hold a meeting with State Department officials, including Cathy Russell, the U.S. ambassador-at-large for global women's issues.  Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mainly from Korea, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. But Japan has long attempted to water down the atrocity.  The sexual slavery issue has been the biggest thorn in frayed relations between Japan and South Korea, with Seoul demanding Tokyo take steps to address the grievances of elderly Korean victims of the atrocity and Japan refusing to do so.

(Yonhap)For example, if a certain university has higher competency in its engineering department than another university, the two can reach an agreement so that the former will be allocated with larger student quota for the said department. The latter, in exchange, would get an increased quota for another department. The exchange would only occur within universities that are near each other.The specifics for the plan, including the budget, will be announced sometime in July.Education authorities compared the scheme to the mergers and acquisitions process. “Each university can prioritize what they can do best and coordinate the number of students for each department accordingly,” said Lee Seung-bok, the director-general of the university support bureau at the ministry. This is part of the government’s Program for Industry Needs Matched Education (PRIME) project, which is to be implemented next year.About 70.9 percent of high school graduates go on to receive tertiary education, according to a 2014 report by Statistics Korea. But the number of college graduates who are unemployed has consistently climbed since 2012, surpassing 500,000 for the first time this year.According to the government, this is because higher education in Korea does not cater to what industry needs. “The country needs to accurately calibrate the needs of the society and provide plans on meeting such needs,” said Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea. “The main thing is how to reduce the gap between what industry needs and what the universities’ provide.”He said Korean education in the past has tried to “catch up” to developed countries, but now it needs to anticipate how the industry and the world will change in the decades to come.According to the Labor Ministry, there is a shortage of approximately 31,000 natural sciences majors. Han Seok-su, the head of the ministry’s university policy office, said natural sciences majors would be the focus of the student opening and department exchanges. He said the ministry was planning to provide subsidies ranging from 5 billion won ($4.5 million) to 20 billion won to each university participating in the PRIME project.The university reforms based on employment have often led to disadvantages for students not majoring in basic sciences, particularly humanities majors who have struggled in the labor market in the past few years. To prevent the number of humanities majors from plummeting, the ministry will encourage universities to provide additional scholarships for those who study humanities. The budget will come from 200 billion won in subsidies Hwang promised last month to provide financial support for humanities. “The essence of the university is academics, the fruits of which can be reaped as late as a few decades later. I believe the country should be in charge of making sure that this is not neglected,” the minister said.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","quotas south korean universities ,adjust their student quotas ,south korean universities will ,korea to let colleges ,korean universities will be","['south korean', 'the Education Ministry']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41180646  0.38389093

Lee Hee-ho, wife of the deceased president who took the reign from 1998 to 2003, has requested approval for her trip from the Unification Ministry, spokesperson Lim Byeong-cheol said. In line with Pyongyang’s proposal, five officials from each side have agreed to meet on June 30 in Gaeseong to discuss details of her visit, according to Kim Sung-jae, who served as the Nobel Peace Prize winner’s last culture minister and currently works at the Kim Dae-jung Peace Center. The former minister will head the South’s delegation, while its counterparts are likely to be led by Maeng Kyong-il, chief of the North’s Asia-Pacific Peace Committee.   Lee Hee-ho (Yonhap)“We received the request today from the center and are planning to decide on Lee’s journey after looking into its needs and whether it meets requirements,” Lim said at a news briefing. The 93-year-old former first lady had initially sought to cross the border late last year but later postponed it due to her deteriorating health condition. Kim Jong-un invited Lee to visit Pyongyang “in good seasons” this year in a letter to her in December, chiefly designed to express gratitude for the flowers sent by her to mark the third anniversary of the death of his father and longtime strongman Kim Jong-il. Last April, Lee’s side offered to meet with the North Korean officials to arrange a trip the following month but they asked to delay it. The exact time frame is to be hammered out but Lee’s side is setting sights on a date before Aug. 15, the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the peninsula, Kim Sung-jae said. “We’ve already held consultations on the land route, lodgings and a meeting with Kim Jong-un last time when North Korea invited her, so we will focus on the timing (in Gaeseong),” he was quoted as saying in a media interview. The project is a rare sign of cordiality between the divided states in the face of escalating tension due to the launch of a U.N. human rights office in Seoul, upcoming South Korea-U.S. military drills and other contentions. If the planned meeting with the young ruler does materialize, Lee will be the first South Korean to see him face to face.

""Just because Japan hasn't responded to South Korea's calls for negotiation doesn't mean South Korea bears all the responsibility to take the next course of action.""""The next course of action"" in this context means bringing the issue to an arbitrator, as stated in the 1965 normalization treaty between South Korea and Japan.The treaty calls for diplomatic efforts first in trying to resolve issues arising from the interpretation of the treaty. But if this fails, the dispute may undergo an arbitral proceeding, according to the treaty.The victims said Friday's ruling contradicted the Constitutional Court ruling in 2011.""South Korea is ignoring us helpless victims who were forcibly conscripted or drafted for labor by the Japanese and were hit by atomic bombs,"" Seong Nak-gu, head of the victims' coalition, said.Choi Bong-tae, an attorney representing the plaintiffs, said the victims had been denied compensation by both the Japanese and South Korean governments.""So where exactly should we seek compensation?"" he said.South Korea was Japan's colony from 1910-1945.Many of the Korean victims of the nuclear bombings in the Japanese prefectures of Hiroshima and Nagasaki had been forced to work for Japanese firms to produce war supplies.The bombings in 1945 essentially ended World War II and emancipated Korea from Japan's occupation.

High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein met with Kim Bok-dong, Gil Won-ok and Lee Yong-soo, who were forced by Japan into sex slavery in frontline brothels during World War II, during his visit a day earlier to a museum on women’s wartime human rights in Seoul. The meeting was part of his three-day trip chiefly aimed at overseeing the launch of a U.N. field office here to monitor and study North Korea’s human rights situation. Addressing their stories, he appeared deeply moved by what he called the “power of human contact” and how “gentle, strong and determined” the women were. “I find it terribly sad that, despite some significant steps taken by Japan over the years, the victims of this terrible crime do not feel their suffering has been adequately and universally recognized. In the final analysis, it is only the victims who can decide whether enough has been done,” Zeid said at a news conference. “I think there is something that can be done beyond what’s already been done. … I feel the personal contact with these victims of past abuse can take discussions a long way toward a resolution.” His remarks came as pressure is building between Seoul and Tokyo to formulate a lasting, acceptable agreement to sate the aging victims’ demands for a genuine official apology and compensation. Earlier in the day, the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan said that another former comfort women has died, bringing the figure of surviving South Korean victims to 49. Kim Youn-hee died of natural causes at a Seoul hospital on Wednesday, it said. She was 83.Kim, who was born in 1932, was forced to work in a factory in Japan at age 12 and then transferred to a military brothel. She came back home after Korea was freed from the 1910-45 colonial rule but lived the rest of her life at a mental institution. Her death followed two other victims dying last week, further slimming the list of surviving victims. Initially, 238 women were on the list of government-registered former sex slaves.Historians say more than 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were coerced into sexual slavery at frontline Japanese military brothels during the colonial era. South Korea has urged Japan to resolve the grievances of the victims, saying the issue is becoming increasingly urgent as most victims are well over 80 years old and may die before they receive compensation or an apology from Japan. Japan has snubbed Seoul’s demand for official talks on compensating the aging Korean women, claiming all issues regarding its colonial rule were settled in a 1965 package compensation deal under which the two countries normalized their relations.The two sides have held eight rounds of director-general-level talks since April 2014 over the issue of the victims, which Seoul believes is a wartime human rights issue that goes beyond the bilateral relationship.Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said in an interview with Yonhap on Thursday that South Korea is poised to speed up efforts for a new chapter in its often-troubled ties with Japan after a years-long “slow and steady” approach.Both sides, he pointed out, have a strong political determination to move toward the future, while dealing wisely with conflicts over their shared history.But the issue of Japan’s sexual enslavement of Korean women during World War II is more complicated, he said.Yun said it’s important to “heal the wounds of the victims’ minds” and the Japanese government is well aware of what it should do.He compared it to a prescription for a patient, saying that the components of medicine are crucial.South Korea and Japan are hoping to resolve the dispute over the “comfort women” within this symbolic year, he added.“Details are quite important in the matter and very serious efforts are required (to resolve it),” he said.He was, however, optimistic of a “win-win deal” on Tokyo’s push for the listing of early industrial sites, some associated with its wartime brutality, as UNESCO World Heritage sites. Tens of thousands of Koreans were forcibly conscripted to work at several candidate facilities in the 1940s. The World Heritage Committee plans to decide whether to approve Japan‘s bid early next month.South Korea wants Japan to include a clear explanation of the bitter historical background in relevant UNESCO records.“We expect an outcome that fully reflects South Korea’s fair concern,” Yun said, adding that he reached a consensus with his Japanese counterpart, Fumio Kishida, on the matter in their Tokyo talks earlier this week.Another key litmus test is what Abe will say about history in his August speech to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.“There seems to be a consensus that the format and contents of Prime Minister Abe’s address should meet the expectations of neighboring countries and the international community,” Yun said.He reaffirmed a push for the resumption of trilateral summit talks also involving China within this year.Yun was cautious, however, about a separate one-on-one meeting between Park and Abe, saying the appropriate conditions should be created first. “There is still a way to go,” he said.By Shin Hyon-hee and news reports (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","japan over sex slavery ,japan into sex slavery ,presses japan over sex ,japan over sex ,taking swipe at japan","['U.N.', 'Japan', 'Al Hussein', 'Kim Bok - dong', 'Gil Won - ok', 'Lee Yong - soo', 'Japan']",3,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.61768925  0.43714279

But some argue the armistice is already in tatters, as Pyongyang has violated it numerous times through provocations such as infiltrating into the South and launching limited attacks on South Korean forces. “Before talking about the peace regime, we should think about whether the armistice agreement has been well managed. It has been in tatters with the North setting off provocations frequently that sort of rubbed salt into the wounds of our people,” said Kim Yeoul-soo, security expert at Sungshin Women’s University.“However, South Korea should also make efforts and has a role to play. Within the comprehensive principle of engaging the North, the South should mix tactical approaches that are flexible enough to persuade the North to move in a direction of peninsular peace.”Above all, the most important task to entrench peace is to denuclearize North Korea. The task appears to be increasingly challenging as Pyongyang has defined itself as a nuclear power state in its constitution and adopted a “Byungjin” policy line of simultaneously developing nuclear arms and its economy.The multilateral denuclearization talks involving the two Koreas, the U.S., China, Japan and Russia have been dormant since late 2008. Amid the absence of dialogue, the North has been advancing its nuclear capabilities to the extent that it has already reached a technical level to “miniaturize and diversify nuclear bombs.”Park Myung-lim, a peace expert at Yonsei University, said that the current security status is comprised of two regimes -- the armistice regime and nuclear regime -- and that they should be replaced by a peace regime through the denuclearization of the North and the establishment of its diplomatic ties with the U.S. and Japan.“A peace regime can be established with the North giving up its nuclear program and with both Washington and Tokyo recognizing Pyongyang and normalizing their relations with it. This would lead to a de facto peace regime,” he said.On the part of Seoul, it should exert more diplomatic efforts to activate the six-party talks, he argued.“The U.S., China, Japan and Russia may seek to focus largely on nonproliferation when it comes to North Korea’s nuclear issue. But for South Korea, the focus is on complete denuclearization as it directly affects its own security,” he said.“Thus, Seoul should take small steps first, such as restoring the six-party dialogue channel and improving inter-Korean relations. And then, based on mutual trust, it should ease Pyongyang’s concerns about the reunification by absorption in the South and work up its leadership to bring the North out to the international community.”U.N. Commander Mark W. Clark, North Korea’s Supreme Commander Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai, the commander of the Chinese People’s Volunteers, inked the armistice on July 27, 1953 after two years of grueling negotiations over the military demarcation line, prisoners of war and other truce-related issues.The armistice was a “temporary” cessation of hostilities. The three parties recommended a higher-level political meeting be held three months later to resolve Korea-related issues including the withdrawal of foreign troops from the peninsula.The political gathering took place from April through June in 1954 in Geneva, Switzerland, with the participation of foreign ministers from 19 countries. But it failed to permanently end the war amid disputes over the UNC role, its activities and other issues.On various occasions, Pyongyang has called for a peace treaty to replace the armistice. But Seoul and Washington suspect Pyongyang intends to pressure the U.S. to withdraw its forces from the peninsula, remove its promise of nuclear protection for the South and stop the allied military drills targeting the North.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","koreas to strive harder ,korean war the two ,koreas face tough task ,war the two koreas ,both koreas to strive","['Koreas', 'Koreas', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53765994  0.84694809

In October, Seoul and Tokyo also plan to hold their joint naval search and rescue exercise, another official said.The biennial Search and Rescue Exercise has taken place since 1999, with the last session being held in December 2013, to boost cooperation in joint humanitarian missions.""The exercise is expected to take place alongside the International Fleet Review slated in October in Yokosuka, Japan,"" the official said.

The “comfort women” said they plan to file a lawsuit claiming $20 million to the San Francisco court against Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Emperor Akihito, Japanese media who called them “prostitutes” and Japanese companies accused of war crimes.“The Japanese government continues to reduce or distort facts about comfort women. We wish to file a lawsuit to find a solid solution to this issue,” said Kim Hyung-jin, the legal representative of the comfort women at a news conference held at the House of Sharing ― a shelter in Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province for the surviving former sex slaves. The media meeting was held a day after leaders of the two countries urged to move forward in marking the 50th anniversary of the normalization of bilateral ties. “The Japanese government keeps derogating the victimized women, who are still suffering from the pain inflicted 70 years ago, so we have no choice but to hold (the Japan) accountable.” Activists and victims of Japan’s sex slavery during World War II hold a rally calling for Tokyo’s apology for its past atrocities in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul on Tuesday. (Yonhap)But the former comfort women will drop their actions if Japan decides to apologize by July, Kim said. He urged Japan to hurry with the apology as few of them remain. The Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan and other surviving victims also held a rally in front of the Japanese Embassy in central Seoul, calling on the Abe administration to apologize for its past atrocities and make due compensation. They also urged the Korean government that there can be no mutual cooperation between the two countries unless the issues of the past are resolved.The Japanese imperial military is estimated to have forced as many as 200,000 women from all over Asia into sex slavery for its soldiers during the World War II. As of now, 238 Korean victims are registered by the government, 50 of whom are still alive.The Abe administration was recently criticized for portraying them as victims of “human trafficking,” which was deemed in Korea as an attempt to undercut Tokyo’s direct involvement. “What we are demanding is for the Japanese emperor to kneel before us and apologize, before the last of us are dead,” said former comfort woman Lee Ok-sun. She also urged the government to aid their effort in getting the decades-overdue apology.Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, who returned from Japan on Monday after a two-day visit, said any solution for the sex slave issue should meet the expectations of the victims and the international community. His visit was to mend the thorny relationship between the two countries that recently soured further amid historical and territorial disputes.“The important thing is to restore the honor of the 50 comfort women before they pass away and for the two countries to make this (resolving comfort women issue) an opportunity to develop their relationship,” he said.

Since taking office in 2013, Park has shunned a summit with Abe, calling on Japan to face up to its wartime history.But in what could be seen as a conciliatory mood, Park voiced hopes Monday that this year will be the first year of opening up a new future together while Abe said that he hopes the two neighboring countries will work hand in hand to chart a new era of relations.Japanese experts said that they appreciated the two leaders for making efforts to improve the strained ties but stressed that more efforts should be made to resolve the core issue of sex slavery.""It is regrettable that (Japan) fell short of expressing (more determination) to resolve the sex slave issue,"" said Haruki Wada, an emeritus professor of Tokyo University.""But South Korea and Japan have agreed to work together over the issue. ... It is good for the two countries to get to this point. Through consultations, I hope Japan can present an outcome that can satisfy Korean victims of the sex slavery,"" he added.Yuki Asaba, a professor at the University of Niigata Prefecture, welcomed the joint celebrations by Park and Abe, saying that their attendance reaffirms their strong political will to improve ties.""The move was a wealthy welcome. But it still remains to be seen whether this mood can pave the way for a summit between the two leaders,"" Asaba said.The professor said that Japan takes heavy responsibility for the sex slave issue, but Seoul should also make efforts to help Japanese people dispel doubts about whether the issue can be clearly resolved.Kimiya Tadashi, a professor at Tokyo University, said that the two sides should make strenuous efforts to resolve the sex slave matter as it is hard to yield satisfactory results if the two don't make concessions.Seoul has demanded that Tokyo show sincerity by resolving the sex slave issue in a way that is acceptable to the living victims.But Japan has long dismissed South Korea's demands, saying that all grievances related to its 1910-1945 colonial rule were settled through a 1965 treaty that normalized bilateral ties.

The official did not elaborate on the steps and asked not to be identified.In Tokyo, South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se also read the message from Park at a reception hosted by the South Korean Embassy, which was attended by more than 1,000 dignitaries, including Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.Abe, for his part, stressed the importance of partnerships between the regional powers.""Let us join hands and create a new era of bilateral ties by looking ahead to the next 50 years,"" Abe said at the reception, adding that he would like to make joint efforts with Park to create a new era.He also said bilateral cooperation is very important to peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region. South Korea and Japan are two key allies of the United States.Abe's special envoy, Fukushiro Nukaga, also read Abe's message at the reception in Seoul.Earlier in the day, Yun paid a courtesy call on Abe and delivered Park's verbal message.She said 2015 can be the starting year for new Seoul-Tokyo relations.Abe told Yun that it is important to be able to ""talk frankly with each other"" to resolve problems.In a meeting with Nukaga, Park expressed hope that Japan will uphold the position held by its previous governments on their history.Park said Seoul and Tokyo should heal the wounds of the past and create a new momentum for their relations, in an apparent reference to the sex slaves and other historical disputes stemming from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula.Park urged Abe to uphold the position on the recognition of history by the previous Japanese administrations in his speech set for Aug. 15 to ensure that the sides can move toward reconciliation and cooperation.That day marks the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II and the 70th anniversary of Korea's independence from Japan's colonial rule.Nukaga told Park that Abe has vowed to stand by Japan's two previous statements of apology -- the 1995 Murayama and the 1993 Kono statements that have served as the basis for Japan's relations with South Korea. In 1993, then Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono issued a landmark statement recognizing the military's involvement in establishing and operating ""comfort stations.""Two years later, Japan's then Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama acknowledged and apologized for the suffering his country inflicted on neighboring nations, including Korea, through its aggressions in the early part of the 20th century.Nukaga also said that Abe has said his heart aches when he thinks of the painful experiences of the former sex slaves.Abe's Cabinet angered South Korea last year with its attempt to ""review"" the Kono Statement, a move that was widely seen by South Korea as an attempt to undermine the apology's credibility.Later Monday, South Korean Foreign Minister Yun said that any resolution to end the wartime sex slavery issue should be based on the desires of the victims more than anything else.""If we come up with a firm solution to the issue, there's no reason it will come up again later,"" Yun told Japanese public broadcaster NHK in an interview. ""It's important to restore the dignity of some 50 surviving victims and by doing so the two countries may open another chapter in their relations.""

330,330,Japan’s 1st gay politician urges Korea to better protect LGBT rights,"As complicated as the relations between Korea and Japan are over historical disputes, the two neighboring countries also share extensive similarities, one of them being their conservative societies that largely frown upon the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.That is why Japan’s first openly gay politician, Taiga Ishikawa, 40, traveled to Korea in early June to provide support for the local LGBT movem...","As complicated as the relations between Korea and Japan are over historical disputes, the two neighboring countries also share extensive similarities, one of them being their conservative societies that largely frown upon the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.That is why Japan’s first openly gay politician, Taiga Ishikawa, 40, traveled to Korea in early June to provide support for the local LGBT movement and participate in its annual queer festival. The Korea Queer Culture Festival’s street parade ― slated for June 28 ― was nearly canceled by Seoul police, but is back on track after a court ruled the ban unjust. “I was shocked to hear that the parade was blocked by the state forces. It saddened me,” said Ishikawa in an interview with The Korea Herald earlier this month. “Then it hit me; there isn’t an openly LGBT lawmaker in Korea yet.” Taiga IshikawaIshikawa was elected a member of the Toshima Assembly, a special ward in Tokyo, in 2011 as the first openly gay candidate.He said having a sexual minority in politics is important because it allows the LGBT community to have a greater voice.While Japan now has three sexual minorities as elected politicians in the country, the conservative administration of Shinzo Abe still does not make the job easy for them, he said.“Policymaking in Japan as a whole is conducted as if sexual minorities do not exist. I wish to be an advocate of LGBTs, as I am one myself,” he said. “In that sense, I hope there was an LGBT politician in Korea as well.”Korea, dominated by traditional Confucian values and a powerful Christian community, seemed to come close in 2008, when lesbian politician Choi Hyun-sook ran for a parliamentary seat. Her attempt, while praised by local activists, came to no avail as she went home defeated with only 1.6 percent of the vote. Ishikawa said he understood how it feels to be alone and cut off from those once regarded as friends because of one’s sexual orientation.“I realized that I was gay in the fifth grade. Many LGBT people realize their sexual orientation in the early stages of their life, whether it be in kindergarten or in middle school,” he said. “It is important to tell them that they’re not weird and that they are not alone.”He said the LGBT parade is important because it is a way of telling these people that they are not alone or isolated, which was how he often felt up to his 20s.“I could not obtain proper information about LGBT at home or school, anywhere. Until I ran into other LGBT people, I was left in utter isolation,” Ishikawa said. “People start to drift apart, while less people understand how I feel.“Statistics show that gay (and) bisexual teens in Japan are six times more likely to commit suicide than those who are heterosexuals. It is important to deliver the accurate information to teenagers.”According to Ishikawa, 62 percent of gay and bisexual teenage boys in Japan have felt the urge to commit suicide, with 14 percent actually having attempted it. Of the entire LGBT teen population, 70 percent were bullied at schools. “The important message is to show that it is not the LGBT people that are evil, but the society that persecutes them,” said Ishikawa.In 1999, when Ishikawa started to interact with other LGBT community members, he realized he wasn’t alone. That gave him the courage to start working as an activist for LGBT rights, he said. He also published the memoir “Where is My Boyfriend?” about his experience growing up as a young gay man in modern-day Japan. Despite the obstacles faced by sexual minorities, Ishikawa said Japan has made considerable progress in the past 10 years, a claim perhaps best backed by his election.He said an increasing number of sexual minorities are revealing their names and faces when appearing in public, such as in media interviews.“When you look at countries that allow gay marriage, (the concept) is widely understood by the ordinary public,” he said. “The trend has been about activists coming out of the closet, but anyone should be able to do so. The hurdle to coming out should be lower.”As a gay member of parliament, Ishikawa said his proudest accomplishment is making Toshima more “LGBT-friendly.” He recently pushed to add a section on LGBT people to the suicide prevention manual of Toshima’s civil servants. Lack of recognition is considered one of the main difficulties faced by sexual minorities, he said. Korea has been no exception. Earlier this year, the Education Ministry was criticized by activists within and outside the country for not adding a section about LGBT in the national sex education guidelines for schools.“The thing that hurt me the most was not being able to convey a feeling to other people that I am attracted to men. Everyone else just assumed I was heterosexual,” he said. “Building a relationship in that situation made me feel as if I did not exist. That I was not being accepted for who I was.”By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","gay politician urges korea ,japan 1st gay politician ,1st gay politician ,1st gay politician urges ,first openly gay politician","['Korea', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Taiga Ishikawa', 'Korea', 'LGBT']",3,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.66235632  0.35295796

It was sent by Jon Kuk-man, head of the North's university sports federation.In the message, North Korea said it won't take part in the Universiade because of the scheduled opening of the Seoul office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. The field office, which will open Tuesday, will be charged with monitoring and documenting human rights in North Korea.The International University Sports Federation's secretary general, Eric Saintrond, was also listed on the recipient list, but Kim said FISU has yet to receive the same email.Kim said the organizing committee is working with the Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, to determine the veracity of the North Korean message.""It's premature to conclude that North Korea has completely pulled out of the Universiade,"" Kim added.Yoon Jang-hyun, mayor of Gwangju and president of the organizing committee, also held out hope that the North will change its mind.""We express regret over the email from North Korea,"" Yoon said.""But with an open mind, we will wait until the last minute for North Korea to participate.""In March, North Korea had said it would compete in athletics, diving, artistic gymnastics, rhythmic gymnastics, table tennis, judo, women's football and handball.However, the country missed the June 3 deadline to formally register for the event and also let the second deadline of June 15 pass.North Korea took part in the last Universiade held in South Korea, the 2003 summer competition in Daegu.On May 29, the North threatened to strike back at the South for the opening of the human rights office. Pyongyang dubbed the plan to set up the office ""an unpardonable provocation.""North Korea has long been labeled one of the world's worst human rights violators, but it has often bristled at such criticism, calling it a U.S.-led attempt to topple its regime.

Aided by government-led promotion and online marketing, tourists from around the world are opening their eyes to the country’s treasure trove of attractions.Situated at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, Georgia has had cultural interactions with neighboring Russia, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Turkey for centuries. As a result, the tourism experience is multifaceted and multilayered, offering a mix of historic sightseeing, religious tours, cultural events, winemaking, spa-bathing and caving. Georgian Ambassador Nikoloz Apkhazava (center) poses with members of the embassy staff and the Georgian National Tourism Administration at the Korea Travel Fair 2015 at Coex in Seoul. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)Georgia has an extremely diverse climate and terrain, from the Black Sea coast to the Caucasus Mountains, and from alpine meadows to semi-deserts, valleys and wetlands. Visitors can go skiing, paragliding, horseback riding, rafting, biking, hiking and ballooning.The capital, Tbilisi, in eastern Georgia, has a 1,500-year history manifested by medieval fortresses, narrow and winding alleys, timeless religious buildings, balconied wooden houses, saunas and spas. The Sulfur Baths in Old Tbilisi is a spa facility that uses naturally heated mineral spring water. “As Koreans love the spas called ‘jjimjilbang’ here, they picked spa-bathing as their most desired activity to do in Georgia on a survey,” Tamar Kazalikashvili, who worked at the Korea Travel Fair 2015 at Coex in Seoul, told The Korea Herald. “Koreans also loved Georgian food and wine for their delicious tastes at low prices.”Last year, 3,000 Korean tourists visited Georgia, a 22 percent increase from the previous year.  Batumi city on the Black Sea (Georgian National Tourism Administration)Places most frequented by Korean tourists are Tbilisi; Gori city where Joseph Stalin was born; Kazbegi village on the slopes of Mount Kazbegi; Batumi city on the Black Sea coast; the former capital, Mtskehta, with its many monasteries and churches; and Kakheti province, which is famous for wine. Kazalikashvili, who has lived in Korea for three years and now studies at Ewha Womans University, said the key cultural similarity between Georgians and Koreans is the “our thing” mentality.“As Georgia is a small nation of less than 4 million people, and has experienced many wars, our people have a strong pride in our nation, culture and religion,” Kazalikashvili explained. “Georgians are protective of their community, like Koreans, but we believe that ‘guests are a gift from God,’ and treat visitors very hospitably.” Georgians have strong religions, and churches, mosques, synagogues, chapels and memorials exist side by side in many cities. The Uplistsikhe cave town, which dates back to the early Iron Age, is located on a rocky escarpment near the Mtkvari River south of the Greater Caucasus Mountains. It has been called the “fortress of the lord” for its pagan and Christian mountaintop architecture. Batumi, the “Pearl of the Black Sea,” is a popular resort destination for international tourists. It has a beachside boulevard lined with palm trees, cafes, hotels and casinos, and features world-class cultural events all year round. National parks and protected areas cover more than 7 percent of Georgia’s territory, and 75 percent of the protected areas are forests. Many walking trails, where one can encounter a variety of fauna and flora and wildlife, have survived for centuries. Georgia has the longest unbroken winemaking tradition in the world stretching back 8,000 years. Earthenware vessels called the “Qvevri” are buried in the ground, sealed and left for months to let the grapes ferment. The warm climate and moist air from the Black Sea provide ideal conditions for wine production, leading to more than 500 indigenous grape varieties. The Rkatsiteli white wine has a fresh and sweet taste, while the Saperavi red wine has a nutty and plummy taste.

Yoo will seek compensation worth $20 million in the case that marks the second sex-slavery trial in the U.S. since 2000, when the victims lost.“We will press charges against about 1,000 Japanese individuals and entities, including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Japanese wartime conglomerates, for committing crimes against humanity and defaming victims of sexual enslavement (by the imperial Japanese Army),” Kim told The Korea Herald. Kim also said Yoo decided to take the case to the U.S. because former sex slaves have made no progress in their two-year court battle in Seoul. In 2013, 12 sex-slavery victims filed a lawsuit against the Japanese government and sought financial compensation for forcing them to work in military brothels. But the Japanese government has dismissed the charge and refused to appear at the court. Tokyo has rejected the court’s request to submit documents related to the case, claiming they are beyond the Seoul court’s jurisdiction. Kim added that a legal battle on U.S. soil would encourage Japan to change its attitude toward the victims, saying Tokyo is sensitive toward international opinions, particularly those of the U.S. In the meantime, Seoul has continued its effort to resolve the wartime sex slavery issue with Tokyo. It is widely expected that Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se will discuss the matter with his Japanese counterpart during his visit to Tokyo from Sunday to Monday.“We sincerely hope that Seoul and Tokyo will hammer out the agreement and resolve the (sex slavery) issue as soon as possible,” said Kim. “Until then, we will bring the case to the court all over the world, no matter how long it will take.”By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","slave to sue japan ,sex slavery on friday ,87 will sue japanese ,former wartime sex slave ,of wartime sex slavery","['south korean', 'U.S.', 'japanese', 'Tokyo', 'Yoo Hee - nam', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'japanese', 'japanese']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32185388  0.1481507

Seoul Metropolitan Government said subway fares would be raised by 200 won ($0.18) and bus fares by 150 won starting from June 27. The basic fee of both subway and bus fares is currently 1,050 won for adults.This is the capital’s first public transportation fare hike in three years. The city has recently faced public resistance for not gathering public opinion over raising the fee. Nighttime bus fares will rise from 1,850 won to 2,150 won, and inter-city bus from 1,850 won to 2,300 won. Children’s fares will remain the same.As part of the efforts to lessen the fee burden and relieve the rush hour congestion, the city will offer a 20 percent discount for passengers taking the public transportation before 6:30 a.m. The free ride service will also be expanded to green card holders aged 65 or older. About 2,200 passengers are expected to benefit from the new rule, the city said.

South Korea's Prime Minister's Office, however, said 1,516 Koreans were forced to carry out dangerous tasks in poor working conditions at these facilities run by four Japanese companies: Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi Mining, Mitsui Mining and Nippon Steel.The office came to that number after analyzing damage reports submitted by former forced laborers between 2005 and 2008.But because the time window is so short, the actual number could be significantly higher, the office said, adding that's why its number may differ from figures suggested by academics and civic organizations in Japan.""The number could increase exponentially if we allow more people to submit damage reports,"" an official at the Prime Minister's Office said on condition of anonymity. ""The Japanese government should first investigate the extent of damages done to these forced laborers before seeking UNESCO's recognition.""The Japanese government and the employers of these forced laborers have refused to release the exact figure.According to the office, at least a hundred of them never made their way back to Korea, having died or went missing in Japan. Only 94 of the 1,500 are alive today.All together, historians estimate that tens of thousands of Koreans were mobilized as slave laborers for Japanese firms during World War II, when Korea was a colony of Japan.

Seoul and Gyeonggi and Gangwon provinces have been among the worst-hit regions, with about 51 percent of average annual rainfall.A man fishes in a reservoir that has been depleted by weeks of drought in Pocheon, Gyeonggi Province, Tuesday. (Yonhap)The drought comes after summers filled with extreme cycles involving devastating droughts and deadly floods during Korea’s increasingly hot summers. A combination of climate change and mixtures of high and low levels of air pressure are the likely causes, experts have said.But experts were puzzled as to the reasons for the extreme shifts in Korea’s recent summers. Some speculate that the recent droughts are part of a cycle that brings the worst droughts every 124 years, based on weather records dating back to the 12th century.“If you look at the records dating back to (the 12th century), there are five (meteorological cycles),” Byon Hi-ryong, professor of atmospheric sciences at Pukyong University in Busan, said.“This year is when two of those cycles meet. One is a 38-year cycle of dire droughts. The other is a 124-year cycle of extreme droughts,” he added.Officials, however, have been slow to create fundamental solutions to the ongoing weather problems. Critics say the government has been busy writing impromptu emergency plans to combat the drought’s effects. The government lacks a long-term plan, critics added.Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs Lee Dong-phil vowed earlier Tuesday to muster 62.5 billion won ($56 million) to fight this year’s drought. The money will provide water to struggling farms. Over 16,000 soldiers, policemen, and officials will deliver the water, Lee said.The proposal comes after criticism from the main political parties that the Park Geun-hye administration had done too little too late.“The government has abandoned local governments to deal with the droughts themselves,” main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in said Monday.“The government must come up with an all-out plan to tackle this growing problem.”Land Ministry and K-Water officials have also been compelled to contain water reserves of the Hangang River, the main water source for the Seoul metropolitan area, despite the drought. Officials fear that the lack of rainwater could eventually deplete water reserves for Seoul.K-Water is a public company managing South Korea’s public water system.Signs showing the drought’s overwhelming effects on South Korea continued to increase public fear that the water deficit was worse than expected.Lettuce prices rose by 176 percent in the first half of June, the Korea Rural Economic Institute, a public think tank, said. Radish prices rose to 743 won per kilogram, higher than prices from last year that stood at about 500 won per kilogram.Increasing algal blooms in the downstream waters of the Nakdonggang River have also raised public fears that the drought is far from over.A struggling farmer surnamed Gweon expressed his frustration last Saturday.“I can’t remember when the last real rain fell here,” he said. “Do you think I should just give up?”By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","korea suffers worsening drought ,worsening drought farmers ,suffers worsening drought farmers ,worsening drought farmers and ,rising vegetable prices worsening",[],3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57754999 -0.05393797

341,341,Scandal exposes Korea’s twisted obsession with degrees,"Two weeks ago, a South Korean “math prodigy” made headlines across the country after claiming that she had been accepted into two prestigious American universities, Stanford and Harvard.Kim Jung-yoon, a senior at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Virginia, rose to fame after media reported that the top-tier universities had competed to recruit her to their undergraduate programs and ended u...","Two weeks ago, a South Korean “math prodigy” made headlines across the country after claiming that she had been accepted into two prestigious American universities, Stanford and Harvard.Kim Jung-yoon, a senior at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Virginia, rose to fame after media reported that the top-tier universities had competed to recruit her to their undergraduate programs and ended up creating a special shared program only for her to study at both schools. According to the reports, the 18-year-old girl secured a rare chance to study at both schools and choose where to graduate from. Kim showed acceptance letters from the schools to back her claims. Kim was featured on radio talk shows while her father contributed to the hype by conducting interviews with local news outlets.The reports on Kim’s achievement sparked envy among Koreans who have been living in a climate where admission into top universities is seen as key to elevating their social status. But about a week later, her whole story was unraveled, with both Harvard and Stanford universities denying the acceptance of the Korean student. The universities confirmed that there was no such joint program allowing a student to study at both schools, calling the acceptance letters provided by Kim forgeries. Kim Jung-yoon, a senior at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Virginia, walks out of Incheon International Airport under protection of an acquaintance on Friday. (Yonhap)Kim, who appears to have masterminded the whole furor herself, immediately went from being idolized to ridiculed, with her father apologizing last week for causing a stir and promising to take care of her mental health.Putting aside the reason behind her scam, the scandal appeared to leave a bitter aftertaste here, as it bluntly illustrated the country’s avid obsession with academic elitism and a competitive media industry prone to lapses of judgment.A 28-year-old student said he could sympathize with her as he understands what it feels like to fail to enter top-tier universities and to be treated like a “loser” in Korean society. “I have felt that entering a renowned university is a way to have my voice heard in Korean society,” Lee, who wanted to be identified only by his surname, told The Korea Herald. Lee is studying for a master’s at a Seoul-based university after receiving a diploma from a lesser-known college. “When I criticize the social structure, people think that I am complaining due to my poor educational background,” he said. “Then, I become a loser again.” In Korea, it has been considered a norm that one’s diploma defines the rest of his or her life, from career to even marriage prospects. Cliques are formed based on educational backgrounds, with graduates from the nation’s top universities taking up high positions on the social ladder and dominating academia, business and politics.The infamous Korean helicopter moms enroll their toddlers in English-language kindergartens, in desperate hopes that the child will not be left behind in the fierce competition to enter the country’s best universities, or if not, prestigious ones abroad.Kim is one of the kids who might have felt pressured to impress her parents, said Seol Dong-hoon, a sociology professor from Chonbuk National University. “The whole hullaballoo could have only been a family issue, but Kim’s father made her lie public by showing off his daughter’s achievement through the media,” Seol said.Indeed, Kim’s case was only the latest in a long list of academic fabrication cases in Korea.One of the most high-profile scandals came in 2007 when Shin Jeong-ah, an art history professor at Dongguk University, faked her academic record. On the back of her distinguished degrees from Yale and University of Kansas, Shin rapidly shot to prominence in the local art world. She was appointed codirector of the Gwangju Biennale, one of the biggest art events in East Asia, at the age of 35. But Shin fell from grace when her academic accomplishments turned out to be forged. She resigned from all her posts and was eventually convicted of falsifying records and embezzlement. The Shin case triggered a wave of similar allegations and confessions across the nation involving a professor, movie director, renowned architect, leading actors and actresses and even a respected monk. Behind the academic fraud cases is Koreans’ belief that educational backgrounds indicate “status” in society, experts said. “Koreans have viewed an academic degree as a prerequisite to success and climbing up the social ladder, which has intensified competition for admission to prestigious universities,” Shin Kwang-yeong, a sociology professor from Chung-Ang University, told The Korea Herald. And the belief has more than 1,000 years of history to it. “Back in history, only aristocrats had a chance to take a state-administered exam to rise in social status,” Shin said, referring to the Goryeo (918-1392) and Joseon (1392-1895) dynasties under which people took the Gwageo, the national civil service exam to advance into society. “But now, exams are standardized and institutionalized so that anyone in any class can take an exam, get respectable degrees and enter the upper tier of society,” he added. With the country’s leading businesses and key national exams still favoring those with prestigious diplomas, the obsession to embellish one’s academic record persists, experts said.A recent survey suggested that university degrees still have a huge impact on new graduates’ job prospects. According to a survey of 418 firms by recruitment site Saramin, 88.5 percent of the surveyed companies said that they have given an advantage to those holding a degree from renowned universities in the resume screening process. Asked about the reason behind the practice, the companies said that they saw prestigious degrees as a result of one’s efforts and a means of objectively measuring job seekers’ abilities. Other experts pointed out the Kim’s scandal was also a result of poor quality journalism. After it was found to be fabricated, a mainstream media outlet published a lengthy correction after having covered the teenage girl’s story.“Kim’s story had every element that can excite Koreans ― the success of a Korean abroad and acceptance into prestigious universities,” said Choi Jin-bong, who teaches mass communications at Sungkonghoe University.“That’s perhaps why Korean media hastily picked up the story.” With the news about Kim going viral in Korea after first being covered by a Korean newspaper in the U.S., the local media continued to reproduce the story until parents and students at Kim’s school raised questions about her credentials, which later prompted a local daily to check the supposed facts. “Amid fierce competition to attract readers and generate traffic online, local news outlets lack a system to check facts before reporting,” Choi said, pinpointing a structural problem of online journalism driven by “stimulating” stories. “Such diminishing media ethics can strike us all in the long run,” Choi added.Above all, the Kim case sounds the alarm to a society that has been pushing its youth to “risk their lives” to get into top-tier universities, said Kim Ji-ae, an activist campaigning to break academic cliques in society. “The 18-year-old girl is not the only one to blame. Korean society that has made a university degree a source of pride or inferiority should take the blame,” Kim said. “Kim’s behavior might be a self-portrait of us all.”By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","korean math prodigy made ,south korean math prodigy ,math prodigy made headlines ,prestigious american universities stanford ,korean math prodigy","['south korean', 'american', 'Stanford', 'Harvard', 'Kim Jung - yoon', 'Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology', 'Virginia']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63252735  0.70121557

The committee is a communist party organ dealing with daily inter-Korean affairs.Spokesman Lim urged Pyongyang to stop such denunciations that lack ""the minimum etiquette and common sense.""

No military clash occurred during his defection. “We’ve secured his custody and handed him over to a related agency, which is now looking into his exact motive and method of escape,” a ministry official told reporters on customary condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. “Details are to be examined further, but the soldier mentioned habitual beating and his discontent over North Korea’s reality as the main reasons that had driven his defection.”  Inter-Korean Transit Office near the Demilitarized Zone on Paju in Gyeonggi-do Province (Yonhap)The man appears to be the first North Korean soldier to flee since another trooper crossed the border and knocked on the door of a barrack in Goseong, Gangwon Province, in October 2012. The incident had revealed South Korea’s lax border defense, prompting the sacking of Army commanders and senior officers in charge. The ministry has since installed a raft of bells, phone boxes and guidance signs within the DMZ to help ensure a safer route for defectors. Pyongyang, for its part, has reportedly been tightening border controls to contain the defector outflow since leader Kim Jong-un took power in December 2011. The North has been holding an increasing number of training exercises for surprise attacks and ambush infiltrations into the DMZ areas, while nearly 1,300 wood or concrete markers have been set up every 200 to 300 meters along the border.  More than 25,000 North Koreans resettled in the South between 2002 and 2014, according to the Unification Ministry. Albeit with slight fluctuations, the annual sums steadily rose from 1,384 in 2005 to 2,706 in 2011 but it plunged to around 1,500 in 2012 and 2013 and then 1,400 in 2014, reflecting reinforced border security.Inter-Korean tensions have been escalating in recent months as the communist regime tests a submarine-launched ballistic missile and claims to have mastered miniaturizing warheads to mount on delivery vehicles. On Sunday, it again fired three KN-01 short-range missiles into the East Sea.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","korean soldier defected ,korean soldier defects to ,north korean soldier defected ,korean soldier defected to ,korean soldier defects","['north korean', 'South Korea', 'Demilitarized Zone', 'Seoul ’s Defense Ministry', 'Hwacheon', 'Gangwon Province']",3,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.71084732  0.40444902

The concept, already being conducted by Ecuador with Germany and Japan separately, is to share culture and language and form a long-term relationship between the countries. “In the past we had relationships with mostly the U.S. But we wish to diversify international relationships. We can have Korean teachers communicate Korean culture and language,” he said.The partnership, he said, will be based on more than just financial support. “It is really for knowledge transfer. We can learn the know-how of the Korean strategy, and establish certain joint research projects with Korean universities.”The partnership between the two countries is already set in motion. In 2013, the minister visited Korea to discuss cooperation in building the Yachay research park project in the Amazon region, dubbed “city of knowledge” which is both a science and technology cluster and an education complex. Institutions like the government-planned Yachay Tech University have already opened in 2014. Incheon Free Economic Zone and institutions like Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology are already working with Ecuador on the project. Espinosa said he was also open to ideas of foreign universities opening campuses in Ecuador. But hosting foreign schools is not the main idea, he stressed.“The main objective is that each country can learn each other’s culture. The idea of the binational school is not to adopt Korea’s education system, but to learn from the culture and exchange cultures,” he said.“Certainly I believe we can learn from the rapid economic growth from Korea that occurred in less than 50 years. The correlation between growth and the education system is valuable,” he said.Improving the quality of education is a key issue, Espinosa said. In the past five years, Ecuador has come from having one of the worst-evaluated education systems in Latin America to the middle of the pack. Determined to go further, Ecuador is currently pushing a strategy mandating teachers to obtain master’s degrees, while carrying out school reform. The country was able to cut 22,000 schools in 2006 to 14,500 in 2015. The goal is to reduce that number to 8,000 by 2017, and finally to 5,500.

But it is not usual for North Korean soldiers to walk crossing the Military Demarcation Line to defect. According to military sources here, the communist country has been striving in recent weeks to prevent defection through the demilitarized zone by beefing up patrols along the inter-Korean border and checking to see if border markers are properly set up. A total of 1,292 markers made out of either wood or concrete are established every 200 to 300 meters along the tensely-guarded border.North Koreans, many of whom are civilians, usually cross the relatively porous border with China first and then try to head to South Korea, often through Southeast Asian nations.

The number of people in quarantine stood at 5,216 as of early Monday.The health ministry said the fatality rate of the disease stood at 10.7 percent, much lower than the 40 percent tallied in the past, with most people succumbing to MERS having underlying medical problems""The government is doing all it can to quickly contain the outbreak,"" the finance minister told lawmakers on the Strategy and Finance Committee. ""There is a need to guard against excessive anxiety and to limit the economic fallout.""Choi said that Monday and Tuesday will be a watershed for the country in terms of MERS coming under control. He said that if the spread is arrested as forecast by experts, the situation will calm down, even if there are sporadic isolated cases.He then told lawmakers that the government will quickly reach a decision on the issue of a supplementary budget. There have been growing calls for an extra budget in the wake of the MERS scare and a slowdown in growth.""The final assessment on the matter will be decided after examining all circumstances up till late June,"" the official said.Choi said earlier in the month that the country's growth will hover in the low 3 percent range for 2015, much lower than the 3.8 percent predicted by the finance ministry on Dec. 21.He, however, said that some sort of economy-boosting measures are needed as a result of MERS, and depending on the fallout, the amount of the support could become large. The official hinted that the government might issue bonds if it opts to go forward with the extra budget.""If extra funds are generated, talks will be held within the government to use part of the money to deal with the drought that is affecting the country,"" he said. The official said that while there are concerns that a supplementary budget can lead to fiscal health problems, South Korea's central government debt is relatively small compared to others.""Instead of focusing too much on the short-term balance, there is a need to be flexible, and strive for fiscal health in the medium to long term,"" he claimed. The finance minister said that under present conditions, raising taxes is not a good idea because it can adversely affect the economy.The policymaker, who doubles as deputy prime minister for economic affairs, said sales at local department stores and large discount outlets fell in the first week of June compared with a month earlier. Payments made through credit cards were down 5.5 percent earlier this month, vis-a-vis the first two weeks of May.Data showed that the tourism and leisure industries were hit the hardest with people spending less on entertainment and eating out.On the criticism directed against the government for not disclosing information about the outbreak, which some argue helped spread the illness, Choi conceded that the health ministry did not do a good job in the early stages. He, however, said that while Seoul wants to guard against wrong information getting out and causing more confusion, it is now committed to releasing all information to the public in a timely manner.Choi also said exports and industrial production were hurt by the sluggish pace of global economic recovery, with facility investment and money poured into the construction sector on the wane.""A drop in exports is not as severe as negative growth in global trade volume, but it is facing unfavorable exchange rate challenges,"" he said. Outbound shipments plunged 10.9 percent on-year in May.Both the Japanese yen and the euro have weakened compared with the U.S. dollar, sapping the price competitiveness of South Korean goods in overseas markets.On fears that a weak yen may pose problems, the minister said that such a development is linked to Tokyo engaging in a quantitative easing program. He said that by fueling domestic consumer spending, the government wants to keep the current account surplus in check. He said that unlike in the past, there is little room for policymakers to intervene directly in foreign exchange rates.In regards to employment, the minister said jobs created in the first quarter were down compared with the previous three-month period, but there was a rebound in May. Some 354,000 new jobs were added to the labor market in the January-March period from 729,000 a year earlier. In May, however, 379,000 more jobs were created from the month before.On other developments, the finance minister said the government is keeping close tabs on a rise in household debt, which is starting to raise alarm bells. He, however, said that with other major countries having almost zero interest rates, it is inevitable that South Korea will maintain its low rate policy. Choi said lower interest burden is another factor that can reduce fallout from more debt.On the impact of U.S. interest rate hikes, the official said measures are being examined that can limit sudden capital flight that can destabilize the market.Despite the troubles, the government is fully committed to pushing forward labor, financial, education and public sector reforms that can bolster the country's competitiveness down the line, he said.

One of the key pending issues is a demand by former Korean sex slaves for an apology and compensation from Japan.   Japan has so far refused to comply with the demand, insisting that the so-called ""comfort women"" were recruited by civilian profiteers and its wartime military-led government was not directly involved.   ""There has been considerable progress on the issue of the comfort women, and we are in the final stage of our negotiations,""Park said in an interview posted on the website of the Washington Post.   Still, she declined to elaborate on the progress, citing behind-the-scenes discussions.   Park has repeatedly pressed Japan to restore the honor of the former sex slaves while they are still alive.   The issue has gained urgency as the number of living victims has shrunk. Two former sex slaves died on Thursday, reducing to only 50 the number of surviving victims.   Park also told the newspaper that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's reign of terror is ""sowing and amplifying the seeds of instability for the regime,"" referring to the executions of some 90 officials in recent years.   In May, South Korea's spy agency said the North executed its defense chief, Hyon Yong-chol, in late April with an anti-aircraft gun for showing disloyalty to Kim.   She also called for pressure on North Korea to bring Pyongyang back to the negotiating table it walked away from in 2008. The six-party nuclear talks were designed to end North Korea's nuclear program in return for aid and diplomatic concessions. The talks involve the two Koreas, the U.S., China, Russia and Japan.   Asked whether she feels squeezed between the U.S. and China over the possible deployment of a U.S. missile-defense battery in South Korea, Park said that when it comes to security, it shouldn't be about yes or no, depending on the position of certain countries.   ""The first priority should be how can we best safeguard the Korean people,"" Park said.   South Korea is struggling to walk a diplomatic tightrope between the U.S., Seoul's key ally, and China, Seoul's largest trading partner, over the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense(THAAD) battery that is designed to shoot down ballistic missiles in their terminal stage.   Washington hopes to deploy THAAD in South Korea to counter ballistic missile threats posed by North Korea, saying it is a purely defensive system.   Still, China has repeatedly expressed its opposition to the possible deployment of a THAAD battery in South Korea, suspecting it is part of U.S. attempts to contain a rising China. (Yonhap)","south korean sex slaves ,sex slaves for japan ,sex slaves president park ,japan on sex slaves ,korean sex slaves for","['Park Geun', 'Japan', 'south korean', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Japan']",3,"[ 0.          3.          0.         ... -0.51548076  0.36908248

353,353,[Weekender] Why Koreans abandon so many dogs,"The thousands of dogs Aerinwon, a private shelter in Pocheon, Gyeonggi Province, may have been abandoned, but it doesn’t mean they have given up on humans.They jump around and wag their tails as people pass by their enclosure, as if forgetting their past poor treatment.Their lively response is ironic, considering the majority ended up in the facility as they were considered either too ill or too old.

Some people brought them in after rescuing them from an abusive environment, its director Kong Kyung-hee said, but others have been less kind, secretly dumping their pets at the shelter at night. In many cases, such abandoned pets are bitten to death by other dogs.Dogs wait in their enclosure at animal shelter Aerinwon in Pocheon, Gyeonggi Province, Wednesday. (Ock Hyun-ju/The Korea Herald)“Some cruel people throw their dogs out of car windows and run away. The dogs, who tend to return to their masters, chase after the cars and end up being run over,” said Kong, cuddling and patting the dozens of dogs that surrounded her. Kong began taking in unwanted dogs 32 years ago. Now, more than 3,000 dogs are housed outdoors in wire cages at the shelter, with the number increasing each year. “It is difficult to accommodate the rising number of dogs with limited resources, but I cannot let them die on the streets or be put to death by the government,” the 72-year-old woman said, who looks after abandoned pets with four staff while living in a small container house.“Puppies are, of course, adorable when they are young. People mindlessly make emotional purchases, and easily ditch them when they start to misbehave, bark, lose their hair and fall ill,” Kong said.According to government statistics, some 81,000 pets were abandoned in 2014, with the majority being dogs. Of these, only 31.4 percent were adopted and 13 percent were reclaimed by their owners, while 23 percent died in shelters and 22.7 percent were euthanized.The number of abandoned pets has dwindled from 101,000 in 2010 to 81,000 in 2014, but the decline hardly means that animal rights awareness has increased, activists here point out.“The culture of easily buying and giving up pets, the huge costs of medical treatment and food, conflicts with neighbors over dogs’ barking and the hectic pattern of life in modern society are to blame for the discharging of pets,” Song Joon-kyu, a researcher from think-tank The Seoul Institute, said at a forum on abandoned animals.It is the norm for Koreans to buy dogs from pet shops rather than adopt one from animal shelters as they tend to prefer dogs of “pure” breeds. In the pet shops, they can pick a dog of a certain breed, color and size for as little as 100,000 won ($90), like shopping for clothes. When shopping for dogs online, the prices are even lower. But it is not only about Koreans’ pet-purchasing culture. There is a more fundamental problem: the supply of dogs exceeds demand. Kong Kyung-hee, head of animal shelter Aerinwon, pets dogs around her inside the shelter, Wednesday. (Ock Hyun-ju/The Korea Herald)“The root cause of dogs being abandoned is an industrial structure that enables people to easily purchase dogs from pet shops and throw them away,” said Park Ana, an animal rights activist at Korea Animal Rights Advocates.“Thousands of unlicensed breeders are producing more pets than society can take in,” Park said, accusing the government of failing to track down and clamp down on the illegal businesses. While the government does not actually have statistics available, more than 3,000 dog farms are thought to be illegally operating across the country to cater to the demand for dog meat and special breeds of pets, pro-animal activists claimed. Many of the dogs in Kong’s Aerinwon were also brutally abused when they arrived. “I recently rescued a dog from a dog farm, where she was forced to give birth to nearly 50 puppies in total,” Kong said. “When she first arrived at our shelter a month ago, she could not even walk.” Such “puppy factories” are notorious for inducing female dogs into heat to keep them producing puppies while locked in a small cage. “The key to promoting animals’ rights lies in lowering the number of pets by regulating the illicit dog trading businesses,” Park said. Under the Animal Protection Law, homeless animals found on the streets are rescued and transferred to some 368 animal shelters, either sponsored by the government or run directly by municipalities. The facilities then put up advertisements on the government’s website for seven days to look for their owners. Unless they find their owners within 10 days of arrival, the shelters can put the dogs up for adoption. If not adopted, dogs are eventually put down, as the state-run shelters do not have enough money or space to keep the growing number of incoming animals. There are also hundreds of privately-run shelters like Kong’s Aerinwon set up to rescue animals in danger of being euthanized. Running on donations, some private facilities grapple with a lack of funding and come under fire for offering poor conditions for dogs, which raises their own questions over animals’ welfare. Thus, it is difficult to say whether euthanasia is good or bad from an animal-welfare perspective, said Cho Hee-kyung, head of the Korean Animal Welfare Association.“The question is whether dogs in such poor conditions (at some private facilities) can be happy just living,” Cho said. “Society needs to address abandoned animals’ rights, too.” As part of campaign to prevent pet abandonment, the government enacted a new system in July 2014, requiring all pet owners to register dogs aged over three months on a government system. Those who fail to do so can face a fine of up to 400,000 won. Since the rule took effect, less than 890,000 pets have been registered nationwide, approximately 55 percent of the total estimated by the central government. “The pet registration system should be reinforced and all the pets should be microchipped so that the authorities can trace pet owners who abandon their furry friends,” the activist Cho said. “The system is already in place, but is far from properly working.” The government is aware of the situation. “We will partner with veterinarians and animal rights organizations to promote the system and raise awareness of why pets should be registered,” said an official from the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, who asked not to be named.“But some citizens say that the government should focus on expanding welfare for people, not animals,” he said. “There seems to be no broad consensus yet on animals’ rights in Korean society.” By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","koreans abandon so many ,abandon so many dogs ,dogs aerinwon private shelter ,thousands of dogs aerinwon ,many dogs the thousands","['Aerinwon', 'Pocheon', 'Gyeonggi Province']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51465929  0.16641784

She later had to undergo uterine surgery twice.  In 1945, when the Japanese surrendered to the Allied Forces, she took the last boat back to Busan, where she stayed for two years because she was too sick to make her way back to Pohang.  She finally married at age 50, after years of poverty from selling just fish and vegetables. Her brothers all died in the 1950-53 Korean War.  Kim's death came less than 30 minutes after the passing of another former sex slave Thursday.  Kim Oi-hwan died of a chronic illness at a hospital in Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province, just southeast of Seoul, said the House of Sharing, a shelter for former sex slaves.

The ministry has been helping farmers since late May. Precipitation in the two provinces stands at about 57 percent of their annual average, the ministry said. The water level of Soyang River Dam in Chuncheon, Gangwon Province, hovers around 153 meters, marking 25 percent of the total capacity and just about 2 meters away from the lowest ever since its 1975 launch. The facility’s operation is coming under threat as the figures are going down by some 3 centimeters every day, according to the state-run Korea Water Resources Corp. The drought has also caused damage to nearly 3,000 hectares of fields across Gangwon.  Fishing boats sit on a weed-covered bank in Soyang Lake in Inje, Gangwon Province. (Yonhap)“The military stationed in related areas is lending a helping hand on a division scale by mobilizing water wagons, trailers, fire reels, fumigator trucks and troops,” ministry spokesperson Kim Min-seok said at a news briefing on Thursday.“We have so far provided 140,000 liters of water, nine wagons and 100 servicemen to Donghae, Hwacheon, Cheolwon, Pyeongchang and other cities and counties in Gangwon Province.” Earlier in the day, Agriculture Minister Lee Dong-phil convened a video conference with senior officials from six city and provincial governments to examine their damage and the current situation for formulating countermeasures. The ministry has decided to constantly review and bolster water supply measures by municipalities and offer financial support if the dry spell drags out further. It also set aside 35.2 billion won ($31.7 million) to cope with the crisis. “We should inject as much workforce and equipment as possible and secure available water resources to minimize the farmers’ inconvenience and economic losses and facilitate their work,” Lee was quoted as saying at the meeting. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport also on Thursday began rallying hydroelectric dams along the Han River basin to beef up water supply chiefly sourced from multipurpose dams, while Minister Yoo Il-ho toured Paldang Dam in Namyangju, Gyeonggi Province, to inspect the ministry’s response. In March, the agency devised measures to save more water resources and has since secured an extra 135 million tons. The latest decision reflects persistent concerns over a protracted dry spell and delayed rains in the summer. Nonghyup, a state-funded agricultural bank, said it has offered relief supplies and financial assistance of 140 million won to 10 cities and counties, while running a situation room for drought management at its 16 regional headquarters and 1,137 branches around the country. The institution also plans to distribute water pumps, hoses, sprinklers and other gears and help repair related equipment in collaboration with the central and local governments.Members of the ruling Saenuri Party, for their part, visited a reservoir in Ganghwa County, Incheon, that has seen its reserve rates plunge for the last two years. They toured the area to look at the damage and discussed support steps after a briefing by county officials. The party delegation was led by Rep. Won Yoo-chul, chair of the policy committee, with officials from the agriculture and land ministries and state-run agricultural and water companies also taking part.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","korea battles worst drought ,worst drought in decades ,battles worst drought in ,battles worst drought ,worst drought in","['Han Min - koo', 'Gyeonggi']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65338677  0.07809373

More than 180 experts and high-ranking officials participated in the forum “Institutionalizing Anticorruption and Good Governance” to seek identity areas for targeted intervention, as well as general tools and strategies to combat corruption. “The question of combatting corruption is no longer a national issue but a global problem. Institutionalizing anticorruption and good governance in the international viewpoint is, therefore, essential,” Paul Linnarz, the regional representative for economic policy, said in his welcoming speech. Linnarz is also a resident representative of German political foundation Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung’s Japanese office. The two-day forum, cohosted by KAS and Asian Institute of Management Rizalino S. Navarro Policy Center of Competitiveness in Philippines, offered several speeches, experts’ lectures and closed-door discussion sessions. While poor public service and bad leadership are often the sources of corruption, several key elements can greatly affect the corruption level, a Filipino expert said. “Improving the economic competitiveness as well as boosting civic engagement and information flow are key factors for eradicating corruption,” said Ronald U. Mendoza, economics professor at the AIM and former senior economist with UNICEF’s Policy and Practice Group in New York. Participants also discussed some common myths about corruption.While many think that a strong anticorruption agency may be the answer to combating corruption, the accountability issue actually poses an obstacle, an Australian expert pointed out.“In principle, they are accountable to the national parliaments, and in many countries parliaments are so poorly organized that effectively these organizations are accountable to no one,” said Norman Abjorensen, the visiting fellow in the Policy and Governance Program of the Australian National University. “They can then act like a loose cannon, creating more damage than benefits to the anticorruption cause.”The closed-door afternoon sessions focused on the positive role of access to information and IT platforms in tackling corruption. On Thursday, participants will have an anticorruption discussion with Senator Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III, chairperson of the Electoral Reforms and People’s Participation Senate Committee. Another discussion will be held at the AIM over rampant corruption in campaigning and election.

Yun planned to visit Tokyo in April 2013, but his visit was canceled after Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso paid tribute to Japanese war dead at the controversial Yasukuni Shrine.Along with Yun, acting Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan is being cited as a Seoul official who could potentially visit Japan to attend the anniversary ceremony. Observers say whether Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will attend it will be a critical factor for Seoul to determine its representative to the anniversary event.Meanwhile, Seoul and Tokyo plan to hold the eighth round of director general-level talks over the issue of “comfort women,” a euphemism for sex slaves who were forced by Japan to serve in its frontline military brothels.Launched last April, the two sides have held seven rounds of talks in Tokyo. But there has been no critical progress in their efforts to address the issue. Seoul has demanded Tokyo offer an explicit apology and compensation to Korean victims, while Tokyo has argued that the issue was already settled under a 1965 bilateral treaty that normalized the two countries’ relations.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","minister mulls japan visit ,seoul officials said wednesday ,mark the 50th anniversary ,mulls japan visit south ,korea is considering sending","['South Korea', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Japan', 'Seoul']",3,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.45568886  0.67352438

""But North Korea is not expected to close down the zone just because of the wage issue.""  The joint industrial complex, which opened in 2004, is the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation. It has served as a major revenue source for the cash-strapped communist North, while South Korea has utilized cheap but skilled North Korean laborers.  The operation of the complex has been highly affected by inter-Korean relations. The Seoul-Pyongyang ties have been strained since 2010 when the South imposed sanctions banning economic and cultural exchanges following the North's torpedoing of a South Korean warship and its shelling of a border island.  In April 2013, the North unilaterally shut down the industrial park for about four months, raising concerns about the viability of the factory zone. Four months later, the two Koreas decided to set up a joint committee in charge of running the industrial park.  Seoul has rejected Pyongyang's unilateral wage hike, saying it is in breach of a 2004 agreement that calls for the two sides to set wages through consultations. The wage hike cap has been set at 5 percent per year.  Touching on the talks on a wage cap, Jeong claimed that the South needs to show ""flexibility"" over the issue although the matter should be resolved through consultations by the two sides.  When it comes to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Jeong said North Korea has ""grave"" concerns about the disease.  Concerns about the spread of the MERS virus are growing in the South as it has killed six South Koreans so far, while the number of those infected has increased to 87.  The communist country has been highly sensitive to the outbreak of contagious diseases due to its weak health care system. Last year, Pyongyang imposed an entry ban on foreign tourists for about five months due to concerns over the deadly Ebola virus.  ""It is certain that the North has grave fears about the newly-found infectious disease,"" Jeong said, adding that North Korea had requested the South Korean firms at the zone to unveil measures to counter the Ebola virus last year.  ""But there have been no requests from the North over MERS except for its recent demand for supply of thermal scanners and masks,"" he added.  At the request of the North, South Korea on Monday installed three thermal scanners for those who move in and out of the complex to prevent the spread of the virus in the reclusive country.

So far, 87 South Koreans have tested positive for MERS, of whom six have died.  The government said the number of people quarantined from the disease has jumped to 2,508, while 583 people were released from quarantine.  The disease has put Park's key agenda, including labor reform, and the nomination for a new justice minister on the backburner.  Park has called on government officials and medical staff to mobilize all resources available to contain the virus and to ensure that infected patients can recover.  ""All tasks of Cheong Wa Dae are now focused on MERS for the time being. It's fair to say other issues have come to a standstill,"" the official said.  The presidential office showed no indication of rescheduling Park's visit to the United States later this weekend.  ""There is nothing to announce"" regarding any possible change in Park's visit to the U.S., presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook told reporters.  Park is set to leave for Washington on Sunday for talks with U.S. President Barack Obama.  The two leaders are scheduled to hold summit talks on June 16 to exchange views on a broad range of security, economic and global issues, including the South Korea-U.S. alliance.

The officer has to undergo another set of tests to be finally confirmed as a MERS patient by the Health Ministry’s  Center of Disease Control. If confirmed, it would be the first MERS case in the Korean military. Following the announcement, about 100 soldiers at the Osan Air Base in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, have been quarantined. The sergeant is currently asymptomatic, according to the Republic of Korea Air Force. The base is near a United States Air Force base.The officer had been hospitalized with a fracture at a civilian facility where the first confirmed MERS patient had stayed, before returning to the base.Among the five newly confirmed patients, two of them stayed at the facility as patients where more than 20 had already been confirmed as infected by the first patient. Among the two health care workers who have been newly confirmed as MERS patients, one of them is believed to have been infected by the first patient at the same facility where more than 20 infection cases took place. The other treated the 14th confirmed patient at a medical clinic where the first confirmed patient had briefly stayed as well.The remaining new patient is believed to have been infected by the 16th patient who visited a total of three hospitals while infected, including the one where he stayed with the first patient.As of Thursday morning, more than 700 schools and kindergartens have decided to cancel classes to prevent possible infection among school children.

""Intensive back-channel negotiations have been taking place,"" David Ignatius said in the column. ""What would it take to make the past less toxic?

""History issues are a serious challenge for now, but that doesn't stop us from developing relationships (with Japan) at other levels,"" the official was quoted as saying.Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mainly from Korea, which was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. But Japan has long attempted to water down the atrocity.Abe came under strong fire for failing to issue a clear apology for the atrocity during his visit to the United States in April that included a landmark address at a joint meeting of Congress.The sexual slavery issue has been the biggest thorn in frayed relations between Japan and South Korea, with Seoul demanding Tokyo take steps to address the grievances of elderly Korean victims of the atrocity and Japan refusing to do so.

The ministry said in its press briefing on Tuesday, “We will make a database for medics to identify the MERS patients and the medical centers where they were hospitalized.”The information will, however, be “disclosed only to medics and not the public to avoid misunderstanding and excessive anxiety,” the official said, adding that, “Names of hospitals are not revealed to the public even in advanced countries.”The ministry tried to allay the public’s concerns, saying the virus is under close supervision at medical centers and has no risk of spreading. Despite the government‘s latest action, fears don’t seem to be going away and some civic groups are calling on the government to disclose more transparent information to the public. A local civic group “Pyeongtaek Advocacy Group,” representing the region where one patient was diagnosed with the virus, is calling for making the information public. “Fears are spreading fast but we have no idea of what the government is doing to deal with the issue. The government should be more responsible in handling the incident,” one representative of the civil group said. Seoul on Tuesday confirmed two deaths from MERS, while six more have been added to the list of infected patients in the country. The two dead bodies will reportedly be cremated as the entire bodies are contaminated with the virus. Among the six, two are believed to be the first tertiary infection cases, the ministry said. As of Tuesday morning, the number of confirmed cases in Korea marked 25, surpassing Jordan as the country with the third-most MERS cases in the world.By Shin Ji-hye (shinjh@heraldcorp.com)","press briefing on tuesday ,affected hospitals south korea ,make database for medics ,health ministry is struggling ,mers affected hospitals south","['South Korea ’s', 'Health Ministry']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57990855  0.55390972

Earlier on Tuesday, officials said 22 elementary schools in the province were at risk of being exposed to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus. They are located near the hospital in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, where a 58-year-old woman died on Monday before she was confirmed to have contracted the disease, the first death from the illness in South Korea.The woman had been in the same hospital as the country's first MERS patient.She is one of the two people who died after having been in contact with the first MERS patient. South Korea says 25 people have so far been confirmed as MERS patients.Four elementary schools in North Chuncheong Province have also decided to cancel classes until Friday after a teacher at one of the schools reportedly came in close contact with a MERS patient.The teacher is known to have visited his father on May 23 before the father was diagnosed with MERS on Tuesday.The teacher also interacted with instructors working at three other elementary schools last weekend. The schools are among the four that are closed for the week.MERS is a viral respiratory illness that is new to humans, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.There had been only 1,142 reported cases in 23 countries since the first case was confirmed in Saudi Arabia in 2012.Most people infected with MERS develop severe acute respiratory illness, including a fever, a cough and shortness of breath. There currently is no vaccine or treatment for the disease that has a very high fatality rate of over 40 percent.

382,382,[Herald Interview] Norway stresses state-funded education,"Providing selective or comprehensive education benefits has long been a topic of discussion in South Korea.

Some say the welfare system should cater to those in need, while others say it should extend to all citizens.Bjorn Haugstad, the deputy minister of education and research in Norway, said that paying for education should remain a duty of the government rather than the parents.“We have always emphasized free education. Providing for education is more about public and government’s responsibility than parents. Parents contribute through paying taxes,” he said.  Bjorn Haugstad.Norway has one of the most expansive systems of public coverage of education expenses in the world, which includes tertiary education fees. Each Norwegian student is entitled to take a loan for education, 40 percent of which is converted into a scholarship upon passing the exams, he said. “Since World War II, the role of the state education loan fund has only increased, into a model that is about a universal coverage,” Haugstad said.The Norwegian official’s message has a special implication in a country where parents shoulder much of the financial burden of student’s learning. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, 37.2 percent of the funding for education institutes come from the private sector, compared to the OECD average of 16.1 percent.Another major issue that has been ailing Koreans is the criticism that the high pressure of academic accomplishments is hindering students from enjoying life. Last month’s World Education Forum 2015, which attributed the country’s improbable economic success to its education prowess, sparked concerns from education experts that the government is overlooking the fact that the excessive workload has deprived school life of joy. “In Norway, we are concerned always about work-life balance. And I think perhaps Korea will also need to (have) a discussion on balancing hard work and life. Working hard is work, but too much would mean no life,” Haugstad pointed out. Finding the proper work-life balance remains a job for Koreans, he added, as they are the ones who know best about their economy and society.Haugstad, 46, is a member of the Norwegian Conservative Party and was the research director at the University of Oslo from 2009 to 2013. He holds a doctorate from Oxford University with a thesis on strategy realization in knowledge intensive organizations.

Realistically, however, there could be different views on the specific ways and level of pressure, he said on background.It represents a dilemma for South Korea, which is seeking to get tougher on its increasingly hostile communist neighbor.The South's top nuclear envoy, Hwang Joon-kook, held trilateral discussions with his U.S. and Japanese counterparts, Sung Kim and Junichi Ihara, in Seoul last week. Hwang and Kim then visited Beijing for separate talks with China's top diplomat on Korea, Wu Dawei.The series of diplomatic meetings came in response to Pyongyang's claims of launching a ballistic missile from a submarine and mastering a technology to mount nuclear bombs onto missiles.In Tokyo, senior officials from South Korea, the U.S., Japan, China and Russia met for a regional security forum. All the countries are members of the now-suspended six-party talks on the North's nuclear weapons program.""The five parties have agreed on the need for pressure on North Korea. For now, there is no option other than pressure,"" the official told reporters on the condition of anonymity. ""But there could be differences on what and how to do.""Besides U.N.-led sanctions, the human rights issue can be a card to ratchet up pressure on the North, but China and Russia remain opposed to that, he pointed out.""Economic cooperation can also serve as a tool for pressure,"" the official said, but he stopped short of elaborating.What is important is to ""change the thought and calculation"" of the North's leaders and persuade Pyongyang to return to the negotiating table, he added.Pyongyang has not budged at all, passing the responsibility for lack of dialogue to Washington.In a statement issued Sunday, the North's foreign ministry said it's too late for any talks, saying the country will continue its efforts toward a ""balance of forces"" with the U.S. through the development of nuclear weapons.Another South Korean government official said, ""It seems like North Korea publicly used the expression 'balance of forces.'""It apparently shows that Pyongyang has no will for talks aimed at dismantling its nuclear weapons program.

Two of them were patients in the hospital, while the other person is a son of another patient who had visited the hospital to care for his parent, the Health Ministry said.They had not been monitored by the authorities as they had shown no symptoms of the disease when they were dismissed from the hospital, according to the ministry.The total number of MERS infections reached 18 in 12 days since the first outbreak on May 20.Still, the ministry said the country has yet to report any tertiary infections, meaning all 17 people diagnosed since the first case became infected after coming in close contact with the first patient.A confirmed tertiary infection will make any of the 18 people who have been diagnosed a carrier.Initially, the country had isolated only the people who have come in close contact with the first patient, who reportedly caught the disease while traveling to the Middle East in mid-April.As a growing number of people are diagnosed with the disease, the government has begun to isolate every person who has come in close contact with any of the patients.As of Monday, 682 people out of 715 who have come in close contact with any of the patients were in isolation at state-designated facilities or their homes. The remaining 33 have been released as they showed no symptoms of the disease past a 14-day incubation period, according to officials from the Health and Welfare Ministry.Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo said the government is mobilizing all-out efforts to prevent further infection.""This week will become a critical crossroads over whether MERS will continue to spread or subside,"" Moon said in a policy coordination meeting with the ruling Saenuri Party officials in Seoul. ""I am very sorry for worrying citizens and causing them anxiety.""Meanwhile, a person who had come in close contact with the first patient has died while at a hospital in Suwon, located some30 kilometers south of Seoul, according to hospital and health ministry officials.The 58-year-old female patient, whose identity has been withheld, is believed to have died due to acute respiratory failure at around 6:00 pm., hospital officials said.Health officials in the city said the exact cause of death has yet to be identified, also adding that the person had not been diagnosed.The death, if linked to the disease, will mark the first-ever MERS-related death in the country and the second in Asia.MERS is a viral respiratory illness that is fairly new to humans. There had been only 1,142 reported cases in 23 countries since the first case was confirmed in Saudi Arabia in 2012 with all cases linked to countries in and near the Middle East so far.There currently is no vaccine or treatment for the disease that has a very high fatality rate of over 40 percent.

We will be factoring in preliminary data for June as well as consider market indicators such as sales,"" said a Finance Ministry official.The government is set to announce its revised economic outlook later next month when it is also expected to downgrade its forecast of other macroeconomic indicators, such as employment and consumer inflation.Seoul's current growth forecast, announced late last year, stands at 3.8 percent. If it lowers the figure by 0.5 percentage point, the revised outlook of 3.3 percent will be slightly higher than forecasts by other economic institutions.Earlier this month, the state-run Korea Development Institute slashed its outlook to 3 percent from 3.5 percent, while the Bank of Korea cut its forecast to 3.1 percent from 3.4 percent last month.The International Monetary Fund has also lowered its forecast for the Korean economy to 3.3 percent from 3.7 percent, while many private sector think tanks are predicting the economy to expand at the 2 percent level.The series of downgrades come as the country's heavily trade-reliant economy is recovering at a slower-than-expected pace due mostly to faltering global demand and a weak Japanese yen.Industrial output in all industries dipped 0.3 percent on-month in April as sluggish exports offset a recovery in consumption, according to Statistics Korea.Recently released central bank data showed that souring trade conditions have hit manufacturers, with the index gauging their sentiment tumbling to 75 from 80, the first fall in four months.The consumer price index has also been crawling. It increased less than 1 percent for the fifth month in a row in April, well below the government's 2 percent target for this year.Some market watchers raised views that the government may slash its consumer price inflation forecast to the low 1 percent level.The central bank has already slashed its inflation outlook to 0.9 percent from 1.9 percent.

Security Council resolutions barring the communist state from any launch using ballistic missile technology.The UNSC sanctions panel on North Korea unveiled the plan during its regular briefing to the UNSC on Thursday. The move came after Seoul said this week that it had sent a letter to the committee calling for a probe into the North’s SLBM test.Criticizing Seoul for referring its SLBM test to the committee, Pyongyang has demanded that the UNSC convene an emergency session to discuss the South Korea-U.S. military drills, which it claims have worsened stability on the Korean Peninsula.In a letter, North Korea’s U.N.-based office said that, should the U.N. panel take issue only with the SLBM test, it would prove that the UNSC is nothing but a “political tool” for the U.S.“The joint exercise that South Korea and the U.S. conduct is the root cause of the deterioration in the security conditions of the Korean Peninsula,” the letter reads.The North sent similar letters to the UNSC last July and August. But the issues that the North raised were not discussed at any UNSC session.There has been a flurry of speculation over the authenticity of the photos that the North released to claim that it “successfully” conducted an underwater ejection test of the SLBM.Some argue that the photos have been manipulated and that the missile was fired from a submerged barge, not a submarine. But Seoul’s National Intelligence Service said the North did conduct an ejection test of the SLBM.Irrespective of the speculations, Seoul has argued that any use of a projectile using ballistic missile technology constitutes a violation of UNSC resolutions banning the North’s missile launches.Pyongyang’s pursuit of SLBM technology has posed a serious security challenge to South Korea and the U.S. as they have no viable means to counter the SLBM threats given that it is difficult to detect deep-water submarine operations. Seoul believes it would take four to five years for the North to fully develop and deploy a SLBM.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","north korea recent test ,recent test of submarine ,the unsc on thursday ,submarine launched ballistic missile ,seoul said this week","['U.N.', 'North Korea ’s', 'U.N.

Lee Hyo-sun, 91, died at a hospital in Changwon, South Gyeongsang Province. She was one of the 238 women who had registered with the government, claiming to have been forced by Japan to serve at frontline brothels during World War II. Her death underscores the urgency of the wartime human rights issue surrounding the victims, euphemistically called “comfort women.” Victims have called on Tokyo to offer them sincere apologies and recognize its legal responsibility for the sexual slavery. Seoul has repeatedly urged Tokyo to address the issue as it would remain unresolved forever should all the victims, who are mostly in their late 80s, pass away.But Tokyo has rejected the demands, arguing all colonial-era issues have been settled under a 1965 pact between the countries that normalized the bilateral relationship. It also claims there is no clear evidence that Japan as a state forcibly mobilized sex slaves during the war.Despite the growing displeasure in Korea over Tokyo’s lack of atonement, a senior U.S. official said Washington was “gratified” by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s congressional speech last month in which he said he would remain true to his predecessors’ apologies for Japan’s wartime atrocities.“We were gratified to hear him say clearly that he stands by the statements made by the previous Japanese administrations,” U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific Affairs Daniel Russel said during his speech at the Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry in the U.S. on Wednesday.Contrary to the U.S.’ positive assessment of Abe’s congressional speech, criticism still continues in Korea over his refusal to include any expressions of repentance in the high-profile speech, such as “heartfelt apology,” an expression his predecessors used in their addresses.Abe is set to make another speech in August to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II. Observers do not expect him to make any explicit apology for the comfort women issue, although he might use expressions in the speech alluding to Japan’s infliction of “pain” or “suffering” on Asians.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","war ii her death ,former sex slave dies ,wartime sexual slavery died ,japan wartime sexual slavery ,ii her death underscores","['Japan', 'Lee Hyo - sun', 'Changwon', 'South Gyeongsang Province', 'Japan']",3,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.51594549  0.2080802

The government will also build a hall of fame in downtown Seoul to honor some 20,000 independent fighters, while compiling a biographic dictionary to list their activities and boost related education. A public-private steering committee on Thursday unveiled 50 historical, political and socio-cultural programs to take place in the run up to the Aug. 15 anniversary, after months-long review of some 560 proposals made by the central and local governments, academia and ordinary citizens. The 11.2 billion won ($10.1 million) project is aimed at nurturing national unity and public awareness of history, promoting peace and hopes for a reunification with the North, drumming up youth participation and presenting the country’s vision for a unified future Korea, according to the Office for Government Policy Coordination, the prime minister’s secretariat.“Through the various programs, we hope to foster the chance to cultivate national integration and reconciliation and accelerate discussions on unification,” said Chung Chong-wook, vice chairman of the presidential committee on unification preparation who presided over the meeting. “The people are the owners of the project. … We should formulate concrete measures and promote the programs to encourage public participation.” To raise historical awareness, Seoul plans to reintroduce the buildings of the exile governments in Shanghai and Chongqing in September and November, respectively, which were set up in the wake of the March 1, 1919, Declaration of Independence. The Seodaemun Independence Park, which was reconstructed from a prison where Japanese authorities tortured and executed Korean independence warriors and their followers during colonial rule from 1910-45, honors about 2,800 Koreans who devoted their lives to the crusade. The hall of fame will be modernized, expanded sharply and used as an educational venue, the OPC said. The biographic dictionary is designed to detail the struggle of about 16,000 fighters over the next five years. With time running out for the aging sex slavery victims, the government will write a white paper to compile the Japanese military’s atrocities and the women’s testimonies, which it will then look to list as a UNESCO world heritage record. “This will help to systematically preserve and manage the history of the so-called comfort women at home and abroad, form a consensus in terms of women’s rights and foster the mood for international solidarity,” the OPC said in a statement. On the unification front, South Korea is considering holding soccer friendlies in Seoul and Pyongyang as it did to celebrate the 60th anniversary. Wrestling and Taekwondo are among other items being considered for inter-Korean sports exchanges. It also plans to launch a special express train this summer linking Asia and Europe, called “Eurasia Express.” Some 250 people from the political, economic, academic and cultural circles and ordinary citizens will gather in Seoul on July 14 before flying to Vladivostok and Beijing for a 20-day journey. Other programs include a joint display of historical records with China, photo exhibitions, a museum on economic development history, music concerts and a science conference.

President Park Geun-hye“Despite these shadows, Park recently signed a Canada-Korea free trade agreement, an environmental cooperation treaty with China and Japan, and has called for a Northeast Asia nuclear safety body,” the magazine said.The fifth to 10th places were taken by General Motors CEO Mary Barra, IMF chief Christine Lagarde, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki and U.S. First lady Michelle Obama.Newcomers include U.S. pop star Taylor Swift, in at number 64 and the youngest of the bunch at 25.The annual list of the world’s 100 most powerful women includes leaders in eight categories ― technology, politics, business, finance, media, entertainment, philanthropy and billionaires.Clinton, who in April announced her second run for the White House, was listed at No. 6 last year, but as U.S. secretary of state she also ranked No. 2 to Merkel in 2011 and 2012.“Come next year’s U.S. elections, Merkel could lose her title for the first time since 2010 to the one person with a credible and mathematical chance of ‘leading’ the world,” wrote Forbes.Even if Clinton wins the Democratic nomination for the White House, she has no chance of being elected U.S. president until November 2016 ― after Forbes publishes its 2016 most-powerful women list.Forbes has put the German chancellor on the list 10 times in the past 12 years, nine of them as most powerful woman. Merkel was first elected in 2005 and won a historic third term in 2013.Geographically speaking, the United States dominates the list. Fifty-nine on the list are Americans, including several immigrants.There are 18 from the Asia-Pacific region, headed by Park, with 12 from Europe, four each from Latin America and the Middle East and three Africans, Forbes said.Other newcomers include EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherin at No. 36; U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch at No. 34; and incoming Guardian editor-in-chief Katharine Viner at No. 80.The magazine said the list features eight heads of state and one monarch, who govern nations with a combined gross domestic product of $9.1 trillion and 15 billionaires with a total net worth of more than $73.3 billion.The top-ranking billionaire this year is Oprah Winfrey at No. 12 with a personal net worth of $3 billion.From news reports","woman south korean president ,100 most powerful women ,11th most powerful woman ,first lady michelle obama ,powerful woman south korean","['south korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Forbes', 'U.S.', 'Michelle Obama', 'german', 'Angela Merkel', 'U.S.', 'State', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Bill Gates', 'Melinda Gates', 'Federal Reserve Board', 'Janet Yellen']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52996588  0.58470112

The two were transported to a hospital to test for infection, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The fourth confirmed patient, in her 40s, spent about five hours with her 76-year-old father, who was sharing the hospital room with the first of two confirmed MERS patients earlier this month.Passengers arriving from the Middle East pass by a thermal camera at Incheon airport on May 21. (Yonhap)When her father became the third confirmed MERS patient on May 21, she reportedly asked the health authorities to quarantine her, as she was experiencing mild symptoms including a fever and a headache. The woman was worried that she may have MERS, and wished to be isolated at a medical facility for fear of transmitting the virus to her husband and daughter.The authorities, however, sent her home, saying her symptoms were not strong enough to be considered MERS. Yet she eventually showed a high fever five days after her father’s diagnosis and was confirmed as the fourth MERS patient in the country.Since her diagnosis, the Health Ministry has been accused by the public of acting negligently despite widespread fear of the rare disease by rejecting her initial request to be isolated, which left her husband and her daughter also at potential risk of infection. The incubation period of MERS is two to 14 days, and it is believed that patients are not contagious during that period. A fever above 38 degrees Celsius is considered one of the typical symptoms of MERS, along with coughing and shortness of breath.The Health Ministry explained that the fourth patient’s fever on May 21 didn’t reach 38 degrees Celsius, and she therefore wasn’t considered a potential MERS patient. Dr. Kim Woo-joo, who is also the head of the Transgovernmental Enterprise for Pandemic Influenza in Korea, said the fourth patient should have been isolated in a medical facility even if her fever wasn’t above 38 degrees Celsius.“I think (the government) should have been more flexible with the particular case,” he told The Korea Herald. “I think the ministry was focusing too much on the rules that only those whose fever is above 38 degrees Celsius should have quarantined. For the fourth patient, however, they should have taken into account that she was in the same room as three other confirmed MERS patients and she, in fact, nursed one of them.”Asked if the fourth patient’s spouse and daughter should be isolated, Kim said the ministry should consult with the fourth patient first. “If she physically stayed away from her family in the house ― at least 2 meters away at all times ― I think the chances (of infection) aren’t very high,” he said.A total of 63 individuals, including health care workers and the patients’ families, were being monitored for possible infection on Tuesday.MERS is known to be caused by coronaviruses, a large family of viruses that cause a range of illnesses in humans from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. There is no known cure or vaccine for MERS, which has a fatality rate of 40.7 percent.More than 95 percent of the confirmed cases worldwide were in the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The first Korean MERS patient was diagnosed with the disease on May 20, following his trip to the Middle East from April 18 to May 3.Since it was first identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, 1,142 people from 23 countries have been infected by the virus. Among them, 465 died from the disease.

The AREX, which runs from the airport to Seoul Station in central Seoul through 11 stops, allows passengers to travel between the two destinations in 43 minutes on express trains. Subway Line No. 9, which is currently under construction, connects the northwestern part of the capital to the eastern region. With the majority of the line now operating, the remaining 13-kilometer-long route is to complete construction soon, officials said. Of the remaining course, a 9-kilometer section ― between Sports Complex Station and VHS Medical Center in eastern Seoul ― will be finished by 2018. Once Incheon International Airport and the eastern tip of Seoul are connected, the AREX train departing from Incheon will run on the Line No. 9 route from Gimpo International Airport Station, and head to VHS Medical Center Station in the east of the capital via Yeouido and Sports Complex stations, officials said.

Ahn Cheol-soo and Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon hosted a debate at the National Assembly emphasizing the importance of inter-Korean business and resumption of talks.The conservative ruling camp, on the other hand, maintained the principle that any lifting of the sanctions should be preconditioned with North Korea’s admission of the attack.The ruling Saenuri Party stressed that the North should first take “responsible” actions including an official apology on the sinking of the Cheonan before Seoul lifts the sanctions that were imposed because of the torpedo attack.The South Korean government, which had indicated a more flexible approach to the North earlier this month through humanitarian and civic-level assistance, faces a dilemma over the mounting calls to improve ties with the North, which remains adamant and isolated, as showcased in its abrupt cancellation of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s visit last week.On Sunday, the communist state ratcheted up its demand for the lifting of sanctions.Seoul countered by renewing its calls for Pyongyang to come out for dialogue to discuss a range of issues including the lifting of the sanctions that ban economic cooperation and assistance for the North.“We have repeatedly said that should the North respond to our proposal for dialogue, we would discuss bilateral issues including the lifting of the May 24 sanctions and try to narrow our differences,” Seoul’s Unification Ministry said in a press release.“In the process, we will strive to ensure that North Korea takes responsible measures (to deal with the sinking of the corvette).”Hours earlier, Pyongyang denied responsibility for the sinking of the Cheonan, calling Seoul’s blame an “outright fabrication.” Proposing a joint investigation, the North said the sanctions based on the “falsified outcome” of Seoul’s probe are inappropriate.“The South should respond to our demand to jointly investigate the sinking of the corvette if it has evidence to pinpoint North Korea as the culprit,” the North’s powerful National Defense Commission said in a statement, portraying the economic sanctions as a “byproduct of political conspiracy.”“As the bisected ship’s body has been salvaged, the reinvestigation will be a lot easier. The NDC has its inspection team ready that will be sent for the reinvestigation.” Seoul has refused to accept Pyongyang’s earlier proposal for the joint investigation with many arguing that it is wrong to allow “criminals” ― North Korea ― to get involved in the investigation process. A Seoul-led multinational probe team, including experts from the U.S., Australia, Sweden and Britain, concluded that a midget North Korean submarine torpedoed the 1,200-ton vessel, breaking it into two parts. As a critical piece of evidence, the team presented part of a North Korean torpedo that was discovered near the scene of the ship’s sinking close to the tense maritime border.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","after seoul imposed sanctions ,five years after seoul ,seoul to lead breakthrough ,torpedo attack about 100 ,years after seoul imposed","['Seoul', 'North Korea', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'south korean']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51487446  0.2875672

Li, who took up the post in March and presented his credentials to North Korea's ceremonial leader, Kim Yong-nam, has not yet met with the North Korean leader amid strained ties over the North's defiant pursuit of nuclear weapons. Li's predecessor, Liu Hongcai, met then-North Korean leader Kim Jong-il less than a month after assuming the post. China is North Korea's economic lifeline and diplomatic backer. Asked about the absence of a meeting between the North Korean leader and the Chinese ambassador, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying replied that, ""As far as I have learned, the Chinese ambassador to North Korea presented his credentials to the North Korean leader on March 30."" ""It means that the ambassador can carry out normal diplomatic activities"" in North Korea, Hua said. North Korean leader Kim has yet to visit China since taking the helm of the reclusive state in late 2011.The alliance between North Korea and China has often been described as being ""forged in blood"" during the 1950-53 Korean War, but it has been wearing thin recently as China's economic and military clout have been growing in Asia.

A legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War, the DMZ bisects the peninsula.North Korea's Rodong Sinmun, the communist party's official newspaper, on Thursday carried an article and photo of their visit to the birthplace of the late leader in Pyongyang.The newspaper reported that Maguire said she was ""highly touched"" after learning about the late leader's revolutionary life.It also quoted Korean-American Eun-hee Ahn as saying that Kim devoted his entire life to the freedom and emancipation of North Koreans.The activists' upcoming trek has spurred rows here as some critics said that their move will not help resolve the pressing issues of North Korea's nuclear weapons program and human rights violations.Touching on what could be seen as pro-North Korean remarks, Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies, said that North Korea has a tendency to use outsiders' visits to the North for propaganda.""There is a need to focus on the purpose of their upcoming event,"" he added.South Korea has decided to allow the foreign activists to cross the heavily fortified inter-Korean border, but recommended they use a western land route instead of walking through the truce village of Panmunjom. Seoul has also advised them to cross the border by car, not on foot.The truce village sits in the middle of the DMZ, which is guarded by stone-faced soldiers on each side of the military demarcation line.But despite Seoul's opposition, the group said the activists will stick to their plan to walk across through the truce village as their peace message should be delivered at a place with a symbolic legacy of the conflict.""South Korea has decided not to allow journalists to cover the event at the DMZ,"" said a government official. ""If the government permits reporters to cover it at the truce village, the move could be seen as official approval for the activists' DMZ crossing.""The activists said that the purpose of the DMZ crossing is to express hope that Korean families separated by the Korean War will be united someday and military tensions between the two sides can be reduced.Seoul has said that the planned event should be made in a way that does not spark unintended tension on the Korean Peninsula, raising concerns that it could be politicized by the North.

Won Yoo-chul of the ruling Saenuri Party said.  Saenuri's Choung Byong-gug also called on the government ""to rather actively demand its introduction"" if it is needed to respond to the nuclear-armed North.  The calls by some ruling party lawmakers run counter to their opposition counterparts.  Rep. Yun Hu-duk of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy stressed the need ""to discuss if the asset fits for the security circumstances of the Korean Peninsula after careful consideration with ample information.""   Citing concerns raised by China over the system's possible deployment, Yun pointed to ""possible serious side effects on Seoul-Beijing relations.""  Meanwhile, the Defense Ministry said it will consult with the U.S. on the possible deployment of its advanced missile defense system on Korean soil if Washington officially makes such requests.  ""The U.S. government has been reviewing the deployment of the THAAD battery for its forces stationed here, as I understand it,"" Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok told a regular briefing. ""If it makes a formal request for discussions on the issue after such an internal process, we will of course consult with it.""  The issue has been the focus of attention here as the move is seen by critics as part of a broader U.S. attempt to get the Asian ally to join its missile-defense system.   Instead of joining the U.S. system, however, South Korea has been developing its own Korea Air and Missile Defense, a low-tier air defense program, and the Kill Chain, which is designed to launch strikes right after signs are detected of imminent nuclear or missile provocations by Pyongyang.

Concerns persist over Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s drive for a “normal state” and ongoing attempts to undercut the country’s imperial past and previous apologies for wartime atrocities such as its sexual enslavement of Korean women on frontline brothels.This has created tension as South Korea has singled out Tokyo’s atonement for the sex slavery as the prerequisite for reconciliation while the U.S. welcomes Japan’s greater military role in the face of economic woes and budget constraints and calls for greater trilateral security cooperation to better counter North Korean threats. Given many factors having shaped the Korea-Japan relationship, outsiders inevitably have a “limited role” to play in helping to tackle bilateral flashpoints, the retired envoy said, stressing that such complicated issues as history should be handled with “great care.”  Former U.S. Ambassador to Korea Kathleen Stephens. (Shin Hyon-hee/The Korea Herald)“I don’t think that this is a zero-sum game. It seemed to me that the U.S. being strongly engaged and the good communication between the leaders of Japan and the U.S. is a good thing for Korea,” Stephens said in an interview with The Korea Herald on Tuesday in Seoul. “If I were a Korean, I would approach the issue with confidence. If I may, it’s kind of an old thing to say, ‘Wow, the U.S. and Japan are closer, and maybe that means there is going to be some cost somehow to the Korea-U.S. relationship.’ I don’t think it’s ever been true.”During her ambassadorial stint here from 2008 to 11, Stephens turned into an icon of public diplomacy. She blogged about the host country in Korean language, dipped into traditional food and biked all over the lower part of the peninsula. In one summer, she even flew to Jejudo Island to pick abalones and octopuses alongside female divers there. Her affability, professionalism and command of the local language made many Koreans feel more comfortable with her superpower homeland. The knife attack on the incumbent Mark Lippert in March, which she heard about on the radio back in the U.S., came as a shock to her. Yet she soon became “impressed” by his poised management of the incident and swift comeback to the public, as well as the outpouring of support from Koreans, she said. “If you are in diplomacy, if you are in public life of any kind, wherever you are, there are always certain risks involved. … And you try to understand those risks and to mitigate but you can never prevent them entirely,” Stephens said. “I don’t think he’s been dissuaded or discouraged in his commitment and enthusiasm.” Listening to questions with curiosity and care, Stephens appeared fresh and full of vigor. As it was her first trip here in 18 months, she said she was viewing the country with “new eyes” and was excited to go biking again in the countryside, have her favorite food and reunite with Koreans and her two dogs left here, named Yeoyoo (composure) and Mooshim (detachment). To her, public diplomacy is just “one additive” to diplomacy. “From my first diplomatic assignment in 1978, I always felt that to be an effective diplomat, by that I define as someone who is able to perceive and understand to some extent views of the host country and communicate the views of your own country and build, not always agreement, but some kind of deeper appreciation and understanding of each other’s concerns and positions,” Stephens said. “To do that, you couldn’t always talk to the people in the government, and you couldn’t only talk to the people who agree with you. You always have to widen the circle.” The former envoy was visiting Korea to take part in a forum on Jejudo Island and give a lecture at a university in Seoul. After 35 years of diplomatic service, she retired following a brief term as interim ambassador to India concluding last December.

They included not only historians, but also political scientists, literature scholars and religious studies scholars, according to University of Connecticut professor Alexis Dudden.  ""We received a tremendous outpouring of support from colleagues around the world who had not appeared on the first list, and who were writing to ask to add their names -- all voluntary as before,"" Dudden told Yonhap News Agency.  ""The sheer volume is truly impressive given the relatively small size of this scholarly community,"" she said. ""We also now have incredible geographic range ... In a word, hundreds around the world are in agreement.""  The statement, issued in the form of an ""open letter in support of historians in Japan,"" came a week after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe failed to offer a clear apology for the sexual slavery or other wartime atrocities when he delivered an unprecedented address at the U.S. Congress.  It showed how much international historians are concerned about Japan's attempt to whitewash history.  The massive addition is expected to put pressure on Abe to address the sexual slavery and other historical issues in a statement he's preparing to issue in August to mark the anniversary of the end of World War II.  Universities that the newly added scholars belong to include Harvard, Columbia, Yale, Princeton, University of Chicago, Stanford, Berkeley, Leiden, Free University, Berlin, Oxford and Oslo, as well as Waseda, Sofia, Nichibunken, Meiji Gakuin, Otsuma and Toyo in Japan.  Big name scholars include Ian Buruma, a renowned scholar on Japan; Franz Waldenberger of the German Institute for Japanese Studies; Sebastian Lechevalier of the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences in Paris; Naoki Sakai of Cornell University and Steven Vogel and Irwin Scheiner of U.C.

We work together with our colleagues in Japan to do this,"" Dudden said.  She also said she is concerned about ""a new and counterproductive atmosphere within Japan"" that would seek to limit open discussion of certain parts of history and events.  ""The evidence underlying the history of the so-called 'comfort women' makes abundantly clear that large numbers of women were held against their will and subjected to horrific brutality in a state-sponsored system organized by the Japanese military,"" Dudden said.  ""All involved in signing this 'Open Letter' are committed to understanding this history -- and all histories -- as a means to better understand the human condition,"" she said.

The upcoming annual security forum is slated for May 29-31.If held, it will be the first bilateral talks between the top defense officials in four years, as they have shunned such meetings due to deteriorated bilateral relations over history-related issues, including Japan's refusal to apologize for its wartime atrocities.Icy Seoul-Tokyo relations have taken a turn for the worse in recent months after the Abe administration renewed claims to South Korea's easternmost islets of Dokdo, and attempted to deny its wrongdoing during World War II, such as the forced sexual enslavement of Asian women, mostly Korean, for its soldiers. Korea was under harsh colonial rule by Japan from 1910 to 1945. ""On the table would be issues of mutual interest including how to work closely to deter and counter North Korea's nuclear and missiles threats and the implementation of the revised U.S.-Japan defense guidelines,"" another source said.In April, Washington and Tokyo disclosed the upgraded version of their 1978 defense cooperation guidelines, which allows Japan to play a greater military role aboard. South Korea has urged the two countries closely consult with it in implementing the guidelines amid concerns over Japan's possible amendment of its pacifist Constitution and a regional arms race.""To maximize the national security interests, it would be desirable for us to separate security issues from historic and other diplomatic feuds,"" said an official at Seoul's defense ministry, requesting anonymity.    Despite the strained relations, Seoul has been working with Japan on security matters. In December, the two Asian counties and the U.S. signed an arrangement to share military intelligence on North Korea's nuclear and missiles programs.In Singapore, the trilateral meeting among the defense chiefs of South Korea, the U.S. and Japan is also expected to take place to better deal with the bellicose regime.

In reality, I don’t think what Prime Minister Abe said was right.”But under the bilateral security treaty, which was revised in 1960 to replace the first 1952 version, there is a clause that mandates the U.S. to secure Japan’s consent when its forces operate in areas surrounding Japan, Hosoya said. “So, in theory, Prime Minister Abe was right by saying that Japan can deny it (the U.S.’ decision to send its forces in Japan to Korea,” he said.Hosoya, who has served as a member of a security advisory group for Prime Minister Abe, was in Seoul last week to attend an academic forum arranged by the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.Commenting on Tokyo’s reinterpretation last year of its war-renouncing Constitution to allow for its limited exercise of “collective self-defense,” Hosoya said the change would help South Korea’s security rather than posing any security challenge.Collective self-defense refers to the use of force to support an ally under attack.“The threat and uncertainty of North Korea is bigger than before, and that is why the U.S. has repeatedly asked the Japanese government to revise the constitutional interpretation,” he said, claiming the “biggest aim” of the reinterpretation is to help South Korea.Under the previous interpretation of the constitution, Japan’s Self-Defense Forces were unable to support U.S. forces operating on a combat mission as Japan could be regarded as exercising collective self-defense, which has been banned under Article 9 of the constitution.“If we cannot exercise collective self-defense, it means the U.S. military should bring oil, water and some of the equipment from the U.S. mainland. It would take time and will be quite costly and it will undoubtedly become a barrier,” he said.“It means there will be more damage to South Korea. If Korea doesn’t like to see the constitutional reinterpretation, we can be happy because we don’t have to provide any logistical support to U.S. forces.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","never sought tokyo agreement ,may not need japan ,not need japan consent ,diplomatic friction after japanese ,has never sought tokyo","['U.S.', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'Washington', 'Tokyo', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Washington', 'Tokyo ’s']",3,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.58837318 -0.01779858

China claims sovereignty over nearly 90 percent of the South China Sea, worsening relations with neighbors such as the Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam. Beijing is in a bitter dispute with Tokyo over islets in the East China Sea. The U.S. has been concerned about China's increasingly assertive moves in the South China Sea, which is resource-rich and includes key shipping lanes. Daniel Russel, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, told the U.S. Congress earlier this week, ""Despite our differences over the South China Sea, the United States and China have worked hard to expand cooperation and develop effective channels of communication to manage differences."" However, Russel said, ""We also underscore that the United States will not hesitate to defend our national security interests and to honor our commitments to allies and partners in the Asia-Pacific."" North Korea is also expected to be one of the agenda items for Kerry's talks in Beijing, ahead of his trip to South Korea on Sunday. North Korea has claimed that it successfully test-launched a ballistic missile from a submarine. If confirmed, it would pose a significant security threat to South Korea. Also this week, South Korea's intelligence agency told lawmakers that the North's young leader, Kim Jong-un, ordered his defense chief executed for showing disloyalty. The moves by North Korea came as five nations involved in long-stalled talks, including the U.S. and China, on the North's nuclear weapons program, agreed on the need to hold ""exploratory talks"" with Pyongyang without any preconditions to test the reclusive nation's denuclearization commitment before resuming formal negotiations.The six-party talks aimed at persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear ambition, involving South Korea, North Korea, the United States, China, Japan and Russia, have been dormant since late 2008.Since then, North Korea has advanced its nuclear capabilities by conducting its second and third nuclear tests, in 2009 and 2013.Some experts now warn that the communist nation's nuclear arsenal could expand to 100 bombs by 2020.","neighbors nervous china ,china sea worsening relations ,asian neighbors nervous china ,beijing is in bitter ,neighbors nervous china claims","['U.S.', 'State', 'John Kerry', 'Beijing', 'chinese', 'China', 'asian', 'China', 'Philippines', 'Malaysia', 'Vietnam', 'Beijing', 'Tokyo']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.07091129  0.78292024

In late 2013 Kim ordered the execution of his once-powerful uncle, Jang Song-thaek.The North's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Kim gave ""field guidance"" to a fish farm in Sinchang, located in the North's northeastern province, under the Korean People's Army Unit 810.The KCNA said Kim was accompanied by senior officials, including Hwang Pyong-so, director of the general political department of the KPA, and Kim Yang-gon, director of the North's unified front department in charge of South Korea affairs.The absence of Hyon does not mean that he was executed as the North has not officially mentioned its purge of Hyon.There is still controversy over the authenticity of the spy agency's analysis as Hyon has appeared in TV documentary footage even after his alleged death. Usually, North Korea removes records and appearances of purged officials from its newspapers and TV footage.

It will take five years and 1.5 trillion won ($1.37 billion) to build the four- to six-lane highway, which is expected to reduce travel time from the northwestern outskirts of Seoul to the border city by 35 minutes.The government has yet to determine how much private money will be lured to bankroll the project, the ministry said.In addition, the government will start work on the undergroundization of the Gyeongin Expressway in the first half of next year for completion in 2018. The road connects Seoul with Incheon, a port 40 kilometers west of the capital.The ministry also said it will rev up efforts to cut red tape in order to attract more private funds to infrastructure projects.

Starting with Incheon and Gimhae, the policy expanded to four other airports including those in Daegu and Cheongju last year, officials said.The visa waiver at Gimpo is expected to draw more visitors, especially group tourists from China who wish to travel to Seoul and near by cities, the authorities said. Since the visa waiver program went into effect, the number of visitors has surged, they added. From April to August in 2014, the number of Chinese travelers transferring from local cities to Jejudo Island surged by about 50 percent on average, public data showed. In the case of Yangyang International Airport in Gangwon Province, the number of visitors from the neighboring country recorded about 59,000 last year, jumping by 470 percent, officials said. As part the measures to provide more convenience for visitors, the ministry also said that it would accept online visa applications. In order to get a visa, foreign visitors currently have to visit Korean embassies in their countries. In the meantime, the authorities said they would also tighten checks to stop entry by criminals. The Justice Ministry will expand the passengers’ identity check process before boarding to prevent the entry of criminals, officials said.Foreigners who provide false information for the stay permit will be sentenced to a three-year jail term or fined up to 20 million won ($18,000) along with deportation. Calls for a stronger punishment have mounted, as the maximum fine for falsely filling out the stay permit form is just 500,000 won ($460).

Before being appointed in February, Walsh was the director of East and North Asia relations in the Canadian government in Ottawa, and had been posted in Berlin, Bucharest and Geneva.As relations between Canada and Korea become increasingly intertwined through free trade, immigration and education, Walsh said he had reason to be optimistic about the future. “Things are going well between our two countries, and I want to keep up the flow of good news for our shared prosperity and security,” he told The Korea Herald last week. “My No. 1 goal is to get value out of the Canada-Korea free trade agreement, which came into force this year.” Canadian Ambassador Eric Walsh (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)Last year bore fruitful results in bilateral relations, with Prime Minister Stephen Harper and President Park Geun-hye exchanging visits and establishing a strategic partnership, the envoy said. He plans to keep the momentum going by promoting corporate awareness of the free trade agreement; bolstering the annual strategic dialogue with concrete initiatives; and strengthening cooperation in science, technology and innovation. Walsh highlighted cooperation in science and engineering, which has secured a $1 million annual budget under the Canadian government’s Economic Action Plan. The two countries established diplomatic ties in 1963, and cooperate through the OECD, G20 and APEC. Koreans make up the third-largest group of international students in Canada after China and India. Canada’s priorities regarding Korea are somewhere between large countries like the U.S. and smaller countries like New Zealand, the ambassador explained. Most fundamentally, the two countries share a blood-sealed relationship from the Korean War (1950-53), to which Canada dispatched 26,000 troops as part of United Nations forces. Over 500 Canadians died. The 42-year-old envoy expressed pride in his job, following in the footsteps of celebrated Canadian ambassadors in Korea, including three who became deputy ministers in the Canadian government. “As a diplomat, I am steadfastly nonpartisan and feel more comfortable that way,” Walsh stressed. “The Canadian bureaucracy profusely provides nonpartisan advice to the government of the day, and loyally implements decisions by the government of the day.”Taking the helm at the embassy ― where some 15 Canadian and 40 Korean staff work ― keeps him fully occupied, he said. In high school, Walsh took an interest in foreign policy and wanted to represent his country in his career. He passed the Foreign Service exam while working on a master’s degree in Russian and European studies at the University of Toronto. “I sometimes feel undereducated with only a bachelor’s degree, but as people say, ‘A bird in hand is worth two in the bush’ ― I have never felt l’m stagnating in my job,” he said. “Over the last 20 years of my diplomatic career, I’ve come to appreciate engaging diverse tasks, peoples and cultures.” The ambassador shed light on Canada’s successful immigration and multiculturalism. At City Hall in Toronto, his hometown, over 100 languages are available, and children grow up in a multiethnic environment. “Our cultural mosaic has created a highly tolerant society and enriched the Canadian life,” he said. “Unlike some European countries, both liberals and conservatives across the political spectrum have favored immigration.” He underscored that creating a harmonious multicultural society in Korea would take time and generations. Regarding the inter-Korean relations, Walsh said he remains an “optimist at heart,” based on his expertise in Geneva and experience in former communist countries. He visited North Korea once prior to his posting.“I lived in Germany between 2010 and 2015, and witnessed the ongoing process of integration,” he said. “I also lived in Romania, where I learned about the 1989 Romanian Revolution. The popular revolt that started in a country town of Timisoara toppled the Ceausescu regime in merely two weeks.” Although contingencies and complications exist on the Korean Peninsula, Walsh was optimistic about the prospect of unification once the two sides built trust. Walsh’s family consists of his wife and two old cats ― Mado and Meze ― picked up on the streets of Ankara, Turkey, in 1999 during his posting there. The ambassador is a vegetarian, although not a vegan. “I like the vegetable-based Korean cuisine, especially temple dishes,” he said.He also likes traveling and plans to visit all corners of Korea. The embassy will host events near Canada Day on July 1, in addition to supporting Canadian films at the 20th Busan International Film Festival in October. The next Canada education fair will be held in November at Coex in Seoul, where over 60 universities, colleges, secondary and language schools from Canada will participate.

Hwang In-ja of the Saenuri Party. Senior citizens refer to those aged 65 or older.The figure means one in five senior citizens lives alone and comprises 20 percent of the entire elderly population, which reached nearly 6,429,000 as of 2015.By region, Gyeonggi Province topped the list, with about 203,000 senior citizens living alone, followed by Seoul with 181,000. Jeju Self-Governing Province had about 18,000 lone senior citizens ― the lowest on the list. Incheon recorded the biggest growth rate of senior citizens living alone at 24.3 percent, while South Jeolla Province had the biggest ratio at nearly 30 percent. According to the report from the Seoul City government, the number of senior citizens living alone will reach nearly 220,000 by 2030.Elderly citizens living alone cited “convenience” as the main reason for why they chose to live by themselves. More than 35 percent of those seniors said “it is comfortable,” while 34 percent said “I want to live independently.” Some 23 percent said “I don’t want to be a burden,” according to the survey from Statistics Korea. “The society as a whole should take the (elderly) issue seriously,” said Rep. Hwang In-ja. “Over the past five years, there is not a single region where the number of elderly living alone has decreased. “The elderly issue is not a matter of individuals and households. It needs the public’s attention,” said Hwang.

In what it called ""an emergency special warning,"" the communist country's Command in Southwestern Sector of Front claimed that South Korean Navy speedboats made a ""military provocation"" by deeply intruding into the North's territorial waters in the Yellow Sea two or three times a day between May 1 and 7.""From this moment, it will make a sighting strike without any prior warning at any warship of the South Korean Navy intruding into the extension of demarcation line in the hotspot (of the sea),"" said the statement carried by the Korean Central News Agency.North Korea also threatened to successively deal stronger blows to the South's ships if South Korea makes counterattacks on the North, according to the KCNA. Pyongyang does not acknowledge the border, known as the Northern Limit Line, which was drawn unilaterally by the U.S.-led United Nations Command when the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a ceasefire. The North has long demanded that the line be drawn farther south. Flatly dismissing the North's claims, South Korea expressed ""serious regrets"" over the warning against ""our ships' normal operations.""""It is not our side but your side that brings up tension along the NLL. Your threatening words and deeds by distorting facts are stoking unnecessary military tension between the two Koreas,"" Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said in a message to the North Korean command.""If you act provocatively while ignoring our warnings, we will sternly and strongly respond to them to the degree where you will bitterly repent,"" Kim said, calling for Pyongyang's full respect for the maritime border.  The latest incident came amid an increasing number of North Korean and Chinese fishing boats operating near the border.Every year, North Korea gets paid from the Chinese side in exchange for offering China the right to fish in its waters, according to officials here. Pyongyang has included part of the South Korean territorial waters near the western sea border when selling the rights to China, prompting the Seoul military to beef up surveillance, they said.""We've never violated the NLL, while the North has often done so,"" said a defense ministry official, requesting anonymity. In the latest case, a North Korean patrol boat crossed the border into the South due to engine failure. The South Korean military ""is analyzing what prompted the North to make such absurd remarks, while maintaining the strong posture against any possible scenarios,"" although there is no indication yet of unusual military movement from the North, he added.

According to a report released by the Seoul Metropolitan Government on Thursday, the number of those aged 65 or older reached 1.24 million as of last month, about 5,000 more than the number of youth aged under 15. The aging index also hit a record high of 100.4 points, exceeding 100 points for the first time, the city said. The index indicates the level of an aging society. Over 100 points suggests the number of elderly citizens who are economically dependent is increasing faster than those who are economically active. The capital’s aging index has been on the rise since 1996. The indicator stood at 21.8 points in 1996, but surged to 90 points by 2013. Seoul, which has a population of 10.3 million, is not the only aging municipality in South Korea. The country’s average aging index was 92.2 points this year, more than double that of 2003. The sharp rise appears to be related to the fast growth of the elderly population and declining birthrate, the city noted. In the past four months, the number of senior citizens increased by about 21,000, while youth numbers dropped by 19,000, it added. As the aging continues, the average age of Seoul City’s population rose to 40.2 this year, passing 40 for the first time, authorities said. The average age of residents in one district in Jung-gu was 51 years old, marking the oldest figure in the capital, they added. “If the current trend continues, 14 percent of the city’s population will be elderly by 2028, leading to an aged society,” officials said. A city with over 14 percent of those aged 65 or older is considered an “aged society,” and over 20 percent a “post-aged society.” If the elderly population accounts for more than 7 percent, it is called an “aging society.”By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","seoul elderly outnumber youth ,seoul elderly outnumber ,elderly citizens in seoul ,older reached 24 million ,fast aging society","['Seoul', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61339641  0.56038707

""Applications for the World Heritage need to comply with the principle of the UNESCO and should not glorify history of colonization,"" Hua said.Japan's unrepentant attitude over its wartime past has caused tensions with its neighbors, including South Korea and China.

The annex, situated between the palace and the Seoul Metropolitan Council building, was built by Japan in 1937 in an alleged attempt to conceal the palace, experts said. The annex has been vacant since the tax agency relocated to the administrative city of Sejong late last year. A temporary plaza will be built on the site, where a symbolic sculpture will be erected, the city said.In addition to removing the building, Seoul City will hold dozens of various events under the theme of “My Independence” to raise public awareness of the historical day. Only 8.7 percent of the current Korean population witnessed the independence day of Aug. 15 in 1945. The city will launch a public fundraiser to build a sculpture for the anniversary of Aug. 15, which will be installed at Yongsan Family Park in March 2019 to mark the centenary of Independence Movement Day ― March 1, authorities said. It will also establish a sculpture that symbolizes peace in a bid to remember the Korean victims of sexual enslavement during the colonial period.

Japan colonized Korea from 1910-45.The International Council on Monuments and Sites has notified Tokyo of its decision, according to Japanese media. The council is expected to announce its decision later this month. The 21-member World Heritage Committee is scheduled to open a weeklong meeting in Germany on June 28 to decide whether to accept ICOMOS' recommendation.""We hope that the panel will avert ICOMOS' suggestion, although it would be a rare case, or defer a final decision,"" a South Korean government official told Yonhap News Agency.South Korea expects UNESCO to consider historical background and controversy in deciding whether to accept Japan's bid to win international recognition for the facilities, he said.Japan's campaign is different from South Korea's undisputed efforts to register historic sites of the ancient kingdom of Baekje (18 B.C.-660 A.D.) as world heritage, he stressed.Besides its plea to the international community, South Korea plans to hold talks with Japan on the matter in Tokyo this month, added the official.""I think the dialogue will be held within May. An exact schedule has yet to be fixed,"" he said.If held, he added, South Korea will likely be represented by Choi Jong-moon, former ambassador to Sri Lanka and current ambassador for cultural and UNESCO affairs.Seoul will first focus efforts on persuading Tokyo to exclude the facilities where forced laborers worked from the list of candidate sites, another South Korean official said.""As an alternative, we may consider coaxing Japan into adding a description that the seven facilities are associated with its wartime mobilization of forced laborers,"" he added.

Yonhap News Agency obtained a copy of the statement.The scholars included Pulitzer Prize winner Herbert Bix of Binghamton University; William Paterson University history professor Theodore F. Cook; Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor John Dower; Harvard University professor Ezra Vogel and University of Chicago professor Bruce Cummings.The statement has been delivered to Abe, according to University of Connecticut professor Alexis Dudden. ""There is no easy path to a 'correct history.' Much of the archives of the Japanese imperial military was destroyed. The actions of local procurers who provided women to the military may never have been recorded,"" the statement said.""But historians have unearthed numerous documents demonstrating the military's involvement in the transfer of women and oversight of brothels. Important evidence also comes from the testimony of victims,"" it said. ""The aggregate record they offer is compelling and supported by official documents.""Though the suffering of victims should not be used for nationalist ends, ""denying or trivializing what happened to them is equally unacceptable,"" it said.Historians estimate more than 200,000 women, mainly from Korea which was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II.But Japan has long attempted to water down the atrocity.The sexual slavery issue has been the biggest thorn in frayed relations between Japan and South Korea, with Seoul demanding Tokyo take steps to address the grievances of the now elderly Korean victims and Japan refusing to do so.""Among the many instances of wartime sexual violence and military prostitution in the 20th century, the 'comfort women' system was distinguished by its large scale and systematic management under the military, and by its exploitation of young, poor, and vulnerable women in areas colonized or occupied by Japan,"" the statement said.It said the historians disagree over the precise number of victims, but ""ultimately, whether the numbers are judged to have been in the tens of thousands or the hundreds of thousands will not alter the fact of the exploitation carried out throughout the Japanese empire and the war zones.""Even though historians dispute how directly the Japanese military was involved and whether women were coerced into sexual slavery, the statement said the ""evidence makes clear that large numbers of women were held against their will and subjected to horrific brutality.""It also said that employing legalistic arguments focused on particular terms or isolated documents to challenge the victims' testimony ""both misses the fundamental issue of their brutalization and ignores the larger context of the inhumane system that exploited them.""""This year presents an opportunity for the government of Japan to show leadership by addressing Japan's history of colonial rule and wartime aggression in both words and action,"" the statement said. Noting that Abe spoke of the universal value of human rights, the importance of human security, and the suffering that Japan caused other countries, the statement said, ""We applaud these sentiments and urge Prime Minister to act boldly on all of them.""We waited to hear what Prime Minister Abe would say during his speeches in the United States last week, and unfortunately his one brief aside comment about this issue further brushed away Japanese state responsibility for this awful history,"" professor Dudden, who led the statement, told Yonhap.""In short, this statement is a direct appeal to the Japanese government to address this history squarely, accept responsibility for it ... and to desist from further distortions and politicization,"" she said.Dudden also said that she was thrilled to see more historians sign the statement than expected.""They are not only in the U.S, but also all over the world including Europe and Australia.

The official said the watchdog will also review whether to impose negligence charges on Daum Kakao.Daum Kakao said it will register a new terms of use if the KCC concludes the current situation to be problematic, adding it is not a serious violation.KakaoTaxi, kicked off in March, connects a KakaoTalk user to the closest taxi in the area via a mobile call. KakaoTalk is South Korea's most popular mobile messenger that commands about 35 million local users in a country with a population of 50 million.A user simply needs to type in his or her destination on the app, which will be sent to an available cab driver. The app does not require the rider to tell the driver the current location, since it automatically shows it on the driver's app through Global Positioning System.It is compared to Uber, a similar tool introduced to the local market by U.S. venture Uber Technologies Inc., which has been under intense scrutiny from local taxi drivers who have called for a ban on the service, saying it undermines their business.

It will translate the document into Japanese and distribute 1,000 copies on Aug. 6, 70 years after the U.S. dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima. The Nagasaki attack took place three days later. More than 200,000 Koreans were believed to have been taken to Hiroshima and Nagasaki to work at facilities such as the shipyards where Mitsubishi Heavy Industries manufactured warships, torpedoes and other military and industrial supplies. They were also mobilized for reconstruction work later on and so were further exposed to residual radiation, according to the document.To better promote the pain endured by the forced laborers, the committee in April 2012 agreed with a Tokyo-based civic group specialized in translation to publish 49 related books and papers in Japanese. Civic groups and historians assess that about 100,000 of the 740,000 victims were Korean. Some 50,000 of them died in the aftermath of the two attacks, while about 43,000 survivors returned home. Last week, a group of bombing victims and civic organizations shed light on their sufferings for the first time during a conference at the U.N. to review the Nonproliferation Treaty, which had so far dealt with the issue focusing on Japanese casualties. “The 43,000 returnees passed away amid social indifference, their physical wounds and aftereffects untreated,” Shim Jin-tae, a 72-year-old Korean whose father was drafted to work at a Hiroshima military base, was quoted as saying at the session. “Japan must stop distorting the history of its aggressive war and colonial rule and apologize and offer compensation to them.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","1945 bombings of hiroshima ,forced conscription during japanese ,report on korean victims ,victims in japan seoul ,conscription during japanese colonial","['Seoul', 'korean', 'Hiroshima', 'Nagasaki', 'Japan', 'Prime Minister ’s Office', 'japanese']",3,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -0.10422743  0.08677263

Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se (right) converses with Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo during a parliamentary committee session on Monday. (Yonhap)Her criticism came days after Abe failed to apologize for Japan’s wartime sex slavery in a speech to the U.S. Congress last week.Abe’s comments, that Japan’s wartime actions brought suffering to Asian people, drew criticism in some U.S. lawmakers.Rep. Mike Honda, who has championed sexual slavery victims, said it was shocking and shameful that Abe continued to evade Japan’s responsibility over the so-called “comfort women” during World War II.Abe’s refusal to apologize is an “insult” to victims and is not acceptable, he said.South Korea has repeatedly pressed Japan to resolve the issue of the elderly Korean women who were forced into sexual slavery for Japanese soldiers during World War II. Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony from 1910-45. Historians estimate that more than 200,000 women were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. Park also urged her foreign affairs team to continue to believe in their conviction and deal with history as it should be while pursuing other matters related to the alliance and relations with the U.S., China and Japan with clear purpose and direction.Park’s remarks were echoed by Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se during a parliamentary session the same day.“Although we are resolute on the matters of history, we continue to maintain a two-track strategy where we share strategic understanding, including that of the North Korean nuclear problem, and fortify (cooperation on) the economy and culture,” Yoon told lawmakers of the foreign affairs committee.The Seoul government has made progress on the sexual enslavement issue a precondition for a summit with Tokyo.“Even though Japan fails to confront history and is being bombarded with its own problems of history, this is a problem that we cannot solve for them,” Park said.Park’s remarks also appeared to show her foreign affairs lineup will stay intact, despite demands from the opposition for a reshuffle.By Cho Chung-un and news reports","apologizing to korean women ,enslavement by the japanese ,not apologizing to korean ,said that japan failed ,korean women who suffered","['Park Geun - hye', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'korean', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'the United States', 'Park']",3,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -0.25684971  0.05969715

We believe it constitutes a diplomatic provocation and poses a grave concern on the peace and stability of North East Asia,” the resolution said. Submitted by Rep. Lee Won-wook of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy and other lawmakers from ruling and opposition parties, the bill also urged the Korean government to ensure Japan stops denying its wrongdoing during its rule of Korea from 1910 to 1945. The resolution comes amid Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe administration’s years-long push to win UNESCO’s approval for wartime facilities on the World Heritage list. Earlier this year, the administration submitted an application to include of the facilities on the UNESCO World Heritage list.The Korean government has criticized the Japanese government’s move, stating the facilities ― dubbed “the modern industrial heritage sites in Kyushu and Yamaguchi” ― include 11 wartime mobilization sites where nearly 60,000 Korean workers were coerced into slave labor during World War II.“I believe Japan’s attempt to list those facilities as UNESCO World Heritage runs counter to the founding spirit of the (UNESCO’s) Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, which is designed to protect heritage with universal values,” said Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se.The International Council on Monuments and Sites, a non-government body, has been reviewing Japan’s submission. It is expected to provide its recommendations in May to the World Heritage Committee, an inter-government body.The 21-member committee is expected to decide whether to list the facilities on the UNESCO World Heritage at a 2015 session to be held between June 28 and July 8.

It also raised suspicion that the Korean government was pressured to exclude information on sexual minorities by local religious groups. The lack of protection for teenage sexual minorities has been a hot-button issue recently in Korea. About 45.7 percent of sexual minorities aged 18 or younger said they had attempted suicide, while 53.8 percent had injured themselves, according to last year’s survey by the Korean Society of Law and Policy on Sexual Orientation and Gender Inequality.Moon Yong-rin, a conservative former education superintendent of Seoul, attempted to exclude a student rights ordinance in a clause that mandated the protection of students who are sexual minorities. His attempt was thwarted after he lost the position to liberal Cho Hi-yeon in last year’s election.Last month, conservative civic groups sabotaged Gangwon Provincial Office of Education’s public hearing on the student rights ordinance, claiming the ordinance “encourages sexual corruption such as homosexuality.”By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","korea to revise sex ,sex education guidelines south ,ministry sex education guidelines ,include lessons about homosexuality ,revise sex education guidelines","['South Korea', 'Human Rights Watch', 'the Education Ministry ’s']",3,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.62436342  0.13354425

The speech marked the first time that a Japanese prime minister has addressed a joint meeting of the House and the Senate.Abe said that Japan's wartime actions brought suffering to Asian people, a comment that drew criticism from some U.S. lawmakers.Rep. Mike Honda, who has championed sexual slavery victims, said it is shocking and shameful that Abe continues to evade Japan's responsibility over the so-called ""comfort women"" during World War II.Abe's refusal to apologize is an ""insult"" to victims and is not acceptable, he said.South Korea has repeatedly pressed Japan to resolve the issue of the elderly Korean women who were forced into sexual slavery for Japanese soldiers during World War II. Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony from 1910-45.Park called on officials to clearly handle the past history.Historians estimate that more than 200,000 women were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. But Japan has long attempted to water down the atrocity.Park also called on the government to improve a system for special pardons to ensure fairness and transparency.In South Korea, presidents usually grant special pardons in commemoration of major national holidays, though the practice has long been under fire for being abused to give favors to their friends and business leaders jailed for corruption.Park's comments came amid controversy over two previous special pardons granted on a businessman at the center of a bribery scandal.Before hanging himself last month, the businessman, Sung Wan-jong, left behind a memo listing the names of the then prime minister and seven other high-profile politicians he claimed to have bribed. All but one listed on the memo are close associates of the president.The prime minister has since quit and Park has called for a thorough probe into the scandal.Park also said a recent deal by the rival political parties on pension reform for civil servants fell short of public expectation.The rival parties have agreed to pass a bill on Wednesday that would require civil servants to pay more into and receive less in pension over the next two decades.South Korea's civil service pension has long faced a looming crisis and caused a deficit of 12 trillion won every year until last year.Previous presidents have delayed addressing the issue, despite knowing the current system is unsustainable.

Under the amendment, Seoul secured Washington’s consent to carry out electroreduction, the first stage of pyroprocessing, which Korean experts have touted as a possible solution to deal with its mountain of used fuel rods. The technology is less prone to proliferation risks, as it produces plutonium mixed with safer fissile materials. But James Acton, codirector of the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington-based think tank, stressed that South Korea could only maintain current power prices by continuing to buy its nuclear fuel in the global market, due to the massive research and implementation costs required for reprocessing. He said Seoul should instead craft a long-term management strategy. “Every country that has done some form of reprocessing has found it more expensive and it adds to the costs of energy. … Electricity is more expensive in Japan because of reprocessing,” he told The Korea Herald on the sidelines of the Asan Plenum hosted by the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul last week. Despite the joint 10-year fuel cycle study being conducted by the allies, pyroprocessing will take much longer to produce results, especially as they will also need to develop other key technologies, such as fast reactors and fuel fabrication methods, he added.  James Acton, codirector of the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, speaks during an interview with The Korea Herald on the sidelines of the Asan Plenum hosted by the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul last week. (Asan Institute for Policy Studies)“To make any difference in Korea on spent fuel with pyroprocessing is going to take 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 years. Maybe it will work out very well,” Acton said.“But my big message to Koreans is that pyroprocessing will not solve your spent fuel problems in the next few decades. And irrespective of what happens, you need a long-term spent fuel management strategy as soon as possible.” An advisory panel consisting of municipal leaders, scholars and environmental activists was launched in October 2013 here to look into various options including storage, disposal and reprocessing at home or overseas. It is mandated to make suggestions by the end of June but discussions have made little progress as the parties struggle to close the gaps in their views and some civic groups refuse to participate.One of the major features of the new so-called 123 agreement is a leeway for South Korea to enrich uranium up to 20 percent if necessary through bilateral consultations. The U.S., meanwhile, is to ensure a reliable supply of fuel for 24 reactors here.The clauses could be seen as a small diplomatic coup for Seoul as enrichment and reprocessing had emerged a central political issue in the negotiations. Some had raised speculation that Washington could push Seoul to renounce the techniques in the text, as it did with the United Arab Emirates and Taiwan.The South Korea-U.S. pact appears to be “fair and good” since it benefits both countries as major operators and exporters of reactors, the U.K.-born scholar said, adding that the so-called gold standard would weaken the United States’ industrial edge and global nonproliferation regime. “If this was 50 years ago or 40 years ago where the U.S. and Soviet Union had a monopoly on nuclear technology, the gold standard would have made sense,” Acton said. “Today’s very different because there are lots of suppliers of nuclear energy. … So I would rather like the U.S. to have a strong export market in nuclear power and to promote good nonproliferation rather than promoting perfect nonproliferation and having no industry or not selling nuclear reactors.” South Korea, for its part, is also “not missing out” because the deal differs from the one that the U.S. and other five world powers struck recently with Iran, which he said was “not attractive for a country that is serious about nuclear energy.” In the wake of the framework agreement, the Iranian threat will now be “significantly reduced” with additional scrutiny and limits on its nuclear program, while North Korea will remain a top proliferation concern, he noted. “The fundamental issue is that if we don’t strike a deal with Iran, it will still have an enrichment program which will be much bigger and have no constraints on it,” Acton said. “It’s very hard to apply that kind of model to North Korea; North Korea already has the bomb. … The long-term goal with North Korea has to remain the denuclearization. But I think that in the short term, we need to focus on reducing risks with North Korea because denuclearization is so difficult. It’s a more useful step for the short term.”By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","pyroprocessing which korean experts ,leading nuclear scientist ,seoul secured washington consent ,korea study of pyroprocessing ,nuclear scientist has said","['U.S.', 'South Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'korean']",3,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.48305508  0.92265576

China’s political development is thought to have far-reaching consequences for Korea in diplomacy, trade and people exchanges, as bilateral relations are deepening. According to Wang Shaoguang, professor of government and public administration at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, China pursues a different kind of democracy from the West, one he claims not only serves people’s needs better, but is capable of solving the evolving challenges of the globe. Wang has criticized for decades the “modernization theory” of Western scholarship, which assumes that economic development will spark democratic reforms. Criticizing the theory as culturally hegemonic, he instead argues that each nation pursue its own polity based on traditions. “Three decades earlier, in reference to communist repression, the late former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said there’s no other political alternative to Western democracy,” Wang said at a seminar, “China’s democracy under Xi Jinping,” at Sungkyunkwan University on Tuesday. “But the world has since witnessed a flourishing of different political structures at the blight of liberal democracy. Many studies have demonstrated unique aspects of East Asian politics within Confucian culture.”Wang is an internationally acclaimed scholar on Chinese politics, having received his bachelor’s law degree from Peking University and doctorate of political science from Cornell University. He has taught at Yale University, as well as Tsinghua University and Chongqing University in China. Professor Lee Hee-ok, who teaches Chinese politics at Sungkyunkwan University, and heads the “Good Democracy in Asia Project,” said that Wang’s perspective sheds light on China’s aspirations as well as the future of regional politics. The true meaning of democracy, according to Wang, is that people become owners of their destiny. As to what the ownership means and its method, nations and regions will have varying interpretations, he said. The adjective in front of the word democracy ― for example, liberal, social, parliamentary or participatory ― expresses each country’s unique circumstances; China’s political style is not unconventional, as there has been a wide variety of experimentations throughout history, he said.  (From left) Panelists Chun Sung-heung, Wang Shaoguang, Lee Hee-ok and Kang Miong-sei speak at the seminar, “China’s democracy under Xi Jinping,” at Sungkyunkwan University on Tuesday. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)In contrast to the West’s “representative” democracy, which focuses on the formal electoral process and entitles politicians as the guardian of popular interest, China has a “representational” democracy, which tries to substantiate needs by having an “able, accountable, accessible and autonomous” government. The CPC’s top leader ― president, general secretary and military chairman ― is selected through a rigorous process after proving competence in regional posts. “A good government is one that works, and can respond to the actual demands,” Wang said. In advising a more open-minded and open-ended understanding of democracy, he stressed that the more important question should be centered on the good governance.He added that even after people’s income rises significantly in China, the concept of good governance will not shift toward the Western model.The way the Chinese leadership addresses demands is through the “mass line” ― equivalent to the West’s “citizen participation” ― where party cadres live and work at selected units to cultivate people’s lifestyles and living conditions.The mass line has seen a revival under President Xi Jinping, Wang said, adding that members of the Politburo Standing Committee ― China’s de facto decision-making body ― conduct monthly field investigations outside of Beijing, while lower-ranking officials conduct them more frequently.Xi spent his teenage years in Shaanxi province during the Cultural Revolution (1966-76), where millions of youths, called the Red Guards, were “sent down” from cities to the countryside to learn rural ways of life. In a fierce debate that followed, Korean scholars critiqued Wang’s view, echoing the Western scholarship perspective. “The core concern of today’s academia is upgrading the quality of democracy,” said Kang Miong-sei, director of think-tank Sejong Institute. “As China’s per capita income rises from the current $7,500 to over $15,000 mark, its democracy should move from being party-centered to people-centered, and supply-driven to demand-driven. The party should let people speak and decide.” Chun Sung-heung, professor of political science at Sogang University in Seoul, chimed in, saying that “Despite professor Wang’s assertion that China’s democracy is pragmatic and substantive, I do not believe China practices democracy.” He added, “Democracy is an institution that allows people to exercise their rights. What China seeks is a system that manages the stability and development of the state and society.” Wang, while referring to political philosophers Aristotle and Montesquieu, who warned the danger of elected officials becoming oligarchs, counterargued by criticizing the weakness of Western democracy.“Should democracy focus on the individual or the group? The democracies of Athens, the Roman Republic and the Italian city-states always existed in relation to the larger society and state.”The Community Party of China, which has ruled since 1949 in a one-party dictatorship, serves people’s needs in harmony with the society’s long-term goals, claimed Wang. He cited the high support for the government by the Chinese people ― validated empirically across age and time ― which runs counter to the notion that the government is authoritarian.The modern liberal democracy is in a quagmire, he emphasized, because citizens often do not vote rationally; the vested bipartisan structure is inapt at representing voters’ interests; and politicians are not held accountable to their pledges.

(AP)The U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Samantha Power, tried to quiet the diplomats at the event that featured more than 20 defectors. She called North Korea's statements “totally self-discrediting.”The North Korean diplomats did not comment as they left the chamber after diplomat Ri Song-chol read out a statement in protest of the event, even as North Korean defectors stood and shouted in their faces.Nuclear-armed North Korea has been on the defensive ever since a groundbreaking U.N. commission of inquiry detailed vast rights abuses there. North Korea has repeatedly referred to defectors who cooperated in the inquiry “human scum.”Defectors stood up and shouted in Korean as Power and others called for calm and a U.N. security team assembled. An observer who speaks Korean said the shouts included “Shut up!” “Free North Korea!'' “Down with Kim Jong-un!'' and “Even animals know to wait their turn.”“There is no need for a microphone,” Power said as one North Korean diplomat persisted in reading out a statement that referred to “ungrounded allegations” and “hostile policy” toward his country. A microphone was briefly turned on for the diplomats.Power continued: “Please shut the mike down because this is not an authorized presentation. ... Please ensure that the microphone is not live. ... We are calling U.N. security.”As soon as the North Korean diplomat stopped talking and the next featured defector, Jay Jo, started speaking, the North Korean diplomats stood and walked out.“They're so rude,” Jo said later, adding that she wished that the diplomats had stayed so she could have spoken with them. The U.S. said North Korea had been informed before the event that it would have a chance to speak.The brief chaos came minutes after U.N. Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights Ivan Simonovic told the audience that North Korea had shown “new signs of engagement” on human rights issues in recent months.","korean diplomats storm out ,korean defectors left argue ,north korean defectors left ,defectors and then stormed ,argue with north korean","['UNITED NATIONS', 'AP', ""North Korea 's"", 'U.N.', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'United Nations']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.88586563  0.38941824

It was the first time that the issue of Korean A-bomb victims has been raised at a U.N. meeting.Previous conferences have dealt only with the issue of Japanese victims.The Hiroshima bombing on Aug. 6, 1945 left about 440,000 killed and injured, and 70,000 were Koreans. The Nagasaki bombing that came three days later left some 300,000 people dead or injured, including about 30,000 Koreans.Most of these Koreans had been taken to Japan as forced laborers during Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule.About half of the Korean victims were believed to have died at the scene. Of the survivors, about 43,000 came back to Korea.During Friday's U.N. meeting, one Korean survivor, Shim Jin-tae, 72, spoke about how he ended up there, saying his late father was taken as a forced laborer and toiled at a military base in Hiroshima during the colonial rule.""A considerable number of Korean A-bomb victims were there as forced laborers,"" Shim said. ""Many of those who survived and came back to Korea have died without getting proper medical treatment.""Criticizing Japan for turning a blind eye to Korean A-bomb victims, Shim demanded that the Japanese government apologize and compensate victims.

They are the main characters in the stage production “Flower Petals,” recently played at Byeol Orum theater in the Korea National Theater Complex in Seoul. Directed by Lee Kang-seon, the show is scheduled to go on stage in Hanam Cultural Art Center in May, and in Guro Art Valley Theater in August.  A scene from “Flower Petals”Based on the award-winning play “Hotel Splendid” by American playwright and poet Lavonne Mueller, the play deals with untold stories of Korean women who were conscripted to serve the imperial Japanese military as sex slaves and the hell they endured in the jungles of Southeast Asia. More than the cruelties associated with sex slavery, the play is about women struggling with their own inner beings, the transformation of the self while traversing from innocence to the harsh realities of the war. Through a montage of scenes involving these women ranging from a premenstrual girl of 11 years old (Sun-hee) to a mother (Ok-dong), “Flower Petals” attempts and succeeds in showing human conditions under duress, their spiritual space invaded by way of rape 20 times or more, that is, in one day. This sort of abuse of humanity is hard to imagine for an average person in 2015, and even for Ok-dong, who views her own life as unreal. She recalls and hangs on to those intimate moments with her husband back home when he was alive. She tells Sun-hee that someday when the war is over, she will meet a nice man whom she will want to share intimate moments with. Sun-hee does not believe her; she cannot imagine that “that” could be tender and wonderful.  This document was issued by the Army department of personnel affairs in 1938, launching a “recruitment” campaign for comfort stations.While Ok-dong perceives her life of a sexual slave in the barracks as a temporary condition, Keum-soon is frantic to escape from the present. Keum-soon urges everyone to escape together, but they are afraid of what would happen to them if they are caught. Keum-soon eventually escapes alone. There are some who claim that sex slavery did not happen during the war. They say that the women were willing prostitutes who were compensated in exchange for their sexual services, a commercial arrangement rather than a forced conscription. Brothels in military bases are a commonly accepted practice in time of war, they say. The women testify otherwise. Sun-hee tells us that soldiers dragged her to the truck her mother was already on. She held her mother’s warm hand and leaned against her, until they were separated. Keum-soon talks about her grandfather who was slain while trying to protect her from the soldiers who rolled into her village to forcibly round up young girls. Bo-bae, years later, recalls that their bodies were mere military supply items, like guns and swords distributed to the soldiers in battlefields. All in all, Keum-soon, Ok-dong, Sun-hee and Bo-bae represent just four of 200,000 stories that took place over the period of 13 years of offensive campaign the imperial Japanese military waged in Asia. One only needs to study the historical records to see that the Japanese army was the primary organizer of the slavery system.By John Cha John Cha lives and writes in Oakland, California.

It was the first question to Abe during the conference.  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe giving a speech at Harvard University on April 27, 2015. (Yonhap)Abe also said his cabinet upholds the 1993 Kono Statement, in which Japan apologized for the atrocity, and has no intention of revising the statement.  He went on to say that ""women's dignity and basic human rights have often been infringed upon during wars"" throughout the 20th century, a remark that could be seen as meaning that Japan is not the only violator of women's rights.  The words, ""deeply pained,"" are one of the expressions that Abe has used in order not to mention ""apology"" when it comes to the sexual slavery issue. Another expression is that his ""heart aches"" when thinking of the sexual slavery victims.  Abe used that expression Monday during a discussion with Harvard University students.  ""When it comes to the comfort women issue, my heart aches when I think about those people who were victimized by human trafficking and who were subject to immeasurable pain and suffering beyond description,"" Abe said Monday.  The selection of the term ""human trafficking,"" instead of sexual slavery, was also seen as an attempt to evade Japan's responsibility because the term is usually associated in South Korea and some other Asian nations with private prostitution.  Abe's word play dashed hope for him to issue a clear apology when he addresses Congress on Wednesday.  Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mainly from Korea, which was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. But Japan has long attempted to water down the atrocity.  Such efforts have intensified after Abe came to power.  Abe's cabinet, for example, angered South Korea last year with its attempt to ""review"" the Kono Statement of apology. Though Japan later said it still stands by the apology, the move was seen as an attempt to undermine the apology's credibility.   His government also came under strong criticism last year after pressuring an American publisher to revise a description of the sexual slavery issue in a school textbook in an apparent attempt to water down the atrocity.  Wednesday's address would make Abe the first prime minister to address a joint meeting of Congress.  Critics have said Abe is unworthy of the honor because he has attempted to whitewash Japan's militaristic past and wartime atrocities, especially the sexual slavery, refusing to acknowledge the country's responsibility and compensate victims.  In front of Congress, about 200 people from South Korea, the U.S. and China held a rally urging Abe to apologize. Those attending the rally included a surviving sexual slavery victim, Lee Yong-soo, and a South Korean lawmaker, Kim Jong-hoon.  ""Abe keeps lying that they never took (comfort women) by force, but I'm a living witness who was taken to Japan's kamikaze unit in Taiwan at age 15,"" Lee told the rally. ""If he has a little bit of conscience left, Abe should formally apologize and make legal compensation.""  Brian Becker, executive director of ANSWER Coalition, a major anti-war and civil rights group, urged Abe to stop playing ""word games.""  ""We can't forget the past because if we do, it will repeat,"" he said. ""So Prime Minister Abe needs to take full responsibility, not play word games, but actually take full accountability and responsibility for those crimes, to apologize, to compensate victims and to be able to say this will never ever happen again.""  Also Tuesday, Korean-American organizations ran a full-page ad in the Washington Post in the form of an ""open letter"" to the peoples of the U.S. and Japan, urging Abe to learn from Germany and offer a clear apology for wartime crimes.  ""There is no place better than the U.S. Capitol for Abe to accept the Japanese Imperial government's role in crimes against humanity during World War II, and to offer a clear and unequivocal apology to all victims,"" the letter said.  ""We, the people of all colors, sincerely hope that Japan will overcome its shameful past by facing the historical facts, not by hiding or covering them up, and become a true champion in the global community,"" it said.  The newspaper also said in an editorial that Abe should include ""Japan's understanding of and remorse for its wartime offenses"" in his congressional speech on Wednesday and a statement he is preparing to issue in August to mark the 70th anniversary of World War II.

The dispatch is designed to request the members of U.S. Congress, where the premier is scheduled to deliver an address on Wednesday, to urge him to “voice clearly and publicly” and offer a “heartfelt apology” for Tokyo’s colonial rule and aggression. The text was written jointly by the Women’s Forum for Peace and Diplomacy, Korean Women’s Bar Association, Civil Peace Forum and People’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy. It was sent to U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry, Ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert, House Speaker John Boehner and seven other Senate and House leaders. The four organizations criticized Abe’s ongoing attempts to undermine Japan’s responsibility during World War II despite its support for U.N. Security Council resolutions against sexual violence against women during armed conflict. “Abe is showing a revisionist stance and even attempting to rewrite history,” the letter read. “It is sad and painful to see that the old ladies, the victims of wartime slavery, are passing away one by one without their rights restored nor receiving the reparation to which they are entitled.” They also expressed concerns over recent calls by political leaders in Washington on Seoul and Tokyo to forge a future-oriented partnership and pursue pragmatic cooperation rather than “dwell on the past.” Without sincere efforts to redress the atrocities, Abe’s speech will send the wrong message to not only East Asia but also the world and dent U.S. leadership, they said. “If the Japanese government keeps evading truthfully acknowledging and repenting the criminal act of war in the past, it is not only Japan that might fail to exert leadership in promoting peace in the East Asian region, but U.S. leadership may face corresponding challenges,” it added.

More than 200,000 women were coerced into sexual slavery, according to historians.  ""If referring to them as victims of human trafficking is intended to pass the responsibility for the problem to civilian networks and evade the Japanese government's involvement and responsibility, it is to gloss over the essence of the comfort women issue,"" Noh said. ""It can never be accepted by our government and the international community.""  As to the new U.S.-Japan defense deal, Noh dismissed a claim that it demonstrates South Korea's diplomatic inability.   Even if the role of Japan's Self-Defense Forces is expanded, South Korea's position has been ""reflected sufficiently"" in the agreement, he said.  It is not a matter of failure or success in Seoul's diplomacy, added Noh.  South Koreans are concerned that Japan's military will again enter the peninsula without their country's consent. Japan colonized Korea from 1910-1945.  The bilateral defense guidelines call for Japan to respect a third country's sovereignty in exercising the right to the collective self-defense.

But what's important is that they find ways to express it and they find ways to indicate that they understand what the concerns of others are,"" Steinberg told a press conference in Seoul.  Steinberg was in Seoul to attend a two-day forum hosted by the Asan Institute for Policy Studies under the theme of ""Is the U.S. back?""  Abe began his weeklong trip to the U.S. this week. His itinerary includes a speech at a joint session of Congress, the first of its kind for a Japanese prime minister.  During his speech at Harvard University in Boston on Monday, Abe did not provide an apology for Japan's wartime sexual enslavement of Korean and other Asian women. He used the phrase ""human trafficking"" in describing the sex slaves without specifying the perpetrator.  In Japanese, the phrase ""human trafficking"" does not have a meaning of coercion, indicating that Abe is sticking to his previous vague statement on the issue that has frayed Tokyo's relations with Seoul.  Steinberg said Seoul should place more emphasis on whether Abe is willing to come to terms with Japan's wartime wrongdoing rather than every word that Abe used or will use for his congressional speech or a new statement due in August.  ""We should focus less on trying to parse the nuance of language, but (we should) focus more on questions about whether there is a kind of reconciliation in coming to terms with concerns about the past that allow us to move forward,"" Steinberg said.  He said that Washington's role is to ""encourage"" Seoul and Tokyo to deal with the history issue, not to put pressure on both sides to resolve it.  ""We can have a suggestion ... but I think it would be counterproductive for the U.S. to try to (put) pressure on Japan or pressure on South Korea or pressure on any of our friends,"" he added.  Steinberg said Seoul has ""sincere"" concerns about the shared history and a ""genuine"" motive to resolve the issue but also cautioned that anyone should not potentially ""misuse"" the history issue to achieve other objectives.  ""What's important is for each side to really understand challenges that the other faces and try to find ways to meet their own needs,"" he said.

(Yonhap)The selection of the term ""human trafficking,"" instead of sexual slavery, was also seen as an attempt to evade Japan's responsibility because the term is usually associated in South Korea and some other Asian nations with private prostitution.  Monday's remark bodes ill for the prospect of a clear apology from Abe when he addresses the U.S. Congress.  ""Several times in the past, I have had the occasion to mention that I will uphold the Kono Statement. From such a standpoint, Japan has made various efforts from the perspective of offering realistic relief for the comfort women,"" Abe said, referring to a 1993 statement of apology for the crime.  ""In the 20th century, we have seen a history where once conflict arises, women's human rights and honor are deeply wounded. We had such a history. In the 21st century, we should not make this history which is akin to the 20th century,"" he said.  Abe also said Japan will work harder to promote women's rights.  Asked about what Japan can do to reduce tensions in the Asia-Pacific region, Abe only mentioned ""deep remorse"" about World War II and said Japan will make efforts to improve ties with South Korea and China.  Outside the auditorium, dozens of students and other protesters, including one surviving sexual slavery victim, Lee Yong-soo, held a rally, lining a road leading to the auditorium's main entrance and forcing Abe to use a back door to get into the building.  Protesters held such signs as ""Abe, stop denying! Unequivocal apology now!"" ""Heartache is not an apology,"" ""Justice for survivors,"" ""Your denial is killing them twice."" Lee, the victim, was sitting in a wheelchair holding a sign that read, ""I am a survivor of Japanese military sexual slavery.""  ""The prime minister of a country should use the main entrance with his head held high if he didn't do anything wrong,"" Lee said. ""Abe, what are you so afraid of?""  Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mainly from Korea, which was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. But Japan has long attempted to whitewash the atrocity.  The sexual slavery issue has been the biggest thorn in frayed relations between Japan and South Korea, with Seoul demanding Tokyo take steps to address the grievances of elderly Korean victims of the atrocity and Japan refusing to do so.  Abe arrived in Boston on Sunday, kicking off a weeklong visit to the U.S. seen as a celebration of the ever-growing security and economic partnerships between Tokyo and Washington. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry hosted a dinner for Abe on Sunday.  Later Monday, Abe flew to Washington for summit talks with President Barack Obama, set for Tuesday, and an address before a joint session of Congress on Wednesday.   In a surprise appearance, Obama joined Abe in an unannounced visit to the Lincoln Memorial in central Washington. Photos showed the two leaders walking side by side up the stairs to the statue of the former U.S. president and talking to each other   Abe also paid a visit to Arlington National Cemetery and the Holocaust Memorial Museum.  The congressional speech, set for Wednesday, will be the first of its kind for a Japanese prime minister and symbolizes the grand welcome the U.S. is throwing for a leader who has helped address U.S. security and economic needs in a region marked by China's rise  Critics say Abe is unworthy of the privilege because he has attempted to whitewash Japan's militaristic past and wartime atrocities, especially the sexual slavery, refusing to acknowledge the country's responsibility and compensate victims.  In the runup to the visit, pressure mounted on Abe to resolve history tensions, with a bipartisan group of 25 congressmen sending a joint letter urging him to address history issues, as well as mainstream U.S. media, including The New York Times, saying the success of Abe's visit depends on how honestly he confronts Japan's wartime history.  Despite such pressure, however, widespread indications are that Abe is unlikely to offer a sincere apology for the wartime atrocities, including the sexual slavery issue, which would mean that Seoul-Tokyo relations won't get better any time soon.

The shipment will be made between April 16 and May 9.  In November, the first shipment carrying 40,500 tons of Russian coal smoothly arrived in South Korea in its pilot operation of the Rajin-Khasan project.  The project came as a symbolic project of three-way cooperation at a time when inter-Korean exchanges have been almost suspended following the deadly sinking of a South Korean warship by the North in 2010.  ""Compared with in November, we think that the port's capacity to load or unload the shipment was improved,"" said an official at the Ministry of Unification, asking not to be named.  ""Nothing has been decided, but there may be a third pilot operation for the project,"" he said. ""We expect that talks over a formal contract could come.""  The project involves three South Korean firms -- top steelmaker POSCO, shipper Hyundai Merchant Marine Co. and state train operator Korail Corp. They will decide on whether to clinch a formal contract based on the outcome of the pilot operations.  This time the project also includes two power plant operators: Korea East-West Power Co. and Korea Midland Power Corp.  The coal shipment will arrive at three South Korean ports in early May, including the one in Pohang, 374 kilometers southeast of Seoul and a port in Dangjin, 123 kilometers south of the capital.  The Rajin-Khasan project is part of Seoul's move to realize President Park Geun-hye's vision for a united Eurasia.  In October 2013, Park unveiled her Eurasia initiative that calls for infrastructure development and freer trade among Eurasian nations by linking their railways.  South Korea imposed the May 24 punitive sanctions on North Korea in 2010 following Pyongyang's deadly sinking of the Cheonan warship in March of that year.  The move has suspended all trade and exchange programs with the North, apart from a joint factory park project in the North Korean border city of Kaesong. The three-way logistics project has been regarded as an exception.

The church, founded in 1921, served as a New York base for Korean independence fighters at the time.  The document's findings coincided with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's visit to the United States. Abe has snubbed calls for a sincere apology for Japan's wartime atrocities, including its sexual enslavement of Korean and other Asian women for its troops.  Titled ""The Korean Situation,"" the document contains accounts by Christian missionaries of pro-independence protests in Korea since the 1919 nationwide uprising, known as the ""March 1 Independence Movement,"" and Japan's brutal crackdown of protesters   ""Among the tortures and brutalities ... were those dealing with young women and school girls who were stripped and examined, tortured and maltreated,"" the document said. ""No charge is made of rape under these conditions. Inquiry as to the number thus treated brings the reply that no exact statistics are available.""  The document also said that in October and November 1919, a ""fresh outburst of torture was resorted to, with new methods not before used in Korea.""  It also showed how peaceful and persistent Korean demonstrations were.  ""No more remarkable 'revolution' has taken place in recent history than that which occurred in Korea beginning March 1, 1919. The plan was to secure independence by moral force, without resort to violence,"" the document said.  ""Though fired upon by the police, sabred, bayonetted, arrested, beaten, tortured, and punished by court judgments, the persistence of the movement has been phenomenal, and the slight amount of retaliation by the Koreans has been amazing,"" it said.  The harsh Japanese colonial rule left deep scars on the hearts of Koreans as they were banned from using their own language at schools and forced to adopt Japanese names. Hundreds of thousands of Koreans were also mobilized as forced laborers and sex slaves.  The sexual slavery issue still remains unresolved as Japan has refused to formally apologize and compensate victims while attempting to whitewash the crime. It has been the biggest thorn in frayed relations between South Korea and Japan.

(AFP-Yonhap)The Korean Red Cross will also offer $100,000 in emergency relief aid to the quake-ravaged country and plans to send nearly 10,000 blankets and nearly 3,500 relief kits containing daily necessities, along with an emergency medical team.Immediately after the disaster struck Nepal, several countries including Germany, Spain, France, Norway, Russia, Israel, Mexico and Monaco pledged relief efforts. UNESCO also pledged to provide support for the restoration of damaged world heritage sites in the country. Seoul’s Foreign Ministry confirmed that at least three South Koreans ― one worker and two tourists ― were injured. The worker was hurt at a construction site for a hydroelectric power plant in a region 70 kilometers north of Kathmandu.The ministry is running a task force to keep abreast of any additional injuries to South Koreans in Nepal. Currently, some 650 South Koreans reside in the country. An unconfirmed number of tourists were also in the country at the time of the disaster. Saturday’s quake in Nepal was the country’s worst disaster in more than 80 years. In 1936, an 8.1-magnitude quake devastated the nation, killing 10,700 people in Nepal and part of India.

A document, which was recently found in a Korean-American church in Manhattan, New York, revealed that Japanese police sexually tortured young Korean women after the March 1 independence movement in 1919.“Among the tortures and brutalities dwelt on by writers and especially emphasized by the American press were those dealing with young women and school girls who were stripped, examined, tortured and maltreated,” reads the document, entitled “The Korean Situation.” Copies of the document found in a U.S. church presumed to have been written in 1920. (Yonhap)The 27-page document explained the pan-peninsular independence campaign that was launched on March 1, 1919. Influenced by then-U.S. President Woodrow Wilson’s 1918 speech that underscored the right of national self-determination, the campaign brought Koreans together in a struggle against Japanese imperialism.The document is thought to have been written in June 1920 by the Commission on Relations with the Orient under the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in the U.S.The document depicted the Japanese police crackdown on Korean independent fighters in detail. Police, gendarmes and soldiers were mobilized to “prevent and suppress” demonstrations, and their crackdowns led to procedures and practices that were condemned “not only in other lands but by many enlightened Japanese,” the document reads.“No charge was made of rape under these conditions,” the document added. The document suggested this may have been due to women being unable to press for rape charges, despite it occurring.The document stated that U.S. missionaries made an inquiry to the Japanese police about how many were sexually tortured, and the reply was that “no statistics are available.”The revelation of the document is expected to add to the increasing pressure on Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to confront history and make a sincere apology for Japan’s past atrocities, including the sexual enslavement of Korean women at military brothels during World War II. Abe is slated to deliver a speech at a joint session of the U.S. Congress on Wednesday. Observers expect the prime minister may express a sense of remorse over Japan’s past militarism, but fall short of making an unequivocal apology that Seoul, Beijing and other nations have long called for.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","japanese police sexually tortured ,tortured young korean women ,japan atrocities emerges fresh ,japanese police sexually ,sexually tortured young korean","['Japan', 'korean', 'Tokyo', 'korean', 'Manhattan', 'New York', 'japanese', 'korean']",3,"[ 0.          1.          3.         ... -0.46007445  0.34474379

""We have done our best, and I can't think of anything better than sending personal letters to the victims, but the South Koreans are still telling us we didn't go far enough.""Such a position is not new, but the remark, made on record, strongly suggests that Abe will likely snub calls from victims and others for an honest and clear apology during his visit to the U.S., which includes an address to a joint session of Congress.Such an address will be a first for a Japanese prime minister.For decades, Japan has offered a number of apologies over its 1910-45 colonial rule of Korea as well as the sexual slavery and other crimes. But those apologies never stood long, with Japanese leaders and politicians taking steps or making remarks backtracking on and raising questions about the sincerity of those apologies.Abe's cabinet, for example, angered South Korea last year with its attempt to ""review"" the country's 1993 apology for the sexual slavery, known as the ""Kono Statement."" Though Japan said it still stands by the apology, the move was seen as an attempt to undermine the apology's credibility.Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mainly from Korea, which was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. But Japan has long attempted to water down the atrocity.The sexual slavery issue has been the biggest thorn in frayed relations between Japan and South Korea, with Seoul demanding Tokyo take steps to address the grievances of elderly Korean victims and Japan refusing to do so.Abe's weeklong trip is seen as a bellwether of Seoul-Tokyo ties amid widespread views that the relations are unlikely to improve unless he offers a sincere apology for Japan's imperialistic past and wartime atrocities.

American experts have recently estimated the North's current arsenal at some 10-16 bombs.""We certainly have been and remain concerned about North Korea's nuclear program. And we've been working with the five parties, as we've talked about, to pressure North Korea to return to credible and authentic denuclearization talks,"" State Department acting spokeswoman Marie Harf said in response to the report.By the ""five parties,"" she was referring to the five countries involved in the six-party nuclear talks with the North.Asked if the Chinese assessment raises alarm, Harf said, ""We've had alarms for a long time about North Korea's nuclear program. A very high level of alarm. That's why we have worked with our partners to see what we can do to get them back to the table.The six-party talks, which involve China, the two Koreas, Japan, Russia and the U.S., have been stalled since the last session in late 2008. During the deadlock, the North has kept bolstering its nuclear capabilities, conducting its second and third nuclear tests, in 2009 and 2013. Some experts now warn that the communist nation's nuclear arsenal could expand to 100 bombs by 2020.Earlier Thursday, Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Russel said the North won't be accepted as a nuclear state.""Our partners, along with the wider international community, have consistently made clear to the DPRK that it will not be accepted as a nuclear power,"" he said in a statement submitted for a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, saying the five-party unity ""has never been stronger.""Russel also said U.S. alliances with South Korea and Japan form the ""bedrock"" of the six-party process and hailed December's trilateral information-sharing agreement to better cope with the North's nuclear and missile threats.On economic issues, Russel said the envisioned Asia-Pacific free trade deal, known as Trans-Pacific Partnership, which the U.S. has been negotiating with 11 other countries, is the ""economic centerpiece of our rebalance"" to the region.""The most important thing we can do for our economic relationship with East Asia is to complete the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, which is also critical to the future of our economy as it becomes increasingly linked to the region,"" he said.

Today, Japan and Australia are growing to be each nation’s most important security partner following the U.S.,” it added, citing a series of bilateral and multilateral pacts and other “institutionalized” consultation channels. In contrast, the U.S.-Japan-South Korea framework has “a long way to go,” though they belatedly clinched a memorandum of understanding in December to share intelligence on North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. “In the case of the U.S.-Japan-ROK trilateral, for instance, political tensions between Tokyo and Seoul have historically prevented the two non-U.S. actors from forging close security cooperation, which in turn has prevented the trilateral relationship from optimizing its potential,” it added.Aside from the fact that it was edited by a Japanese expert, the argument triggered criticism that it undermined the fundamental difference in geostrategic significance between South Korea ― home to 28,500 American troops working in tandem with the 600,000-strong homegrown army ― and Australia ― which will see the rotational presence of U.S. marines increase up to 2,500 by 2017 and has a military of some 30,000 forces.Yet the paper was seen to more reflect Tokyo’s efforts to prop up the U.S.’ rebalancing policy through its greater military role, increased military spending and other support. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s such drive for a “normal state” rekindled worries around the peninsula that it may make way for a return of the Japanese militarism of the early 20th century. Adding to the concerns is Abe’s ongoing attempts to undercut the country’s imperial past and previous apologies for wartime atrocities on the international stage.For Washington, however, Abe in many ways sates his needs, given economic woes and budget constraints, with U.S. President Barack Obama gearing up to bolster his foreign policy legacy in the final chapter of his term. Meanwhile, powered by Japan’s formidable lobbying, “history fatigue” is spreading in the government and academic circles in Washington that South Korea’s lopsided focus on the past and lack of pragmatism is obscuring critical trilateral collaboration, diplomatic sources say. Seoul, for its part, has apparently softened its stance in favor of a two-track approach under which it would sternly respond to Tokyo’s historical and territorial provocations while maintaining cooperation on North Korea, the economy and other areas of mutual interests. Calls are growing at home and abroad for Abe to atone for the Japanese military’s sexual slavery involving Korean and other women when he gives a speech later this month at an Asia-Africa summit in Indonesia and the joint session of U.S. Congress in Washington, as well as in August to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II. Yet the prospect remains dim for any about-face in his historical view, and for the possibility of a full-blown thaw between the two old foes.“Japan, which has long regarded Korea a partner with which to share common interests and universal values, could feel somewhat left behind as China becomes one of our top diplomatic priorities,” a Seoul official said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. “As Korea remains steadfast on the historical issues, Japan may think that it will only be able to move us forward through the U.S., and pursuing trilateral partnerships respectively with Australia and India of course serves its own interests but caters greatly to the U.S. rebalancing policy ... . While keeping up pressure on Japan, we’re continuing to speak to the U.S. on the significance of history in future cooperation.”By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","japan hard lobbying in ,worries neighbors with seoul ,for wartime atrocities tokyo ,japan hard lobbying ,wartime atrocities tokyo appears","['Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Japan']",3,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.61634851  0.28916857

The battlefield of diplomacy for the second history war is UNESCO, based in Paris.At issue is Japan's bid to register its early industrial facilities as UNESCO world heritage sites. The 23 candidate sites, which Japan claims are symbolic of the ""Meiji Industrial Revolution,"" include several coal mines and shipyards where tens of thousands of Koreans worked as slave laborers during Japan's imperialistic past.""The UNESCO listing is a pet project of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe,"" a government source here said Tuesday. ""Japan is lobbying very hard to get the sites registered.""  The International Council on Monuments and Sites, an expert group to review applications, is expected to decide whether to support Tokyo's move as early as next week. It will then announce a decision in mid-May for recommendation to the World Heritage Committee. The panel plans to hold a meeting in Germany from June 28 to July 8.South Korea is strongly protesting against Japan's attempt, saying it is a ""matter of a moral problem.""""Listing those facilities laden with the pain of a neighboring country violates the spirit of the UNESCO world heritage list,"" Seoul's foreign ministry said in a statement.It does not make sense to compare it with the listing of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in Poland, which was inscribed on the UNESCO list in 1979, officials here stressed.Germany is known for its sincere apology for its wartime atrocities and Auschwitz is meaningful as a reminder of the need not to repeat such a tragic history, but Japan is a different case, they added.Seoul's foreign ministry formed a task force to counter Tokyo's campaign.It is led by Choi Jong-moon, former ambassador to Sri Lanka and current ambassador for cultural and UNESCO affairs. This week, South Korea also named another veteran diplomat, Lee Byeong-hyun, as ambassador to UNESCO.Dozens of lawmakers here sponsored a draft resolution denouncing Japan's push and calling for the South Korean government to make all-out efforts to foil it.But it's apparently not an easy task to vote down Japan's campaign, with Tokyo wielding a lot of influence over the organization with huge financial contributions and a wide web of cultural diplomacy networks.""This is not without a positive sign, though.

Wada added to growing calls at home and abroad for Abe to adopt a more repentant attitude toward history as he is slated to deliver an address later this month at an Asia-Africa summit in Indonesia and the joint session of U.S. Congress in Washington, as well as in August to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II. “While upholding the two statements is essential, the real focal point is how seriously Abe would take the issue, feel it deep down in the heart and reflect it in the anniversary statement,” the academic said in an interview with The Korea Herald on Saturday. “What matters is not only the words he picks but also the actions he would take to tackle the comfort women issue, which will be a litmus test of his sincerity.” Wada is one of the leading voices in Japan supporting the Korean and other women who were forcibly rounded up for sexual servitude for the Japanese Imperial Army during the conflict. He was visiting Seoul to give a speech on Korea-Japan relations at Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul upon a request by the Pacific Era Committee. For 12 years, the professor served as executive director for the Asian Women’s Fund set up under former premier Tomiichi Murayama in 1995 to provide some 360 sex slavery victims in Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan and the Netherlands with a publicly raised indemnity valued at 565 million yen ($4.8 million) and state-backed medical support worth 750 million yen. Haruki Wada, professor emeritus at the University of Tokyo. (Sungkyunkwan University)But the fund triggered a backlash here as a majority of the survivors refused to accept the private donation which they accused of being a deviation from taking on official legal responsibility.Wada has nonetheless continued to make efforts to bring about change, providing crucial scholarly work, public lectures and criticism against the Abe administration’s attempts to whitewash the country’s militarist past. “It was regrettable that the fund did not work out well, though it made some good points,” he said.“We should and could have looked into its legal dimension and taken better care of domestic sentiment in both countries especially in light of the concept of atonement, for instance.” Calling the sex slavery dispute a “cancer in the body” for the bilateral ties, he stressed the significance of a statement jointly issued last June by civic organizations including the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan, a coalition of 37 women’s rights groups, in drawing a compromise between the two governments. The text calls on Tokyo to admit that the comfort women and station scheme was created directly by the military, and that the women were mobilized against their own will. After Abe portrayed the women as victims of “human trafficking” in a recent media interview, some officials and experts struck an upbeat tone, saying the premier virtually recognized the system’s forceful nature. Yet in Korea, it was deemed another attempt to undercut Tokyo’s direct involvement in the conscription process that was lost in translation. “At the end of the day, it will all hinge on how far would Abe go to shift his existing position on the comfort women issue and acknowledge the government’s responsibility, where the issue of forcibility is key,” Wada said. As the protracted strain threatens to chip away at practical gains and augments diplomatic burden, Seoul has recently formulated a two-track approach under which it plans to strictly respond to Tokyo’s historical and territorial provocations while maintaining cooperation on North Korea, the economy and other mutually beneficial areas. Wada acknowledged the Park Geun-hye government’s pursuit of reconciliation with Japan yet emphasized that the new strategy should entail greater efforts and pressure to resolve the sex slavery row. “It is good that Korea is trying to change Japan’s attitude through the two-track approach but they should not sit idle or concede to it if Japan continues to refuse to budge,” he said.“The issue must come to an end right now.

468,468,[Weekender] A rebellion against perfection,"In recent years, Korea, one of the most digitalized countries in the world, has seen an increasing number of people pursue “analog” ways of life, such as keeping a handwritten diary or reading a printed book.

All of this is being done in a search for self-expression ― and an element of imperfection.  A woman makes a black-and-white print in a dark room. (Mulnamoo Photo Studio)“Koreans are seeking analog as a rebellion against perfection and an escape from rationality that human beings have firmly believed in,” said Seol Dong-hoon, a sociology professor at Chonbuk National University. In today’s digital age, technology and social media bring people closer, but Seol said this will also continue to make them feel more isolated “because a digitally dominated society lacks a human touch.”At a glance, there seems to be no room in Korean society for analog ― a term often used to describe anything old or reminiscent of bygone times. Yet there are signs of a growing trend of adopting old-school ideals in Korea, heralding a resurgence of analog habits.Yang Yoon, psychology professor at Ewha Womans University, says behind this revival of old-school products is Koreans’ thirst for self-reflection. “The digital era has brought changes too rapidly,” Yang said. “While living a life of convenience, they struggle to adapt to the changes, get lost and start questioning who they really are.” This is evident in an apparent addiction to digital perfection. With the introduction of digital cameras, Koreans began taking large numbers of photos, editing and deleting them until all-but perfect images were left. In a backlash against this apparent need for perfection, Kim Hyun-sik, a photographer and former journalist, opened a black-and-white photo studio, “Mulnamoo,” in Seoul in 2010. “A digital photo can be easily edited and manipulated to look perfect,” Kim said. “But that’s not real.”To take a picture with a film camera, there are numerous aspects to consider ― lighting, the temperature, and ambience, just to name a few. “That’s why analog pictures are more natural, though not perfect,” Kim said. “It makes every image count. And the image you capture at that very moment can never be the same as others.” His photo studio has been successful, with an increase customers in recent years, perhaps hinting at a sense of nostalgia that is beginning to appeal to many Koreans. While some tap into the old days of film photography, others, like Park Sung-jun, a university student, prefers to put pen to paper. “In modern society, everything happens so fast, so I grab a pen to slow down my life a bit,” said the 26-year-old, who still regularly scribbles on paper and keeps a handwritten diary. “Handwriting helps me better express myself and remember what happened.” Park, a so-called digital native ― people who have grown up in a technology-focused world ― still mostly uses a smartphone to take quick notes because it is “convenient and efficient,” but he sticks to handwriting when he writes in his journal. Unlike digital writing, which displays words in perfect order, handwriting better reflects his personality and emotions, he noted. “The type, thickness and color of a pen all matter in expressing how I feel,” he said.Park isn’t alone. Sales of paper diaries have grown over the past few years, with an 8 percent rise in 2014 from the previous year, according to Kyobo Book Center, one of the largest bookstores in Korea. The yearning for jotting down notes has also rekindled an interest in high-end fountain pens. Although they may be unfamiliar accessories to the younger generation, brands such as Montblanc and LAMY saw double-digit growth in sales last year. Park Jong-jin, head of the Fountain Pen Lab, credits the renaissance of pens to the generation that is familiar with a combination of analog and digital cultures. “They write something on paper with a fountain pen and take pictures of their handwriting to share it online,” he said.This fusion of both the digital and analog world seems set to continue. “As the world moves forward, digital and analog will continue to coexist, complementing one another,” the sociology professor Seol said.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","the most digitalized countries ,koreans are seeking analog ,imperfection woman makes black ,studio koreans are seeking ,most digitalized countries","['Korea', 'Mulnamoo Photo studio)“korean']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.2180748   0.7074278

Curtis Scaparrotti appears to run counter to what U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter said during a visit to South Korea last week that the U.S. is not ready to begin discussions with Seoul about whether to deploy THAAD to the peninsula.   ""I think both countries are taking that into consideration right now, in terms of the other impacts that have to do with the deployment of THAAD on the Peninsula,"" the USFK commander said during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing in response to a question whether Seoul and Washington would push against Chinese opposition to THAAD.   Scaparrotti also said the ""decision process is under way right now,"" though he did not elaborate.   The USFK commander is the one who brought up the need for a THAAD battery in South Korea for the first time in June. The proposal has since become one of the most sensitive defense and political issues in Seoul as China and Russia have expressed strong opposition to such a deployment.   Supporters say the advanced missile defense unit is necessary to meet ever-growing missile and nuclear threats from North Korea, while opponents claim mid- and lower-altitude missile interceptors are enough as the North is unlikely to attack the South with such high-altitude missiles.   ""I think this is a decision for South Korea, having to do with the defense of their country and from my perspective as a commander there, defense of our troops,"" Scaparrotti said. ""The THAAD system, if employed, is focused on the defense of the peninsula. That's what it is specialized to do. It doesn't have any influence beyond that.""   During a House Armed Services Committee hearing on Wednesday, Scaparrotti expressed the need for a THAAD deployment to South Korea, saying it would provide a ""layered defense"" for American troops and bolster the capabilities of Patriot and other existing systems.   On Thursday, the U.S. Pacific commander, Adm. Samuel Locklear, also told the Senate hearing that the U.S. is in discussions about a potential THAAD deployment to the South, though did not elaborate on what those discussions are, including whether they are internal discussions in the U.S. military or whether they mean talks with South Korea.   ""Our ability in the region to partner with our Japanese allies and our South Korean allies to bring the BMD (ballistic missile defense) capabilities to bear has been productive. And in addition, we've been in discussions about the potential deployment of additional THAAD battery, beyond the one that's in Guam but on the Korean Peninsula,"" Locklear said.   Considering its sensitivity, South Korean officials have repeatedly said that there has been no U.S. request for a THAAD deployment, no formal consultations between the two countries and therefore no decision on the issue.

Seoul Metropolitan Government said it would increase the subway fare by 250 won ($0.20) to 1,300 won and bus fares by 150 won to 1,200 won. This is the first hike in 3 1/2 years.The new fares are expected to go into effect from late June after the city council reviews the proposal. As an alternative plan, the city has proposed a 200-won hike only for the subway.To lessen the fee burden and relieve the rush hour congestion, the city vowed to offer an early morning discount. Passengers taking the subway or buses before 6:30 a.m. will get a 20 percent discount, the city said. The new discount offer will be available in Seoul City and inter-city buses in Gyeonggi Province for now, to be later expanded to Incheon, the city added. Seoul City will also extend the facility of free rides ― currently available to Korean senior citizens ― to green card holders aged 65 or older. About 2,200 passengers are expected to benefit from the new service, it said. Fares for under 19s will not be raised, it added.The city has stressed the need to raise the public transportation fare, citing rising deficit and the number of seniors with free passes. According to the city government, the budget deficit of the Seoul subway system reached 420 billion won last year, up 14 percent from two years ago. Bus operators also saw a 25 percent deficit jump to 310 billion won. The free-ride policy for the elderly partially contributed to the subway deficit, officials said. The policy caused about 290 billion won of losses last year with some 250 million elderly trips, the city said. This accounted for 13.7 percent of the total subway users. The city also emphasized that nearly 2 trillion won is needed to improve the safety measures and transportation service by 2018.

None of the 124 South Korean firms have paid March wages to North Korean workers.Seoul's unification ministry said that it will do its best to resolve the wage dispute, adding that the row may be prolonged if it passes the deadline.""As we cannot exclude the possibility that the wage dispute cannot be settled until April 20...the Seoul government will continue to make efforts to resolve the issue,"" Lim Byeong-cheol, spokesman at the unification ministry, said at a press briefing.""What's important is that the government has the will to tackle this row. We do not prejudge any situations without having a specific deadline in mind.""Seoul has not accepted the North's unilateral move, saying Pyongyang violated a 2004 agreement that calls for two quasi-government committees from each side to set the wages together. The wage cap has been set at 5 percent.Its efforts for the talks have gained urgency as North Korea will take days off on Wednesday and Thursday to mark the April 15 birth anniversary of its late founder, Kim Il-sung.The industrial complex opened in the early 2000s, the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation. It has served as a major revenue source for the cash-strapped communist country.Lim also called on North Korea to stop threatening to retaliate against a move by Seoul activists to resume their campaign to send anti-Pyongyang leaflets and other materials via balloons across the inter-Korean border.""It is not desirable for North Korea to criticize Seoul activists' leaflet launch as it is a matter of freedom of speech,"" Lim said. ""North Korea should immediately stop making threatening remarks to South Korean people.""Despite Seoul's request for restraint, anti-North Korea activist Park Sang-hak on Thursday made an attempt to launch balloons carrying leaflets and copies of DVDs of ""The Interview,"" a U.S. comedy film about a plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.

The Japanese daily Nikkei reported on Sunday that Tokyo is gearing up to sign the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement with South Korea in a move to strengthen security ties with the neighbor.   ""(South Korea) has not discussed the issue of signing the ACSA with Japan recently and has no such plan for now,"" defense ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said at a regular briefing.""We feel it's necessary to sign the pact, for example, to help in cases of launching overseas peacekeeping operations, but our judgment is that now is not the appropriate time to sign it considering diverse pending bilateral issues,"" he said, without further elaboration.The long-strained relations between South Korea and Japan have taken a turn for the worse in recent weeks over Japan's renewed claim to South Korea's easternmost islets of Dokdo and its refusal to apologize for the wartime atrocities, including the forced enslavement of Asian women, mostly Koreans, for its World War II soldiers.Korea was under harsh colonial rule by Japan from 1910-45. Japan has the ACSA, which provides a framework for logistics cooperation between armed forces, with major global powers, including the United States and Australia.Kim also reiterated the government's position that no discussions have been made for a possible bilateral meeting between the two defense ministers on the sidelines of the upcoming Shangri-La Dialogue, the annual regional defense ministers' talks slated for next month in Singapore.Despite the soured ties over territorial and historical issues, South Korea has been working to boost defense cooperation with Japan in a limited fashion under the trilateral cooperative mechanism that involves the U.S. In December last year, the three nations signed the arrangement on sharing their sensitive military information on North Korea's nuclear and missile threats.

Artistic director and former actor Song Seung-whan, who produced the nonverbal musical hit “Nanta,” said Korea’s assimilation of U.S. popular culture gave it a global identity and marketability. “Through American movies, music and fashion, we were endowed, fortuitously, a universal appeal in our modern identity,” Song said in a lecture at the “Korea CQ” forum at the Turkish embassy residence in Seoul on Tuesday. “Hallyu has spruced up Western ideals with an Asian flavor, creating a cult following in Asia.”The hallyu boom was created when Korean music companies aggressively entered overseas markets after record sales in Korea plummeted in the late 1990s with the digital transition.  Participants pose after listening to renowned actor and artistic director Song Seung-whan (center, seated) speak on hallyu’s past, present and future at the “Korea CQ” forum at the Turkish embassy residence in Seoul last Tuesday. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)“When hallyu fans watch Korean dramas and listen to K-pop, they also check out the celebrities’ clothes, cellphones and furniture. It is culture that drives the economy and elevates the Korea brand,” he explained. Song noted the stock value of AmorePacific cosmetics corporation, which recently surpassed Samsung Electronics.’ The formidable purchasing power of women ― at the heart of hallyu fandom ― is a force to be reckoned with, he said. The Korean government should spend more on culture and art initiatives -― currently at 0.6 percent of national expenditure -― to get closer to the OECD average of 3 percent, Song said.The director highlighted that as people’s income rises, happiness becomes one of experiencing life’s diversity, as opposed to obsessing over money. “When we were poor, our zeitgeist was ‘success.’ We thought that we would be happy after we became successful. But even with a $30,000 income, Koreans are some of the unhappiest people in the world,” Song said. “Our new motto should be ‘happiness.’ We are successful when we become happy.” A key to earning happiness is by engaging in a rich array of cultural activities, according to Song, who is also a professor at Sungshin Women’s University.When asked by Park Jae-woo, vice chairman of the Korean Association of Plastic Surgeons, how Korea’s cultural industries can keep up their performance from fast-approaching Chinese competitors, Song said:“The Chinese companies are not as desperate or dependent on the global market due to the sheer size of the domestic economy. Furthermore, unlike ‘Westernized’ Korea, the Chinese culture maintains a strong national identity, molded by the enclosed imperialist and socialist years.”Song said it will take many years until Chinese pop culture reaches a worldwide audience. Until then, he added, Korea can go about its business as Asia’s forerunner in the creative industry. Korea should not regard China solely as a profitable market, Song warned, hinting at the possibility of a top-down boycott campaign. It is wise for both sides to develop a trust-based partnership by mixing Korea’s knowledge and China’s resources, he advised. Praising Korea’s rich art and music scene, Turkish Ambassador Arslan Hakan Okcal said he participated in a kimchi festival, royal procession and fashion show, where he “paraded the catwalk” in a glossy and colorful hanbok.Okcal wished more Koreans would open their eyes to Turkish soap operas, like the Turkish youngsters who love K-pop. “I get lots of emails from 17- and 18-year-olds asking me, ‘Ambassador, what are you doing in Korea, not bringing more K-pop to Turkey?’” he said. “Young Turks love Korean idols’ kinky outfits and hairstyles.”For hallyu’s sustainable development, “Korean pop-culture must dig deeper and be more original, like the timeless Beatles,” the ambassador said. The event was organized by the Corea Image Communication Institute, which promotes Korean culture around the world through membership activities.

The audience watches on in fascination, with both their eyes and cameras zooming in on the scene. The venue was both a fashion show and diplomatic reception marking the silver jubilee of ties between Mongolia and Korea.“I have never seen anything like this for the last two years as an ambassador. It was extraordinary,” Azerbaijani Ambassador Ramzi Teymurov said at the event at Lotte Hotel in Seoul on Wednesday.Bulgarian Ambassador Petar Andonov said, “The show was amazing. I felt touched by the beauty of Mongolian culture, choreography and models.”Mongolia, wedged between China and Russia, entered the world economy in the early 1990s after four decades under socialism. It now has a fledgling democracy sitting on a treasure trove of gold, coal, copper and uranium, which feeds the country’s growth. The country of nomads has now well and truly jumped on the bandwagon of globalization. A new middle class with Western tastes is emerging and people are well-traveled and educated. World-famous luxury brands can also be found in its capital Ulan Bator.Models pose at a fashion show as part of the silver jubilee reception between Mongolia and Korea at Lotte Hotel in Seoul on Wednesday. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)Mongolian Ambassador Baasanjav Ganbold told The Korea Herald about his country’s multifaceted culture, which combines nomadic and urban elements. “Our embassy wanted to showcase the beauty of our nomadic heritage in a contemporary tapestry. By weaving fashion, music and dance together, the show presented powerful snapshots of our past, present and future,” Ganbold said, while referring to the work of Mongolian designers Damdin Onobolar and Javhlangiin Tselmeg. Mongolia’s experience of socialism had more freedom than that of China or North Korea, as the nomadic life required free movement across the land. The socialist legacy, rather than being eradicated, has been combined with market elements to create new identities, he said. Korea is a gateway to the league of developed nations for Mongolia, Ganbold said. Bilateral trade volume has increased 140-fold since tying the diplomatic knot, making Korea Mongolia’s fourth-largest trading and investment partner.A total of 1 percent of the Mongolian population ― 25,000 people ― currently live in Korea and over 4,000 Mongolian students study here. “Modern Mongolian and Korean cultures are highly complementary, due to our intertwined history and heritage,” the ambassador noted. “With over 100,000 people exchanging visits every year, the growing social interaction is a firm pillar of our partnership.”Ganbold said Mongolia needs more students studying science, engineering, medicine, information technology and agriculture. While Mongolia has livestock-based agriculture, it wants to learn from Korea’s advanced agricultural science and business models to upgrade its industry, he said. “People have to do practical work to lift the economy to Korea’s level. The country needs more applied science majors than social science majors,” Ganbold said. The ambassador highlighted the two governments’ commitment to the Korean Peninsula Trust Process and Eurasia Initiative, in regards to Korea’s contribution to regional peace and stability,Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul said in a speech that Mongolia and Korea closely cooperate on regional initiatives, such as the Northeast Asia Peace and Cooperation Initiative and the Ulaanbaatar Dialogue on the Northeast Asian Security. The Mongolian government has initiated some 30 infrastructure and social development projects totaling nearly $100 billion through public-private partnership deals. Korean companies have an opportunity to contribute to Mongolia’s growth, such as in the Tavan Tolgoi coking coal mines project in southern Mongolia. Chinese and Japanese companies have been chosen to take part in the project through a public tender. But the opportunity for Korean comapnies lies in associated infrastructure work, according to the Mongolian embassy.

The lawmakers also denounced Japan for publishing official documents to broadcast and shore up their claim.“We strongly condemn the Japanese government’s series of provocations to infringe upon Korea’s territorial sovereignty and distort ancient history,” lawmakers said in the resolution. “We feel enormously regretful toward Japan’s two-faced attitude: It has talked about enhancing forward-looking friendship while continuing to whitewash history and encroach upon Korean territory.” The resolution also called for the Korean government to react strongly to the Japanese government. “We urge the (Korean) government to take any diplomatic measures to ensure such mishaps never happen. We should make it clear to the Japanese government.”The parliamentary resolution came a day after Korea Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo made a stern statement against the Japanese government. He called Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s perception of history “regretful,” and warned that such attempts would be judged by history.Japan approved middle-school textbooks this week with contents of heightened claim over Dokdo. Some of the books embraced the theory of “Imna Nihono-fu,” which claims that the ancient Japanese regime ran a military outpost in the southern part of Korea from the fourth to sixth centuries.

The committee will submit the resolution to the general parliamentary meeting for approval.A series of nagging issues stemming from Japan's 1910-45 colonization of Korea remained as impediments to bilateral relations, including the territory problem, as well as disputes over the Japanese imperial army's sexual enslavement of Korean women during World War II.

William Gortney, commander of North American Aerospace Defense Command and U.S. Northern Command, is different from the U.S. government's official assessment.  ""We stand behind Adm. Gortney's statement,"" a Pentagon official told Yonhap News Agency by phone.  Gortney made the remark during a Pentagon briefing on Tuesday, saying he believes the North has ""the ability to put it on -- a nuclear weapon on a KN-08 and shoot it at the homeland.""  It was the latest in a series of similar assessments by U.S. military commanders.   Last month, Adm. Cecil Haney, commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, told a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing that he believes the North has ""already miniaturized"" some of its nuclear weapons.  In October, Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, said that as USFK commander he assumes the North has the capabilities to miniaturize nuclear warheads and that the country has ""the technology to potentially actually deliver what they say they have.""  The road-mobile KN-08, though untested, is believed to have a range of at least 5,500 km, which puts Alaska at risk. U.S. officials, including Adm. Samuel Locklear, commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, have expressed concern about the missile, saying the missile is harder to keep an eye on as it can be launched from mobile launchers.  North Korea has conducted three underground nuclear tests so far, in 2006, 2009 and 2013. The country has also conducted a series of long-range missile or rocket launches since 1998. In its latest launch in late 2012, the North succeeded in putting a satellite into orbit.  Experts have warned that it is only a matter of time until the North develops nuclear-tipped missiles.  The Northern Command, based at Peterson Air Force Base, Colo., is charged with coordinating homeland defense.

The ministries of gender equality and education announced they would jointly distribute supplementary textbooks on the comfort women issue, along with teaching aids including video clips and PowerPoint files, to 193 education offices and 800 public libraries starting this month. The move follows Japan’s approval this week of new textbooks that downplay its wartime atrocities.Scholars estimate that up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea and China, were forced to work in brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. Many of the victims, euphemistically called “comfort women,” have died of old age; there are only 53 known surviving victims in South Korea.The Korean public school textbooks currently in use only mention the victims briefly, sometimes in as little as a single sentence. History teachers’ use of the new materials will be encouraged ― but not required ― for a more in-depth education. All history teachers will also be given special education on the wartime atrocity.“It’s up to each teacher to make their own decision on whether or not to talk more about the matter using the new materials,” said Kim Jae-ryon, the director general of women’s rights promotion bureau of the Gender Ministry.“But they will be encouraged (by the government) to use the materials as much as they can. They will also be encouraged to talk about the issue when they are talking about human rights, peacebuilding and how to prevent sexual violence.” The materials, written by school teachers and currently being reviewed by academic and civic experts, will have three versions for elementary school children, middle school students and those who attend high school, respectively. All the materials for both teachers and students will also be available for the public to browse or download online. Nam Sang-gu, a researcher at the state-funded Northeast Asian Foundation, said the materials emphasized the importance of peacebuilding and overcoming the aftermath of military conflicts. Nam participated as one of the writers.“While our goal is to educate our children about what happened and what we should remember so such tragedy does not repeat in the future, we also don’t want them to form a negative sentiment against Japan as a whole,” he said. “In the material we also talk about how there are people in Japan who empathize with the victims and have worked for their rights and compensation.”Seoul has made repeated demands for an official apology and legal reparations for the victims, but Tokyo claims that the issue of compensation was settled in the 1965 Korea-Japan Normalization Treaty. Earlier this week, Japan’s Education Ministry approved updated versions of middle school textbooks that added stronger claims to the easternmost Korean islets of Dokdo while softening descriptions of its wartime aggression.Meanwhile, 56.2 percent of Korean parents said they preferred state-authored history textbooks, while 56.1 percent of teachers said they preferred materials penned by independent historians and experts, according to a 2014 survey organized by Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation. Following last year’s controversy surrounding a history textbook published by private publishing house Kyohak Publishing Co., which was opposed by left-leaning civic groups for their “overly favorable” depiction of Japan’s 1910-45 colonization of Korea among other things, the Education Ministry is currently considering whether to replace all history textbooks with state-authored ones. Currently, only elementary school textbooks are authored by the government, while middle and high school students use materials penned and published by private publishers. The ministry is to announce its decision in September.

The plan is to expand the scope of punishment to the captain and actual operators of the ship instead of just the owner.If a ship is found to have failed to maintain its static stability by carrying more cargo or less ballast water than regulated, the ship’s owner, operator and the captain will be subject to punishment. They can face up to three years in prison or 30 million won ($27,490) in fine.“In Sewol’s case, the ship’s owner and the operator were the same. But the CEU pointed out that the punishment would be complicated if this wasn’t the case, and we accepted (the proposition),” said an official from the Oceans Ministry. He explained that while punishment of the ship’s operators and captains is possible, the process is complicated as it is not stipulated in the actual law.When the Sewol tilted over and sank on April 16, 2014 ― leaving over 300 dead or missing ―- it had been carrying too much cargo and not enough ballast water for it to remain stable, a December report by the Korean Maritime Safety Tribunal had shown. This caused the ship to topple when it rapidly changed course during its voyage toward Jejudo Island.The revision to the regulation on ships’ static stability is one of the CEU’s plans for improving safety, which is a follow-up on the government investigation on safety-related corruption cases that was initiated by the Sewol tragedy.These plans aim to close legal loopholes and step up punishment for employees who may endanger the safety of citizens, officials said. They include: toughening punishment on facility managers disabling fire-fighting systems; illegal renovation on freight trucks and lorries that allow them to exceed the maximum speed limit; and implementing punishment for employees at aqua-leisure facilities.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","last year fatal sinking ,overloaded ships south korea ,fisheries revise law ,government probe the corruption ,south korea said wednesday","['South Korea', 'the Corruption Eradication Unit', 'Prime Minister ’s Office', 'the Ministry of Oceans']",3,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.73572969  0.5374133

Japan’s Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida reported the 2015 edition of the Diplomatic Bluebook to the Cabinet, which claims that the islets are its “inherent territory” based on history and international law. Seoul’s Foreign Ministry instantly protested the announcement, calling in Kenji Kanasugi, a minister at the Japanese Embassy here. “No matter how much the Japanese government repeats its preposterous claims, the historical truth cannot be erased or changed that Dokdo, which is our indigenous territory, was the first victim of Imperial Japan’s aggression on the Korean Peninsula, and that the victims of the Japanese military’s sex slavery were forcefully conscripted and suffered from unspeakable pain and wounds,” the ministry said in a statement.  Kenji Kanasugi, a recalled minister at the Japanese Embassy, leaves the Korean Foreign Ministry office Tuesday. (Yonhap)Unlike last year, the latest text leaves out the description that the two nations “share fundamental values such as freedom, democracy and respect for basic human rights, and common interests in maintaining regional peace and security,” though it still says that they are “the most important neighboring countries to each other.” On the issue of Japan’s wartime sexual slavery, it reiterated Tokyo’s long-held position that the dispute has already been settled and introduced previous efforts to appease the victims such as through the 1995 Asian Women’s Fund. The document is expected to intensify their territorial brawl, dealing a fresh blow to Seoul’s efforts to mend the relationship ahead of the 50th anniversary of its normalization. One day earlier, Japan’s Education Ministry certified 18 updated versions of geography, social studies and history middle school textbooks, most of which newly added stronger claims to Dokdo. Seoul’s Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yong summoned Japanese Ambassador Koro Bessho to lodge a protest and warn about the diplomatic paper. Kishida and Japan’s Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga refuted Korea’s complaint over the textbooks, calling it “unacceptable.” “The decision was made fairly and neutrally based on professional and scholarly deliberations,” Suga said at a news briefing on Tuesday. Introduced in 1957, the bluebooks have in recent years carried the argument as part of Tokyo’s diplomatic activities and the regional and global security landscapes. Yet the Shinzo Abe administration has been ramping up its sovereignty assertion since its launch in December 2012. It has since installed within the cabinet secretary’s office a bureau solely in charge of territorial policy, revised teaching and schoolbook guidelines and multiplied expenses for promotion at home and abroad and propping up lobbying targeting foreign governments. The drive is also aimed at better coping with Japan’s territorial row with China over the Senkaku or Diayou islands in the East China Sea. For the first time, the full version of the bluebook will be translated into English for wider distribution this year, while dozens of past official documents and news articles are to be available in an online archive.With Tokyo spurring its campaign, Seoul is stepping up intra-agency efforts to better respond through stern diplomatic measures, improved public promotion and more thorough academic analysis. Experts have called for the government to formulate a more multifaceted approach and beef up its logic especially from the aspect of international law. The Foreign Ministry, for instance, launched websites in Italian, Portuguese and Hindi on Monday to raise awareness about Dokdo and Korea’s sovereignty overseas, bringing the number of available languages to 11. The Education Ministry plans to release a new curriculum policy as early as this month for elementary, middle and high schools so that future editions of textbooks contain more detailed and strengthened statements on Dokdo and Japan’s wartime sex slavery. While overhauling the country’s Dokdo education, it will also distribute teaching materials on the comfort women issues soon in collaboration with the Ministry of Gender Equality & Family, officials said. More exhibitions are expected to take place for the public. The National Assembly, for its part, is exploring ways to support the cause such as by adopting a resolution condemning Japan’s distortion of history and taking other legislative steps to reinforce government activities and enhance public education. “We need a two-track policy that we maintain our firm stance regarding territorial and historical matters, but pursue cooperation in areas that benefit both countries,” a Foreign Ministry official said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject.By Shin Hyon-hee heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","annual diplomatic paper tuesday ,territorial tension japan again ,decades japan foreign minister ,diplomatic paper tuesday further ,ties for decades japan","['Japan', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Fumio Kishida', 'Cabinet', 'Seoul']",3,"[ 0.00000000e+00  2.00000000e+00  1.00000000e+00 ... -5.78336656e-01

The government will aim to eliminate projects that have failed to generate results or are redundant, and programs that customarily got assistance in the past.  The finance ministry said it spends some 58 trillion won ($53.5 billion) annually to support the numerous projects, although about 25 trillion won goes to programs that are fixed by law, and cannot be easily changed.   In addition to subsidy cuts, the government will adopt a ""one-out, one-in"" system in which ministries and agencies can fund new projects only if one existing program is terminated, the ministry said, without disclosing how much money can be saved.  ""The goal of the new guidelines is to prioritize spending amid tax revenue shortfalls and greater demand for welfare and other key programs that can bolster economic competitiveness,"" said Song Eom-seok, head of the ministry's budget office.  Song said that welfare and projects that can help stabilize the livelihoods of ordinary people will get more funding, while more money will be allocated to the creation of a national eco-system that can fuel growth, generate new economic opportunities and help start-ups and business ventures.   The official added that the government will earmark more money for programs aimed at helping young people get practical training while they are at school, in an effort to raise their chances of finding work after graduation.  Spending on public safety will also be increased, along with programs to better cope with a rapidly aging society.  The finance ministry also said that funds will be allocated to reflect President Park Geun-hye's Dresden Declaration, which calls for laying the groundwork for a future reunification of the two Koreas. The initiative emphasizes more exchanges and cooperation between the two sides that are still technically in a state of war.  Projects like building rail lines along the southern side of the 240-kilometer-long demilitarized zone that separates the two Koreas can be pursued, even if bilateral relations remain cool. The lines could then be linked with North Korea's railway line in due course.  Last year, the government allocated 200.3 billion won to expand cooperation with Pyongyang, with 360 billion won being set aside this year.   Other ways to maximize the effect of budget spending is to get firms to engage in public-private partnerships that will permit them to play a greater role in infrastructure building, according to the finance ministry.  The latest guidelines will be sent to government ministries and agencies by Friday, with each responsible for submitting their 2016 budget spending plans by June 5.

The Korean government immediately lodged a protest, calling the decision a “provocation” against its sovereignty over its indigenous territory. Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yong summoned Ambassador Koro Bessho and delivered a written complaint. “The Japanese government has once again staged a provocation by approving middle school textbooks that distort, downplay and omit obvious historical facts,” ministry spokesperson Noh Kwang-il said at the news conference.  Members of a nongovernmental organization working to promote Korea`s sovereignty over the Dokdo Islets stage a rally outside the Japanese embassy in Seoul on Monday. (Yonhap)“The Japanese government’s ceaseless injection of misleading historical views and territorial views into the country’s young generations is no different from seeking to repeat past wrongdoings, while displaying a lack of resolve to take a responsible role as a trusted neighbor.” The Education Ministry struck a more stringent tone, issuing a statement to “strongly condemn” the announcement and call for an immediate correction. It took issue with the absence of descriptions of Japan’s sexual enslavement of women from Korea and elsewhere, which it said amounted to falsifying history and evading historical judgment. Previous middle school textbooks have failed to touch on the issue of the so-called comfort women at all, officials say. But one of the newly authorized publication introduced the landmark accounts by a Korean sex slavery victim in 1991 and Tokyo’s ensuing probe into the matter and official apology in 1993. “We strongly urge the Japanese Education Ministry to take the lead in keenly repenting for the erroneous past and correct misdeeds through the accurate understanding of the country’s history of aggression so that its distorted historical accounts will not break peace in Northeast Asia as the two countries mark the 50th anniversary of the normalization of their relationship,” the ministry said in a statement. The update follows an amendment of authorization standards in January 2014. In addition, a subsequent revision of teaching guidelines for middle and high school students recommended that history, social studies and geography books state that Dokdo is Japan’s “indigenous territory” and “illegally occupied by Korea.” Of the 18 textbooks newly certified by Japan’s Education Ministry, 15 describe Dokdo as indigenous territory and 13 describe it as illegally occupied. This is an increase from nine and four, respectively, in its last deliberation, which is held every four years. All four geography texts and all but one of the six social studies workbooks carry both statements. All eight history books say that Dokdo was incorporated into Japan’s Shimane prefecture in 1905. Three of them were more elaborate, depicting Japanese fishermen’s activities in the waters surrounding the islets up until the late 1900s. The move is likely to dampen Korea’s efforts to reconcile with Japan ahead of the anniversary by promoting trilateral partnerships involving the U.S. or China and resuming bilateral security cooperation. On Tuesday, Japan’s Foreign Ministry is scheduled to release an annual diplomatic paper reiterating the sovereignty assertion, which would prompt officials to file another complaint and escalate tension. Seoul associated Tokyo’s persistent territorial claim with its imperial past that resulted in its illicit takeover of the islets a century ago.At the height of the Russian-Japanese war in 1905, Japan annexed outcrops to install communication and surveillance devices and collected intelligence on Russian naval movements in the East Sea. Japan returned Dokdo to Korea after winning the war, but then pushed to occupy the entire peninsula.“We’ve been closely monitoring the results of the latest deliberation, expecting that, given last year’s policy changes, the textbooks would include exacerbated content, especially with regard to Dokdo,” a senior ministry official told reporters on condition of anonymity. “While Dokdo-related content is relatively easy to assess, history entails cautious analysis before we demand revisions from Japan, as opinions among scholars here may diverge.”By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","schoolbooks japan on monday ,updated middle school textbooks ,korean government immediately lodged ,claim in schoolbooks japan ,japan on monday approved","['Japan', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Cho Tae - yong', 'Koro']",3,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -0.09067123  0.48530218

The age limit was imposed after the United States reported a few mad cow disease cases in the past.

Na Kyung-won of the ruling Saenuri Party comes as diplomatic friction between the neighboring countries has grown over the issue of compensation for Korean women who were forced into sexual slavery for Japanese soldiers during World War II. Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony from 1910-45.Meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida, Na urged Japan to resolve the so-called comfort women issue, saying that ""it is the problem that should be resolved first in regard to South Korea-Japan relations,"" according to party officials.She also said that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's address at a joint U.S. Congress session, set for April 29, should contain a ""forward-looking"" message, highlighting Seoul's demand for the prime minister's apology over the long-standing issue. Kishida, in return, expressed his hopes that Abe's Congress address could be made in a way that South Korea and the international community would understand and appreciate, the party officials noted. Na also met with Shinako Tsuchiya, the chief of the lower house's foreign affairs committee, and other politicians to discuss ways to improve bilateral ties. During her two-day visit, Na is also scheduled to meet with Japanese female lawmakers and Korean residents in the neighboring country. A key topic of discussion is expected to be a statement Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is due to release in August to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II. Speculation is rife he will not include words of apology for Tokyo's past atrocities.It is Na's first overseas trip since being elected chairwoman of the parliamentary committee for foreign affairs and unification in February.

The boy, named Adam Crapser, wasn't as fortunate: The parents he had were abusive, and never sought the green card or citizenship for him that they should have.Now, at 39, after a life struggling with joblessness because of his lack of immigration papers, homelessness and crime, Crapser, a married father of three, is facing deportation because he's not a citizen.""The state abandoned him when he was a child,'' his attorney, Lori Walls, said. ""Now the U.S. is throwing him out.''A deportation hearing is set for April 2.Federal immigration officials say they became aware of Crapser after he applied to renew his green card two years ago: his criminal convictions, ranging from burglary to assault, made him potentially deportable under immigration law.U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement wasn't aware of Crapser's childhood adoption history when it decided to pursue his deportation, agency spokesman Andrew Munoz said.Two U.S. senators, including Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, are proposing a stand-alone, automatic citizenship bill for adoptees like Crapser. ""It was not his responsibility to fill out that immigration paperwork,'' Merkley said. ""He knows no other country.''Advocates say thousands of adoptees don't know they aren't citizens until they, for example, try to get a job.The federal government does not track the citizenship status of international adoptees or how many have faced deportation. The State Department says it is aware of adult adoptees who are in immigration removal proceedings.Adoptees who didn't become citizens are lawful permanent residents - but they lack the documents to prove it. Their stories about deportation to countries as diverse as India, Russia or Brazil are detailed on advocacy websites.Many of them remained stuck in legal limbo. A provision that would make citizenship automatic for all international adoptees regardless of age was added to a Senate immigration bill several years ago. But when reform stalled, the provision did, too.Since the 1950s, American couples have adopted nearly half a million children from other countries; about 100,000 of those children came from South Korea. For years, it was the parents' responsibility to seek citizenship, but many did not.In 2000, lawmakers made citizenship automatic for international adoptees, but the law wasn't retroactive. It excluded adoptees 18 or older at the time. Crapser wouldn't have met the criteria.Seven years after Crapser and his sister were adopted, their parents abandoned them. The foster care system separated Crapser, 10 at the time, from his sister, whom he was dependent on, according to orphanage records.The boy bounced through several foster and group homes. When Crapser was 12, he moved in with Thomas and Dolly Crapser, their biological son, two other adoptees and several foster children.The next four years, Adam Crapser said, the couple choked, kicked and hit him and the other children every day, slammed them against walls, set dogs to attack them and burned them with hot objects.""Everything I did was wrong,'' he said. ""As far as humiliation goes, I have been there.''His father also used racial epithets to address him and forced him to forget Korea.""He always told me I'm American, and that I need to let go of my past,'' Adam Crapser said.In 1991, the couple was arrested on charges of physical child abuse, sexual abuse and rape. They denied the charges. Thomas Crapser's sentence included 90 days in jail, and his wife's three years of probation.Because students at his high school teased him about the abuse, Adam Crapser said he dropped out of 9th grade.He became homeless and slept in a shelter or the back of an old car while working several fast food jobs and finishing his high school equivalency diploma at night.The Crapsers had not obtained U.S. citizenship papers for him.Over the next few years, Adam Crapser struggled alone, and also got into trouble with the law.Once it was after he broke into his parents' home - it was, he said, to retrieve the Korean Bible and rubber shoes that came with him from the orphanage - and later it was for stealing cars and assaulting a roommate.Because he lacked a green card to prove he could work in the U.S., he opened a barber shop and an upholstery business - something he could do without immigration papers.He said his parents withheld his adoption record for years, so it wasn't until 2012 that Adam Crapser submitted a green card application - which set in motion his path to a deportation hearing.Adam Crapser said he takes full responsibility for his crimes, but he has ""done his time'' and changed his life.""America promised me a home,'' he wrote in his court declaration. ""I implore this country to keep its promise. If not for me then for my children, so they won't have to grow up without a dad.''

Korea’s total public and private fiscal liabilities could come to more than 2 quadrillion won ($1.8 trillion), government statistics show. The NPAD prioritizes expanding the public service pension to widen the social safety net. But its reform proposal has been criticized for lacking specific data. That makes calculating the plan’s effects on public debt and the service pension difficult, the ruling party said.The Saenuri Party stressed the need to put a cap on the growing government debt, which is estimated at more than 898 trillion won, according to the Finance Ministry. This does not count subsidies to the service pension provided by government coffers.The governing party proposes decreasing overall pension payments to retired civil servants. The plan would increase pension payments to lower-level and generally less-paid government retirees, while taking away funds for higher-level retirees.Public officials, the main beneficiaries of the pension, oppose both plans. Instead, they are pushing to maintain current pension levels, although they have expressed a willingness to contribute more to the fund from their monthly paychecks.Parties previously set May 6 as the deadline for finalizing a reform plan, but the NPAD has recently proposed annulling the date. Its lawmakers say setting a deadline for landmark reforms goes against the public interest. Any reform must be thoroughly discussed, they argue. But the Saenuri Party and the NPAD’s critics say the main opposition party is just buying time due to the upcoming elections.On April 29, four parliamentary voting districts will go to the polls. The NPAD is expected to remain lukewarm on the pension reforms until the polls as government workers are considered to be one of its largest political support groups.“I don’t know what the NPAD is thinking, but they’ve got it all wrong,” said Choi Young-jin, professor of Korean politics at Chung-Ang University in Seoul.“They seem to be playing a delaying tactic. But such a move is likely to backfire. Government workers are not going to be the largest voting group in the coming elections.“Besides, the April by-elections are not as important as the 2016 general elections and the 2017 presidential election ― two elections that will be influenced by the pension reforms,” Choi added.The pension reforms are not expected to have a large economic impact, according to an economist.“I agree that the issue is a sociopolitical one,” said Kim Wonshik, professor of economics at Konkuk University.Kim was invited by lawmakers to speak at the parliamentary debates among lawmakers and civil servants as a pension expert. “Public officials comprise about one to two million of the population (in a country of about 50 million),” Kim said.“That means decreased pensions are not going to have a denting effect on gross spending, although government spending will obviously decrease.” By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","reform drive fizzles disagreements ,pension reform drive fizzles ,main opposition new politics ,pensioners raising fears ,to reform south korea","['South Korea ’s', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Saenuri Party']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55862427 -0.01664796

Starting Wednesday, the government will begin receiving requests for compensation from bereaved families of those killed in the sinking of the passenger ship Sewol and 157 survivors, according to the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries.The beginning of the process, however, comes nearly one year after the Sewol sank on April 16 while en route to the southern resort island of Jeju.The accident left 304 people killed, mostly high school students on a school excursion, marking one of the worst and most tragic accidents in the country's history. The belated start of the compensation process was partly attributed to a prolonged search for missing passengers that ended Nov. 11 with nine still not found. They are included in the number of people killed.Last week, family members of the victims called on the government to decide on the recovery of the submerged ship before the first anniversary of the sinking.The government has yet to announce whether it will actually push ahead with its plan to salvage the sunken ship. A ministry official earlier said a study on how and when the ferry should be lifted from the ocean was still underway.The government compensation for each student is expected to reach about 420 million won ($378,000) and 760 million won for each of their teachers, who apparently stayed behind to tend to their pupils.Compensation for others, including children and crew members, will vary, depending on their age, job and expected income, the ministry said.The families of the victims are also expected to receive over 200 million won each from public donations that have amounted to over 128.8 billion won as of March 17, according to the ministry.The families of each student from Danwon High School will also receive an additional 100 million won in insurance payments.Those who survived the tragic accident will also be offered government compensation for their injuries and loss of income.However, 15 crew members of the ship who have been convicted of abandoning the ship without aiding their passengers will be completely excluded from any compensation.The 15 convicted crew members have been handed down prison terms ranging from five to 30 years while the ship's 68-year-old captain Lee Joon-seok has been sentenced to 36 years in prison.

(Yonhap)A series of advanced aerial assets that the military has deployed over the last decade have offered greater operational flexibility, which has made it unnecessary for the Air Force to maintain the geographically-divided command mechanism. “Considering the enhanced mobility of the advanced combat aircraft, there is no need to maintain regional Air Force commands as we have done in the past,” an Air Force official said, declining to be named.The decision for the change was made at a session of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Council last Friday, which was presided over by JCS Chairman Adm. Choi Yun-hee. The Air Combat Command will be stationed in Daegu, while the Air Mobility & Reconnaissance Command will be based in Osan. Each of the new commands is to be headed by a two-star commander. The Air Force will test-run the new structure from July and fully introduce it from January next year.“As it is a reorganization of the command structure to enhance operational efficiency, there is no need to increase troops or budgets for the new commands,” said the official.The need for an overhaul of the command structure has been raised for quite some time with officials and experts arguing that in a small operational zone on the Korean Peninsula, dividing the commanding structure according to region is not suitable for optimal aerial operations.In an emergency, both F-15K fighters, based in Daegu, and KF-16s, based in Seosan, are to be mobilized for the same mission, which means the function-based command structure would be better to cope with aerial threats rather than having specific commands take charge of certain regions.The change in the command structure has been caused mainly by Seoul’s recent and future procurement of a series of advanced Air Force assets including airborne command and control aircraft, all of which have increased operational mobility and flexibility, and decreased the need to divide operational areas according to region.The South Korean military plans to introduce refueling tankers, high-altitude and low-altitude unmanned reconnaissance aircraft and stealth fighter jets, which will increase the need for a function-based command structure.“When we first created the regional commands, there were only fighter jets and little need to focus on the functions of aerial assets. But now, we need to reorganize the command structure into a function-oriented one,” an Air Force official told The Korea Herald, declining to be named.The reorganization plan is also designed to streamline the overall command structure and remove any overlapping functions among regional commands.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","air force to revamp ,tuesday under the reorganization ,better incorporate new weapons ,incorporate new weapons systems ,air force said tuesday","['south korean', 'the Air Force ’s', 'the Air Force', 'the Air Force ’s Southern', 'Northern Combat Commands', 'the Air Combat Command', 'the Air Mobility & Reconnaissance Command']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62531191  0.7326616

Observers expect his visit to set the stage for the allies’ official consultations over the THAAD issue. U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter. (AFP)Cater is to hold talks with South Korea’s Defense Minister Han Min-koo on the second day of his visit over such pending issues as North Korea’s persistent nuclear and missile threats, and the allies’ efforts to implement the “conditions-based” transition of wartime operational control.Seoul’s Defense Ministry dismissed the speculation that Carter and Han would touch on the THAAD issue as part of their talks’ official agenda.“Secretary Carter will visit Seoul to meet with South Korean officials for the first time since his inauguration (last month),” ministry spokesperson Kim Min-seok told reporters.“As the U.S. has yet to determine whether to deploy a THAAD battery to the U.S. Forces Korea here, that issue is not on the agenda for the talks (between Han and Carter).”Carter is seen to be in favor of strengthening missile defense against North Korea. During his confirmation hearing last Month, he vowed to use a “full range of capabilities” against missiles and weapons of mass destruction from the communist state, stressing that they pose a direct threat to the U.S. The THAAD issue has been one of the hottest diplomatic issues as China has explicitly expressed its opposition to THAAD. Beijing argues that THAAD could undermine its security interests, although the U.S. defends it as a defensive system to intercept North Korea’s ballistic missiles.Seoul has so far taken a cautious stance, arguing that there has been no request from the U.S., no official consultations over the issue and no decision reached yet.Touching on the public concerns over Seoul being put in a tricky diplomatic position over the potential deployment of THAAD, President Park Geun-hye said in a meeting with her aides that Seoul would make its decision “prudently based on a comprehensive analysis of various pieces of information.”Should the allies’ defense chiefs not discuss the THAAD issue at their meeting early next month, the allies could also discuss it at their Integrated Defense Dialogue in Washington slated for mid-April, observers say.The THAAD is a core element of the U.S.’ multilayered missile defense program. It is designed to intercept short-, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles at altitudes of 40 to 150 km during the final phase of their flight, after detecting them with a radar system with a maximum range of about 1,800 km.The U.S. plans to complete its deployment of seven THAAD batteries in the U.S. mainland, Guam and foreign locations that may include South Korea, Japan and the UAE. One THAAD battery consists of six truck-mounted launchers, 48 interceptors, an air-transportable radar system and a fire and communications element.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","south korea from april ,april 11 for talks ,talks with seoul officials ,defense ministry said tuesday ,in april defense secretary","['U.S.', 'Ashton Carter', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Seoul ’s Defense Ministry', 'U.S.', 'Terminal High - Altitude Area Defense', 'Korea']",3,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.69189388  0.47923931

He has been under growing international pressure to tone down his revisionist views and present a more repentant attitude to Japan’s wartime history. But skepticism persists over any sweeping turnaround in his approach in light of his elusive remarks on sensitive historical issues, namely Tokyo’s sexual enslavement of Korean and other Asian women during the war. In an interview last week with the Washington Post, the premier displayed sympathy and claimed to uphold the positions of his predecessors, some of whom offered apologies to the sex slavery victims, saying many women’s human rights were violated under conflict and pledging efforts to prevent it in the 21st century. Nonetheless, he once again attempted to whitewash the forced nature of the recruitment system by describing the so-called comfort women as victims of “human trafficking.” Though trafficking indicates the involvement of some form of coercion, Abe’s comments are primarily in line with the Japanese right-wing denial of its government’s immediate participation, and the assertion that the women involved were rounded up by their own family or private contractors. He also failed to identify the traffickers and purpose of sexual servitude. Such attempts frustrate South Korea, which is seeking a long-overdue reconciliation with the old foe following years of spats and tit-for-tat diplomatic actions. With the sex slavery issue being a must for a bilateral thaw, Seoul is taking a detour: trilateral cooperation including Beijing. The three countries held their first foreign ministers’ meeting in three years last week in Seoul and agreed to arrange a three-way summit “at the earliest possible date.” President Park Geun-hye had a brief encounter with Abe on the margins of the funeral for the late Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in the island country Sunday, during which the two leaders concurred on the need for follow-up measures for the trilateral talks. “As we created rare, crucial momentum through the tripartite ministerial meeting, we should bring the summit to pass,” South Korea’s Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said at a conference of chiefs of missions Monday, quoting the proverb, “strike while the iron is hot.” The upcoming speeches appear to have little chance of bringing about a significant change in Abe’s management of Japan’s history or Tokyo’s sudden concessions in its drawn-out sex slavery negotiations with Seoul. Given international criticism about his revisionist push, however, Abe may be compelled to express a more forward-looking position toward wartime atrocities in Washington and the anniversary statement, some observers say. Another potential burden is the fact that he will be the first Japanese premier in history to address a joint session of the U.S. Congress. In 2006, then-Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi pursued a congressional speech, but it did not materialize amid stiff resistance by some senior lawmakers over his historical perception and record of visiting the controversial Yasukuni war shrine. Domestic interests could also hold sway. A telephone survey conducted in Japan by Kyodo News over the weekend showed that 54.6 percent of the respondents said Abe should express regret and apologize for the country’s colonial rule and aggression when it celebrates the anniversary in August, whereas 30.5 percent opposed. “Despite Abe’s deep conservative belief and hawkish character, he could be realistic in terms of dealing with historical issues, taking every internal and external factor into account when delivering the addresses. The level of the messages may not meet our expectations, but it could facilitate a compromise on the sex slavery issue later on,” a Seoul official said on condition of anonymity, due to the sensitivity of the matter.

Chun's visit was in return for one made by then-Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone a year earlier.Seoul delivered its stance to Japan that the Japanese emperor should make remarks containing an expression of deep regret or an apology for Japan's colonial rule and such comments should be made officially, according to the documents.The documents showed that Japan also believed it was ""inevitable"" for the emperor to make such comments at that time.But as Tokyo claimed that the contents of the remarks were not the subject of a diplomatic compromise, Seoul took the stance of remaining calm.""It is very regrettable that there was a miserable history between the two countries during that time of this century and such a history should not be repeated,"" the documents quoted then-Japanese Emperor Hirohito as saying at a welcoming dinner on Sept. 6, 1984.It marked the first time that a Japanese emperor, a symbolic figure of Japan's colonial rule, made such comments on the shared history.""It is meaningful that the Japanese emperor expressed regret for Japan's (wartime) history when meeting with the South Korean president,"" the Seoul government said at that time, according to the documents.Every year, Seoul's foreign ministry reveals diplomatic documents that were produced more than 30 years earlier after they have been reviewed. This year's documents were mostly written in1984 under the government of Chun, who took power through a military coup in 1979.

Shinzo Abe (Yonhap)That dampened hope for a clear apology from Abe when he addresses the U.S. Congress.""On the question of comfort women, when my thought goes to these people, who have been victimized by human trafficking and gone through immeasurable pain and suffering beyond description, my heart aches,"" Abe said in the interview held Thursday.""And on this point, my thought has not changed at all from previous prime ministers. Hitherto in history, many wars have been waged. In this context, women's human rights were violated. My hope is that the 21st century will be the first century where there will be no violation of human rights,"" he said.These remarks were similar to a previous Abe statement on the issue, in which he only said without issuing an apology that he was ""deeply pained to think of the comfort women."" Rather than such vague statements, critics have said Japan should issue a clear apology as the perpetrator.Abe also said during the interview that his cabinet upholds the position on the recognition of history of the previous administrations, in its entirety, including the Murayama Statement in which the country apologized for the imperialistic past.He also said his government is not reviewing the Kono Statement of apology for the sexual slavery.Abe will become the first Japanese prime minister to address a joint session of Congress.Critics have claimed that Abe is not worthy of the honor because he has attempted to whitewash Japan's militaristic past and wartime atrocities, especially the sexual slavery issue, while refusing to acknowledge the country's responsibility and compensate victims.Korean-American organizations have campaigned against such an address by Abe and collected thousands of signatures. They also ran a full-page advertisement in a Washington-based newspaper demanding Abe apologize for the sexual slavery issue before speaking before Congress.Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mainly from Korea, which was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. But Japan has long attempted to whitewash the atrocity.The sexual slavery issue has been the biggest thorn in frayed relations between Japan and South Korea, with Seoul demanding Japan take steps to address the grievances of elderly Korean victims of the atrocity and Japan refusing to do so.

It is also the end of months of preparations. However, for many Koreans the wedding is neither the beginning nor an end. While many aspects of Korean society has undergone rapid changes, and westernization since the Korean War, weddings and marriages continue to be influenced by traditional values and customs more than other areas of life. (123rf)For a wedding to occur, the would-be bride and groom must first arrange a formal meeting between their parents. If the potentially awkward meeting goes well, and both families approve of the match, they discuss the date.This, however, often requires the couple to have passed a superstitious hurdle. Many Koreans still place much value in “gunghap,” the evaluation of the couple’s compatibility based on the time and date of the couple’s dates of birth. Once the happy couple is over such hurdles, then comes the matter of picking the venue. Wedding venues range from religious facilities to hotels and wedding halls. Wedding halls, which mostly host “Western style” weddings, are reminiscent of an assembly line where weddings are held in rapid succession.The cost of holding a wedding ceremony is as varied as the type of venues, ranging from negligible to hundreds of millions of won.Once the date and venue are set, there comes the step of exchanging gifts between the families. Although it varies from family to family, the gifts demanded by the groom’s family can range from hefty to the ridiculous. And the scale of the dowry is proportional to the groom’s qualifications.While the dowry traditionally consists of gifts, it is not uncommon for the goods to be replaced with actual cash.For example, it is not unheard of for the family of a groom who is a judge to demand hundreds of millions of won, if not a billion. “(The groom’s family) demanded 1 billion won ($906,000) from my father,” said a 31-year old woman who recently broke off her wedding declining to be named. However, this process may be the “norm” but it is far from standard. The vast majority of people keep the gifts within ranges they can manage or cut it down to a symbolic gesture. But even after this, the expenditure involved in arranging a wedding, and a marriage, is not over. Traditionally, the groom is required to provide the housing – rented or purchased – while the bride’s family provides the appliances, furniture and other items that the couple will use. As with the dowry, the price of the housing and the amount of goods the bride brings can be a source of conflict, and in extreme cases, break-up. Such complicated, and some antiquated, processes are driving more and more couples to opt for small weddings witnessed only by a small number of close family and friends, with dowries and other material aspects often reduced to the minimum. Still others, who find the struggles involved in the process too much to bear, are opting to stay single. The difficulties in finding a job –- a prerequisite for marriage in Korea -- and finding a suitable partner and the burdens that come after marriage are forcing more people to take this route.So many young people are taking this path so that a new term, “sampo generation,” has been coined.The word “sampo” is a combination of the Korean words for “three” and “forfeit,” and refers to those who have given up dating, marrying and having a baby. However, this is not the norm. Nor is everyone deterred.“I married right after my husband was discharged from the Army, and while I had worked for a number of years, he had only just begun working and had very little savings,” Kim, a 38-year old office worker said. She married in 2003 and now has two children and one on the way.“Of course it would have been great if we had lots of money, but we are doing fine. Really, I don’t see why kids today say they are giving up marriage when they have not even tried it.” By Choi He-suk (cheesuk@heraldcorp.com)","many koreans the wedding ,the korean war weddings ,koreans the wedding is ,marriage wedding typically marks ,korean war weddings","['Koreans', 'korean']",3,"[ 0.00000000e+00  0.00000000e+00  1.00000000e+00 ... -4.19947892e-01

What was once widely construed as the culmination of love and happiness, wedding ceremonies have become a commercialized extravaganza in Korea, often forcing couples to seek financial support from parents and take loans from banks. Down the long list of things to tick off for a wedding these days are dowry, a studio photoshoot, bridal gown rental, professional makeup and banquet hall reservation. This can all stack up to a sum that chokes up many eligible bachelors and bachelorettes. Not to mention the indistinguishable ceremonies being a let-down for those who beg to differ.Amid growing concerns over the overheating wedding industry, some couples delay marriage until they are financially ready, while some diverge from the norm and opt for nuptials that are more personalized and affordable. One of the latter, Kim Young-woo and Ha Mi-hyo, decided to avoid the standardized package wedding and take matters into their own hands ― without the help of hotel caterers and Vera Wang dresses. Self-pronounced travel addicts, Kim and Ha met each other for the first time in India in 2001. They dated for 11 years before finally deciding to tie the knot in December 2013. What set them apart from other couples was that instead of making a reservation for a cookie-cutter wedding hall, they booked flights for a 40 day-long trip to Latin America. Their self-wedding portraits taken against the arresting backdrops of Bolivia and Peru quickly drew the attention of other Korean couples. In an interview with The Korea Herald, Kim and Ha likened conventional weddings to carnival cutouts, referencing the large stand-up paintings in amusement parks where people can stick their head out of the hole to get a body of a gorilla or Marilyn Monroe. “We went to several weddings together where the bride and the groom didn’t appear to be enjoying their own ceremony. They were only putting up with the show because it was something everyone else was doing,” Kim said. For Kim and Ha, newlywed couples faded into a pretty blur at identical wedding services. Seeing the picture-perfect weddings degraded into a cliche, the well-traveled couple mapped out their own wedding plan.“We married to come up with an excuse to go to South America,” Ha said with a laugh. “We reserved a room at a Japanese restaurant for our family, who were our only guests, and gave a presentation of photos from our dating years. My brother-in-law sang for us and our parents read us letters. Then we took off on a plane.”The pared-down wedding was intimate and meaningful. Furthermore, it only cost what a regular meal for that number of people would.But not everyone was supportive of their decision to forego the standard wedding. Ha’s two elder sisters, both married and one with children, were fretful. “In the beginning they worried for us, saying that a bigger wedding has to take place to proclaim our lawful bondage. But we assured them that what other people thought of us didn’t matter with our happiness,” Kim said. “Since we didn’t have an overblown nuptial to declare our marriage, we had to at least have good photos to commemorate our union.”Ha purchased a white minidress and veil, which cost her a moderate 100,000 won ($90), and wore it throughout the trip in front of monumental sites. In some locations, people handed her flowers to go with her bridal outfit. The outcome was breathtaking photos of the couple at Bolivia’s Uyuni salt lake desert and Peru’s Machu Picchu, and snapshots around Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, Chile and Argentina. The couple said traveling together also led to unexpected situations, which enabled them to see each other in a new light, jointly tackle problems and build shared memories.“After seeing our photos a friend of mine told me that he envied my wedding,” Kim said. “He too had wanted a smaller ceremony and an adventurous honeymoon, but he couldn’t convince his parents, nor his future wife.” Kim said it requires a certain kind of courage to take a road less traveled, but blindly following someone else’s footsteps in the hopes of finding happiness is something to be wary of. “I’m not saying our way of a wedding is better. All I’m saying is that it’s important to live your life your way without being scared of what others will say,” he said. The couple’s next joint dream is also directed toward a road less traveled: embarking on a trip around the world.By Lim Jeong-yeo and Hong Hye-jin(kaylalim@heraldcorp.com) (honghyejin@heraldcorp.com)","korea often forcing couples ,defied cookie cutter weddings ,travel addicts defied cookie ,addicts defied cookie cutter ,sad get thee wife","['thou', 'Shakespeare', 'Korea']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.72493428  0.49456081

The AIIB stakes for regional and non-regional members, as well as minimum shares allocated to smaller countries, will also be factors that affect South Korea's eventual holding, it said.Excluding China, South Korea ranks No. 2 in terms of GDP size among the Asian members, although this may fall one notch if Australia opts to join.""By joining the AIIB before the March 31 deadline, Seoul is now in a position to put forward its views on various issues and take advantage of the premium offered to all founding members,"" Choi Hee-nam, deputy minister of international affairs at the ministry, said.Guidelines and charters for the bank's operation and the related anex are due to be determined before the end of June.Talks are expected to focus on the voting rights of each country that will have influence in the bank. Emphasis will likely be placed on who gets to sit on the board and the prospective locations of some of the AIIB's regional offices. The headquarters of the bank will be located in Beijing.The ministry said that while some concerns still linger about the governance structure and transparency of the AIIB, progress has been made.Last year, there were speculations that China would have the final say on all decisions made by the investment bank, but through negotiations, this authority has been transferred to the board of directors, which will not be so easily swayed by a single country, the ministry said.The fact that China may not foot 50 percent of the authorized capital could further weaken that country's influence, it said. The AIIB expects some 35 countries to become founding members.Other officials said China has pledged to address the so-called safeguard issue such as environmental protection, labor and women's rights when the final agreement is forged.On past talks with the United States, which had expressed serious reservations about its allies joining the AIIB, a ministry official said there have been talks on all fronts and at all levels from the finance minister down to working-level general directors.""Washington has said that the final decision rests with Seoul, and they have even acknowledged that there are investment-related demands that South Korean companies have the capability to meet,"" the official said.He explained that North Korea could receive future funding from the AIIB if a motion is passed by a general meeting of its shareholders. The country, however, cannot join the infrastructure bank because it is not a member of the ADB or World Bank, which is one of the prerequisites for membership.

""The U.S. puts significance on its alliance with Seoul in terms of strategic values ... So I'd like to say that we deserve to have more confidence.""The Seoul-Tokyo ties have plunged to their lowest level in recent years as Japan is reluctant to apologize for its sexual enslavement of Korean women for its troops during World War II.Historians estimate the number of sex slaves at 200,000 with only 53 South Korean victims still alive.The U.S. seeks to strengthen trilateral security cooperation between Washington, Seoul and Tokyo in an apparent bid to keep a rising China in check. But experts said the long-stained Seoul-Tokyo ties may hamper Washington's efforts.Recently, controversy flared up in Seoul as U.S. Undersecretary of State Wendy Sherman last month made remarks seen as taking sides with Japan in a sensitive historical row.Seemingly targeted at Seoul and Beijing, she said political leaders should not try to exploit nationalist feelings and ""earn cheap applause by vilifying a former enemy."" Later, the U.S. sought to calm an upset South Korea, saying that Tokyo's wartime sexual enslavement of women was a terrible violation of human rights.Ahn rejected such speculation over Washington's exhaustion over the matter, taking U.S. President Barack Obama's remarks about the sex slavery as an example.During his visit to Seoul in April 2014, Obama called Japan's use of sex slavery a ""terrible and egregious violation of human rights.""""If we have too much interest, our excessive anxiety or unduly worries over the history issue could even bring about fatigue that does not exist in the U.S.,"" Ahn said.Japan has intensified its moves to whitewash its wartime atrocities since Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took office in late 2012.In June, Japan reviewed its previous apology over the sex slaves, known as the Kono Statement, saying that the outcome was a political compromise between the two countries.A group of Japanese historians demanded U.S. publisher McGraw-Hill revise the description of Japan's sexual enslavement of women during World War II in a textbook, claiming there are grave errors in the textbook.In early February, a group of American history scholars expressed strong protest against Japan's attempts, saying that no government should have the right to ""censor history.""

The advertisement comes a month before Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is expected to deliver a speech at a joint session of the U.S. Congress during his visit to the U.S. slated for April 26 to May 2. YTN, a local cable news channel, reports on Tokyo’s two-minute advertisement in which the country highlights the positive aspects of Japan’s post-war role in Asia.Analysts say the video clip appears to be intended to highlight the positive aspects of Japan’s postwar role in Asia to counter growing opposition from Korean- and Chinese-Americans to Abe’s planned speech, which they assume will not carry any expressions of atonement for Japan’s wartime atrocities.The clip was produced by Japan’s Foreign Ministry and claims that Tokyo helped lay the foundation for the economic development of South Korea, China, India, Sri Lanka and other Asian countries, without mentioning any of the damage Japan inflicted on them at the height of its militarism.“With the 1951 San Francisco Peace treaty, Japan returned to the international community and in 1954, started providing economic assistance to Asian countries,” the clip said, referring to the treaty of Japan’s postwar settlements with allied powers. “It encouraged the steady flow of private investments, including those of Japanese firms, bringing sustainable growth to the region.”Japan pointed to specific cases where it assisted in Korea’s infrastructure development, including Subway Line 1 in Seoul, a steel plant in the southeastern port city of Pohang and the Soyang River Dam in Gangwon Province. It also touched on the construction of hydropower plants in Myanmar and Indonesia; harbors in China and Sri Lanka; and a water supply system in Cambodia.Calling the clip a distortion of history, critics in Korea argued that Japan’s description of its support for infrastructure played down the grueling industrialization efforts each Asian country made to become economically advanced. They also said Tokyo misrepresented its postwar compensation as voluntary financial assistance to Asian countries.The content of the advertisement gives a glimpse into what Abe might say in his speech slated for April 29 at the U.S. Congress. Observers say he may not focus on Japan’s wartime wrongdoings or any efforts to address the still-strong memories of Japan’s past militarism.Deteriorating public sentiment against Tokyo in Korea is expected to pose a headache for Washington as Abe’s visit to the United States is largely meant to reaffirm the robust U.S.-Japan alliance and stress Japan’s greater security role in the face of regional and global security challenges.In Korea, there have been concerns the U.S. has been lukewarm toward Tokyo’s apparently revisionist views of history, particularly after a senior U.S. official made remarks that indicated that Seoul and Beijing were also to blame for strained ties with Tokyo in regards to the past.During his visit to the U.S., Abe and U.S. President Barack Obama are expected to highlight the evolvement of their alliance over the past 70 years. They are also expected to sign a revision of its 1997 bilateral defense cooperation guidelines. The revision is expected to contain a set of joint measures to cope with Chinese threats and other emerging scenarios. First adopted in 1978 to counter Soviet threats, the guidelines were last amended in 1997 to reflect post-Cold War security threats.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","japan media blitz raises ,minute ad on cnn ,media blitz raises eyebrows ,japan media blitz ,tokyo is facing flak","['Tokyo', 'U.S.', 'asian', 'CNN', 'YouTube', 'korean', 'French', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe']",3,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.74713176  0.80842304

(Yonhap)On Wednesday, the Navy decided to refer a vice admiral and rear admiral to its disciplinary board on allegations that they pressured caddies to sing and dance multiple times at a golf course inside a naval unit in Jinhae, South Gyeongsang Province, since last November.The two would face punishment for using their senior positions to make “inappropriate demands,” the Navy said. Another rear admiral in charge of management of the golf course will also be referred to the board for failing to report the case to the higher authorities.The referral to the disciplinary panel came the day after a pan-governmental anticorruption panel indicted a retired rear admiral and a retired commander on charges of manipulating documents regarding the evaluation of a substandard part of a naval salvage ship, named Tongyeong, to help a foreign defense firm win a procurement deal. The indictment of the two retirees was just the latest in a recent series of cases involving former admirals.Former Chief of Naval Operations Hwang Ki-chul was arrested last Sunday on charges of peddling influence to allow the foreign firm to win a deal to supply a part of the salvage ship Tongyeong. Hwang served from 2013-2015 as CNO.The corruption scandals surrounding the Tongyeong acquisition have drawn the ire of the public as its delivery to the Navy has been delayed due to some of its underperforming parts. Due to the delay, the advanced ship failed to be deployed to help support the rescue operations of the sunken Sewol ferry last April.Hwang’s arrest came after another corruption scandal involving a former Navy chief sent shockwaves across the nation.Chung Ok-geun, who led the Navy from 2008-2010, was arrested in January on charges of receiving hundreds of millions of won from a local firm after he helped it win a deal to participate in the Navy’s acquisition of next-generation warships.The sexual and corruption scandals occurred as the North continues to pose a serious naval threat to the South by frequently violating the Northern Limit Line, the de facto inter-Korean sea border, and carrying out maritime drills that are designed to infiltrate into South Korea’s border islands.Critics called for a sweeping reform in the Navy to restore public trust and troop morale. During his inauguration ceremony a month ago, new Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Jung Ho-sub vowed to stamp out corruption and sexual misconduct, saying that the Navy should be reborn to win back public sentiment.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","navy beset by corruption ,corruption the south korean ,corruption and sexual scandals ,maritime threats the scandals ,korean navy is faltering","['the south korean Navy', 'North Korea ’s', 'Navy', 'North ’s']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65317714  0.4333379

But his trip has drawn keen attention due to the possibility of him raising the need for a THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) missile defense battery in South Korea to better defend against North Korean ballistic missile threats.""We're making progress on building an integrated air and missile defense umbrella, (and) both the Koreans and the Japanese have made some commitments in procurements on their side to make us more interoperable,"" he said in an interview aboard his aircraft, according to the Defense Department's DoD News.South Korea has been badly divided over whether to allow such a deployment, with supporters saying the deployment would help better protect against North Korea's ballistic missile threats, and opponents claiming it would inflame tensions with China and Russia. Dempsey is scheduled to hold talks with his South Korean counterpart in Seoul on Friday.Earlier this week, David R. Stilwell, strategic plans and policy deputy director for Asia at the JCS, reportedly said that the THAAD issue will be discussed when Dempsey visits Seoul. But South Korea's defense ministry rejected the report, saying the issue is off the official agenda.Other topics of discussions in Seoul would include the delayed transfer of wartime operational control over South Korean forces from Washington to Seoul, training exercises and response options to North Korean provocations, Dempsey said.""I'll get a chance to visit with both military leaders and political leaders to reassure them of our commitments and to seek their insights into the region,"" Dempsey said of his trip to Japan and Korea.Feedback from the allies is ""important for us to get their insights into the way they see the region evolving, so then we can collaboratively continue to adapt our relationship,"" he said.Dempsey also said that the North's provocative actions in response to annual military exercises between South Korea and the United States only reinforce the need for such drills. Such exercises are very important to ensure there is a ""credible deterrent against provocation"" by the North, he said.""They react in a provocative fashion, which of course has become somewhat predictable and reinforces the need for us to have these meetings and exercises with the frequency that we do,"" Dempsey said in an interview aboard his aircraft.The exercises ensure that the U.S. and the South are prepared with their military capabilities should the communist nation ""do more than just provoke,"" Dempsey said. The maneuvers are a ""critical part of our relationship and we do them with a very steady drumbeat, the same time every year,"" he said.North Korea has long condemned such annual drills as a rehearsal for invasion of the country. In an apparent expression of its anger at the latest exercises, known as Key Resolve and Foal Eagle, the North fired short-range missiles and surface-to-air missiles into the East Sea on two occasions earlier this month.South Korea and the U.S. have repeatedly said the drills are purely defensive.Dempsey said the exercises are held to ""rekindle"" tactics, techniques and procedures, to ensure the United States can operate collaboratively with its own joint force and with its South Korean allies.

A task force aiming to prevent accidents will also be created. They will also urge owners of unregistered sites to close down or change their type of business and specify current safety regulations, which have been accused of having loopholes and unclear wording. The strengthened rules will standardize fire equipment requirements and tent textiles, as well as the uses of combustible materials and electricity. Officials are also considering imposing safety ratings on camping sites.Critics, however, pointed out that the proposals already overlap with a series of safety laws passed in January by amending the Tourism Promotion Act to obligate camping ground owners to register their sites with local governments, while central government officials must ensure safety regulations. Violators are subject to up to two years in prison and 20 million won ($18,000) in fines. The rules are set to take effect in February next year. The revisions were the result of a bipartisan effort to strengthen camping safety across Korea, until last week’s tragedy exposed the loopholes and belatedness of the safety laws.Two families sleeping in a tent at a camping site in Incheon, a port city just west of Seoul, were engulfed by a fire that overtook their tent in seconds last Sunday. Two adults and three children were killed. A man nearby rescued a fourth child. The cause remains under investigation.Law enforcement officials are looking into whether the camping site owner violated construction laws by not installing fire equipment. Police are also checking whether local officials condoned the safety violations and if they received kickbacks in the process.Camping-related industries in South Korea have been on the rise in the last decade. Sales in outdoor equipment such as tents, sleeping bags and bivouac tools reached the 600 billion won mark last year.But public awareness about safety regulations appears to have been low.Saenuri Rep. Han Sun-kyo on Tuesday asserted that only 97 of the nation’s 1,800 camping sites had received regular fire inspections. The Saenuri Party’s policy committee chair Rep.

The Chunmoo multiple launch rocket system is displayed at a defense exhibition at KINTEX in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province, last May. (Yonhap)“When the new MLRS is delivered for operational deployment, it will greatly enhance our counterfire readiness posture, given that the new MLRS has a longer range and its performance will be better than the existing ones,” said the source.The Chunmoo is expected to be deployed to South Korea’s northwestern border islands sometime next year, to cope with North Korea’s persistent artillery threats. On the islands, South Korea has the K-9 self-propelled howitzers, but they only have a range of around 40 km.The North currently has 170 mm-caliber self-propelled howitzers and 240 mm-caliber multiple rocket launchers that have ranges of between 54 km and 65 km. The North has been developing a new 300 mm-caliber multiple launch rocket system that is thought to have a range of some 200 km.The development of the Chunmoo came amid rising concerns over the North’s long-range artillery along the border. Pyongyang has recently shown off its rocket capabilities, while Seoul has largely focused on how to defend against the North’s ballistic missile threats. The Chunmoo was developed to replace the Guryong, which has been deployed since the 1980s. It can fire both 130 mm-caliber rockets and 230 mm-caliber rockets. The state-run Agency for Defense Development developed the Chunmoo, which will be manufactured by Hanwha Corp.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","army to deploy new ,advanced multiple launch rocket ,south korea artillery counterstrike ,will bolster south korea ,said tuesday the new","['south korean', 'Army', 'North Korea ’s', 'MLRS', 'Chunmoo', 'South Korea ’s']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.30746859  0.68667984

(Yonhap)One of the officials who asked for anonymity said the fire appeared to have begun at a farm near a North Korean billet. It wasn't immediately clear whether the farm was located inside or outside the DMZ. Authorities said the fire appeared unintentional, as the North Korean military was also trying to quench it.By 3:45 p.m., the fire was within the proximity of the Dora Observatory in Paju, north of Seoul, a popular tourist destination.There has been no report of injuries or damage so far, officials said, as the observatory was closed to visitors this day.Access to the customs office leading to the South Korea-run industrial complex in the North's border town of Kaesong has been restricted since around 2:30 p.m.More than 50 South Korean firefighters were putting out the fire, Paju city and military officials said, adding three helicopters were aiding the process under the approval of the United Nations Command.Firefighters said they were experiencing difficulty extinguishing the fire due to strong winds and their inability to enter the northern side of the border. The two Koreas are technically at war since no peace treaty has been signed to end the 1950-53 Korean War.It was not immediately clear what caused the fire, a South Korean military official said.The Korean DMZ, the world's most heavily-armed border, runs the width of the Korean Peninsula roughly along the 38th parallel. It is guarded by more than 2 million troops on both sides.Drought in the central part of the Korean Peninsula has caused several fires recently. As of Monday, the entire northern part of the Gyeonggi Province surrounding Seoul has been under a drought warning.

The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) has recently gained traction as major Western economies, including Britain, Germany and France, decided to join the Chinese-led bank. Close U.S. allies in Asia -- South Korea, Australia and Japan -- have yet to make their decisions. The end of March is the deadline set by China for all interested parties to join the new bank, which many experts see as a counterbalance to the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank, which have been dominated by the United States and other Western economies.South Korean Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan has said Seoul will make a decision by the deadline, while Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said earlier in the day that Tokyo could consider joining the AIIB if conditions are met. Asked about the stances by South Korea and Japan, China's foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei replied, ""With regard to our neighbors in Asia such as South Korea and Japan as well as an important Asia-Pacific country Australia, these countries also expressed that they will make a positive consideration about this issue."" ""We are open to their decisions,"" Hong said.The United States has been negative about the Chinese push that is seen widely as an attempt to bolster its economic clout in Asia.The U.S. has called for transparency and high standards of governance as key requirements for such an institution.China has offered $50 billion with a reported stake of up to 50 percent in the AIIB, which South Korea viewed negatively because China could make a unilateral decision in the bank.""The establishment of the AIIB is to promote economic development and infrastructure building in Asia,"" Hong said.

Kim is likely to visit Russia in May in what would be his international debut and an apparent message of affront against China.   Li ""is on a mission to warm up relations between the neighbors against a backdrop of the DPRK's recent outreach to Russia,"" the state-run China Daily said, using an acronym for North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  Bilateral relations between North Korea and China, which jointly fought against South Korea, the United States and 20 other allies countries during the 1950-53 Korean War, were once touted as close as ""lips and teeth.""   But, the current Chinese Communist Party leadership led by President Xi Jinping has been increasingly frustrated by North Korea's unruly behavior, including the North's third nuclear test in early 2013.    Yang Xiyu, a researcher for the China Institute of International Studies, told the newspaper that the new ambassador ""will be tasked with the improvement of relations by strengthening economic ties and stepping up efforts to stop the country from pursuing nuclear weapons.""   Zhang Liangui, a professor of Korean studies at the Party School of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said bilateral ties between North Korea and China will not be affected by temporary events.   ""China's relations with the DPRK may undergo ups and downs, but it is not affected by any single event,"" Zhang told the newspaper.   Li, 59, is the second Chinese ambassador to North Korea picked from the Chinese Communist Party's International Department. His predecessor, Liu Hongcai, returned to a vice ministerial post in the department after completing his five-year stint in Pyongyang.   According to the newspaper, Li is ""one of China's few minister-level ambassadors -- one level senior to most other ambassadors -- signaling the geopolitical importance of the DPRK.""   China has appointed such senior-level ambassadors to the United States, Japan and Britain, the newspaper said.   Li studied German at Shanghai International Studies University in the early 1970s and served as ambassador to Myanmar from 2001 to 2005 and ambassador to the Philippines from 2005 to 2007.   China sent its first ambassador to Pyongyang in 1950.

Indications have grown he would get the chance despite objections that the nationalist leader is not qualified for the honor.Opponents have accused Abe of attempting to whitewash Japan's militaristic past and wartime atrocities, especially the country's sexual enslavement of women for its troops during World War II, and is still refusing to clearly apologize for the crime.Abe would be the first Japanese leader to address a joint meeting of Congress.""I would hope that Prime Minister Abe would make sure that ...he acknowledges the systematic kidnapping of girls and women during the 1930s and 1940s during the second world war, that they were responsible for, that he apologizes on behalf of the government, that the apology be unambiguous, and that he accepts the historical responsibility,"" Rep. Mike Honda (D-CA) told reporters.Should Abe want to become a leader in women's rights, as he said in a speech at the U.N. General Assembly last year, he must apologize to the victims of sexual slavery, Honda said, adding that ""nothing less than"" a clear apology is enough for him to be a global leader.""Their government needs to apologize for the past, be responsible for the present, and provide the leadership of the future. In order to do that you have to unequivocally apologize and accept the historical responsibility of what happened through the systematic kidnapping of girls through the Japanese Imperial military,"" the lawmaker said.Honda, who has long championed the rights of sexual slavery victims, said it is still unclear whether congressional leaders had invited Abe, but he got a sense that they have.""When these kinds of things happen, they try to keep a very high security level so that they don't share a lot of information beforehand. This is not unusual,"" he said.The Washington-based newsletter ""Nelson Report"" also said that House Speaker John Boehner has agreed to officially extend an invitation to Abe for a speech to a joint meeting of Congress before Congress adjourns on April 29 for the spring recess.The report said, however, that no official announcement of the invitation will be made pending completion of certain technicalities and discussions, including ""final sign-off"" from House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce (R-CA).Royce's office rejected the report, saying such a decision is totally up to the speaker.""Reports of the chairman's 'sign off' are inaccurate. The decision on these types of invitations lies solely with the speaker, not with the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee,"" the official told Yonhap News Agency without providing any further details.Boehner's office said it does not have ""any news to announce at this point.""Korean-American organizations have campaigned against such an address by Abe and collected about 6,000 signatures so far. They also ran a full-page advertisement in the newspaper Hill demanding Abe apologize for the sexual slavery issue before speaking before Congress.Those opposed to an Abe speech have been looking to Royce to raise objections, just as former committee chairman Henry Hyde derailed Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's push for an address in 2000, citing his visits to a Tokyo shrine honoring war dead, including war criminal.Abe's visit, expected to begin around April 26, is likely to be an occasion for the U.S. and Japan to celebrate progress in negotiations on an Asia-Pacific free trade deal, known as the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), and a revision to their defense guidelines.White House officials have repeatedly said they would welcome Abe with grand ceremonies and other elaborate protocols as is with a state visit, even though Abe's trip is technically an official visit as he is not a head of state.

The Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank was set up last October with 21 member states, aimed at spurring the region’s development by financing projects in energy, transportation, telecommunication, agriculture and other key sectors. The $50 billion institution may provide Seoul with a chance to share its know-how for rapid economic ascent, businesses with fresh markets and other economic incentives. Yet the government had been reluctant to announce its participation due largely to the bank’s relatively opaque governance structure and the opposition of Washington, which regards it as a potential rival to the World Bank and other mechanisms where it has a significant say.But a recent series of upgrades in the governance structure and operational principles, coupled with the joining of major European economies, appears to have propelled Seoul to lean toward participation. “We will have to go in that direction,” a Foreign Ministry official said, requesting anonymity citing ongoing discussions. “It’s true that there have been improvements ― now the bank will have a decision-making council and a secretariat to oversee its operation, among others. China has agreed to cut its stake and even said it is willing to yield the secretary-general post to other countries.” At a news conference late Tuesday, Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said intra-agency consultations are underway and that a final decision on Seoul’s involvement will be made by the end-March deadline based on economic benefits and other national interests. South Korea is expected to have conveyed its position to Washington during talks on Tuesday in Seoul between Deputy Foreign Minister Lee Kyung-soo and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Russel. “As the number of participating countries grows, they will help tackle problems that the international community has raised regarding the AIIB’s standards as a multilateral development bank,” another senior ministry official said at a meeting with reporters on Tuesday. Cheong Wa Dae said that nothing has been decided as the government is still looking into China’s offer. “We have never had formal discussions regarding our participation in the AIIB such as through meetings,” senior presidential economic secretary Ahn Jong-beom told reporters on Wednesday. After a surprise announcement by the U.K. last week, Germany, France and Italy unveiled their decision to join the initiative, dealing a fresh blow to the U.S. In a joint statement, the three countries said they are “keen to work with the AIIB founding members to establish an institution that follows the best standards and practices in terms of governance, safeguards, (and) debt and procurement policies.” Washington has lobbied its allies to reject Beijing’s proposal, fretting that the bank may undercut the global financial pecking order some 70 years after the Bretton Woods conference laid the groundwork for institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. While agreeing to the surging needs for infrastructure investment in the region, the U.S. yet again stressed the significance of “high standards” in launching any new multilateral bank, though it was up to a sovereign country to decide whether to sign up. “We believe any new multilateral institution should incorporate the high standards that the international community has collectively built at the World Bank and the Regional Development Bank,” State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki told a news briefing in Washington on Tuesday. “But it will be important for prospective members of the AIIB to push for the adoption of those same high standards, including strong board oversight and safeguards.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","wednesday the asia infrastructure ,forecast to join china ,south korea is forecast ,government sources said wednesday ,wednesday the asia","['South Korea', 'China', 'U.S.', 'european', 'the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank']",3,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.55750817  0.83789074

Britain announced its plan last week to join the bank, becoming the first Western country to do so. France and Germany followed suit.  ""It's a decision of any sovereign country, including South Korea, to make on AIIB,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said at a regular press briefing.  Psaki said that the United States believes there is a pressing need to enhance infrastructure investment around the world, but any new multilateral institution should incorporate the high standards that the international community has collectively built at the World Bank and the regional development bank.  ""As was true with the United Kingdom, the decision of any country to join is certainly a decision made by a sovereign country. But it will be important for prospective members of the AIIB to push for the adoption of those same high standards,"" she said.  South Korea has also been in a quandary over whether to allow the United States to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile defense system to the country.  The possibility of a THAAD deployment has left South Korea badly divided, with supporters saying the deployment would help better protect against North Korea's ballistic missile threats, and opponents claiming it would inflame tensions with China and Russia.   South Korean and U.S. officials have said there have been no official consultations on the issue.  ""We have not formally consulted with South Korea ... and no decisions have been made on a potential deployment to the Korean Peninsula,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said at a regular briefing.  China has expressed strong opposition to a THAAD deployment to South Korea.  Earlier this week, Chinese Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Jianchao said in Seoul that the South should take China's ""concerns and worries"" into consideration when making a decision on a THAAD deployment.   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Russel took a swipe at Liu's remarks, saying he finds it ""curious that a third country would presume to make strong representations about a security system that has not been put in place and that is still a matter of theory.""  When asked why China is opposed to a THAAD deployment, State Department spokeswoman Psaki said, ""Why are the Chinese opposed?

""The Seoul government has not sent a formal request to halt the launch.""  ""Even if the government makes the request, the group will press ahead with it,"" he stressed.   About 500,000 leaflets, as well as DVDs of the movie ""The Interview,"" which depicts a plot to assassinate leader Kim Jong-un, will be sent to the North, he noted.  Park's group regularly launches big balloons carrying such anti-Pyongyang leaflets in a campaign to spread dissenting messages in the reclusive country.  The upcoming campaign is feared to further escalate inter-Korean tension that is already brewing as the North has strongly protested Seoul's joint military exercises with the United States this month.  Referring to the leaflet plan, North Korea's main propaganda website Uriminzokkiri renewed its military threat Monday.  ""The act of leaflet scattering, which will be carried out amidst the rehearsal of war on North Korea, is an explicit declaration of war,"" the website said. ""(We) do not hide the fact that we will counteract this time with cannons or missiles.""  In spite of the growing inter-Korean tension over the leaflet campaign, the South Korean government largely remains disinclined to interject itself in the matter, repeating its hands-off position.  ""Basically, leaflet scattering by private groups falls on the basic right to free expression. It is something that (the government) cannot regulate by force,"" Lim Byeong-cheol, unification ministry spokesman, said in a briefing.   But in the event of the campaign posing clear threats to the safety of border-area citizens, the government will take necessary action, including a meeting with related activists to call for discretion, Lim noted.  Inter-Korean tension may further worsen over the leaflet issue down the road as more activist groups are expected to launch similar campaigns with the start of the spring season.   Park said he is also planning another campaign in early April jointly with foreign groups, including the U.S.-based Human Rights Foundation.

Entertainment expenses have been on the rise since 2000, with the only exception being in 2005.   Banks and insurance firms were the biggest spenders. Tax office data said 18,518 firms in this category spent an estimated 750 billion won on entertainment expenses in 2013. This breaks down to more than 40 million won per company.  Manufacturers spent 27.39 million won on average, the second highest, with health and medical related business spending 26.66 million won on average during the one-year period.  Business insiders say the data do not show the entire picture, with the actual amount probably topping 9 trillion won by a considerable margin.  Under the local tax rules, the basic annual deduction per company for entertainment spending is set at 12 million won, with the maximum deduction reaching between 0.03 percent and 0.2 percent of sales, depending on the size of the business.  The general estimate is that small and medium enterprises exceed the maximum limit by upwards of 50 percent, while corresponding numbers for conglomerates reach around 30 percent.  South Korea's parliament on March 3 passed the anti-graft ""Kim Young-ran Law"" that severely restricts exchanges of money and gifts to wipe out corruption. The law also sets limits on the price of meals that a person can be treated to between people whose interests are at stake.  The law, named after the former head of the country's Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission, aims to tighten loopholes in existing anti-corruption rules that are unable to punish public officials for accepting expensive gifts and services unless there is clear sign of reciprocity. The strengthened law subjects public officials, journalists and private school faculty to a maximum penalty of three years in prison or a fine of five times the amount they accept in money or valuables, regardless of whether it is in exchange for favors or related to their work.   ""It may be a good idea to reduce tax deductions and even get rid of the entertainment expenses category from local accounting books altogether,"" said Lee Jong-soo, a government administration professor at Hansung University.  A business insider noted how entertainment costs actually hurt ordinary people.   ""Such practices add extra cost to companies that will eventually pass on the burden to consumers, translating into higher service charges and finished product prices,"" he said.  ""Entertainment spending is understandable to some extent, yet if it becomes excessive, it can be detrimental for the business environment as a whole,"" said Sohn Won-ik, a senior official at Deloitte Korea said.   In the United States' case, there are some tax benefits for meals and entertainment outlays used by companies, while Britain includes entertainment spending as part of corporate employees' wages. Germany accepts up to 70 percent of all such spending as legitimate expenses entitled to tax breaks.  ""Entertainment expenses usually lack transparency,"" argued Ahn Chang-nam, a tax expert at Kangnam University.  He said that worries expressed by business and government circles that withdrawing tax deductions will adversely affect consumer spending are exaggerated.  The finance ministry, on the other hand, argued that the total sum that is eligible for deductions is not really high, and that some advanced economies do offer some kind of tax break. It said for the moment the government is not looking at adjusting the current system.

The year also marks the 70th anniversary of Seoul's liberation from Tokyo's colonial rule in 1945.  Lee Sang-deok, Seoul's chief delegate to the talks, met with his Japanese counterpart, Junichi Ihara, earlier in the day in Seoul in their seventh round of talks to discuss the ""comfort women"" issue, according to the foreign ministry.  Last April the two countries launched the talks on sex slavery, but no major progress has been made as Japan is reluctant to sincerely apologize for its past wrongdoings.  The meeting comes as the Seoul-Tokyo ties have plunged to their lowest level in recent years mainly due to the sex slavery issue. Historians estimate the number of sex slaves at about 200,000 with only 53 South Korean victims alive today.  Seoul demands that Japan show sincerity by resolving the sex slave issue in a way that is acceptable to the living victims. But Japan has long dismissed Seoul's demands, saying that all grievances related to its colonial rule were settled through a 1965 treaty that normalized their bilateral ties.  In June, Japan irked Seoul and Beijing, victims of Tokyo's wartime aggression, by saying that its 1993 apology over the sex slavery issue, named the Kono Statement, was the outcome of a political compromise between Seoul and Tokyo.  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe plans to release a statement in August to mark the 70th anniversary of Japan's defeat in World War II.  Abe said he will express remorse over Japan's role in the war in his fresh statement, but the prevailing view is that the premier will not apologize for the sex slavery issue and may water down the spirit of Japan's 1995 apology for Japan's colonial rule, named the Murayama Statement.  Since taking office in early 2013, South Korean President Park Geun-hye has shunned a summit with Abe as a show of anger against Tokyo's refusal to face up to its historical grievances.

The year also marks the 70th anniversary of Seoul's liberation from Tokyo's colonial rule in 1945.Seoul-Tokyo ties have plunged to lowest levels in recent years mainly due to the sex slavery issue. Historians estimate the number of sex slaves at about 200,000 with only 53 South Korean victims alive today.Japan angered Seoul and Beijing, victims of Tokyo's wartime aggression, in June by saying that its 1993 apology over the sex slavery issue, named the Kono Statement, was the outcome of a political compromise between Seoul and Tokyo.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he will express remorse over Japan's role in the war in his fresh statement that will come out in August to mark the 70th anniversary of Japan's defeat of World War II.But many analysts predict that the premier will not apologize for the sex slavery issue and may water down the spirit of Japan's 1995 apology for Japan's colonial rule, named the Murayama Statement.Since taking office in early 2013, South Korean President Park Geun-hye has shunned a summit with Abe as a show of anger against Tokyo's refusal to atone for its historical wrongdoings.

The expression is not something the perpetrator nation should say, Watanabe said.""This year is the 70 year anniversary of the end of war and Abe may make some statement and we can presume that something will be missing from his statement,"" Watanabe said, apparently meaning that no apology will be included in the statement.Watanabe said Abe is ""very consistent in denying the historical facts of the comfort women system."" ""Just a month before he became prime minister for the second time, he endorsed a revisionist opinion ... saying comfort women were mere prostitutes,"" she said.She said the Japanese government has taken out references to the comfort women issue from junior high school textbooks on grounds that junior high school students are too young to learn about the issue. Now, Japan is attempting to take it out from high school textbooks and is even trying to ""censure"" a U.S. textbook.The activist was referring to Tokyo's demand made late last year that U.S. textbook publisher McGraw-Hill alter the description of the sexual slavery issue in one of its textbooks. The demand was denounced as apparent attempt to water down the atrocity.Watanabe also criticized Abe for pledging at the U.N. General Assembly last year to help make the 21st century a world with no human rights violations against women and ""pouring millions of money"" for the cause while at the same time turning a blind eye to calls for reparations from sexual slavery victims.""Even if the government of Japan did something good to support the survivors of sexual violence inflicted by other states ... It does not evade the responsibility of the state of Japan to the survivors of comfort women system,"" she said.""If the government of Japan admits to the crime of its own military and meet its obligation under international law, to provide reparations to survivors, it would set a significant benchmark that states are held accountable for their crimes even after 70 years,"" she said.Shu-hua Kang, executive director of the Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation, also held a presentation about Taiwanese victims of the atrocity, and urged Japan to admit and formally apologize for the crime and provide compensation to victims.""Sexual slavery, a form of wartime violence directed against women, is one of the worst human rights abuses of our day,"" she said. ""For over 70 years, the Japanese government still denies any legal responsibility over the crime it committed against comfort women and refuses to compensate survivors directly.""Kang also urged Tokyo to reject any public statements distorting historical facts about comfort women and to ""incorporate the history of comfort women into the national curriculum so that younger generations can understand such crimes should never happen again.""

With his shoulders slumped under the weight of his backpack, he heads toward yet another institute in his hectic day.The 11-year-old’s schedule, revealed in a recent report by ChildFund Korea, involved studying after school at English, Chinese, math and piano institutes, and going to bed at 2:30 a.m. “For kids in my neighborhood, sleeping five hours a day is pretty generous. We usually go to bed around 1 a.m., because of all the homework,” he said. Roughly 50 percent of Korean children say they are severely stressed by the pressure to achieve high academic results, the highest figure among 30 developed nations around the world according to a state-run institute.  About 50 percent of Korean children say they are under pressure to do well academically. (Yonhap)Kim Mi-suk, a researcher from the state-run Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, compiled data from the United Nations Children’s Fund and Korea’s Welfare Ministry to find out where children suffer the most from academic-related pressure. For her study, she looked at 30 countries ― most in North America and Europe, including the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Netherlands and Spain ― and compared them with South Korea. Other Asian countries were not included in the study.Some 50.3 percent of South Korean students scored three out of four in the category of “pressured by school work,” which was 17.2 percentage points higher than the average of 33 percent. Korea was followed by Spain, Slovenia and Portugal, and Dutch students were found to suffer the least from study-related stress ― only 16.8 percent said they were stressed out.South Korean is infamous for its extreme emphasis on education, which often starts early. According to Korea Consumer Agency, 41 percent of parents said their children started receiving private education before entering elementary school.On average, private education for elementary school students costs around 370,000 won ($328) per month.Experts are split on the effectiveness of early education. But some experts like Ewha Womans University professor Lee Ki-sook warn about the possible side effects of academic pressure on young minds.Lee, who conducted a six-year study on a group of 181 children, said children forced to study hard from a young age can become isolated or even aggressive later in life. Kim’s report also showed that severely pressured Korean children scored the worst in “life satisfaction,” with only 60.3 percent saying they were satisfied. The second-lowest country on the list, Romania, had a score of 76.6 percent.In contrast, 94.2 percent of Dutch children said they were happy with their lives.“Korean children’s low life-satisfaction is closely related to study-induced stress. This calls for (state-led) strategies to alleviate their pressure, such as adjusting class hours,” Kim said. “There is also a need to procure free time for children as well as infrastructure like parks.”By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","korean students suffer ,students suffer from all ,korean students suffer from ,studying after school ,childfund korea involved studying","['ChildFund Korea', 'Chinese']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34966189  0.24800213

At the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women, Gender Equality and Family Minister Kim Hee-jung tacitly urged Tokyo to face up to history and resolve the issue in line with its commitment to tackling violence against women. It was the first time for Seoul to raise the issue at the panel. “I am encouraged to see how much progress has been made around the world in securing greater safety for women. But no such progress has been made regarding the thousands of women who were forced into sexual slavery during World War II,” she said in her keynote address at the meeting in New York.  Gender Equality and Family Minister Kim Hee-jung delivers a keynote address at the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women in New York on Monday. (Yonhap)“We must face up to past wrongdoings in order to not repeat history, and to ensure that women and children can enjoy a peaceful future.”As her ministry seeks to enlist documents related to the sex slavery as UNESCO heritage items, Kim boosted hopes for the registration process to be completed this year, which marks the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the peninsula from Japanese rule and the foundation of the U.N. She has long been leading the UNESCO drive since serving as a lawmaker. Shortly before the event, she held a meeting with Gay McDougall, a former U.N. special rapporteur who authored a landmark 1998 report detailing Japan’s “systematic rape, sexual slavery and slavery-like practices” during the war. “Because the issue of the so-called comfort women is directly linked with women’s human rights during conflict, which is a universal value, we should learn lessons through the materials that such a tragedy must not repeat again in human history,” the minister said at a news conference ahead of the U.N. meeting. Seoul and Tokyo have had five rounds of director general-level talks since last April to end the dispute but apparently made little progress due to stark differences in their positions. Seoul demands an official, sincere apology and compensation for the victims, while Tokyo claims the issue was settled in a 1965 agreement that normalized their testy bilateral ties.“What our government is demanding is that Japan acknowledge its past misconduct, make a sincere apology and provide correct history education for future generations so that this will not occur again,” Kim added.

The council has also proposed a joint research project on the two countries' historical higher education sites -- Sungkyunkwan in Seoul and Kukjagam in the North Korean border town of Kaesong.The project, if accomplished, could help Seoul's push to list its relics as world heritage sites recognized by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the city said.In addition, the council has suggested a joint research project on construction, railway and military facilities built in South and North Korea during the 1910-45 Japanese colonial rule.

Hopefully it will spark a radical change in the immigration system,” said Lee Il, a lawyer at Advocates for Public Interest Law, the legal representative of the African-born plaintiff whose identity has been withheld.In January, the Seoul High Court ruled in favor of the Sudanese man’s request to be submitted to the screening process. Incheon Airport Immigration Office ― the defendant in the case ― had denied the process, stating that he had no legitimate grounds to be granted refugee status. The immigration office had also accused him of lying in his testimonies.  An airport terminal (Yonhap)The case was widely publicized in Korea last year, after the plaintiff was forced to stay in the waiting room of the airport for five months while engaging in a legal battle against the authorities to even get a chance to apply for refugee status.Almost immediately after he arrived in Incheon International Airport in November 2013, he was turned back by the airport authorities. After refusing to return home, he stayed in the airport waiting room with no bedding, where he survived on fast food.The plaintiff filed a lawsuit against the office in February 2014, demanding that he should at least be allowed to go through the screening process. He claimed to be a conscious objector and said that his life would be in danger if he returned to Sudan. “The decision to bar an applicant from the refugee screening process should be made only when there is no doubt that a person is abusing the system. When a case calls for a more elaborate decision (on granting refugee status), the applicant should be allowed to follow to the proper legal procedures,” the high court said in its ruling. The man was able to enter the country in April 2014, when Incheon District Court ruled it was illegal for officials to confine him at the airport.Last month, he applied for a formal screening process to be considered a refugee.Although the Refugee Act of Korea was enacted in July 2013, the country’s threshold for accepting refugees has been notoriously steep. According to the Center for Refugee Rights in South Korea, there were 2,896 refugee claims in 2014 but only 94 ― or 3.2 percent ― were approved.

At a time when Korea’s IT industry profits are dwindling amid a sagging economy, Bulgaria offers a blue ocean of well-educated workers and a business-friendly environment, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, Andonov said. “Korea’s strength in developing computer hardware and Bulgaria’s strength in software can be harmonized as part of President Park Geun-hye’s ‘creative economy’ road map,” he said. “Despite Bulgarian workers’ high education credentials, operational and labor costs remain one of the lowest in Europe.”Bulgaria has a myriad of small and medium-sized companies doing contract programming for multinational firms, including BMW, SAP, HP, IBM, Boeing, Nortel, Microsoft, Cisco and Oracle.  Bulgarian Ambassador to Korea Petar Andonov (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)The country has a strong tradition in informatics education from the communist era, as it was the largest manufacturer of personal computers within the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance alliance.To this day, an “unusually high number of students” major in electronics, engineering and computer sciences in university, giving Bulgaria its reputation as the Silicon Valley of Eastern Europe, he said.The ICT sector in Bulgaria has taken up a growing share of the national economy through exports: Bulgarian ICT companies work as subcontractors in foreign projects or specialize in importing, assembling and selling hardware and software. Bulgaria joined NATO in 2004 and the EU in 2007 ― matters of “civilizational choice,” according to Andonov. The country is currently positioning itself as a regional transport and logistics hub at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, he added. “We are trying to diversify our energy sources as part of European Union’s Juncker Plan and Energy Union (a massive 315 billion euro scheme to boost investment and create jobs),” the ambassador explained, stressing that energy security has been a vital national concern in light of the country’s total dependence on Russia for natural gas import.The ambassador noted that Samsung C&T;, Hyundai Heavy Industries and Korea South-East Power Corporation have invested in Bulgaria’s solar energy sectors. “More Korean companies can participate in various energy infrastructure projects, including hydropower generation facility construction along the Danube,” he added. Investing in Bulgaria gives companies wider access to markets in Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia and the Commonwealth of Independent States, and Southeastern European countries not yet part of the EU ― Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Kosovo and Albania. Bulgaria’s currency board arrangement has kept the foreign exchange rate fixed at 1.95 lev per euro, preventing currency fluctuation and ensuring predictability for investors. Both corporate and personal income taxes are 10 percent. After the EU-Korea free trade agreement came into force in July 2011, trade between Bulgaria and Korea increased 35 percent annually, reaching the highest volume at $273 million. Cumulative Korean investment in Bulgaria is around $254 million. In 2013, Bulgaria exported $175 million worth of precious metals, electronic microchips, agri-food and seafood to Korea; Korea exported $126 million euros worth of cars, tires, electronic goods, home appliances and semiconductors to Bulgaria. “I wish to export more of our rose oil, organic food, pharmaceutical products, meat products and wine to Korea,” Andonov said. Bulgaria and Korea established a diplomatic relationship in 1990 and strategic partnership in 2010. The approaching 25th anniversary of ties on March 23 will set a benchmark for further cooperation in all fields, he said. “The last 25 years of our relationship was spearheaded by the market opening, but the next 25 years and beyond will certainly depend on our younger generation,” Andonov said. “People-to-people exchanges through traditional and popular culture can do what governments and businesses cannot.” The Sofia University in Bulgaria has a Korean language and culture center and Hanguk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul has a Bulgarian language department. Andonov was a foreign policy and economy analyst at TV Europe (2006-09) and U.S. Radio Free Europe (2003-06), Bulgarian ambassador to Japan and the Philippines (1998-2003), economic adviser to the prime minister (1991-92) and president of Bulgaria (1997-98).By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","korean companies bulgarian ambassador ,sagging economy bulgaria offers ,korean companies bulgarian ,by korean companies bulgarian ,bulgarian ambassador to korea","['Bulgaria', 'ict', 'korean', 'bulgarian', 'Korea', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea', 'Bulgaria']",3,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.65521783  0.53384912

The suspect, identified as 55-year-old Kim Ki-jong, said he attacked Lippert in opposition to ongoing Korea-U.S. military drills.Seoul has been scurrying to prevent the incident from negatively affecting the allies' alliance at a time when the Korean public has been irked by U.S. Undersecretary of State Wendy Sherman's remarks seen as taking Japan's side in history rows.""The two countries have maintained close cooperation. In the near term, there will be high-level contacts,"" a ranking official at the foreign ministry told reporters on Thursday.South Korea said that it and the U.S. shared the view that the attack was ""an isolated incident"" that will not affect the two countries' relationship.Washington reaffirmed its strong alliance with South Korea on Thursday, saying that it won't be deterred by ""senseless acts of violence"" despite the incident.As part of efforts to build close cooperation, Seoul is seeking to have Kim Hong-kyun, former secretary for international cooperation under the national security office -- who is known to be tapped as a new deputy foreign minister -- visit the U.S., government sources said.In what is seen as a reciprocal move to a series of recent Seoul visits by ranking U.S. diplomats, the government may seek to arrange visits to Washington by Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yong, sources added.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry may reportedly make a visit to Japan next month ahead of a planned visit by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to the U.S.Kerry's itinerary has not been confirmed, but South Korea hopes that Kerry will also pay a visit to Seoul as well, as it could serve as an occasion to demonstrate the strong alliance between the two allies.Seoul plans to spare no effort to promote public diplomacy in the U.S. to prevent American citizens from having negative sentiments toward South Korea following the attack on Lippert, according to officials.

The plant will be constructed in the Korean pharmaceutical industry complex, which is also to be established in the city. The opening date of both the complex and plant has not yet been decided, the ministry said. Korea’s Yonsei University Severance Hospital has agreed to be in charge of treatment at a medical center specializing in women’s cancers that is scheduled to open in Riyadh in 2016. The hospital, which will house about 150 patients, is being constructed by Saudi health care firm Integrated Business Ventures and a number of U.S. firms. Korea’s Green Cross Laboratories, on the other hand, has signed to establish a clinical laboratory in Saudi Arabia to research specimens collected from patients at the medical center in Riyadh.All the deals between the firms of the two countries were signed a deal during Park’s ongoing trip to the Middle East, which also includes visits to Kuwait, Qatar and UAE. “We hope health and medical businesses can generate the second ‘Middle Eastern boom’ following the early bilateral ties between Korea and the Middle East in the ’70s, which were limited to energy and construction,” said Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo, who is currently accompanying Park.At the government level, Moon and his Saudi counterpart Al Khateeb agreed to launch joint research and development projects on health care. South Korea will share information on its national health insurance system, as well as its Hospital Information System ― known as HIS ― where all of the medical charts are digitized, along with the personal data of the patients, among others.South Korea is one of the most popular medical tourism destinations for affluent citizens in the Middle East. Some 2,500 people from the four Middle East countries visited Seoul in 2013 for medical treatment. Among them, those from the UAE spent the most ― an average of 17.7 million won, which is almost 9.5 times higher than the average spending of 1.8 million won per foreign patient the same year.

The months-long travel restriction, which banned foreign tourists from visiting North Korea and imposed a strict 21-day quarantine on all people, including diplomats, entering the country, was lifted earlier this week. Beijing-based Koryo Tours, which takes about 2,500 Western tourists to North Korea a year, said the first group of foreign tourists will arrive in Pyongyang on March 14. ""With the North Korean border now open once more, Koryo Tours is pleased to have applied for its first trip to the country this year with a tour group now scheduled to arrive in Pyongyang on Saturday, 14 March,"" the company said in a statement. Before lifting the travel restriction, North Korea barred foreigners from taking part in an international marathon set to be held in Pyongyang on April 12. So far, foreigners were still banned from the marathon, Koryo Tours said. ""At this stage, the information we have is that the Pyongyang Marathon on 12 April remains closed to foreign amateurs,"" it said. Under international sanctions over nuclear and missile ambitions, North Korea has promoted tourism as a source of earning much-needed hard currency. North Korea's frantic measures against Ebola appear to highlight concerns that it could pose a direct threat to the regime's survival if the virus crossed into the North, South Korea's spy agency told lawmakers last month.

The monument commemorates the ""heroic feats performed by the 14 fighter pilots in the operation to ensure the successful launch of satellite Kwangmyongsong-2,"" said the KCNA. In April 2009, Kim observed the launch of the rocket, which Pyongyang claims was aimed at sending a satellite into orbit, along with his father and then-leader Kim Jong-il. The launch was unsuccessful.Citing the North's earlier news reports, South Korean officials said that at least one of the 14 airmen was killed due to a jet crash on the eve of the rocket launch.""It's presumed that a pilot was killed as a MiG-23 fighter jet crashed into the waters near the launch site in Musudan-ri while conducting a patrol flight against a possible attempt to intercept (the rocket),"" a unification ministry official told reporters on background. The pilot received a posthumous medal and 13 others were awarded watches with the name of Kim Jong-il, he added.Kim Jong-un. meanwhile, inspected the air force unit on the occasion of the North's tree-planting day, which falls on March 2.He said the unit needs to play a role in leading in his campaign for forest restoration, according to the KCNA.He planted ginkgo and other types of trees himself during the visit, it added.

In her Independence Movement Day address, she called for the two Koreas to meet to discuss reunions of families displaced by the 1950-53 Korean War, while expanding cooperation in sports, culture, arts and humanitarian areas. With the Korea-Japan relationship marking the 50th anniversary of its normalization, Park stressed a resolution of the issue of Japan’s sexual enslavement of Korean women during World War II, calling it a “historical task that must be tackled on the two countries’ journey to the future.”  President Park Geun-hye delivers a speech during a ceremony at Sejong Center for the Performing Arts in downtown Seoul, marking the 96th anniversary of the March 1 Independence Movement. (Yonhap)“History is not to be selectively remembered at one’s convenience, and acknowledging history is the only path to progress,” the president said, citing Alexis Dudden, a historian at the University of Connecticut who recently led a group of 19 U.S. scholars to issue a statement in protest against Japan’s attempts to press a textbook publisher to alter descriptions regarding the sex slavery. “As Germany and France have in the past managed to surmount conflict and enmity and jointly lead the establishment of a new Europe, I hope Japan will now accept the historical truth in a brave and honest manner and join hands with Korea to write a new history as partners for the 50 years ahead.” Park’s remarks appear to be intended to ratchet up pressure on Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, whose populist credentials have triggered concerns he may stoke further tensions by displaying revisionist views, such as through an envisaged address at U.S. Congress or a statement marking the 70th anniversary of World War II later this year. But her tone was somewhat softer compared with two previous speeches. Last year, she took a harder line in the wake of the premier’s visit to the controversial Yasukuni war shrine, saying that “a leader who cannot concede past wrongdoings will not be able to chart a new future.” With their bilateral sex slavery talks remaining in a gridlock, fatigue is growing gradually in the government and academic circles in Washington, powered in part by Japan’s intensified lobbying, that Seoul’s lack of flexibility and practical diplomacy is complicating a crucial three-way security partnership including Tokyo in the face of rising North Korean threats, sources say. At a seminar in Washington on Friday, Wendy Sherman, under secretary for political affairs at the U.S. Department of State, said that “disagreements” about history and territory issues between South Korea, Japan and China are “understandable, but it can also be frustrating.”“Nationalist feelings can still be exploited, and it’s not hard for a political leader anywhere to earn cheap applause by vilifying a former enemy,” she said. “But such provocations produce paralysis, not progress. To move ahead, we have to see beyond what was to envision what might be. And in thinking about the possibilities, we don’t have to look far for a cautionary tale of a country that has allowed itself to be trapped by its own history.” A senior official at Seoul’s Foreign Ministry downplayed her assessment as nothing new, saying it will be an “overinterpretation” to conclude that it was to back Japan’s claims while taking a swipe at South Korea and China. “In the overall context, her remarks were in line with the U.S.’ basic viewpoint that it serves U.S. interests that the three Northeast Asian countries cooperate closely to boost regional stability, peace and prosperity,” the official told reporters on customary condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. “She also clearly indicated that the countries should learn the lessons of the past, heal wounds of history and forge a future-oriented partnership.” As to Pyongyang, Park apparently sought to convey relatively conciliatory messages and focus more on humanitarian and civilian exchanges than military issues. This reflects South Korea’s pursuit to bring the communist regime to the negotiating table, now that it has set better cross-border ties and unification preparation as the centerpiece of Park’s third-year presidency. “Our efforts to prepare for unification is ever aimed at isolating North Korea but to help lead it to come out as a responsible member of the international community and take the course of mutual prosperity and peace,” she said. “North Korea should no longer turn away from inter-Korean dialogue.” The family reunions remain a top priority given the rapid aging of the survivors, she said, reiterating calls for talks “as soon as possible” to arrange regular meetings and exchange of letters and the identification of the families. To help restore the divided state’s national homogeneity, Park pledged to support various joint cultural and economic projects such as for historical study and a trans-peninsula railway. “North Korea should forgo the illusion that nuclear weapons will provide protection, and come out and take the path to opening up and change that can improve the livelihoods of the people and earnestly guarantee peace and regime stability,” the president added. Early this year, Seoul proposed inter-Korean meetings to discuss “all issues of mutual interest” including a possible lifting of bilateral sanctions and restart of lucrative tours to a mountain resort in the North. The North Korean leader also boosted hopes for a thaw by expressing, in his New Year address, his willingness for “highest-level” talks with the South. Yet the mood quickly cooled as the sides failed to build on the momentum and instead continued spats such as over launches of anti-Pyongyang leaflets by civic groups here. With South Korea and the U.S. scheduled for annual military drills until late April, tension on the peninsula will likely escalate as the Kim regime engages in a show of force in retaliation, firing short-range missiles, breaching the de-facto maritime border or staging other small-scale provocations, experts say.

According to the Justice Ministry, 94 out of 96 lawsuits have concluded in seizing property from descendants of Koreans who received land assets in return for working in favor of the Japanese government during the colonial period. Two cases are pending in the top court, it said. Since 2008, the government has launched a large-scale probe into the property that was rewarded to pro-Japanese traitors, and sought to reclaim it from the descendants, amid growing public pressure to set the history right. The value of the overall land property seized from 168 pro-Japanese workers’ generations amounts to about 100 billion won ($91 million), the ministry said.The legal battles were mainly divided into three cases ― state litigation launched by the government, administrative lawsuits sought by the concerned descendants who wished to take their property back after it was seized, and constitutional lawsuits over the legality of the asset confiscation project, officials said. Of these, the government won 97 percent or 91 cases, the ministry said. The state lost only three cases in which it was difficult to prove that the property owners were indeed pro-Japanese traitors or that the assets were clearly given to them in return of pro-Japanese activities, it added. The government said the asset redemption project is expected to be wrapped up by this year as final rulings of the remaining two cases are to be delivered soon.

In 2007, more than 120 South Korean victims were alive, but the number has since dropped to 53, with their average age standing at 90.""There is little time left to restore their honor,"" Park said in an address marking Korea's 1919 nationwide uprising against Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule.Park also lashed out at Japan's repeated attempts to distort history textbooks, saying Tokyo's moves hurt its relations with Seoul.Critics have accused Japan of glorifying its militaristic past and glossing over its wartime atrocities.Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony from 1910-45 and controlled much of China in the early part of the 20th century.Park urged Japan to muster up the courage to face up to history as Germany did for its neighbors so that Seoul and Tokyo can become partners for the future.Relations between South Korea and Japan have been at one of their worst points in recent years due to Tokyo's refusal to address the sexual slavery issue and its repeated claims to South Korea's easternmost islets of Dokdo.Park also used Sunday's speech to propose that South and North Korea quickly hold talks to stage reunions of families separated since the 1950-53 Korean War.Millions of Koreans remain separated since the Korean War, which ended in a cease-fire, not a peace treaty.Family reunions are a pressing humanitarian issue on the divided peninsula, as most of the separated family members are in their 70s and 80s, and wish to see their long-lost relatives before they die.The two Koreas last held family reunions in February in 2014.""North Korea should not ignore inter-Korean dialogue anymore,"" Park said.South Korea has repeatedly called on North Korea to come forward for talks to discuss the reunion of separated families and other issues.Still, North Korea has remained silent on South Korea's offer to hold talks. Instead, the North has threatened to retaliate against South Korea over its planned annual joint military drills with the United States. The North claims the joint military drills are a rehearsal for a nuclear war against it.Park also urged North Korea to abandon its expectations that its nuclear weapons programs can safeguard the country, and to embrace reform and openness that she says could guarantee peace and its stability.North Korea has described its nuclear programs a ""treasured sword"" against what it called Washington's policy of hostility.Park left for Kuwait later in the day on a nine-day, four-nation trip to the Middle East expected to focus on wide-ranging economic cooperation beyond energy and construction.

Six votes were needed to overturn the law.Under the law, adultery was a crime punishable by up to two years behind bars. Any third person involved in a love affair could also face criminal charges. The regulation was only applicable when a spouse filed a lawsuit. Nine judges deliver a decision at the Constitutional Court in Seoul on Thursday. (Yonhap)“The public perception toward the anticheating law does not reach consensus anymore. Whether to sustain a marriage should depend on people’s free will and choices,” the majority of the judges said.“Considering the level of social criticism (of the adultery law), it has become difficult to bring about the intended precautionary effects. In fact, it has rather been used as a means of divorce for those who committed more faults (than their partners) yet wished to break up, and a means of blackmailing erratic housewives.”The two dissenting judges viewed the matter differently.“Adultery is an act that damages the marriage-based social system and has a destructive impact on families. Therefore, it is not included in the realm of the individual’s sexual rights,” the minority said, including a left-leaning female judge. “The abolishment of the adultery law can lower the level of sexual morality (in society), and thereby accelerate the dissolution of the family system,” they added.In the past, the court had turned down petitions to repeal the law four times from 1990 to 2008. In its 2008 ruling, the majority of the judges supported personal freedom but were one vote shy of ordering a change.Since the enactment of the adultery law in 1953, there has been a national debate over its legality. While some claimed that the law was necessary to protect family values and to keep the legacy of traditionally long-revered Confucian values, others argued that it breached privacy rights. Public requests to abolish the law have mounted as the law was sometimes used to exact personal revenge or secure more alimony. It also tended to put women at an unfair disadvantage due to social prejudice. The court’s landmark ruling is expected to affect thousands of people who have been punished so far. While about 100,000 people were punished by the controversial law since 1953, the severity of the punishments have gradually declined. Among those, only some 5,400 people ― those who were indicted on charges of violating the adultery law since Oct. 31, 2008 ― are expected to be allowed a retrial. The judiciary authorities allow a retrial request from only those who faced charges a day after the last constitutional ruling on the same topic was announced. The last ruling in favor of the adultery law was upheld on Oct. 30, 2008. The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy hailed the court’s decision, saying that it reflected social changes. The ruling Saenuri Party stressed that the marriage and family system should still be respected.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","controversial adultery law ending ,adultery law ending decadeslong ,court scraps adultery ban ,law ending decadeslong debate ,korea controversial adultery law","['the Constitutional Court', 'South Korea ’s']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.316172    0.25202852

She plans to visit Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, respectively, on her first overseas trip of the year.“The trips are meant to expand the Park Geun-hye government’s diplomatic landscape out to the Middle East region and to strengthen ties with Gulf nations this year, which marks the 50th anniversary of (South Korean builders’) entry to foreign markets,” said Ju Chul-ki, senior presidential secretary for foreign affairs. This May 20, 2014, photo shows President Park Geun-hye and Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan (seventh from left), deputy prime minister of United Arab Emirates, attending an installation ceremony of a Korean-made nuclear reactor in Barakah in the Gulf nation. (Cheong Wa Dae)The South Korean government will also seek to diversify business portfolios with Gulf nations to prepare for the post-oil era, shifting their focus from heavy industries of energy and plants to high-value-added industries such as education, medical services and infrastructure improvement.“We will link their policies aimed at diversifying industry (portfolios) with our three-year economic plans,” Ju said.Park plans to introduce her vision of creative economy aimed at nurturing creative ideas from across society, and assimilating them with ICT, science and technology, and other industries.Park’s Middle East trip was previously scheduled for last year, but was put on hold after she came under fierce public scrutiny over the government’s bungled response to the sinking of a ferry that killed 300 in April. Park visited the UAE on a two-day trip instead, on the request of the Middle Eastern country. She attended a ceremony to mark the installation of the first nuclear reactor developed and exported by Korean firms to the country. “It is a must for South Korean presidents to visit (traditional partners) in the Middle East to maintain strategic and economic ties on a regular basis rather than exploring ways to break into new markets in the region,” said In Nam-sik, an associate professor of European and African studies at the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security, referring to the South Korean economy’s heavy economic dependence on the oil-rich nations.The four nations are South Korea’s major destinations for construction and plant exports as well as major providers of fossil fuel energy. Trade volume between South Korea and the four countries accounts for 74 percent of total trade in the Middle East region, according to the presidential office.Earlier this week, Park urged officials to expand economic cooperation with the region, stressing that massive construction and infrastructure projects in oil-rich nations could become a new growth engine for South Korea’s economy.The president said she expected Korean builders to seize opportunities to initiate “the second Middle East boom.” In the 1970s, South Korea sent tens of thousands of engineers and workers to the Middle East during a construction boom in the region.This year marks the 50th year since South Korean builders entered foreign markets, and the 40th year since they set foot in the Middle East.Her tour of the four nations comes at a critical time, with Korean builders suffering from declining orders from the Middle East. With international crude prices falling, oil-rich Gulf nations are expected to cut the number of construction orders this year as profits from oil exports deteriorate. According to a study by Hyundai Research Institute, Korean builders are forecast to lose $6.8 billion worth of construction orders from foreign countries a year if the price of Dubai crude oil drops 10 percent. The study, quoting a recent forecast by Cambridge Energy Research Associate, said the price of Dubai crude could slide to $64 per barrel this year, a sharp drop from an average price of $100 recorded last year. This implies that Korean builders could lose $24.8 billion or one-third of the total amount of orders they won last year, HRI said. Construction orders from the Middle East totaled 47.5 percent last year.On the first leg of her four-nation trip, Park will visit Kuwait for three days and hold a summit with the emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah. The leaders are set to discuss ways to increase bilateral cooperation in energy, construction, railroad, medical and information technology. Park is the first South Korean president to visit the Western-allied Gulf nation in eight years. During her stay, the two sides are also set to announce plans to ease entry of South Koreans to Kuwait, Ju told reporters. Park will also seek Kuwait’s support for peace on the Korean Peninsula and discuss security issues in the Middle East region, he added. Park will then fly to Saudi Arabia on March 4 for a two-day visit to meet newly crowned King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. The two previously met for a summit in Seoul in November. The leaders are to seek expansion of bilateral cooperation in energy, construction, health and communication technology as well as security issues. “Saudi Arabia is one of our core allies that has no diplomatic ties established with North Korea,” said Ju. “We will reconfirm Saudi’s consistent support for South Korea and our policies toward North Korea.” Park also plans to meet Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, chairman of Kingdom Holding Company of Saudi Arabia, popularly known as the Warren Buffet of the Middle East. At her third destination, the UAE, Park plans to meet with Mohammed bin Zayed bin Al Nahyan, prince crown of Abu Dhabi, before heading to Qatar on March 6. It will be their third summit since Park entered office in early 2013. “The UAE has been our strategic partner and we will seek to diversify cooperation in (the) medical, food (and) culture (industries),” the senior presidential secretary said. The Korean government plans to intensify medical cooperation with the UAE to improve the quality of medical service there. Park also plans to meet Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani in return for the Qatari leader’s visit to South Korea in November. Park’s visit is expected to secure more business opportunities for Korean firms in Qatar, the host of the 2022 World Cup.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","middle east next week ,her nine day trip ,officials said thursday park ,on sunday she plans ,business opportunities for korean","['Park Geun', 'korean', 'south korean', 'Kuwait', 'Saudi Arabia', 'the United Arab Emirates', 'Qat']",3,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.55958384  0.73443443

""Not only is the anti-adultery law gradually losing its place in the world, it no longer reflects our people's way of thinking.""  Two other justices supported this view, saying family issues should not be criminal, or even if so, the weight of the penalty should vary according to the intricacy of the matter.  The remaining two justices voiced opposition, saying the law was necessary to protect sexual ethics and the institution of marriage.Under the landmark ruling, some 5,400 people indicted or convicted of adultery after Oct. 30, 2008, when the law was last upheld, may ask for a suspension of indictment or a retrial.  South Korea had been one of the few remaining countries in Asia that prohibits infidelity, next to North Korea and Taiwan. Extramarital affairs here had been banned under the criminal law since 1953, and before that, only women were held accountable for some fooling around.  Sentences have been relatively heavy, with jail time ranging up to two years being the only fate a cheater and his affair partner could face. In Taiwan, the sentences range up to just one year in prison.  Previously, the court had turned down petitions to repeal the law four times from 1990 to 2008. In 2008, however, the judges supporting personal freedom became a majority, but were only one vote shy of realizing a change. Some 100,000 South Koreans have been convicted of adultery since 1953. But the conviction rate dwindled from two-thirds between 1985 and now, to below 1 percent between late 2008 and early this year.  Many experts and activists welcomed the ruling, saying it demonstrated progress in women's rights.  ""The anti-cheating law has been traditionally aimed at punishing women, but those days are long gone now,"" Song Jae-ryong, a sociology professor at Kyung Hee University, said.  Others said the law was practically non-existent, as it had lost its effectiveness in preventing infidelity.  ""The anti-adultery law is no longer achieving its purpose,"" Kim Jeong-beom, a law professor at Hangyang University, said. ""Penalties have become extremely light and don't have the preventative effect they're supposed to have.""  The state shouldn't interfere in personal matters, which should be settled in a civil manner, another expert said.  Public reaction, however, was mixed, with some voicing concerns that the ruling may encourage promiscuity.  ""I'm worried that the decision would make people less responsible to their spouses,"" said Lee Gyu-yeong, a teacher.  But others supported it, saying it enhanced personal freedom.  ""It's not appropriate for the criminal code to intervene in people's love life,"" Kim Min-soo, an office worker, said. ""And it's not like the ruling would make people feel freer to cheat than before.""

The report, obtained by The Associated Press, makes clear the challenge of keeping banned arms and luxury goods from a nuclear-armed country with a history of using front companies to duck detection. The U.N. Security Council holds consultations Thursday on the report, which also says North Korea's government persists with its nuclear and missile programs in defiance of council resolutions. The council last year imposed sanctions on OMM after Panama in 2013 seized a ship it operated that carried undeclared military equipment from Cuba. Panamanian authorities found two Cuban fighter jets, missiles and live munitions beneath the Chong Chon Gang's cargo of sugar. The council's sanctions committee said that violated a U.N. arms embargo imposed in response to North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. At the time, U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power said that imposing a global asset freeze on OMM meant that the company would no longer be able to operate internationally. But the new report says that in the months after the sanctions were imposed, 13 of the 14 ships controlled by OMM changed their owners and managers, ""effectively erasing"" the company from a database kept by the International Maritime Organization. Twelve of the ships ""reportedly stayed, visited or were sighted near ports in foreign countries,"" and none were frozen by member states as the panel of experts recommends. The new report explores the shipping company's global reach, using people and entities operating in at least 10 countries: Brazil, China, Egypt, Greece, Japan, Malaysia, Peru, Russia, Singapore and Thailand. The report recommends updating the sanctions list with 34 OMM entities and says all 14 vessels should be subject to sanctions.  No interdictions of the kind that Panama made in 2013 were reported in the period between Feb. 8 of last year and Feb. 5 of this year. But the new report warns that the panel of experts sees no evidence that North Korea ""intends to cease prohibited activities."" The report also says diplomats, officials and trade representatives of North Korea continue to ""play key roles in facilitating the trade of prohibited items, including arms and related materiel and ballistic missile-related items."" The panel of experts warns that some U.N. member states still are not implementing the council resolutions that are meant to keep North Korea from further violations. North Korea also faces an embargo on luxury goods, but the report found that it managed to bring in luxury goods from multiple countries, including with the help of its diplomatic missions. Some items were for the country's Masik Pass luxury ski report, which opened in 2013. China told the panel of experts that the ski lift equipment it provided was acceptable because ""skiing is a popular sport for people"" and that ski items are not specifically prohibited. In another case, a yacht seen alongside leader Kim Jong Un in 2013 was sourced by the panel of experts to a British manufacturer, Princess Yachts International, which the panel said did not reply to a request for more information. The panel also said it has opened its first investigation into a case involving North Korean drones after the wreckage of three drones was found in South Korea in late 2013 and 2014. The report says the drones had been used for reconnaissance over South Korean military facilities and that the drones contained components ""sourced from at least six foreign countries."" North Korea protests that the U.N. sanctions are harmful to its citizens, but the report says it has found no incidents where they ""directly resulted in shortages of ... humanitarian aid."" It does recommend that the sanctions committee propose exemptions for purely food, medical or other humanitarian needs.

It will mark the first time that a top North Korean diplomat will address the U.N. rights council.  Pyongyang has long been labeled one of the worst human rights violators in the world. The communist regime does not tolerate dissent, holds hundreds of thousands of people in political prison camps, and keeps tight control over outside information.  In December, the United Nations General Assembly formally adopted a landmark resolution that pushes to refer the North to the International Criminal Court for human rights violations.  The U.N. Commission of Inquiry unveiled its report in February 2014 that accused Pyongyang of ""systematic, widespread and grave violations of human rights.""  During his three-day visit to Geneva that starts on Monday, Cho will also deliver a speech at the Conference on Disarmament on Wednesday, calling for global attention to resolve North Korea's nuclear weapons program, the foreign ministry said.  North Korea's top diplomat Ri is also expected to speak at the conference earlier on Tuesday, which is also the first of its kind, according to the source.  Established in 1979, the Conference on Disarmament is a multilateral forum to negotiate arms control and disarmament.

Pickled foods, unlike kimchi and other fermented foods, are often boiled and thus sterile.  South Korea, which has no such restrictions, imports more than $100 million worth of kimchi from China every year.  Beijing's move follows repeated requests from Seoul. The two countries agreed at their summit in Seoul in July last year that they would expand cooperation and exchanges in the food sector and review regulatory standards.  China has also notified the World Trade Organization of its move to ease its rules on pickled foods, according to officials from South Korea's Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs.  The two countries on Wednesday initialed their bilateral free trade agreement, under which South Korea agreed to reduce its import tariffs on kimchi imports from China.

It was the lowest number of elementary school-level children since the data was first compiled in 1965.  The number of middle school students was also cut in half to 286,826 last year, the first figure coming under the 300,000-threshold since 1971, the data showed.  The shrinking underage population also led to smaller school classrooms, with an average of 30.2 students sitting together in one classroom. It was a sharp fall from the average of 51.9 in 1994.  The data came as South Korea's fertility rate has been stalling between 1.2 to 1.3 children per woman in recent years. It is the lowest level among the member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.  Meanwhile, the data also showed that 80.6 percent of Seoul's middle and high schoolers were under stress for various reasons ranging from school records, family matters, relations with friends as well as looks.   Only one of every 100 students sought teachers for stress consultation while the majority of them chose to consult their friends, according to the data.

The nation's spy agency said Tuesday that the teen has been receiving training there.  Countries that include Turkey and Iraq have been used as the main gateways by aspiring foreign terrorist fighters to cross into Syria to join IS.  The 18-year-old, identified only by his surname Kim, disappeared on Jan. 10 during a trip to the southern Turkish city of Kilis, situated near the border with Syria.  Since Kim's disappearance, the Seoul government has requested that Syria's neighboring countries beef up border control to prevent South Koreans from traveling to Syria and other nations put on Seoul's travel ban list.  Seoul has imposed travel bans on six countries -- Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Afghanistan and Yemen.  South Korea's foreign ministry said it held a meeting with 15 local travel agencies earlier in the day to seek cooperation on safe travel for its citizens.  ""Travel agencies are advised not to sell travel packages involving countries near Syria as there is a high chance that local travelers can become a target of terrorists there,"" Lee Myung-yul, director-general at the foreign ministry's consular affairs bureau, said at the start of the meeting.  Meanwhile, the Seoul government has held a series of meetings as part of moves to implement the United Nations resolution on curbing FTFs, according to government sources.  The government has tentatively concluded that Seoul is able to punish people who are suspected of joining terrorist groups or conducting terror acts with a set of current laws.  A review of domestic legal procedures to punish FTFs has been underway around the world as a follow-up to the U.N. resolution slamming violent extremism.  In September last year, the U.N. Security Council adopted resolution 2178 calling on cooperation to prevent travel and support for FTFs.

It will also become available at the official web portal of the South Korean government (http://www.korea.net).A separate pamphlet will be handed out at elementary, middle and high schools nationwide as educational material for teachers, the ministry added.The pamphlet will contain dozens of ancient documents, maps and old photos proving South Korea's ownership of the islets. About 15,000 copies of the pamphlet will be distributed, according to the ministry.

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has inspected an artillery and landing exercise by front-line units deployed near the Yellow Sea, Pyongyang`s media reported Saturday.(Yonhap)The 4th Corp. led the North's shelling of a South Korean border island, Yeonpyeong, in November 2010, which killed four South Korean marines and civilians and wounded more than a dozen others. Conducted at the direct instruction of Kim, the main aim of the latest training was to prepare for a fight against the United States, it added.""The entire army should make their training more intense, as the anti-Japanese guerrillas did in Mount Paektu, to prepare all soldiers as stalwart combatants and turn all units into an iron-willed guards unit and thus bring the anti-U.S. confrontation to the final conclusion by crushing the enemies promptly in case they pounce upon the DPRK,"" Kim was quoted as saying. The DPRK is the acronym for the North's formal name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.The Rodong Sinmun, a newspaper published by the ruling Workers' Party, also carried a story, coupled with related photos, on Kim's so-called field guidance.The pictures showed the firing of multiple rockets and Kim, in black coat, watching the exercise through binoculars. A tablet PC was seen on his table at a command post.He was accompanied by Hwang Pyong-so, director of the general political bureau of the North's military, Defense Minister Hyon Yong-chol and several other senior military officials.The North's media did not specify the timing of the training and its venue. The reports came a couple of days after Lunar New Year's Day, one of the biggest annual celebrations for Koreans.The South Korean government said the live-fire training was held on Friday afternoon, in which Silkworm anti-ship missiles, SA-2 surface-to-air missiles and 122mm self-propelled artillery were mobilized.The Chinese-made Silkworm missile has a range of up to around 95 kilometers, which means Seoul and the nearby Gyeonggi Province are within its reach. The North is known to have more than 180 SA-2s that can fly as far as about 48 kilometers.""The North Korean military seems to have conducted the island strike and landing exercise this time with South Korea's western border islands in mind,"" despite Kim Jong-un's talk of the U.S. threat, a source at the South's defense ministry said.Meanwhile, the North's Rodong Sinmun took a swipe at the new Pentagon chief, Ashton Carter, for his recent remarks that the communist nation's intercontinental ballistic missiles pose a direct threat to his country.The newspaper called Carter a ""war lunatic,"" accusing him of trying to escalate tension and seeking a cause for deploying the THAAD missile defense system on the Korean Peninsula.

Moscow has been reaching out to Pyongyang in recent months in an apparent effort to increase its influence in inter-Korean affairs and secure investment from the South in major trilateral economic projects, such as a joint industrial district, railway, gas pipeline and power grid. With the country celebrating the 70th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany this year, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he had received “positive” signs that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un would join a ceremony on May 8 in Moscow, which would be Kim’s first overseas trip since taking power in December 2012. Yet the outreach poses a dilemma for South Korea. Vladimir Putin. (EPA-Yonhap)President Park Geun-hye is also invited, so the event may set the stage for an unprecedented meeting with Kim and thus open a chance to break the prolonged stalemate in cross-border ties. It would also likely serve as a much-needed catalyst for her drive for greater Eurasian cooperation, the centerpiece of her third-year diplomatic agenda. Her participation, in contrast, could hit a raw nerve in Washington at a time when the crisis in Ukraine is reigniting Western tension with Moscow. In the wake of the annexation of Crimea, stifling sanctions imposed by the West have prompted Russia to turn to the East, bolstering ties with China, India, South Korea and Central Asia. Confirming that President Barack Obama will be absent, Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser at the White House, recently hinted that the U.S. hoped Park would not travel to Russia, stressing the need for “one voice” among allies. “In terms of our allies around the world, I think the key point we’ve made is that it’s important for the world to speak with one voice on behalf of the principle of respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity and the notion that bigger nations should not be able to bully smaller ones, to redraw maps,” he said at a news conference in Washington last week. Shepherd Iverson, a professor of the Center for Korean Studies at Inha University in Incheon, said the U.S. was still vital for South Korean interests. “The penultimate economic and military power in the world is the U.S., and will remain so for some time. The Chinese and South Korean economies are intricately intertwined and depend on Western markets for their success. South Korea ultimately depends on the U.S. for its survival,” he said.“North Korea is the Ukraine of East Asia.”Japan, too, has sought to enhance relations with Russia with attempts to resolve a territorial dispute, boost energy imports and invest in the Far East and Siberia development. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has held five summits with President Vladimir Putin since his swearing-in in December 2012. Yet the efforts came to naught when Tokyo joined the anti-Russia sanctions ― under pressure from Washington, its top ally and security provider, and as a member of the Group of 7 major economies. Abe has yet to decide whether he will take part in the celebration.A growing number of Seoul officials are inclined to decline the invitation, though they say for the time being that no decision has been made and all related factors will be taken into account. Park’s attendance, they say, would only grant Kim a diplomatic coup and increase Moscow’s leverage in the face of icy relations between Pyongyang and Beijing. In addition, a summit held on the margins of a multilateral conference would be less likely to produce substantive results. “She should not be there, all the more so if Kim Jong-un is coming ― he will be a scene-stealer, attracting all the international media attention,” a senior official said, asking for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. “But we need to continue efforts to better Russian ties such as through the Rajin-Khasan project,” he added, referring to the fledgling initiative to refurbish a port city and railroad near the North Korea-Russia border.Another official said, “There would be few incentives that we could gain from her trip. … And Moscow doesn’t seem to be the best place for the leaders of the two Koreas to meet for the first time.” Some experts argue that Park should go, not just for talks with the young leader, but to prevent the current situation from shaping up like the timeworn contest between South Korea, the U.S. and Japan and North Korea, China and Russia. Given Beijing’s aloofness toward Pyongyang, Moscow’s efforts could expedite not only her “Eurasia Initiative” but also inter-Korean rapprochement and possibly the resumption of the six-nation denuclearization talks, they note. “I think it is humiliating (for South Korea) to follow orders from across the ocean and to not pursue its own interests ― relations with the North ― and lose a chance for an inter-Korean summit on a neutral soil,” Georgy Toloraya, director of Korean programs at the Institute of Economy at the Russian Academy of Science, said in an email interview with The Korea Herald. “I think what Russia is doing is aimed at helping South Korea to improve relations with North Korea and get back to reconciliation process.” North Korea, for its part, is realigning its old relationships with China and Russia, after years of oscillating between the two patrons according to its interests following the Cold War era. Many experts assess that Pyongyang’s ties with Beijing are at a post-Cold War low, chiefly driven by the Kim regime’s tests of a long-range missile and then a nuclear device just a few months ahead of President Xi Jinping’s inauguration. Then the young ruler executed Jang Song-thaek, his uncle and the country’s second-most influential man, who had built up political and business ties with China. Xi was the first Chinese leader to visit Seoul before Pyongyang. “While trying to work out its own salvation given frosty ties with China, North Korea is leaning toward Russia,” Ko Jae-nam, a professor of European and African studies at the state-run Korea National Diplomatic Academy, wrote in a paper released Thursday. “Russia is also seeking to expand its influence over the peninsula by enhancing North Korea relations, which in fact has paid off to a considerable extent. If Kim Jong-un indeed accepts the invitation and attends the May ceremony, which I believe he quite likely will, it will trigger repercussions in relations between the two Koreas and their respective ties with Russia.” Iverson said “win-win plans” for three-party rail or pipeline projects would have a positive impact. But their success would require strenuous behind-the-scenes negotiations, and Seoul would need to step up diplomacy efforts given the current tension between the U.S. and Russia. “Washington knows that South Korea has been trying for years to get a pipeline and a railroad thorough North Korea connecting itself with Russia. In traveling to Moscow, President Park and her delegation may refer to economic self-interest. This is no surprise to the U.S.,” he said. “It is obviously not an opportune time to symbolically support Russia or to emphasize a growing friendship. Putin has never been politically weaker domestically.”By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","korea russia is adding ,russia adds to geopolitical ,russia is adding to ,courting of north korea ,russia is adding","['North Korea', 'Russia', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Moscow', 'Pyongyang', 'inter - korean']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.88921613  0.46417829

They stressed that no government has the right to “censor history.”The textbook says Japanese troops forcibly mobilized some 200,000 women, aged between 14 and 20, to make them work at comfort stations, or frontline military brothels. It also touches on the harrowing lives of the victims including some who were allegedly murdered after being caught fleeing.During a parliamentary session late last month, Abe said he was “very surprised (by the false description),” a comment that reignited criticism from South Korea and other countries.“Since the international community failed to fix what should have been corrected, such a textbook is being used in the U.S. Should we just sit quietly, the world will not look at us positively. We should clearly make our claims,” Abe reportedly said during the session.The comfort women topic has long been the thorniest issue in South Korea-Japan relations. Tokyo argues that all colonial-era concerns including the sexual slavery issue have been settled under a 1965 deal that normalized the bilateral relationship, and that there is no evidence to confirm the victims were forcibly mobilized by Japan’s military.But Seoul argues that the issue was not covered under the deal and should be dealt with separately from other issues, given that it concerns universal human rights.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","sex slaves thank historians ,gratitude to 19 historians ,former sex slaves thank ,sexual enslavement on monday ,slaves thank historians","['korean', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'Tokyo', 'the House of Sharing', 'Gyeonggi Province']",3,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -0.6560722   0.25745553

At the time, both men concurred on the need to hold dedicated talks at the earliest possible date.The source said no agenda has been set for the possible talks, although media reports from Tokyo speculated the finance ministers could address their efforts if the United States hikes it key rates as expected later this year.Any move by the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise rates could bring about market volatility and adversely affect certain financial markets in Asia and developing economies. The two ministers could discuss economic and fiscal conditions facing both countries, the source said.Such a meeting, if held, could conceivably segue into a new currency swap arrangement, financial watchers say.There have been consistent reports from Japan that the current $10 billion swap deal will expire on Feb. 23 due to a clash of political egos and pride. Under this arrangement, each country can use their respective currencies to get U.S. dollars from the other side at a pre-determined rate, which could come in handy in an emergency. The pact was originally set up in July 2001, with the total that can be swapped being expanded at one time to $70 billion.

Texts for Japanese history and world history classes in high school only briefly deal with the issue.Future textbooks should have clearer descriptions of the forced nature of the sex work and the issues surrounding the victims' human rights, the ministry said.The ministry also said it will develop separate teaching materials on the former sex slaves, possibly to be released by the start of the new school year next month, so that teachers can better educate students on the issue.Historians estimate there were about 200,000 sex slaves from all over Asia. Most of them are believed to have been Korean, though the South Korean government only has 238 registered in its database.Japan has yet to atone properly for its wartime sexual slavery and has not paid direct compensation to any of the victims. South Korea has pressed Japan to address the long-running grievances by extending a formal apology and compensating the victims. But Japan has refused to do so, saying the matter was settled by a 1965 treaty that normalized relations between the two countries.

John Kirby said during a press briefing in response to a question about whether the U.S. has had any talks with South Korea about the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system.“There’s constant discussions and certainly with our South Korean allies about that. But I have no detail to provide, and certainly no announcements to make with respect to that,” the spokesman said.The remark appeared to run counter to what South Korean and U.S. officials have repeatedly said so far, that there have been no official consultations between the two countries about deploying a THAAD battery to South Korea.But Lt. Col. Jeff Pool, a Pentagon press officer, said Kirby’s comments are not different from previous positions as officials from the two sides have often talked informally to each other about the issue because, for example, there have been frequent press reports about it in South Korean media.He stressed that there are no serious or official talks underway currently.“It would be untruthful to say that we haven’t informally discussed (it) because we already had a site survey in the ROK (South Korea) and Gen. Scaparrotti said that he wanted it,” Pool said, referring to the commander of U.S. Forces Korea.“Also, there are false stories regularly in ROK press about THAAD, so we must discuss with our counterparts,” he said.“Unfortunately some news outlets will choose to distort what the spokesperson said and that will cause unnecessary concern and confusion regarding this important topic.”The possibility of the U.S. deploying a THAAD battery in South Korea has been the focus of attention in Seoul because such a deployment is seen by critics as part of a broader U.S. attempt to get the Asian ally to join its missile defense system.The deployment could inflame tensions with China and Russia because they see the move as a threat to their security interests.The two countries have repeatedly expressed concern and opposition at such a possibility. (Yonhap)","constant thaad discussions pentagon ,the pentagon press secretary ,pentagon press secretary ,said during press briefing ,pentagon press secretary said","['the United States', 'South Korea', 'Pentagon', 'John Kirby', 'U.S.', 'South Korea']",3,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.72769827  0.66667479

According to the nation’s Health Ministry, more than 95 percent of measles patients in Korea last year were infected during an overseas trips, or by those who had traveled abroad.The number of measles patients in Korea quadrupled from 107 in 2013 to 442 last year. Many were infected in China or the Philippines. According to last year’s WHO data, Asia has the most suspected measles cases, with China on top, followed by the Philippines and Vietnam. Over 100,000 measles cases were reported in China and the Philippines alone last year, with the latter’s immunization program interrupted by Typhoon Haiyan. The spread of the virus has accelerated due to mass migration in the island country, with almost 4 million people displaced by the natural disaster.Measles outbreaks have been recently reported in North America this year after people were infected at Disneyland in California.“Measles cases are still being reported occasionally in China and the Philippines, and those who are unvaccinated have a 90 percent chance of catching the disease once exposed to the virus,” the Health Ministry said in a statement. “We encourage everyone who plans to go abroad to get their vaccinations before leaving the country.”Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease that spreads through the air by sneezing or coughing. Symptoms include runny nose, coughing, red eyes and fever along with a rash of red dots that can cover one’s entire body.In 2013, more than 145,000 died from measles worldwide. According to the WHO, more than 95 percent of measles deaths occur in nations with low per capita incomes and poor health care systems.Those who have had measles in the past, as well as those who received the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine are considered to be immune to the disease. Those who have never had measles and never received a vaccine are encouraged to get vaccinated, said South Korea’s Health Ministry.

The 20-year-old student attacked Sunday is the second Japanese woman raped in India in recent months. The man had met her in Jaipur and offered to act as her tour guide, according to police inspector general D.C. Jain.The man later took the woman on his motorcycle to a farming village outside the city in Rajasthan state, where he raped her on the side of the road before leaving her, Jain said. Villagers who heard the woman crying helped her contact police. A medical examination confirmed the woman had been raped. Police were searching for a man in his 20s and were certain ""the person who committed the rape is from Jaipur,"" Jain said, though police have yet to identify a particular suspect.The case was just one in a series of ongoing cases that has renewed public fury and horror over India's inability to halt chronic violence against women, despite strengthening laws against sex crimes in 2013. In December, a 22-year-old research scholar from Japan was held captive and gang raped for nearly three weeks in a village near a Buddhist pilgrimage center in Bihar state. Police have arrested several suspects in that case, which also involved a tourist guide who had offered to help the woman with sightseeing. She escaped from captivity on Dec. 26 and fled to the eastern city of Kolkata. In another case, police said Monday that they had arrested eight people suspected in the rape and murder of a Nepalese woman in the northwest Indian state of Haryana.  The 28-year-old woman had been staying with her sister when she went missing Feb. 1. Her mutilated body was discovered three days later, and an autopsy revealed that several organs were missing and that objects including stones, blades and a stick had been inserted into her body, police said. ""This is a matter of serious crime,'' police superintendent Shashank Anand said in announcing that a special investigative team had been formed.The woman's sister joined hundreds of protesters in criticizing police for moving too slowly in the case during a candlelight demonstration that blocked traffic on a major road outside of New Delhi over the weekend. She told reporters she wanted the culprits to be hanged. ""I get chills when I think of what happened to my sister, I want justice for my sister,"" she said. She has not been named, in accordance with Indian laws that forbid the identification of rape victims.","who raped japanese student ,raped japanese student sightseeing ,second japanese woman raped ,man who raped japanese ,raping and killing nepalese","['JAIPUR', 'India', 'AP', 'japanese', 'India', 'nepalese', 'japanese', 'India']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27962899  0.18168633

The book also touches on the harrowing lives of the victims including some who were allegedly murdered after being caught fleeing.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe attends an Upper House Budget Committee meeting of Parliament in Tokyo, Monday, Feb. 2. (AP)During a parliamentary session late last month, Abe said he was “very surprised (at the false description),” a comment that reignited criticism from South Korea and elsewhere in the world.“As a result of the international community failing to fix what should have been corrected, such a textbook is being used in the U.S. Should we sit quietly, the world would not look at us positively. We should clearly make our claims,” he said during the session.In the historians’ statement, they supported McGraw-Hill, underscoring that “they stand with many historians in Japan and elsewhere that have worked to bring to light the facts about the comfort women issue and other wartime atrocities.”“We practice and produce history to learn from the past. We therefore oppose the efforts of states or special interests to pressure publishers or historians to alter the results of their research for political purposes,” the statement said.The comfort women issue has long been the thorniest issue in South Korea-Japan relations. Tokyo has long argued that the issue has been settled under a 1965 deal that normalized the bilateral relationship, and that there is no evidence to confirm the victims were forcibly mobilized by Japan’s military.But Seoul argues that the issue was not covered under the deal and should be dealt with separately from other issues, given that it concerns universal human rights, an issue that goes beyond the bilateral relationship.For the U.S., Tokyo’s apparent moves to whitewash wartime atrocities are disheartening as it is also the victim of Japan’s 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor in which historians say some 2,400 Americans were killed. Historical revisionists in Japan argue their country staged the war to fend off Western powers’ invasions of East Asia and should be credited with the endeavors to “liberate” the Asian region. They also say their wartime wrongdoings are exaggerated or falsified.By Song Sang-ho and news reports (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","american scholars decried tokyo ,protest against the moves ,whitewash atrocities international criticism ,19 american scholars decried ,scholars decried tokyo recent","['Tokyo', 'U.S.', 'american', 'Tokyo', 'U.S.']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36211088  0.54887217

Currently, 53 Korean victims are alive with their average age standing at 88.  ""As this year is a landmark year for the Seoul-Tokyo relations, the government will ramp up more efforts to help heal your pains and restore your dignity,"" Cho told a meeting with six victims of Japan's sex slaves.  The sex slavery issue has been the main impediment to improvement in the relations between Seoul and Tokyo at a time when this year marks the 50th anniversary of normalization of the diplomatic ties between the two nations.  This year also marks the 70th anniversary of Seoul's liberation from Tokyo's 1910-45 colonial rule.  In April, the two historical rivals launched the talks on the sex slavery issue, but progress has been meager as Japan has been reluctant to sincerely apologize for the issue.  ""South Korea will utilize all available resources to let the global community more understand that this is also an issue of universal human rights on the top of the bilateral historic issue,"" he added.  Cho left a message on a visitors' book that reads that the Seoul government will do its best to help the victims regain their dignity while they are alive and not to make their courageous confession fruitless.  During the meeting with Cho, the victims spoke about their painful experiences, slamming Japan for not sincerely apologizing for its wartime atrocities.  ""I want to see the Japanese government apologize for (this issue) before I die,"" said Yi Ok-seon, 88.  Yoo Hee-nam, 86, said that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe does not even blink an eye at Tokyo's horrible wartime acts.  ""I hope that the Korean government will help ease our pains and sorrows before we all die by letting the issue be further known globally.""  Abe has irked Seoul and Beijing, both victims of Tokyo's wartime aggression, as Japan has attempted to whitewash its past military atrocities.  Abe said last month that he would not use key words from Japan's previous apologies for its wartime atrocities in his new statement that will be issued in August to mark the 70th anniversary of the country's defeat in World War II.  The Japanese premier said that he will express remorse over Japan's role in the war, but there is a prevailing view that he will water down the spirit of past administrations' apologies.  Japan issued two key statements containing apologies for past wrongdoing -- the 1993 apology on the sex slavery issue, named the Kono Statement, and the 1995 apology for Japan's colonial rule, named the Murayama Statement.  South Korea demands that Japan show sincerity by settling the sex slave issue ""in a way that is agreeable to the living victims,"" including through a sincere apology and compensation.  Japan has long dismissed Seoul's demands, claiming that all grievances related to its colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula were settled through a 1965 treaty that normalized their bilateral ties.

Nineteen scholars belonging to the American Historical Association co-signed the joint statement titled, ""Standing with Historians of Japan.""  ""The statement matters now because the history involved -- the so-called 'comfort women' -- has long been accepted as fact not only in Japan but also around the world. Targeting this particular history now for political reasons ... raises serious concerns about the state of academic freedom in Japan today,"" the professor said.  ""As for Prime Minister Abe, it is important ... to understand that memory and history are different things. In this instance we have a politician who would openly supplant long proven histories with preferred national memories,"" he said.  The statement is ""an act of professional solidarity with historians in Japan and elsewhere -- South Korea, the Philippines, Australia, Indonesia -- who research and write about these issues, Dudden said.  ""Our aim is to show respect and solidarity for the efforts of historians everywhere who have long worked on the so-called comfort women issue and have published their work according to professional standards of evidence and multiple cross-referencing. This is how we produce the work we do, and why we hold to it as accurate and proven,"" he said.  In the joint statement, the scholars expressed ""dismay"" at Japan's pressuring of the textbook publisher, accusing the Abe administration of ""vocally questioning the established history of the comfort women and seeking to eliminate references to them in school textbooks"" as part of its effort to promote patriotic education.  They also stressed that ""no government should have the right to censor history.""  ""We practice and produce history to learn from the past. We therefore oppose the efforts of states or special interests to pressure publishers or historians to alter the results of their research for political purposes,"" the statement said.  Dudden stressed that ""academic freedom is at stake"" when certain political views summon history.  ""This is how memory takes over what it calls history by picking and choosing from the past at will instead of learning from it,"" he said.  ""Our small group agrees that it is the responsibility of historians who are able to practice in societies as open as the United States to recognize moments when colleagues elsewhere are themselves targeted and have their work targeted,"" he added.  Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mainly from Korea, which was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. But Japan has long attempted to whitewash the atrocity.  The sexual slavery issue has been the biggest thorn in frayed relations between Japan and South Korea, with Seoul demanding Japan take steps to address the grievances of elderly Korean victims of the atrocity and Japan refusing to do so.

Efforts to normalize relations have stalled over Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programmes and on the continuing distrust over the kidnapping of Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 80s.  Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Koreans live in Japan, mostly a legacy of those who emigrated or were forced to move to Japan during its 1910-1945 colonial rule of the Korean peninsula.  About 10 percent are believed to be affiliated with Chongryon, which charges that the community is persecuted by authorities and harassed by right-wing activists.

(Yonhap)About 50.4 percent of Japanese students took issue with Abe’s denial that the Japanese military had forcibly turned women in Korea and other Asian countries into “comfort women,” a euphemism referring those coerced into sexual slavery by Japan during World War II. The survey by Seo Kyoung-duk, professor of general education at Sungshin Women’s University, was conducted on 250 students from South Korea and another 250 from Japan.Only 18 percent of Japanese students said Abe was “headed in the right direction” while another 18 percent said his approach was “controversial but inevitable for Japan’s future.” Some 13.6 percent called it a “failed policy.” Students from both South Korea and Japan thought their discord in history-related issues like comfort women and the South Korean islets of Dokdo was the biggest hindrance in the relationship between the two countries ― 78.4 percent of the former and 46.4 percent of the latter saying so. But 19.2 percent of Japan’s youth said Abe’s political stance was the biggest obstacle.“Japanese students’ discontent with Abe was not something I anticipated. It showed that the current (Japanese) administration may not be as popular as it claims to be,” said Seo. Abe’s administration has attempted to whitewash Japan’s wartime atrocities like comfort women, one of the thorny issues in South Korea-Japan relations. It recently asked a U.S. textbook publisher to revise its description of Japan’s sexual enslavement of some 200,000 Asian women.His attempt backfired when the publisher shot down the request and said “scholars are aligned behind the historical fact of comfort women.” U.S. Congressman Mike Honda even called Abe’s tactics “an act of nonsense.”But Seo’s survey also showed that students from two countries had different thoughts on comfort women. Although 94.4 percent of Koreans said Japan needs to apologize and compensate for the comfort women issue, only 32.4 of Japanese agreed.Some 37.6 percent said Japanese government has already compensated sufficiently for its crimes.“I was surprised to see that such high a number of Japanese students thought their government had done enough for the comfort women,” Seo said. “The results showed that Japan’s distortion of history was even more severe than I’d anticipated.”Among possible measures to close the widening gap between the two countries, joint historical research was the most popular choice among students of both countries, with Koreans at 58.4 percent and Japanese at 32 percent. It was followed by a South Korea-Japan summit, more exchange in the private sector, cultural exchanges and economic cooperation.

It is the most advanced variant of the T-50 family operated by the South Korean Air Force.  Equipped with a supersonic advanced light attack platform, the aircraft can carry a weapons load of up to 4.5 tons and be armed with such precision-guided weapons as the GBU-38/B Joint Direct Attack Munitions and CBU-105 Sensor Fused Weapon.  ""We could be a favorable bidder, as KAI won a $200 million deal for 20 KT-1 basic trainer aircraft from Peru in November 2012,"" another source said.   Indonesia bought 16 units in 2011 and Iraq purchased 24 in 2013. The latest export was to the Philippines, which bought 12 units.  South Korea's vice defense minister, Baek Seung-joo, meanwhile, asked the Peruvian authorities to show ""interest in South Korean companies that have been participating in the fighter purchase project,"" his office said.  He is in Lima for a three-day visit starting Monday as part of his Latin American tour that began Friday and also took him to Colombia.

South Korea has so far sent 19 in two batches to an Ebola treatment center in Goderich, near capital Freetown.The decision came as Seoul has accepted a recommendation from Emergency, an Italian non-government agency in charge of the Ebola center, as new cases of the disease have been on the decline, according to the foreign ministry.The number of fresh infections came in at 65 in the third week of January in Sierra Leone, down from 337 in the same period of December last year, the government said.Seoul's third team of medical workers will kick-start a four-week operation from Feb. 23 after undergoing training.An official at the foreign ministry added that Seoul also sent a set of tablet PCs and electronic stethoscopes last week to Emergency to help treat Ebola patients.South Korea has joined global efforts to fight Ebola by sending medical workers and offering a combined $12.6 million in assistance. The virus is estimated to have killed more than 8,700 people since the outbreak in December 2013, according to the World Health Organization.

In contrast, market share by foreign brands reached 56.8 percent.The local producer lost its share as the government marked up prices of a pack of cigarettes by 80 percent, or by 2,000 won ($1.82), this year. Officials said they were aiming to encourage people to quit smoking.KT&G; remained the best-selling brand, but Philip Morris, British American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco Inc. made headway in the first month of the year, the convenience store operator said.Philip Morris accounted for 24.4 percent of all sales followed closely by 23.4 percent for BAT and 9 percent for JTI.In terms of quantity, KT&G;'s market share stood at 38.3 percent, while corresponding numbers for foreign rivals stood at 61.7 percent.Philip Morris' share stood at 21.1 percent, with 29.8 percent being tallied for BAT and 10.8 percent for JTI.Such numbers were broadly repeated for the other convenience store chain that said KT&G;'s sales share dropped to 46.2 percent in the first month of 2015, while in terms of quantity, numbers stood at 40.5 percent.The chain said KT&G; still was ahead of its rivals, but its lead has been eroded drastically compared to last year, while BAT's market presence moved up sharply thanks to the popularity of such products as Vogue.Market watchers said price cuts by foreign brands helped win over consumers.BAT's Vogue sold for 3,500 won per pack, cheaper than the prices for most South Korean cigarettes that sold for 4,500 won.This strategy was emulated by Philip Morris, which adjusted prices of its Marlboro and Parliament brands by 200 won each. These two cigarettes sold for 4,500 won a pack, the same as local brands.KT&G; projected that despite the company losing market share last month, such developments will not last for long.""KT&G; has maintained a market share in the low 50 percent range for quite some time, and this is not likely to be affected in the future,"" a company official said.

As per data released by the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, and Statistics Korea, the number of licensed international marriage agencies dropped by one-third from 1370 firms in 2012. (Yonhap)Behind the drop lies the government’s decision to control the number of marriage brokers to prevent marriage fraud. The Justice Ministry enacted a restrictive rule for issuing a license to marriage brokers in Korea in 2013. However, the measure did not work out. According to figures from Statistics Korea, the number of international marriage frauds has been increasing since 2013. “The increase stems from the government’s misguided policy,” said Lim Dong-won, an associate attorney from Wonjin, Korea-based law firm. “The government’s strict rule pushed out the legitimate agency. Rather, it drew in fraudulent brokers who diversified their tactics to continue their business without holding a license.”One of their common tactics is to give false hope. According to a study of marriage frauds, brokers took advantage of unmarried Korean men by giving them false hopes of a perfect marriage. In fact, the brokers only cared about making money out of arranging a marriage. They never verified whether the bride wanted to marry him in the first place “My wife never wanted to marry me right from the beginning. She only cared about money. She thought of me as someone who should bring money to her and her family members.” an anonymous victim of marriage fraud said in an interview with Munhwa IlboAfter his marriage in December 2013, the couple started slowly drifting apart, so he took her to a local multicultural center for marriage counseling. He bought her a brand new smartphone, and even went so far as to wire 500,000 won to her parents’ account. But she continued to demand more money from him. After five years, she finally left him. Another tactic is to extort money. The brokers did not allow a meeting between the couple until a broker commission was paid. The commission went by different names such as tuition for learning Hangul and cost to settle down in Korea. They even urged clients to pay 500,000 won extra per month as “wife’s rent,” according to the study. “Even though you have completed a contract with a marriage broker, you are most likely to find yourself paying unexpected money for tuition or food,” said Ahn Jae-Sung, a representative to the center for international marriage victims, in an interview with Munhwa Ilbo. “You need to pick up her language and definitely see her in person. I believe it will help you avoid marriage fraud.” By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","korea causing unlicensed brokers ,marriage agencies have lost ,international marriage fraud after ,international marriage agencies dropped ,south korea causing unlicensed","['the Ministry of Justice', 'South Korea', 'the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family', 'Statistics Korea']",3,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.92665797  0.59542221

""It appears the discussions went about what we can always guess.""Even before the meetings, the U.S. had downplayed the contact, saying it would only be ""one of many"" nongovernmental ""Track 2"" meetings held to discuss security issues in East Asia, and that the U.S. government is not involved in it.""Track 2"" diplomacy refers to nongovernmental, unofficial contacts between private citizens or groups of individuals while ""Track 1"" diplomacy refers to officials government-to-government contacts.Relations between the U.S. and the North have worsened further recently following a cyber-attack on Sony Pictures. The U.S. has blamed the North for carrying out the attacks and imposed fresh sanctions, but Pyongyang has categorically denied any involvement.The six-party denuclearization talks with North Korea have been stalled since late 2008.Many analysts say the administration of President Barack Obama has little interest in resuming negotiations with Pyongyang. The U.S. has demanded Pyongyang take concrete steps demonstrating its denuclearization commitments before nuclear talks reopen.

602,602,U.S. envoy: Russia firm on N.K. denuclearization despite Kim's possible trip,"A top U.S. diplomat handling North Korea said Thursday that Russia remained committed to denuclearizing the reclusive state, despite a possible visit by the North's leader Kim Jong-un to Russia in May.

North Korea ...","A top U.S. diplomat handling North Korea said Thursday that Russia remained committed to denuclearizing the reclusive state, despite a possible visit by the North's leader Kim Jong-un to Russia in May. Ambassador Sung Kim, the U.S. special representative for North Korea policy, made the remarks upon his arrival at the Beijing airport for talks with his Chinese counterpart, Wu Dawei, after visiting Tokyo. North Korea has confirmed the attendance of its leader for a May ceremony in Russia marking the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II, the Kremlin said in a statement on Wednesday, without mentioning Kim Jong-un's name.If realized, it would be Kim's first foreign trip since taking the helm of North Korea in late 2011. Some analysts are concerned that closer ties between North Korea and Russia may complicate diplomatic efforts to denuclearize North Korea. Asked about Kim Jong-un's possible visit to Russia in May, Sung Kim replied, ""I have seen reports that the visit might be possible."" ""The main thing is that Russians remain very much committed to denuclearization and the joint statement of the six-party process,"" he said. ""They have made it very clear that they would strongly oppose nuclear tests by North Korea and, in fact, they oppose continuing nuclear activities by North Korea."" The U.S. envoy further said he held ""very productive"" talks in Tokyo with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts and expects to hold ""very substantive and detailed"" talks with his Chinese counterpart in Beijing. North Korea is seeking to deepen both diplomatic and economic ties with Russia at a time when its political relationship with China remains frosty amid international pressure over its nuclear ambitions and dismal human rights record. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has been under intense pressure over the conflict in Ukraine, is also eager to bolster ties with North Korea in an apparent effort against America's pivot to Asia. Putin invited Kim Jong-un to attend the May 9 ceremony during a meeting with Kim's special envoy in November. China is North Korea's main economic benefactor, but political ties between the allies remain strained, particularly after the North's third nuclear test in early 2013.

FINA is headquartered there, but according to the KSF, FINA said it will confirm the specific location of the hearing later.FINA has separately told Park's camp about the hearing, according to the KSF.Park's career appears to be in jeopardy after the news of his failed doping test emerged earlier this week. The KSF has said Park was tested ahead of the Asian Games in the South Korean city of Incheon, which opened in September, and was notified of the result last October.Park, a four-time Olympic medalist and two-time world champ, has blamed the positive test on an injection he took at a local hospital. His agency, Team GMP, is seeking a legal action against the Seoul-based hospital, and state prosecutors said Tuesday Park received a shot of testosterone, a substance banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). Prosecutors are considering indicting the doctor who administered the injection, surnamed Kim, on charges of professional negligence.According to prosecutors, officials from the hospital have claimed that they gave Park the injection to help boost his hormone levels but that they weren't aware that testosterone was a banned substance.Park's camp has told the authorities that the swimmer repeatedly asked the hospital about the contents of the injection and that he was assured that the shot would be clean.Though Park is arguing that he didn't intentionally take the banned substance, he may ultimately be held accountable for the result and face discipline, based on WADA's World Anti-Doping Code.In Article 10, titled ""Sanctions on Individuals,"" the code states that if an athlete can establish that he or she bears no fault or negligence, the athlete may not face sanctions. However, one exception cited by the same code is ""the administration of a prohibited substance by the athlete's personal physician or trainer without disclosure to the athlete.""The code also points out: ""Athletes are responsible for their choice of medical personnel and for advising medical personnel that they cannot be given any prohibited substance.""

But Seoul and Washington have insisted that the North should first show its sincere commitment toward denuclearization.The North offered on Jan. 10 to temporarily halt nuclear tests if the U.S. suspends its annual military exercises with South Korea this year, a proposal flatly rejected by Seoul and Washington.

Korean Air Lines Co. and Asiana Airlines Inc., the nation's two largest air carriers, set the fuel surcharge at $15 for flights bound for the United States for February, far below $165 from a year ago and down from $58 this month. Flights bound for Europe and Africa also will go down from $56 to $15 next month, according to company officials. Hana Tour Co., the nation's largest tour agency, estimated the demand for international air travel will rise 28 percent on-year to about 250,000 people this month, and predicted that 154,000 people will travel abroad in February, up 22 percent from a year ago. The top destinations were Vietnam and Cambodia, followed by Thailand and Japan, the agency said.

Carrying a similar report, the (North) Korean Central Broadcasting Station described the U.S. as a deadly foe and claimed it blatantly revealed an ambition to topple the socialist system.Last week, Obama said in an interview on YouTube that the isolated communist regime is likely to collapse mainly due to the Internet-driven inflow of information.The North's broadcaster also condemned the latest spread of anti-Pyongyang leaflets via balloons in the country by a group of conservative activists in the South.On Sunday, the National Defense Commission, Pyongyang's top ruling organ, warned of stern punishment against South Korea, accusing it of allowing the leaflet campaign and planning to start annual joint military drills with the U.S. in March.

""If Abe really wants to inherit the correct understanding of history, Japan should heal historical wounds so that it can mend ties with its neighboring countries and win confidence from the international community.""In June, Japan angered Seoul and Beijing, both victims of Tokyo's wartime aggression, by saying that its 1993 apology over the sex slave issue was the outcome of a political compromise between Seoul and Tokyo.

The aid will be provided through the Central Emergency Response Fund, which has offered a total of $6.5 million to Pyongyang since 2011. The annual sum given to the communist state has varied each year: $5 million in 2011, $7 million in 2012 and $2.1 million in 2013. U.N. offices based in the North decide on the spending through negotiations with the head of United Nations Development Programme stationed there. Other U.N. affiliated organizations that provide financial aid to the North include the World Food Plan, the Food and Agriculture Organization, the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund. The CERF plans to send $100 million to 12 countries around the world in this batch. Syria will receive the highest amount of $30 million, followed by Lebanon with $18 million.

Hagel is expected to talk about it again when he speaks with Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani later Thursday.Last month, the three countries signed a memorandum of understanding that calls for voluntary sharing of military secrets on North Korea's nuclear and missile programs between the three countries.The deal paved the way for Seoul and Tokyo to share such intelligence via the U.S. after the two countries failed to strike a bilateral intelligence sharing deal in 2012 due in part to negative public sentiment in South Korea about signing such a pact with the former colonial ruler.Now that the MOU has been signed, the three countries should ""get the ball rolling,"" the source said, referring to U.S. efforts to establish a formula to carry out the agreement.The formula is expected to lay out detailed procedures, including how to determine intelligence to be shared. Such procedures are necessary because the three countries have no idea what intelligence the other partners have, the source said.The intelligence sharing deal is considered an effort to get around frayed relations between South Korea and Japan and move trilateral security cooperation forward.Relations between South Korea and Japan have been strained for years due mainly to Tokyo's attempts to whitewash its wartime atrocities and colonial occupation. Their relations worsened further after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe came into office as he took a series of nationalistic steps.The U.S. has called for Seoul and Tokyo to come to terms with each other. Frayed relations between the two key Asian allies are a cause for concern for Washington as it seeks to develop three-way security cooperation in an effort to keep a rising China in check.

Abe is known for his strong nationalist views,” the report said. Abe “brings both positive and negative qualities” to the alliance with the U.S., at once bolstering it but also renewing historical animosities that could disturb the regional security environment, the report said.A poor relationship between South Korea and Japan “jeopardizes U.S. interests by complicating trilateral cooperation on North Korea policy and other regional challenges,” the report said, adding that it also hurts U.S. efforts to build an “integrated U.S.-Japan-South Korea ballistic missile defense system.”In his New Year’s news conference early this month, Abe said he would include Japan’s remorse over the war and how the country will contribute to the region and beyond in a special statement he plans to issue to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of the World War II in August. “International audiences will be watching closely on how Abe handles the upcoming commemorations,” it said. The report pointed out, however, that Abe’s remark about expressing “remorse” for the war in the statement to be issued in August has set off speculation that the “planned document may stop short of a forthright apology.”It also criticized Abe for demonstrating “an inconsistent pattern” of making and then recanting controversial statements that upset China and South Korea, referring to Abe’s 2013 comments that suggested his government would not reaffirm a 1995 statement of apology made by then Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama.The so-called Murayama Statement is regarded as Japan’s most significant official apology for wartime acts, the report said. Abe later backed down from the remark, saying his cabinet shares the same understanding as previous cabinets.

Abe is known for his strong nationalist views,"" the report said. Abe ""brings both positive and negative qualities"" to the alliance with the U.S., at once bolstering it but also renewing historical animosities that could disturb the regional security environment, the report said.A poor relationship between South Korea and Japan ""jeopardizes U.S. interests by complicating trilateral cooperation on North Korea policy and other regional challenges,"" the report said, adding that it also hurts U.S. efforts to build an ""integrated U.S.-Japan-South Korea ballistic missile defense system.""In his New Year's news conference early this month, Abe said he would include Japan's remorse over the war and how the country will contribute to the region and beyond in a special statement he plans to issue to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of the World War II in August. ""International audiences will be watching closely on how Abe handles the upcoming commemorations,"" it said.The report pointed out, however, that Abe's remark about expressing ""remorse"" for the war in the statement to be issued in August has set off speculation that the ""planned document may stop short of a forthright apology.""It also criticized Abe for demonstrating ""an inconsistent pattern"" of making and then recanting controversial statements that upset China and South Korea, referring to Abe's 2013 comments that suggested his government would not reaffirm a 1995 statement of apology made by then Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama.The so-called Murayama Statement is regarded as Japan's most significant official apology for wartime acts, the report said.

Those sex slaves were euphemistically described by the Japanese military as “comfort women.”“The bottom line of Japan’s wartime sex slavery is that Japan systematically mobilized women to perform during the war and the human rights of many women were abused,” Seok said in his article, which was also published in the Chinese language by a Hong Kong-based newspaper, Ta Kung Pao, on Friday.“If the Japanese government of Shinzo Abe continues to take steps toward the wrong path and cause friction with neighboring countries, it will eventually undermine Japan’s own national interests,” Seok said. Japan has yet to atone properly for its wartime sexual slavery and has not paid direct compensation to any of the victims. Earlier this month, Japan’s foreign ministry asked an American publisher to change references of the victims of wartime sex slavery, in a fresh bid to whitewash Japan’s record of wartime atrocities abroad.South Korea has pressed Japan to address long-running grievances by the victims of wartime sex slavery by extending a formal apology and compensating them. But Japan has refused to do so, saying the matter was settled by a 1965 treaty that normalized relations between the two countries.Little progress was reported in this week’s new round of talks between Seoul and Tokyo over wartime sex slavery.

Another faction wants to continue talks with the New Politics Alliance for Democracy to avoid a struggle that could block legislation of other bills.The latter group holds the upper hand, as parliamentary laws require the majority party to present a unanimous front for the divisive bill to pass. The party has 158 of the parliament’s 295 members.The main parties have been divided over the bill since 2005. The Saenuri Party supports a hard-line version that could be used to prosecute Pyongyang officials after unification. The NPAD backs a bill urging Seoul to “persuade” Pyongyang to improve its rights record through regular talks.Saenuri chair Rep. Kim last Thursday suggested ending the near-decade-old partisan impasse by using the so-called fast-track clause in the National Assembly Act, sparking a backlash from NPAD members who called the Saenuri proposal a “bullying tactic.”A draft bill that is designated a fast-track bill is automatically sent up for final vote to a plenary session in 330 days, at which point the majority party can use its superior numbers to approve the law.But labeling it as a fast-track bill requires the support of three-fifths of the parliamentary committee overseeing the legislation. For the North Korea human rights bill, that is the Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee, where the governing party holds 14 of the 23 seats.If all 14 Saenuri lawmakers vote for the Saenuri version of the human rights bill, it will pass. But two senior Saenuri legislators on the panel have openly expressed their opposition to designating the human rights bill as a fast-track legislation.“I see no reason to make a fuss out of this bill,” Saenuri Rep. Choung Byoung-gug said. “There are so many more key bills that we need to pass. I see no reason to draw the ire of the NPAD on this symbolic bill.”Saenuri Rep. Yoo Ki-june, the foreign affairs committee head, expressed a similar opinion.“It will take 330 days to reach the parliament’s full session. By then, this National Assembly will be approaching the end of its term,” he said. The next parliamentary elections are in April 2016, with candidates expected to be announced as early as next January.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","bill amid fierce protest ,party officials on tuesday ,unilaterally passing the bill ,tuesday were torn over ,controversial north korea human","['Saenuri Party', 'North Korea', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.1478813   0.50692749

(Yonhap)""I will also partly reorganize Cheong Wa Dae to improve the work efficiency and help (staff’s) mind take a new turn,” she said. The president also said she will appoint a group of advisors “as soon as possible” to enhance communication between Cheong Wa Dae and the political parties to speed up her economic reform policies.The president, however, didn’t say when she would replace her staff and Cabinet members. Although it appears she may carry out the reshuffle within this month, according to some observers, citing mounting pressure for the revamp from the opposition parties, as well as the sharp drop in her approval rating.According to a local pollster, her job rating plunged to 35 percent last week, the lowest level since she entered office in early 2013. Park had vowed to conduct a reshuffle last week during her New Year’s news conference. But the president said she would keep three secretaries who have been pressured to resign over their alleged involvement in an influence-meddling scandal. She said a decision on the fate of her Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon will be taken later after all pending issues are resolved. But it is widely expected that Park would replace Kim this time as it may be a burden to carry out her reform drive by retaining him. Not only the main opposition party, but also some from the ruling Saenuri Party have been demanding Kim’s removal, accusing him of pulling the strings over state affairs and personnel choices.At the meeting, Park also lamented a recent child abuse case at a day care center in Incheon, stressing that efforts to create safe and healthy child care environment went in vain.Free child care was one of her major welfare campaigns, designed to help mothers with small children return to the workplace and also children with low-income families to have equal opportunities to receive proper care and early education. The Park government, so far, has injected 9 trillion won every year to operate the universal child care system. The program allows parents send their kids to local day care centers for free, and encourages local offices to build more child care facilities.""Despite efforts to create a safe and reliable environment to raise children, it is deplorable that such cases are coming out,” she said. The president ordered the relevant ministries to tighten protection of children and eradicate child abuse cases by closely working together. In a joint measure, the government and the ruling Saenuri Party decided to implement measures to root out child abuse at day care centers. Under the new measures, all children institutions, both private and public, will be required to install surveillance cameras and strengthen qualifications of their staff. The government also plans to shut down any day care center immediately if it is caught engaging in child abuse. Care providers who have been reported or punished for child abuse will be suspended for 10 years.The recent child abuse case sent shockwaves across the country, after a video footage revealed a nanny harshly beating a 4-year-old for not finishing her food.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","in weekly cabinet meeting ,cabinet shake up president ,weekly cabinet meeting ,weekly cabinet meeting presid ,geun hye said tuesday","['Park Geun', 'Cabinet', 'Cabinet', 'Cabinet']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.20357636  0.80820888

The new year also marks the 70th anniversary of Seoul's liberation from Tokyo's colonial rule in 1945.Since taking office in early 2013, South Korean President Park Geun-hye has shunned a summit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as a show of anger against Tokyo's refusal to atone for its historical wrongdoings.In her new year press conference on Jan. 12, Park repeatedly urged Japan to face up to history, warning that the issue could be a ""big burden"" on Japan unless it is quickly resolved.South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se told reporters in Seoul earlier in the day that Japan is seen as not offering sufficient conditions for the bilateral summit to be held.""Japan seems to deal with the sex slavery issue solely from the perspective of a bilateral matter. But the comfort women issue is a matter of universal human rights,"" Yun said.The foreign minister expressed hope that the Seoul-Tokyo talks on the sex slavery could produce progress so that it could set the stage for improvement in bilateral ties.The Seoul-Tokyo ties have plunged to the lowest levels in recent years mainly due to the sex slavery issue. Historians estimate the number of such sex slaves at about 200,000 with only 55 South Korean victims alive today.In June, Japan angered Seoul and Beijing, both victims of Tokyo's wartime aggression, by saying that its 1993 apology over the sex slavery issue, named the Kono Statement, was the outcome of a political compromise between Seoul and Tokyo.Abe said he will express remorse over Japan's role in the war in his fresh statement that will come around Aug. 15 to mark the 70th anniversary of Japan's defeat in World War II.But analysts predict that the premier is not likely to apologize for the sex slavery issue and may water down the spirit of Japan's 1995 apology for Japan's colonial rule, named the Murayama Statement.

It also threatened to block the main gate of the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division and carry out a city-wide referendum to ask residents whether they were in favor of the U.S. unit’s presence in the city.The municipality has strongly protested the decision by Seoul and Washington to retain the 210 Fire Brigade, the U.S.’ key anti-artillery unit, in Dongducheon until the South’s artillery reinforcement plan is completed around 2020.The city has been pushing for a series of development schemes on the premise that all U.S. bases in the city would be relocated to Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province by 2016 under the so-called Land Partnership Plan. It has criticized the Seoul government for canceling the plan, saying that the delay would seriously impede its development efforts.The city said it would withdraw its employee from Camp Casey who has helped U.S. military personnel register their cars under the Status of Forces Agreement, a pact that governs the legal status of the 28,500 U.S. troops in Korea. After the withdrawal, the U.S. personnel must visit the city hall for vehicle registration.From next Monday, civic groups in the city plan to stage a one-person demonstration in front of the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division headquarters. On the weekends, Dongducheon Mayor Oh Se-chang and other senior officials plan to join the protest.Next Wednesday, the Seoul government plans to hold a meeting to discuss the support measures.

His disappearance was reported by his co-traveler to the embassy, which later sent its officials to the area to find him.The official noted that it was the co-traveler who reported the teenager's disappearance to the embassy.He said that the co-traveler is now under the custody of the South Korean embassy for further investigation.In Seoul, the teenager's mother said her son had exchanged emails with his Turkish friend named Hassan whom he met on the Internet, according to South Korean police.Quoting the teenager's parents, police said the son visited Turkey together with one of his parent's church members.Police said an analysis of the missing teenager's phone records showed no evidence that he has had any contact with IS.The mother also told police that South Korean intelligence officials analyzed the teenager's computer, but they did not find anything that could link his son with IS.The South Korean Foreign Ministry also said there is no evidence to prove that the teenager has crossed the border into Syria and joined IS.

He was ordered detained by the district court until the charges can be further investigated, Lalitpur's police chief Pushpa Ranjit said. Officials were not giving others details on the case because it involves a minor. If convicted, MacIntosh could face up to 10 years in jail.MacIntosh arrived in Nepal on a tourist visa in August 2014, and has been a frequent visitor to the children's shelter where the boy lived and they met there. Macintosh also allegedly  threatened the boy, police said.Canadian news reports said he was from Nova Scotia and has 17 child sex offense convictions against him. He was accused of sexually abusing boys in the 1970s and the allegations surfaced in 1995, when he was living in India.But he wasn't extradited until 2007, and the first of his two trials in Nova Scotia didn't start until 2010. His convictions were quashed in April 2013. Police were also investigating if there were any other minors involved.","sex abuse charges kathmandu ,nepal ap canadian tourist ,child sex abuse charges ,nepal on child sex ,police official said saturday","['KATHMANDU', 'Nepal', 'AP', 'canadian', 'Nepal', 'Ernest Fenwick MacIntosh', 'Lalitpur', 'Kathmandu']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32801652  0.59180999

Launched last April, the consultations will be their sixth session. With Korea regarding the issue’s resolution as essential for a rapprochement, Japan acceded to the first-of-its-kind meeting ahead of a trilateral summit between President Park Geun-hye, U.S. President Barack Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. But the two sides appear to have since made little progress given stark differences in their stances, with some Seoul officials saying that the negotiations were only “backpedaling” amid Abe’s revisionist push. Seoul has been demanding an official, sincere apology and compensation for the victims, while Tokyo claims the issue was settled in a 1965 agreement that restored their relations.Korea is expected to once again press for a breakthrough as the two countries mark the 50th anniversary of normalized ties this year. “The issue of the so-called comfort women is a humanitarian one concerning wartime violence against women, and we’re hoping for an early resolution given the old ages of the victims,” presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook told reporters Friday. On Thursday, a group of lawmakers led by Rep. Suh Chung-won, a longtime confidant of Park and senior member of the ruling Saenuri Party, met with Abe in Tokyo. They delivered the president’s message that this year would hopefully provide a chance for the two countries to “make a fresh start.” Abe, in response, expressed his sympathy for the victims and said he upholds a 1993 apology issued by then-Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono. But the nationalist leader stopped short of indicating a resolve to put an end to the longstanding dispute with concrete measures, expressing regret that the issue was becoming “politicized.” Up to 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, are believed to have been forced to provide sex to Japanese troops in frontline brothels during the war. Of the 237 Korean women who have come forward as former sex slaves, 55 are still alive.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","sex slavery talks seoul ,for sex slavery talks ,slavery involving korean women ,slavery talks seoul and ,over japan sexual slavery","['Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'korean', 'Lee Sang - deok', 'northeast asian', 'the Foreign Ministry', 'Junichi Ihara', 'asian', 'oceanian', 'Japan']",3,"[ 0.          2.          1.         ... -0.45553312  0.05134526

The new year also marks the 70th anniversary of Seoul's liberation from Tokyo's colonial rule in 1945.The Seoul-Tokyo ties have plunged to the lowest levels in recent years mainly due to the sex slavery issue. Historians estimate the number of such sex slaves at about 200,000 with only about 50 South Korean victims alive today.Japan angered Seoul and Beijing, victims of Tokyo's wartime aggression, in June by saying that its 1993 apology over the sex slavery issue, named the Kono Statement, was the outcome of a political compromise between Seoul and Tokyo.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he will express remorse over Japan's role in the war in his fresh statement that will come on Aug. 15 to mark the 70th anniversary of Japan's defeat of World War II.But many analysts predict that the premier will not apologize for the sex slavery issue and may water down the spirit of Japan's 1995 apology for Japan's colonial rule, named the Murayama Statement.Since taking office in early 2013, South Korean President Park Geun-hye has shunned a summit with Abe as a show of anger against Tokyo's refusal to atone for its historical wrongdoings.In her New Year press conference on Monday, Park urged Japan to face up to history, warning that the issue could be a ""big burden"" on Japan unless it is quickly resolved.

The hawkish premier is currently working on a statement to be unveiled on Aug. 15 to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, which will likely determine Tokyo’s relations with its two key neighbors. With Abe pushing for a constitutional revision, a greater military role and various revisionist moves, academics around the world, including pro-Japan experts, have been saying that for the policies to win support at home and abroad a sincere atonement for the country’s wartime atrocities should be made. For Seoul, the issue of Tokyo’s sexual enslavement of Korean women during the conflict remains the biggest thorn in their bilateral relationship, with their reconciliation hinging on the resolution of the issue. “Abe needs to realize that this is a lose-lose issue for Japan,” Jeffrey Hornung, a professor at the Hawaii-based Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies, said in a recent article for the journal Foreign Affairs, referring to the so-called comfort women dispute. While embracing the comfort women statues in Korea and the U.S., the premier should reaffirm his strong commitment to the 1993 Kono Statement by reissuing it as his own apology, Hornung said. The statement made by then-Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono offered Japan’s “sincere apology and remorse” for the “immeasurable pain and incurable physical and psychological wounds” inflicted during its rule. “Abe recently reiterated his commitment to it. Now he should reaffirm it as official government policy by putting it out in his capacity as prime minister: an Abe statement,” the professor said. “He should place a rose on the empty chair at the statue in front of Japan’s embassy in Seoul. Such an act would be powerfully symbolic, demonstrating to the world his country’s embrace of the issue, his remorse, and a reminder to the world of Japan’s commitment to peace for the past 70 years.” Michael Auslin, director of Japan Studies at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, stressed that Abe’s past endorsement of previous formal apologies, including one issued in 1995 by then-Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, had been deemed “inapt and offensive” due to other remarks and moves that suggested otherwise. The prime minister “must put all this behind him” by offering a genuine apology this year, he said, which would help him execute his pursuit of greater military engagement in Asia and enable his people to better understand and discuss more comprehensively their past and future. “While expressing ‘remorse’ is inward looking, an apology is outward directed,” Auslin wrote on the Commentator, a website. “Abe, who has a bold and largely coherent plan for Japan to play a larger and more beneficial role in Asia, should take this anniversary as an opportunity to once and for all signal official Japanese acceptance of the tragedy of the past.”By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","history amid japan frosty ,pressure on japanese prime ,japanese prime minister ,on history amid japan ,amid japan frosty relations","['Japan', 'Korea', 'China', 'U.S.', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Tokyo']",3,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.52123529  0.27379602

During a meeting with Korean correspondents in Japan, Suh said that among many pending bilateral issues, what mattered the most was restoring the honor of Korean women who were forced into sexual slavery by Japan during World War II.“Japan should again present a clear stance on upholding the Kono Statement,” he said in Tokyo. “Should any other words (that could challenge the statement) come out (of the Tokyo government), it will be difficult (to improve the bilateral ties).”Suh, the head of the Korea-Japan Parliamentarians’ Union, arrived in Japan on Wednesday, along with other South Korean lawmakers, for a three-day visit to help work toward improving relations, which have been strained due to territorial and historical feuds.Following the press meeting, Suh was to hold a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during which he was to convey a message from President Park Geun-hye.Suh’s remarks on the Kono Statement came amid concerns that the Abe government could move to discredit or water down the Kono Statement, in which then-Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono apologized to the victims of sexual slavery.Tokyo carried out a controversial review of the apology last year. Following the review, Tokyo suggested the apology was the product of a political compromise between Seoul and Tokyo, challenging its credibility. Amid criticism from South Korea and China, Tokyo said it would keep the apology.The content of Park’s message to Abe was not immediately known. But the message was expected to carry Park’s wish for the two sides to work together to forge a future-oriented partnership, particularly as this year marks the 50th anniversary of the normalization of their diplomatic relations.Attention is focused on whether Suh, dubbed the “leader of the Pro-Park faction” in the ruling party, could forge a reconciliatory mood between the two countries to resolve a series of pending issues including the issue of a one-on-one summit between Park and Abe. The two sides have not held any summit so far, although the leaders met in a three-way meeting last year that was brokered by U.S. President Barack Obama.During her New Year’s address to the nation on Monday, Park called for a “shift in Japan’s stance” toward history. She reiterated that as the victims of sexual slavery were old, the comfort women issue should be addressed as soon as possible, or else would remain unresolved for good.

The professor of general education at Sungshin Women’s University led a variety of publicity campaigns abroad to refute their claims on history and territory. At home, he has focused on education for Korean youths who appear increasingly indifferent to the painful history. The former battle earned him the reputation as Korea’s foremost civilian public diplomacy practitioner. On the second, however, he says his endeavor still has miles to go. “In dealing with the issues of the Dokdo Islets and comfort women, the biggest enemy is not the Japanese government. It is our own indifference,” the professor said in an interview with The Korea Herald. Last week, the Japanese government permitted a publisher to omit references to Japan’s wartime sexual enslavement of Asian women in its school textbook. “Japan is clearly aware of the importance of education. The only way we can fight back is to learn the correct version of history,” said Seo,Koreans often resort to venting fury at Japan’s blatant attempts to distort history. But the important thing is not to get emotional but to acquire facts and establish logic, he said. “The comfort women issue, in particular, extends beyond Korea and Japan. It is a human rights issue,” he said.Seo gained his reputation as a Dokdo campaigner in 2005, when he placed a full-page advertisement in the New York Times in protest against the Japanese prefecture of Sinema’s designation of Feb. 22 as “Takeshima Day.” Takeshima is the Japanese name for Dokdo.“That’s when I realized that staying still will solve nothing. But at the same time, making a ruckus would not solve a thing either. We need to approach the issue by providing cultural content,” Seo said. Since then, he has been trying to raise awareness on the issue through ads in other big media outlets, creating a Dokdo song and producing a documentary film called “Sorry, Dokdo.”He said that history educators needed to take a similar approach via different mediums. In 2013, he co-authored a book named “Ten Moments in Korean History You Should Know” which he said is part of an effort to make history more approachable.“As of now, I’m working on a webtoon (Internet-based cartoon) on historical issues. We need to work on adding education content like webtoons and videos that students can easily access,” he said.  Seo Kyoung-duk (Park Hyun-koo/The Korea Herald)Seo was shocked recently to find out how little students knew about Korean history. During his lectures, he realized that some students were misinformed about Ahn Jung-geun, one of best-known independence fighters during Japan’s colonialization of Korea from 1910-1945. A recent survey by a local daily showed about 36 percent of middle and high school students said the comfort women system was created to provide “job opportunities for Korean women,” while 12.4 percent could not spell out the term, even confusing it with prostitute.Over 60 percent of students were unaware of the 1993 Kono Statement, in which then-Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono acknowledged that women from Korea and other Asian nations had been forced into sexual slavery during World War II.“Some people say kids nowadays are selfish, because they don’t care about social issues. I don’t think so. We (adults) made them that way,” said Seo. “We can’t get mad at them for not knowing about the March 1 Independence Movement when we didn’t even provide the historical content to them.”While he emphasized the importance of cultural content in teaching history, he added that it has to begin in the classroom. In 2005, Korean history became an optional subject for the college entrance exam, resulting in students placing less importance on the subject.“If we don’t even teach it in the classroom, students cannot learn anything (about our history). What do we have? A history camp? Videos about comfort women? Nothing. Take textbooks out of the equation, and it just doesn’t make sense,” he said. Starting in 2016, all Korean students taking the state-commissioned college entrance exam will have to study Korean history. The measure, implemented by the Education Ministry in 2013, is a culmination of efforts by local experts and activists like Seo who campaigned for the often-disregarded subject.Seo plans to take more direct actions, particularly when it comes to educating students about comfort women issues.“At this stage, nothing’s been decided yet, but I want to establish an educational institute on the human rights issue of comfort women,” he said. The facility will be modeled after his “Dokdo School,” which operates educational programs on Dokdo for teenagers.In addition to raising historical awareness in Korea, Seo plans to expand his activities in Japan. Last year, Seo visited Tokyo to hold a lecture about comfort women. This year, he plans visit 10 cities for a survey on Japanese teens’ opinions on Korea, comfort women and Dokdo. The survey will be conducted together with another survey in Korea to study how Korean teens view Japan. The data will be used for his projects to mark the 70th anniversary of Korea’s independence.Recently hate protests by Japanese far-right groups has shaken the media and the animosity between two countries has deepened. Seo said that through the survey, he hoped to show it was not all like that, and to help the two peoples understand each other.“I received a lot of hate mails from far-right groups. They even target my family and my school, urging it to fire me. But the fact that they resort to blackmail shows that they are not proud of what they’re doing,” Seo said.However, there was progress as well. “Some students at the lecture were genuinely surprised. They told me ‘If you’re telling the truth, then Japan committed a serious crime. I’ll have to do some research.’”“If my lecture can move even one out of 50 people, I consider it a success. It can motivate them to partake in activities. This is the power of education,” he said. It has been 10 years since the professor began the herculean task of promoting Korea. For Seo, however, it is merely the start and a long uphill battle still awaits.“(Japanese Premier) Shinzo Abe won’t apologize for the comfort women. Why would he? Even Rep. Mike Honda (of the U.S.) said pressuring Abe over comfort women was a waste of energy and time,” he said. “But I believe the power of truth will prevail. If we succeed in persuading those around the world, Japan will have to give in.”If Korea successfully persuades Japan to acknowledge its past wrongdoings, Seo says it can create a path for a joint historical textbook between Korea, Japan and China, proposed in 2013 by President Park Geun-hye. Seo added that this was still premature, especially with China laying claim on Korea’s ancient Goguryeo Kingdom. This process would have to start with education, he said. He also said focusing on education for the young generation is very effective as they are less prone to prejudice.“If we attempt to make (a joint textbook) with the two countries, we need to make sure we have a solid footing on our own history,” he said.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","fight against japan rightists ,sungshin women university led ,education for korean youths ,past decade seo kyoung ,cultural fight against japan","['Seo Kyoung - duk', 'Japan', 'Sungshin Women ’s University', 'korean']",3,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -0.15988716  0.51980501

Suh Chung-won, a seven-term lawmaker of the ruling Saenuri Party with reportedly close ties to Park, is scheduled to hold meetings with Japanese political leaders and attend a New Year’s meeting with Korean residents in Japan.The group could also meet with Abe on Thursday, although planning is still under way, according to sources close to the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.A main focus of attention in the visit has been on whether Suh will carry a personal letter from Park to Abe.Sources have said Park did not send a letter.In October, Abe delivered a letter to Park through a Japanese parliamentary delegation, saying he would like to improve their countries’ soured relations through summit talks.Park has insisted on holding a summit only after Tokyo demonstrates sincerity about resolving South Koreans’ grievances over Japan’s 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula.

He has been serving a four-year term since January 2013.The younger Chey was sentenced to three years and six months in prison for conspiring with the elder Chey in the embezzlement scheme.The Supreme Court also upheld a four-year prison term handed down to Koo last year for fraudulently issuing commercial papers worth about 215 billion won.It was somewhat customary for outgoing presidents to pardon their friends and associates jailed for corruption, stoking controversy that the measure fosters persistent corruption among political and business elite by allowing the well-connected to escape justice.Park, who has been critical of issuing special pardons recklessly, earlier promised to exercise the right in an extremely restrictive manner.

She said she hopes to be able to return to both Koreas.The Korean Peninsula remains technically in a state of war, split along the world’s most heavily fortified border, because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. In South Korea, praising North Korea can be punished by up to seven years in prison under the National Security Law. Shin Eun-miIn Washington, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Shin had been barred from exiting South Korea for three weeks, and the U.S. has seen reports indicating the prosecution has asked for her to be deported and banned from the country for five years.In a rare note of criticism of a key ally, Psaki said that despite South Korea’s generally strong record on human rights, the security law limits freedom of expression and restricts access to the Internet.Supporters argue that the law is needed because of continuing threats from North Korea. But critics want it scrapped. Past authoritarian leaders in South Korea frequently used the law to suppress political rivals.Shin posted stories about her trips to North Korea on OhmyNews, a popular South Korean online news site. Her book on her trips was included in a government-designated reading list in 2013, but the Culture Ministry removed it this week. Ministry officials said they will seek to retrieve 1,200 copies that were distributed to libraries across South Korea. During a November lecture in Seoul, Shin said many North Korean defectors living in South Korea had told her they want to go back home and that North Koreans hope new leader Kim Jong Un will bring change. She also praised the taste of North Korean beer and the cleanliness of North Korea’s rivers. Shin has said she had no intention of praising the country and was only expressing what she felt during her travels there.Conservatives have sided with government moves to expel Shin, accusing her of ignoring North Korea’s abysmal human rights conditions. But her impending deportation drew sharp criticism from liberals who say the conservative government of President Park Geun-hye is clamping down on freedom of speech.“The decision to deport her is a clear violation of human rights,” the Hankyoreh newspaper said in an editorial Friday. “The government is taking the lead in trampling on human rights.”At the United Nations, the deputy spokesman for Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Farhan Haq, told reporters: “The secretary-general’s position on freedom of expression and freedom of opinion is well-known. ... That would apply here as well.” Ban is South Korean.In October, prosecutors indicted a Japanese journalist on charges he defamed Park by reporting rumors that she was absent for seven hours on the day of a ferry disaster last April because she was with a man. Last month, the Constitutional Court ordered the dissolution of a small leftist party that officials say advocated a North Korean-style socialist system.In December, a high school student threw a homemade explosive device toward a podium where Shin was speaking, injuring two people. Shin was not injured. The student was sent to a juvenile detention center and is awaiting trial.

Ethnic Koreans of other nationalities are also encouraged to report themselves if they are residing in South Korea with forged passports.According to the immigration agency, 18,588 foreigners were caught from 2008 to 2013 for either entering or residing in South Korea with a passport with someone else’s identity.The KIS estimates that the majority of illegal residents with forged passports are ethnic Koreans from China.Many of them entered South Korea with illegal passports prior to 2007, the year South Korea was officially declared an immigrant-receiving country by the United Nations. Also in the same year, South Korea launched the employment permit system (EPS), which allowed foreign workers to live in the country for a maximum of four years and 10 months. “(Prior to 2007), it was very difficult for Korean-Chinese people to work in South Korea,” said Lee Moon-han, deputy director of the KIS. “Korean-Chinese were granted a long-term stay here only if they had a South Korean national as their relatives.

In an emergency meeting of the Agriculture Ministry and the ruling Saenuri Party, the ministry said it would raise the vaccination rate from 70 percent to 100 percent for all livestock and toughen the monitoring system in municipalities. The government also suggested that it would create an early alert system as part of the efforts to prevent the spread of the disease. “The quarantine officials should thoroughly carry out the vaccination process and make sure that there no loopholes in the disinfection measures,” Saenuri Party spokesperson Rep. Park Dae-chul said. As of Thursday afternoon, more than 28,000 livestock at 38 farms in the country had been slaughtered since the outbreak was discovered on Dec. 3.Earlier in the day, three vaccinated pigs at a farm in Sejong City, were confirmed to have been infected with the illness, the Agriculture Ministry said. This was the first case detected in the administrative city. While culling the pigs, the quarantine authorities limited the travel of farm animals to within 3 kilometers of the concerned site. The farm is located 19 kilometers from another farm in Cheonan, South Chungcheong Province, where foot-and-mouth disease was discovered on Jan. 1.Dozens of pigs at four farms in Anseong, Gyeonggi Province, were also suspected of being infected with the animal disease.

The number of people making direct purchases from foreign manufacturers or online shops has been increasing steadily over the recent years as more people seek to save money by bypassing local importers and distributors, who often add a significant amount of service charges to the original product price. In a recent survey by the state-run Korea Internet and Security Agency, more than four out of every 10 Internet users surveyed said they have made at least one direct purchase from an overseas site.However, 56.6 percent of those who made such purchases said they had experienced inconveniences or suffered a financial loss in the process. The commission said it will work with the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law to set compensation for any monetary damages to local consumers since overseas shopping sites are not subject to punishment under local laws.The directive also includes imposing fines for automakers that fail to carry out voluntary and timely recalls on their vehicles that are found to have problems.

The majority of such domestic workers were ethnic Koreans from China ― many of whom speak fluent Korean ― according to the report. The research suggested that foreign-born nannies and housekeepers are more satisfied with their jobs than the Korean parents who hire them, and the government should organize training and certification programs for foreigners who wish to work as domestic helpers here. The research institute surveyed a total of 259 Korean parents who have hired a foreign-born babysitter, as well as 256 ethnic Koreans who have worked as babysitters in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province for the report. An ethnic Korean from China earned an average of 1.62 million won ($1,467) a month last year, as a live-in nanny who works five days a week, according to the report. While 1.62 million won is much more than the cost of the government’s all-day child care service ― a maximum of 1.1 million won a month ― it is still cheaper than the cost of hiring a Korean live-in nanny from private agencies, which can cost more than 2 million won a month. While 92 percent of the surveyed ethnic Koreans from China said they were satisfied with their jobs as nannies, only 55 percent of the Korean parents said they were happy with their their babysitters and housekeepers from China. Also, 93 percent of the ethnic Koreans said their spoken Korean language skills were excellent, while only 65 percent of the Korean parents said the same of their nannies’ language abilities. A total of 62.5 percent of the surveyed ethnic Koreans from China said they wanted to settle down in Korea. Meanwhile, 79.3 percent of the Korean mothers who hired a Korean Chinese as her live-in housekeeper were employed full-time.The number of Korean households that hire a live-in nanny has been increasing since 2011, from 1,204 to 3,693 in 2013, according to another report released by the Gender Equality Ministry.Of those who hired a live-in nanny, 45.6 percent said they made the decision because they were worried that their child is too young to be in a day care center, while 18.3 percent said they did not have anyone ― including their parents ― to look after the child.A total of 67.3 percent of Korean mothers who hired a full-time housekeeper said the greatest benefit they gained from the service was that they did not have to quit their jobs.

But the disagreements themselves should no longer be cited as reasons for not holding summit talks with Japan,” New Politics Alliance for Democracy chair Rep. Moon Hee-sang said.Sour relations between the two Asian neighbors have persisted during President Park’s term, apparently due to South Korea’s distaste for Abe’s revisionist views on history. The prime minister has made statements denying Japanese atrocities during World War II.Moon also “welcomed” Japanese Emperor Akihito’s New Year remarks, as they seemed to imply remorse over Japan’s aggression in the Second World War. The Japanese royal had said “it was most important” for Japan to “learn from” World War II when considering its future policies.“The Abe administration should heed Emperor Akihito’s words of learning from the past,” Moon said.Relations between Seoul and Tokyo have worsened in recent years. Park has apparently refused to hold bilateral talks with Abe due to the prime minister’s historical views. U.S. President Barack Obama attempted to mend ties by mediating a trilateral meeting last March.Prime Minister Abe’s statements denying any forcible recruitment of sex slaves by the Japanese military has especially enraged South Korea. The Japanese military either forcibly recruited or tricked into enslavement thousands of Asian and some Dutch women who are euphemistically called comfort women. Many of the former slaves are from Korea, with the average age of the surviving victims close to 89.Abe has not shown signs he will retract from his revisionist views. Most recently, the Japanese government on Dec. 24 posted a YouTube video that supported Tokyo’s claims over Dokdo, South Korean islets in the East Sea whose ownership Japan contests.The move reignited an issue that has been a major source of tension between Seoul and Tokyo.The main opposition leader also expressed his support for bilateral talks with North Korea.“This year marks the 70th anniversary of our liberation from Japanese colonial rule, and our country’s postwar division. It is time to end seven decades of rivalry and begin a new age of peace,” Moon said.

The measure was put into effect on New Year’s Day, and its impact was immediate and resounding.As of Sunday, corner stores across Korea have started selling individual cigarettes, a trend that all but died out over the past few decades. Since cigarettes cost 300 won a piece and a pack of 20 costs 4,500 won, it is naturally cheaper to buy a packet. But local store owners said more customers were reluctant to buy a whole packet, as they are trying to cut back in the face of the tobacco price hike.A corner store in Sillim-dong, Seoul, is seen Sunday selling individual cigarettes. (Yonhap)Industry sources said that tobacco sales on Jan. 1 nearly halved compared to the same day last year, with local retail giant Lotte Mart reportedly seeing a 49 percent drop in sales. Observers are saying the drastic drop in sales was partly due to hoarding that was rampant ahead of the price hike, but the government projects the drop in sales is likely to continue throughout the year.The Finance Ministry said Koreans are expected to consume 2.8 billion packs of cigarettes for this year, which is 34 percent less than 4.3 billion last year. The government had claimed that raising cigarette prices was part of its effort to lower the country’s smoking rate. Following the parliamentary agreement on tobacco prices, the Health Ministry said last month it was pushing to expand smoke-free zones and anyone caught smoking inside a restaurant would be slapped with a 100,000 won fine. The string of government measures seem to have made it tougher to be a smoker in Korea, claimed government officials. According to the Korea Health Promotion Foundation, the number of people who registered themselves at state-run anti-smoking clinics from September to November was 46 percent higher than during the same period in 2013. Officials there said this was the direct influence of the government’s price hike.According to the Health Ministry, the smoking rate for male adults dropped from 47.1 percent in 2004 to 43.9 percent in 2005 after the government raised the cigarette prices from 2,000 won a pack to 2,500 won. The officials aim to ultimately drop the adult male smoking rate ― which stands at 42.5 percent as of 2013 ― to 29 percent by 2020.To counter this, some smokers are turning to electronic cigarettes, despite the high price and questions over health risks. Online shopping mall G-market said their e-cigarette sales jumped exponentially since the government raised cigarette prices; especially from Dec. 1 to Dec. 22 when sales soared sixteenfold.

(Yonhap)Seoul’s Foreign Ministry called the sanctions an “appropriate response,” reiterating that cyberattacks to damage private and corporate interests and the openness and security of cyberspace should not be tolerated. Those sanctioned will be banned from accessing the U.S. financial system and doing any transactions with U.S. nationals. But the largely symbolic sanctions are unlikely to further damage the economy of the heavily isolated country which is already under a series of international sanctions for its nuclear and missile tests.The sanctions target the North’s Reconnaissance General Bureau, the country’s premier military spy agency, which Washington and Seoul believe orchestrated a series of cyberincursions against them. Seoul also blames the RGB for launching a string of fatal provocations including the 2010 torpedo attack on the corvette Cheonan that killed 46 sailors. Korea Mining Development Trading Corp., in charge of the arms exports, and Korea Tangun Trading Corp., a defense research agency, have also been added to the sanctions list, as well as 10 senior officials, including those operating in Iran, Syria, China, Russia and Namibia.“Even as the FBI continues its investigation into the cyberattack against Sony Pictures Entertainment, these steps underscore that we will employ a broad set of tools to defend U.S. businesses and citizens, and to respond to attempts to undermine our values or threaten the national security of the United States,” U.S. Treasury secretary Jack Lew said in a statement.The sanctions came as Pyongyang has hardened its rhetoric against the U.S., while continuing its peace offensive toward the South and refraining from launching its usual verbal attacks against Seoul.“The U.S. is wholly responsible for its hitherto antagonistic, hostile relationship with North Korea. The U.S. should throw away its hostile policy toward the North,” said a piece in Saturday’s edition of the Rodong Sinmun, the daily of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party.“Should the U.S. come forward with good will while respecting our sovereignty without intervening in our internal affairs, we would respond to that accordingly.” The two Koreas have moved closer to dialogue since the North Korean leader demonstrated his desire to hold a “top-level meeting” with the South and restore cross-border ties in his New Year address.Supporting the U.S. sanctions against the North, Seoul appears to have reaffirmed that it would deal separately with the issues of inter-Korean cooperation and provocations such as the nuclear development and cybervandalism.In response to Kim’s New Year’s address, Seoul reiterated that it remained open to dialogue in any form. Some observers said the North could specify its desire for inter-Korean talks this week, while others presume that it may wait until after President Park Geun-hye delivers her New Year’s speech, which is expected to be delivered on Jan. 12.The upcoming impediment to inter-Korean dialogue would be the planned annual military exercise between the U.S. and South Korea, which will begin in February. The North Korean leader has called on the allies to cancel the exercise, but the South said the “defense” drills will proceed as planned.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","new economic sanctions friday ,sanctions friday against pyongyang ,foreign ministry responded angrily ,economic sanctions friday against ,economic sanctions friday","['the United States', 'North Korea', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'Sony Pictures Entertainment', 'the North ’s Foreign Ministry', 'America']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55556774  0.66593385

Half-blind and in rags, Kim grabbed another slave, and the two disabled men headed for the coast. Far from the glittering steel-and-glass capital of Seoul, they were now hunted men on this remote island where the enslavement of disabled salt farm workers is an open secret. “It was a living hell,” Kim said in a recent series of interviews with The Associated Press whose details are corroborated by court records and by lawyers, police and government officials. Lost, they wandered past asphalt-black salt fields sparkling with a patina of thin white crust. They could feel the islanders inspecting them. Everyone knew who belonged and who didn't. Near a grocery, the store owner's son rounded them up and called their boss, who beat Kim with a rake and sent him back to the salt fields. Slavery thrives on rural islands off South Korea's rugged southwest coast, nurtured by a long history of exploitation and the demands of trying to squeeze a living from the sea. Two-thirds of South Korea's sea salt is produced at more than 850 salt farms on dozens of islands in Sinan County, including Sinui island, where half the 2,200 residents work in the industry. Workers spend grueling days managing a complex network of waterways, hoses and storage areas. Five times during the last decade, revelations of slavery involving the disabled have emerged. Kim's case prompted a nationwide government probe of thousands of farms and disabled facilities that found more than 100 workers who'd received no, or scant, pay. Yet little has changed on the islands, according to a months-long investigation by the AP based on court and police documents and dozens of interviews with freed slaves, salt farmers, villagers and officials. In this Feb. 19, 2014, lawmakers and human right activists look at salt farms as a part of human rights inspection on Sinui Island, South Korea. Slavery thrives on this chain of rural islands off South Korea’s rugged southwest coast, nurtured by a long history of exploitation and the demands of trying to squeeze a living from the sea. Five times during the last decade, revelations of slavery involving the disabled have emerged, each time generating national shame and outrage. (Yonhap-AP)Although 50 island farm owners and regional job brokers were indicted, national police say no local police or officials will face punishment, despite multiple interviews showing some knew about the slaves and even stopped escape attempts. Soon after the national investigation, activists and police found another 63 unpaid or underpaid workers on the islands, three-quarters of whom were mentally disabled. Kim's former boss, Hong Jeong-gi, didn't respond to multiple requests for comment through his lawyer. He's set to appeal a 3 year prison sentence next week. Other farmers often describe themselves as providing oases for the disabled and homeless. “These are people who are neglected and mistreated,” Hong Chi-guk, a 64-year-old salt farmer in Sinui, told the AP. “What alternative does our society have for them?” The night of July 4, 2012, Kim, who'd been homeless for a decade, was sleeping in a Seoul train station when a stranger offered him a place to stay and a job in the morning. Hours later, he stood on a Sinui island salt farm. Hong had paid an illegal job agent the equivalent of about $700 for his new worker, according to court records. The beatings began the first day on the farm for Kim, who's visually disabled and described in court documents as having the social awareness of a 12-year-old. “Each time I tried to ask him something, his punch came first,” Kim told the AP. Only a week after his first escape was thwarted, Kim began to plan another. He and the other slave, Chae Min-sik, again tried to find their way to a port. But the grocery owner's son, identified by officials only as Yoon, rounded them up again and called Hong. After another beating, it was back to work. Hong, Kim discovered, was an influential man, a former village head. Despite his fear, Kim ran again at the end of the month. Again, Yoon captured them. Furious, the owner said that if Kim ran again, he'd get a knife in the stomach. Hong beat Kim so badly he broke Kim's glasses. He worked Kim so hard the slave was too tired to think about escape. The number of people enslaved is difficult to determine because of the transient work, the remoteness of the farms and the closeness _ and often hostility _ of the island communities. Social workers believe many slaves have yet to be found, and that investigations have so far been inadequate. “If the recent investigation was done properly, then pretty much everyone on the island should've been taken to the police station and charged,” said Kim Kang-won, an activist who participated in the recent investigation on Sinui. “The whole village knew about it.” Provincial police have vowed to inspect farms and interview workers regularly, but people familiar with the island confirm that slavery is rampant. “The police chief would tell me that I'd eventually come to understand that this was how things on the island worked,” said Cho Yong-su, a doctor who worked at the Sinui Island public health center from 2006 to 2007. Han Bong-cheol, a pastor in Mokpo who lived on Sinui Island for 19 years until June, sympathized with farmers forced to deal with disabled, incompetent workers. “They spend their leisure time eating snacks, drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes. They are taken once or twice a year to Mokpo so they can buy sex. It's a painful reality, but it's a pain the island has long shared as a community.”After a year and a half as a slave, Kim made one last bid for freedom. He managed to mail a letter to his mother in Seoul. Kim's mother brought the letter, which gave directions to the farm, to Seo Je-gong, then a police captain. Because Kim's letter noted collaboration between local police and salt farm owners, Seo and another Seoul officer went to the island posing as tourists who'd come to fish and buy salt. They visited Hong's home while he was away and found the slaves sitting on a mattress in a room without heat or hot water. Kim, Seo said, looked like a homeless person. Kim was frightened and baffled, then relieved. “I am going to live,” he said. Chae initially refused to leave Sinui but was freed later after Seo found a 2008 missing person's report for Chae. He now lives in a Seoul shelter. Yoon, who repeatedly captured Kim and Chae, was fined $7,500. Kim, who lives in Seoul and occasionally works construction jobs, settled with Hong for about $35,000 in unpaid wages. He has nightmares and receives treatment for his injuries. He also gets flustered when he talks about salt, disgusted when he sees it. “Just thinking about it makes me grind my teeth.” (AP)","hell for disabled slaves ,disabled slaves on south ,mining the big salt ,living hell for disabled ,slaves on south korean","['Kim Seong - baek', 'Kim', 'Seoul']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55310112  0.62736374

655,655,S.Korea activist to launch 'Interview' DVDs into N.Korea,"   A South Korean activist said Thursday he plans to launch a series of balloons across the border into North Korea carrying copies of a film which has enraged its leadership.    Former defector Park Sang-hak said the balloons would carry a total of 100,000 copies on DVDs and USB memory sticks of ""The Interview,"" a comedy about a fictional plot to kill North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.   The giant balloons, whi...","A South Korean activist said Thursday he plans to launch a series of balloons across the border into North Korea carrying copies of a film which has enraged its leadership.    Former defector Park Sang-hak said the balloons would carry a total of 100,000 copies on DVDs and USB memory sticks of ""The Interview,"" a comedy about a fictional plot to kill North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.   The giant balloons, which are used by private groups in the South to float anti-regime material across the heavily guarded border, will also carry bundles of leaflets.   ""Probably the first launch will be made in late January if weather conditions allow,"" Park said, adding the exact date would be decided when his partners from the U.S.-based non-profit Human Rights Foundation visit Seoul around Jan. 20.   He said the foundation had financed the production of the DVDs and USB memory sticks.   The Sony Pictures film sparked off an international incident.   Threats made by hackers after a November cyber attack on the movie giant initially prompted Sony to cancel the film's Christmas Day release, after many large US theater chains got cold feet.   The United States blamed North Korea for the cyber attack, but it vehemently denied any involvement.   U.S. President Barack Obama expressed regret at Sony's cancellation and the studio then decided on a limited release. It was also released online.   Last week the North derided Obama as a ""monkey"" for encouraging cinemas to screen the comedy.   South Korean activists -- many of them defectors from the North -- have been carrying out leaflet launches for years.   At times of heightened cross-border tensions, Seoul has stepped in to stop them for fear of retaliation.   The two Koreas agreed last year to restart suspended dialogue when a top-ranking North Korean delegation made a surprise visit to the Asian Games held in the South in October.   The trip raised hopes of a thaw, but was followed by a series of minor military clashes along the border that renewed tensions and talks never materialised.   At one time the two Koreas traded heavy machine-gun fire after the North's military tried to shoot down balloons carrying anti-Pyongyang leaflets.   But in a New Year message Thursday the North's leader Kim called for top-level talks with the South, and Seoul responded positively.    Park said his launch operation would get into its stride in March when the wind direction is favorable. ""I will never succumb to any threats,"" he said.

Kim Moo-sung, chairman of the Saenuri Party, reiterated the need for innovation and change on Thursday as the ruling party embarks on a year that hinges on the success of its reform drives. Kim said that Korea faced many political, economic and social challenges, and that the party had a lot to tackle in 2015.“When the country is in difficulty, the Saenuri Party should be the group that leads innovation to open a new age,” Kim said. He went on to say that the party should rally behind “the spirit of reform to become the icon of innovation,” which would enable the party to win general and presidential elections down the road. This year, the conservatives are faced with a number of reforms, the success of which could have a lasting impact on the party’s leaders. Chief among the reform issues is the public sector pension system, which is expected to continue to pile up large deficits. With the party leadership having emphasized the issue for some time, it was selected as the most pressing matter of 2015 by ruling party members in a recent survey conducted by a local daily. However, the matter is unlikely to be resolved easily. The issue has already missed the deadline of end-2014 that Cheong Wa Dae called for, and resistance from labor groups and the opposition bloc is expected to continue. The issue has been met with fierce resistance from government employees from the outset, and they have since warned that they would launch a campaign for President Park Geun-hye’s administration to step down. With much riding on the issue, the Saenuri Party is said to have experienced some trouble in selecting the chair for the committee, as the position will bear the brunt of the wrath of those opposing the reforms. The chair will also be unable to avoid taking the blame should the efforts to reform the pension system fail. The party chairman, however, is taking on the issue with his characteristic drive, stating that results will be seen by April.Kim has also taken on the task of reforming the conservatives, which he touted as his main agenda since taking the helm of the party. Despite his support, the process has faced hurdles. The plans drawn up by the party’s reform committee were initially rejected at the general meeting of lawmakers in November, and the committee was accused of failing to communicate properly.The reform plan eventually received party approval, but only after significant changes had been made and doubts had been raised about Kim’s leadership. All aspects of the modified plan were accepted by the party at the very end of last year, but failure to achieve significant change would deal a considerable blow to Kim, whom pundits consider one of the few conservative bigwigs to practice his own brand of politics with relative independence from President Park.
