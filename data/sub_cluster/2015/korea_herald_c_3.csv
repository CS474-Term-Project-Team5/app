The Welfare Ministry said patients visiting the top 140 emergency rooms in the country will be classified into five categories depending on the urgency and severity of their condition, and charged different fees accordingly.  Non-emergency patients who show mild symptoms such as flu will be required to shoulder all the emergency room fees on their own, while that of emergency patients will be partially covered by the national health insurance program. Until last year, all patients benefitted from partial coverage.  YonhapThe new move came as part of measures to better control infectious diseases and protect public health, after emergency room crowding was suspected as one of the culprits behind the Middle East respiratory syndrome crisis last year.A total of 88 out of 186 MERS victims were found to have been infected in emergency rooms, the ministry said.The government’s data also showed that about 80 percent of emergency room users were not in critical condition. The most common affliction of emergency room patients visiting the country’s top five hospitals was cancer, followed by open wounds, flu and acute gastroenteritis. Once patients arrive at the emergency room, medical staff will determine the urgency and severity of symptoms. If judged urgent, the patients will be given emergency treatment. If symptoms seem infectious, they will be immediately quarantined. If symptoms are mild, however, the patients will be led to different medical institutions upon their consent.Emergency room use fees will vary by hospitals, ranging from 18,000 won ($15) to 54,000 won, with larger ones costing more, the authorities said. Non-emergency patients must pay the fees even if their only treatment is a drug prescription.

Looking at their warm, puffy creations, the cooks’ beamed as they imagined them being doled out to those in need, a daily routine for the volunteers.Standing among them was Yoon Kyung-ae, an 83-year-old volunteer who has become a familiar face at the Korean Red Cross, with which she has been working every day for the past three decades.The start of her voluntary work was nothing more than a coincidence. “I still remember the first day. It was Oct. 10, 1986 right after I retired from teaching. My friend asked me if I would join a Japanese class held at the Korean Red Cross’ office. That was the beginning,” said the 83-year-old former middle school teacher.  Yoon Kyung-ae Park Hyun-koo/The Korea HeraldWhile learning Japanese at the office, Yoon gradually opened her eyes to voluntary work. She joined the organization with the aim of dedicating the rest of her life to others, she said. Her first voluntary job was offering assistance at an information desk at Seoul Red Cross Hospital. Her job gradually broadened to guiding visitors to operation rooms and assisting at the hospital’s pharmacy. She mainly helped with sorting pills. The experience at the hospital left her with many fruitful memories, she said.“One day, a random man was urgently looking for a particular doctor. I guided him to the doctor and luckily he was able to receive the surgery that he needed. I cared for him until he left the hospital. A few days later, the man visited me to express gratitude with a box of sweet potatoes. He was a sweet potato farmer,” she said with laugh. “Since then, we have become friends and we still keep in touch. He still sends me a box of sweet potatoes every year.” Her dedication to helping others was not limited to hospitals. Whenever disasters occurred in the country such as the Seongsu Bridge collapse in 1994 or Sampoong Department Store collapse in 1995, she ran to the scene and supported the survivors and rescue workers. She also never hesitated to offer a helping hand to shelter-seekers or refugees whenever weather disasters hit the country. “The poorer the region is, the harsher the damage is when a disasters happened. The only thing the volunteers could do was to make sure that the refugees have three meals a day at shelters,” Yoon added.As of late last month, the total length of time she spent on voluntary service in the past 30 years amounts to 30,395 hours, according to Korean Red Cross officials. Starting from 2002, the former teacher has visited a disabled welfare center four days a week to support the disabled residents.Despite being in her 80s, she does not feel any physical difficulties in carrying out her voluntary service. “Nothing is physically hard or challenging to me. Everything is enjoyable and fun. See? I’m still healthy enough to carry this box,” said Yoon, grabbing the daily supply box with two hands. In recognition of her dedication to voluntary service, she received several awards from the organization over the years. “Volunteering is nothing special. It’s just a spirit of offering a helping hand to anyone anywhere at any time. That’s actually the best way to stay happy, joyful and healthy,” she said with a blissful smile.  By Lee Hyun-jeong(rene@heraldcorp.com)","of sweet potatoes every year ,to make cream cakes hours ,make cream cakes hours ,potatoes every year her dedication ,sweet potatoes every year her","['Korean Red Cross', 'Jongno', 'Seoul', 'Yoon Kyung - ae', 'the Korean Red Cross', 'japanese', ""the Korean Red Cross '"", 'Yoon Kyung - ae', 'Park Hyun - koo', 'the Korea HeraldWhile', 'Japanese', 'Yoon', 'Seoul Red Cross Hospital', 'Seongsu Bridge', 'Sampoong Department Store', 'Yoon', 'Korean Red Cross', 'Yoon']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38292915  0.33785295

South Korea agreed to end the dispute once and for all if Japan fully implements the deal.The victims, however, oppose the agreement saying that it lacks acknowledging legal responsibility.""When a case is not suitable for mediation, (the court) decides not to mediate (and open a trial),"" a court official said.Mediation is a way of finding solutions without former court trials. When an agreement is not reached amicably, former trials can be reopened.In 2013, a dozen elderly South Korean women filed for mediation to the court seeking 100 million won ($85,000) in compensation each.Still, Japan returned the relevant documents to the court, insisting that the South Korean court does not have jurisdiction over the Japanese government. The court set June 15 and July 13 as dates for mediation and asked the Japanese government to send its representative, but no Japanese official showed up.Two of the 12 elderly women have since died, lowering the number of plaintiffs to 10.After about two years of mediation efforts, the elderly women submitted documents to the court twice, seeking a formal suit against Japan. Now a trial has begun, but there is still the high possibility that the Japanese government will not respond to it, citing the Monday deal.Even without the participation of the Japanese government, the court can hand down a ruling.Still, even if the court rules in favor of the plaintiffs, a separate case needs to be filed with a Japanese court to execute the compensation decision.Only 46 former sex slaves, euphemistically called ""comfort women,"" remain, as many others have died over time.

He was 73.Kim Yang-gon, the head of the United Front Department at the ruling Workers' Party, died in car accident at 6:15 a.m. Tuesday, according to the North's Korean Central News Agency.The KCNA called Kim ""the closest comrade-in-arms"" of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, saying that North Korea will hold a state funeral for Kim on Thursday, to be headed by the North's leader.Kim Yang-gon was one of the two ranking North Korean officials who attended the rare inter-Korean high-level talks in August following heightened tensions sparked by a land mine blast near the inter-Korean border blamed on North Korea.The two Koreas reached a rare deal on Aug. 25 to defuse military tensions and make efforts to promote inter-Korean civilian exchanges.But inter-Korean ties have remained strained since the two sides ended their high-level talks on Dec. 12 without producing any agreements.South Korea's government said it offered condolences over Kim's death earlier in the day in the name of Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo.""The government expressed condolences over the death of Kim who contributed to a meaningful agreement at the August talks,"" Jeong Joon-hee, a ministry spokesman, told a regular press briefing.Jeong refrained from commenting on the immediate impact of his death on inter-Korean affairs, adding that a closer watch is needed.Analysts said that Seoul-Pyongyang ties may continue to be strained in the short term due to the death of Kim, a dialogue-seeking figure.""Kim's unexpected death is feared to lead to the prolonged suspension of inter-Korean talks,"" said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior researcher at the Sejong Institute. ""Given that the high-level talks fell apart in December, there is a chance that Seoul-Pyongyang ties may be further strained.""Kim had mainly dealt with inter-Korean affairs since the regime of Kim Jong-il, the father of the North's current leader, who died in late 2011.In 2007, Kim was named the head of the party's United Front Department, which manages Pyongyang's relations with Seoul. He also contributed to creating an inter-Korean summit held between Kim Jong-il and then-South Korean President Ro Moo-hyun in October of that year.Since Kang Sok-ju, a secretary handling international relations for the North's ruling party, remains ill, Kim was known as effectively doubling up with Kang's jobs at the party.North Korea announced a list of members for the funeral committee for Kim, including Choe Ryong-hae, a senior secretary of the ruling party and a key aide to the North's leader.In November, Choe was sent to a rural farm as punishment for his mishandling of a newly built hydroelectric power plant project.The inclusion of his name on the list may indicate that Choe has been reinstated.The Unification Ministry declined comment on Choe's status.Despite the troubling news, North Korea has not shown any abnormal signs on the military front, a military official said.

According to the poll by the Presidential Committee for National Cohesion, 51.8 percent of the respondents said that the political wrangling between the ruling party and opposition bloc contributed most to worsening social confrontations. In the multiple-choice survey of 2,000 Koreans aged 19 and over, the wealth gap was chosen as the second-biggest factor (40.3 percent) and personal selfishness (36.4 percent) as the third reason for social strife in the country.The majority of those surveyed, or 75 percent, viewed conflicts among different classes as the worst, followed by labor-management (68.9 percent), ideological clashes (67.7 percent) and regional conflicts (55.9 percent).The survey was released by a committee set up by President Park Geun-hye upon her inauguration to champion one of her key pledges of national integration. The administration has been upping its pressure on the rival parties to endorse stalled bills, including those on labor reform, blaming them for taking the nation‘s economy hostage for their own political interests.The most urgent matter to be tackled is the ideological war (44 percent), followed by labor-management conflict (33.4 percent) and regional conflict (27.8 percent), the respondents said.One in 7 respondents picked the nation’s rapid economic development as South Korea’s proudest achievement since its independence from Japan in 1945. With four reform agendas -- the labor, education, public and finance sectors -- hanging in the balance, 59.9 percent of respondents chose labor market reform as the priority in promoting social unity. Asked what constitutes “social integration,” 23.6 percent of the surveyed pointed to “respect for law and order,” followed by “freedom that entails responsibility” (21.9 percent) and “coexistence of various values” (20.3 percent).Those aged 60 or over stressed patriotism most, while those in their 20s and 30s emphasized freedom and a variety of values, illustrating a generational rift in perceiving social unity.

Tokyo has demanded to remove the statue as part of Monday`s South Korea-Japan settlement over the ""comfort women"" issue. Yonhap“The apology is rather vague and it’s hard to believe that Tokyo is being sincere,” the NGOs, including the House of Sharing and the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan, said in a statement.“If the motivations were sincere, Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe should’ve offered an apology himself, instead of sending the nation’s foreign minister on his behalf.”The NGOs also said they are “flabbergasted” at the South Korean government for accepting the “absurd” conditions of the settlement, including to consider it “final and irreversible” as long as Tokyo properly follows through on its promises, and agreeing to “find solutions” to Tokyo’s demand to shift the statue of a girl symbolizing victims from outside the Japanese Embassy in SeoulFollowing the statements by the NGOs, Rep. Lee Jong-kul, the floor leader of the main opposition Together Democratic Party, called for the resignation of Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and an official apology from President Park Geun-hye for accepting Tokyo’s conditions in the settlement.“Our party cannot accept this agreement,” Rep. Lee said. “The settlement shows that the government did not consult the surviving victims and NGOs at all before singing the deal.”Lee called the settlement just as “humiliating” as the 1965 South Korea-Japan Normalization Treaty, which was signed by former President Park Chung-hee, the father of current President Park Geun-hye. With the 1965 treaty, South Korea received a $300 million grant in economic aid. Despite Seoul’s repeated demands for an apology and legal compensation for the victims since the 1990s, Tokyo has said that all reparations in regard to “claims” -- including the issue of “comfort women” -- between the two countries were settled in 1965.In fact, Tokyo’s Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida told Japanese reporters after signing the deal on Monday that Japan still maintains the same legal stance about the “comfort women” issue, meaning it was legally and “finally and completely” settled under the 1965 treaty. He told reporters that Tokyo still has no plans to acknowledge legal responsibility and pay reparations, but instead decided to advocate the establishment of the government-backed fund for the surviving victims. “Our party is determined to ask the current administration at the National Assembly why it agreed to the settlement being ‘final and irreversible,’” Rep. Lee said. “We are also going to find out why the settlement even mentions the possibility of removing the statue that symbolizes the victims from outside the Japanese Embassy in Seoul.”Meanwhile, the Korean American Forum of California, a group of Korean-Americans supporting the surviving Korean sex slavery victims based in San Francisco, also issued a statement condemning the agreement between the two governments. “The ‘comfort women’ issue is an example of institutionalized sexual slavery and one of the largest cases of human trafficking and human rights violations in the world,” the organization said in a statement. “There are surviving victims of Japan’s wartime slavery in 10 other countries aside from South Korea. Tokyo mentioned nothing of them in the agreement, limiting the issue as something that only happened between Korea and Japan, while it should be recognized as a universal human rights issue.”The group also criticized Japan’s demands regarding the statue and the settlement being final. “The motivation is obviously to prevent the issue being talked about on the world stage anymore,” the group said. “And if Japan is truly sorry about what happened, they wouldn’t have any problems with having the statue in front of their embassy.”Some Japanese activists supporting Korean victims also expressed concerns over the settlement between the two nations. Watanabe Mina, secretary-general of the Tokyo-based Women’s Active Museum on War and Peace, said the agreement does not mention anything about educating the future generations on the issue. “One of the most important things about the ‘comfort women’ issue is to remember and educate so it does not repeat in the future,” she said. “Not only did Tokyo mention nothing about education, it demanded to remove the very symbolic statue, which will only help the public remember the war atrocities.”The General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, one of two main organizations of ethnic Koreans living in Japan and has close ties to North Korea, also heavily criticized the South Korean government for signing the deal in spite of Japan’s eyebrow-raising conditions, calling the agreement a “humiliation.”“It is humiliating because Seoul accepted Japan’s ‘irreversible’ apology that does not even say anything about national or legal responsibility,” said Ri Dong-je, a representative of the group’s affiliate organization consisting of North Korean sympathizers, in a statement. “The South Korean government should stop betraying its own citizens by giving in to Japan’s unreasonable requests. Japan, on the other hand, should take full legal responsibility of its inhumane war crimes in the past.” By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","tokyo apology for korean victims ,tuesday criticizing both governments for ,surviving korean sex slavery victims ,angry reactions from surviving korean ,korean sex slavery victims","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'korean', 'Koreans', 'south korean', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Tokyo', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Pedestrians', 'korean', 'the Japanese Embassy', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'the House of Sharing', 'the Korean Council', 'the Women draft for Military Sexual Slavery', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Shinzo Abe', 'south korean', 'Tokyo', 'Tokyo', 'Lee Jong - kul', 'Together Democratic Party', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Park Geun', 'Tokyo', 'Lee', 'South Korea', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Park Geun - hye', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Tokyo', 'Fumio Kishida', 'japanese', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'the National Assembly', 'Lee', 'Seoul', 'the korean American Forum', 'California', 'Korean - Americans', 'korean', 'San Francisco', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Tokyo', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'korean', 'Watanabe Mina', 'Tokyo', 'Women ’s Active Museum', 'Tokyo', 'General Association of Korean Residents', 'Japan', 'Koreans', 'Japan', 'North Korea', 'south korean', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'Ri Dong - je', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Claire Lee']",18,"[ 5.         16.          5.         ... -0.30303878  0.8474223

12,12,Chinese media cast wary eye on Korea-Japan deal on wartime sex slaves,"A newspaper published by China's ruling Communist Party on Tuesday took a wary and skeptic note on a landmark deal between South Korea and Japan on the issue of Korean victims of Japan's wartime sexual slavery, insisting that the deal will have ""little influence"" in Northeast Asia.

Both South Korean President Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said their bilateral relations entered a new era with the Monday deal. The United States praised the deal on the issue that has seriously plagued relations between the two key American allies for years. The deal was in line with diplomatic efforts by U.S. President Barack Obama to form a united front with South Korea and Japan against China's increasingly assertive behaviors and North Korea's defiant pursuit of missile and nuclear programs. The issue of Korean victims, euphemistically called ""comfort women,"" by the Japanese military during World War II has long been a thorn in diplomatic ties between Seoul and Tokyo as Japan's conservative politicians have not done enough to resolve the long-standing grievance regarding the Korean victims.In an editorial titled ""Comfort women deal will not aid Tokyo,"" the Chinese state-run Global Times newspaper stopped short of welcoming the deal. ""The comfort women deal has little influence on Northeast Asia.Japan's easing of tensions with South Korea doesn't mean it will gain more leverage in dealing with China,"" it said. According to historians, up to 200,000 women, mostly Korean, but other Asian women, including Chinese, were coerced into sexual servitude at front-line Japanese brothels during World War II. ""As the victim, China has been taking the initiative to resist Japan's denials of its history of aggression. South Korea is not a key factor in the Sino-Japanese relationship,"" the editorial said. Some Chinese analysts were also skeptical about the deal between South Korea and Japan. Wang Shaojin, a professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, said the deal is unlikely to help South Korea and Japan fully resolve history-related issues. ""The key point is whether Japan can face up to its history,"" Wang said. Su Zhiliang, a professor at Shanghai Normal University who is conducting research into Japan's wartime sex slavery, welcomed the deal, but it remains to be seen whether the Japanese prime minister's apology to the Korean victims is sincere or not. Under the Monday deal, Abe apologized to the Korean victims and Tokyo provided a 1 billion-yen ($8.3 million) fund for the victims. In return, South Korea will refrain from criticizing Japan over the issue. Still, critics in South Korea say questions remain whether Japan legally admitted its ""responsibilities"" over the issue. Japan had previously refused to resolve the grievance of the Korean victims, insisting that the issue was settled under a 1965 treaty that normalized bilateral ties.

What's important now is for Seoul and Tokyo to fight back nationalist pressure and sincerely carry out the agreement, they said.""The agreement between Seoul and Tokyo to finally resolve the issue of World War II-era sexual slavery or 'comfort women' is tremendously important, even historic,"" said Evans Revere, a former U.S. diplomat and senior adviser for the Albright Stonebridge Group.Earlier in the day, South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and his Japanese counterpart, Fumio Kishida, reached the agreement in Seoul, under which Japan will admit responsibility for the wartime crime and pay reparations to the victims.The deal came after President Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe held their first-ever one-on-one summit in early November and agreed to accelerate negotiations on the issue in a year marking the 50th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral diplomatic relations. ""At that meeting, and for the first time, the two leaders committed themselves and their governments to a speedy resolution of this thorny issue. In doing so, they each created a personal stake in a favorable outcome -- something that was essential to the compromises that made this breakthrough possible,"" Revere said.""Without their leadership, this agreement would not have happened.""The White House also praised the leaders of the two countries for ""having the courage and vision to forge a lasting settlement to this difficult issue."" National Security Advisor Susan Rice also said the U.S. looks forward to advancing trilateral security cooperation.Under the agreement, Japan formally acknowledged its responsibility for forcing Korean women into sexual servitude for its troops during World War II and agreed to offer 1 billion yen ($8.3 million) in reparations to the victims through a fund to be created by the South Korean government.South Korea promised to end the dispute once and for all if Japan fulfills its responsibilities.Bruce Klingner, a senior Korea expert at the Heritage Foundation, also called the deal ""a stunning success achieved through diplomatic perseverance as well as the courage by Prime Minister Abe and President Park to overcome seemingly insurmountable differences.""But he said the two countries should fight back nationalist pressure if the deal is to come to fruition.""Japanese ultra-right groups -- who deny Japanese imperial army involvement in wartime atrocities -- may seek to undermine support for the agreement. Korean non-government groups may argue the agreement doesn't go far enough in requiring Japanese contrition and demand additional Japanese concessions,"" Klingner said.The expert also said that the agreement allows Seoul and Tokyo to ""refocus attention from past differences to jointly focus on current security threats from North Korea and China"" and paves the way for greater trilateral security cooperation with the U.S.""Hopefully, South Korea will now be open to resurrecting an aborted 2012 military intelligence sharing agreement with Japan as well as integrating its national ballistic missile defense system into the more comprehensive and effective allied system,"" he said.Scott Snyder, a senior expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, also praised Park and Abe.""The agreement is a welcome step forward that should enable greater bilateral cooperation and trilateral cooperation with the United States. I believe it is good for both Korea and Japan and shows pragmatism and statesmanship on the part of both leaders,"" he said.Victor Cha, chief Korea expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that the agreement ""goes farther than most thought Japan would go in terms of admitting government responsibility,"" even though civic groups in South Korea may not be content.""This should pave the way, hopefully, for a normalization of political relations for the remainder of the Park and Abe terms, including enhanced trilateral cooperation with the United States on regional security issues including military information sharing agreements among the allies,"" he said.David Straub, a former State Department director for Korea and currently associate director for the Korean Studies Program at Stanford University, praised Park and Yun for ""their determination, skill, and courage in getting the best possible terms from a conservative Japanese government.""""I believe that this agreement fully vindicates the 'comfort women,' and, because Prime Minister Abe agreed to it, it makes it virtually certain that future Japanese governments as well, whether conservative or progressive, will uphold the position and the agreement,"" he said.""The agreement should result in the creation of a new, virtuous cycle in Korea-Japan relations. In future, both countries should be able to consider other issues in bilateral relations based on the merits of each issue, rather than having everything poisoned by a single issue,"" he added.Dennis Halpin, a researcher at the Johns Hopkins University's U.S.-Korea Institute, said that the agreement would allow Abe to project an image as statesman and supporter of women's rights on the world stage and to ""pursue Tokyo's long-standing elusive dream of a permanent U.N. Security Council seat.""It would also be good for the U.S. as the two key allies are now able to work together to support President Barack Obama's ""pivot to Asia"" and deal with the challenges of a nuclear North Korea and a rising China, the expert said.But South Korea could face tensions with nongovernmental groups if it tries to move the statue of a girl symbolizing sexual slavery victims set up in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul, Halpin said, pointing out that the statue has become something of Korea's own Statue of Liberty.(Yonhap)","seoul and tokyo to refocus ,support president barack obama pivot ,breakthrough deal between south korea ,seoul and tokyo to fight ,and tokyo to finally resolve","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Evans Revere', 'U.S.', 'the Albright Stonebridge Group', 'south korean', 'Yun Byung - se', 'japanese', 'Fumio Kishida', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'Park Geun', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', '""the White House', 'Susan Rice', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'korean', 'south korean', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Bruce Klingner', 'Korea', 'the Heritage Foundation', 'Abe', 'japanese', 'korean', 'japanese', 'japanese', 'Klingner', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'North Korea', 'China', 'u.s.""hopefully', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Scott Snyder', 'the Council on Foreign Relations', 'Park', 'Abe', 'the United States', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'victor Cha', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Abe', 'the United States', 'David Straub', 'State Department', 'Korea', 'the Korean Studies Program', 'Stanford University', 'Park', 'japanese', 'Abe', 'japanese', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Dennis Halpin', ""the Johns Hopkins University 's"", 'U.S.-Korea Institute', 'Abe', 'Tokyo', 'U.N.

""We look forward to deepening our work with both nations on a wide range of regional and global issues, on the basis of mutual interests and shared values, as well as to advancing trilateral security cooperation,"" she added.Secretary of State John Kerry issued a similar statement, saying the agreement will ""promote healing and help to improve relations"" between two of the most important U.S. allies. He also praised the leaders of the two countries and called for the international community to support the agreement.""We look forward to continuing to work with both countries on regional and global issues, including advancing our economic ties and security cooperation,"" he said.State Department deputy spokesman Mark Toner said he is aware that some Korean victims still feel aggrieved even with Monday's agreement, but it is for South Korea's government to work with them to address their concerns.The spokesman also said that it's incumbent upon the government of Japan to ""sell this agreement or to convince Japanese people that this agreement is in the best interest of Japan.""""This agreement will not necessarily answer or appease everyone's concerns going forward, but that said, we do support this agreement as a way forward to heal this wound,"" he said at a regular press briefing.A senior State Department official told reporters in a conference call that Monday's agreement will open a new chapter in cooperation between Seoul and Tokyo and is as important as the Trans Pacific Partnership free trade deal.""A region in which Japan and Korea are trading, are collaborating, are working together, are exchanging goods and services, ideas, culture, tourists, scientists, et cetera, without reservation, without hindrance, is going to be a more stable, secure and prosperous Asia,"" the official said.Under Monday's deal, Japan formally acknowledged its responsibility for forcing Korean women into sexual servitude for its troops during World War II and agreed to offer 1 billion yen in reparations to the victims through a fund to be created by the South Korean government.South Korea promised to end the dispute once and for all if Japan fulfills its responsibilities.The deal came after President Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe held their first-ever one-on-one summit in early November and agreed to accelerate negotiations on the issue in a year marking the 50th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral diplomatic relations. Historians estimate that more than 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during the war. Korea was under Japanese colonial rule from 1910 to 1945. The victims are euphemistically called ""comfort women.""South Korea demanded Japan offer a formal apology and proper compensation to the victims before they all die. Earlier this month, a former South Korean comfort woman died at age 96, reducing the number of surviving victims in the country to 46.Japan claimed it fulfilled its legal responsibility in a package deal under the normalization treaty of 1965, but South Korea insisted the comfort women issue should be handled separately as it constitutes a crime against humanity.Frayed relations between the two allies have been a key cause for concern for the U.S. as it seeks to bolster three-way security cooperation seen as a key pillar for President Barack Obama's ""pivot to Asia"" initiative aimed in part at keeping a rising China in check.

Another 237 Korean women, forced into sexual slavery for Japanese troops during World War II, followed suit, demanding a sincere apology and legal compensation from the Japanese government. Later that year, Kim and three other victims filed a lawsuit against Japanese authorities. But Japan’s highest court ruled against them in 2004. Twenty-four years on from that step up to the podium, a long-standing dispute between South Korea and Japan over the issue has continued to distress the now 46 Korean survivors, who are mostly in their 80s and 90s. Earlier this month, Choi Gab-soon died at age 96. Nine victims have died this year alone.Up to 200,000 “comfort women” were sexually enslaved by the Japanese Army before and during World War II. The surviving victims have maintained pressure on Japan by holding a demonstration every Wednesday outside the Japanese embassy in Seoul. South Korea has demanded an official apology and legal compensation from the Japanese government for the victims, while Japan has claimed it fulfilled its legal responsibilities under the treaty for normalization in 1965. Korea has claimed that the wartime human rights issue should be dealt with separately. The diplomatic standoff deteriorated in 2014 when Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called for the landmark 1993 Kono Statement to be revised, backtracking on its apology to the victims. The Kono Statement acknowledged that the comfort women had been coerced to serve as sex slaves, with the Japanese military’s systematic involvement in establishing and managing the frontline brothels.  In 1995, Tomiichi Murayama, then prime minister, issued a “heartfelt apology” for Japan’s “aggression” and “colonial rule” on the Asian mainland in a statement. That year, Japan also set up the privately run Asia Women’s Fund, which drew on donations, refusing to directly compensate the women. The move drew ire from Korean victims’ rights groups, including the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan, who viewed it as a gimmick by Japan to dodge its responsibility to directly apologize to the victims and compensate them. The operation of the fund was temporarily suspended in 1999 and disbanded in 2007 amid opposition from the victims. Of the victims, 12, including Lee Ock-seon, aged 86, filed for compensation from the Japanese government in August 2013 through the Seoul Central District Court. The case is currently pending at a mediation procedure. While the trial over the suit can begin regardless of the mediation process -- which aims to seek settlement before beginning the official trial -- the victims had been waiting for a reaction from the Japanese side that has repeatedly sent back relevant court documents citing the Korean court does not have jurisdiction over the Japanese government. Since then, two of the 12 have died.The international community has also pressured Japan. In 1996, the United Nations’ Human Rights Commission passed a resolution to accept the investigative reports covering comfort women forced into sexual servitude during the war, pressuring Japan to take legal responsibility for the atrocities.The U.S. House of Representatives in 2007 passed a resolution demanding Japan admit to its wrongdoing and issue an apology to the victims. In light of worsening bilateral ties, South Korea and Japan first held working-level talks in 2014 to settle the issue that has long posed hurdles in their relations. A total of 12 talks were held in the lead-up to the deal struck Monday. Japan expressed an “apology, remorse from the heart” to the victims of sexual enslavement and said it felt “responsibility” in the talks held in Seoul earlier in the day. But former comfort women showed mixed reactions after the deal was made public, as Tokyo did not make it clear whether it would be legal or ethical responsibility.Lee Yong-soo, an 88-year-old former sex slave, said in a press conference that she would ignore the results of the agreement. “The government doesn’t seem to care about the victims. What we cried for was an official apology from Japan and its legal responsibility.”Another 88-year-old former sex slave Yoo Hee-nam said in the House of Sharing, a shelter for the victims in Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province, that she would follow the government‘s decision. “We are not satisfied. Money is not an issue when we look back on our lives in the past,” Yoo said. “But, given the government’s efforts to resolve the issue within this year, I would follow what has been decided by the government.”By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","women drafted for military sexual ,237 korean women forced into ,korean women forced into sexual ,another 237 korean women forced ,237 korean women forced","['Kim Hak - soon', 'south korean', 'korean', 'japanese', 'japanese', 'Kim', 'japanese', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'korean', 'Choi Gab - soon', 'the japanese Army', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'japanese', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Shinzo Abe', 'the Kono Statement', 'japanese', 'Tomiichi Murayama', 'Japan', 'asian', 'Japan', 'Asia Women ’s Fund', 'korean', 'the Korean Council', 'the Women draft for Military Sexual Slavery', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Lee Ock - seon', 'japanese', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'japanese', 'korean', 'japanese', 'Japan', 'the United Nations ’ Human Rights Commission', 'Japan', 'the U.S. House of Representatives', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Lee Yong - soo', 'Japan', 'Yoo Hee - nam', 'the House of Sharing', 'Gwangju', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Yoo', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",17,"[ 3.         15.          4.         ... -0.63204551  0.2441877

Police found a digital timer and a bundle of pipes presumed to be carrying explosives in the restroom at the shrine, local media said.DNA tests on cigarette butts found in the restroom and the suspect's hotel room matched, according to the Fuji News Network, a commercial television news network in Japan.Chon made a statement that he installed some sort of a device in the restroom on the day of the incident, according to local media.The indictment came as South Korea and Japan began crucial talks in Seoul on how to resolve the issue of former Korean sex slaves for Japan's World War II soldiers.South Korea and China view the Yasukuni Shrine -- which honors over 2.4 million war dead, including 14 convicted Class-A war criminals -- as a symbol of Japan's past imperialism.Many South Koreans still harbor deep resentment against Japan over its 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula.

The exhibit featured 37 photos of some of the now-elderly Korean women forced to serve as 'comfort women' -- a euphemism for women forced into prostitution -- for Japan's military during World War II.Nikon, which had initially approved Ahn's proposal for the exhibition, unexpectedly cancelled the show three days after a newspaper article about it led to public complaints. The Tokyo District Court at the time, however, ordered Nikon to allow the exhibit to go on.""I'm happy that freedom of expression has been acknowledged,"" Ahn told reporters after the court ruling, according to Sankei Shimbun newspaper.Nikon had justified its decision to close down the show out of safety concerns, and the spokesman said the company felt the court's decision partially reflected an acknowledgement of its position.""We'll carefully consider whether to appeal or not,"" he said. The wartime forced sex issue is a sensitive and divisive one in Japan, which colonised the Korean peninsula from 1910-1945, while its military invaded parts of China and other areas of Asia during World War II.Many Japanese agree that young women from the Korean peninsula and elsewhere in Asia were systematically and repeatedly forced into having sex with Japanese soldiers during the war.But some argue that local pimps and businesses tricked the women into prostitution rings, with Japanese soldiers buying their services as customers with the military having no direct role in the running of brothels.The issue has been a major irritant between Seoul and Tokyo, with South Korea repeatedly asking for talks on compensation. Japan has consistently cited a broad 1965 compensation deal with Seoul that led to the normalisation of diplomatic relations as having settled all outstanding issues.But Friday's court decision came as Japan and South Korea announced that their foreign ministers will meet next week in a bid to reach a final settlement over the issue.","sex slaves was temporarily cancelled ,damages to south korean photographer ,cancelled the show three days ,prostitution rings with japanese soldiers ,korean photographer whose tokyo exhibition","['AFP', 'japanese', 'Nikon', 'south korean', 'Tokyo', 'japanese', 'the Tokyo District Court', 'Nikon', 'Japan', 'Ahn Sehong', 'AFP.Ahn', 'Nikon', 'Nikon Salon', 'Tokyo', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Ahn', 'the Tokyo District Court', 'Nikon', 'Sankei Shimbun', 'Nikon', 'Japan', 'korean', 'China', 'Japanese', 'korean', 'japanese', 'japanese', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'South Korea']",2,"[ 2.          5.          3.         ... -0.75981641  0.23158889

The Constitutional Court, however, said the medication is a temporary treatment for the offenders and the hormones could be produced again when the treatment is stopped.The court also pointed out that the treatment targets are narrowly selected, and only for pedophiles, after experts analysis.Three judges who opposed to the law said it is problematic to use the treatment when the effects and the side effects have not yet been properly verified.The law authorizing chemical castration for sex offenders came into effect in 2011 -- the first Asian country to adopt this type of treatment -- amid a public outcry over a series of rapists reoffending following their release.Chemical castration involves administering medication -- either via injection or tablets -- to take away sexual interest and make it impossible for a person to perform sexual acts. The effects are reversible after the person stops taking the drug.

She was wearing shorts and was barefoot at the time. She weighed just 16 kilograms and was 120 centimeters tall.  (123RF)While being confined, her father and his girlfriend reportedly rarely gave her anything to eat. The girl told police she was constantly physically abused by both of them. According to the police, her father had been addicted to games, while her biological mother left her when the victim was 3 years old.South Korea has seen a dramatic increase in its number of reported child abuse cases, from 7,406 in 2010 to 15,025 last year, partly due to stricter rules on reports. In 2014, more than 80 percent of the abusers were confirmed to be the parents of the victims. The Incheon victim initially had attended an elementary school in Bucheon, Gyeonggi Province, in 2012, before moving to the current residence with her father and his girlfriend in the same year. Even in Bucheon, the child was reportedly often absent from the school. The girl never came back to school after the summer break in August, leading the teacher to visit her home. A missing report was filed, but it was later confirmed the girl had moved to Incheon with her parents.After moving to Incheon, the father never notified the city government of his new address, making it impossible for her teacher or education authorities to track her down.“We are aware of the problems that have been revealed by this case and are thinking of ways to better protect children who don’t show up to school from possible domestic abuse,” said Kim from the Welfare Ministry.According to the National Child Protection Agency, the victim is currently being treated at a hospital and her condition is getting better. She reportedly told the agency she wants her father to be punished.Among the 10,027 confirmed child abusers last year, 8,207 were the victims’ parents. The largest number of cases, 33 percent, were caused by the parents’ “lack of knowledge and skills in child care,” such as not being able to differentiate abuse and discipline. Twenty percent of the cases were triggered by the parents’ social isolation, as well as their stress stemming from financial difficulties. Ten percent of the abusers had conflicts with either their spouse or other family members. Also, a large portion of the abusers, 32.4 percent, were unemployed. An elementary school teacher, who wished to remain unidentified, said the current system, where a teacher is required to mail a notice to a student‘s house when he or she is absent consecutively for more than a week, is ineffective. “We are required to send the notice to the address that is written on the student’s legal documents, such as his or her ID,” she told The Korea Herald. “But there is no way for us to find out whether or not he or she actually lives there. The best way would be to visit the student in person and find out if he or she is physically okay.”According to the National Child Protection Agency, there are only 37 shelters nationwide for children who have abusive parents and are unable to live with them. Those shelters together can house just 250 children.

The number, composed of their birthdate and seven unique digits, is commonly used in daily activities including creation of bank accounts, online shopping or purchase of mobile phones. But as the law does not have a clause allowing Koreans to alter their identification number, citizens use the same number at all times, even when their information is leaked. The court has ordered the government to change the number only in exceptional cases when errors are found in the birthdate.Refuting claims that the system overhaul could be abused by criminals, the court stressed the need for an “objective and fair system to review applications for changing resident numbers.”A group of five people, including a man surnamed Kang, filed a suit against the Ministry of Interior with the Constitutional Court after the government rejected the request and lower courts ruled against them. They asked the court to revoke the government’s rejection, arguing that their numbers were stolen and exposed them to the danger of identity theft and scams. But the ministry maintained that there are no alternatives to the current system and the permission to change resident numbers would take a toll on their administrative tasks. It also cited the hefty costs. According to the ministry’s own estimate, the reform of the system could cost up to 670 billion won ($571 million). The verdict came amid mounting concerns over security of personal information amid a series of data theft cases and financial scams in Korea in recent years.In early 2014, a massive leak of client databases at Lotte Card, KB Kookmin Card and NongHyup Card shocked Koreans, triggering calls for a reform in the current resident registration system. More than 200 million identification numbers were leaked online as a result. Under the growing pressure, the government put forward a bill to allow its citizens to change the numbers when there are well-established fears and danger of damage to their person or property.But activists and experts have pointed out that the measure does not sufficiently protect data from being stolen and misused in the first place, suggesting that the number be composed of entirely random digits not related to personal details. The resident registration system was introduced in 1968 as a 12-digit number, as part of efforts to track down North Korean spies in the aftermath of an attempted assassination of then-President Park Chung-hee. The current 13-digit system took effect in 1975.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","law barring south koreans from ,resident registration numbers was unconstitutional ,ruled wednesday that law barring ,numbers was unconstitutional the court ,that law barring south koreans","['the Constitutional Court', 'South Koreans', 'Koreans', 'korean', 'Koreans', 'Kang', 'the Ministry of Interior', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Korea', 'Lotte Card', 'KB Kookmin Card', 'NongHyup Card', 'Koreans', 'north korean', 'Park Chung - hee']",1,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.20087796  0.33632374

YonhapThe report also stated that although estimates on the total number of such victims vary, “most argue that hundreds and thousands of women were forced into these situations” by the Japanese during the war. According to the CDE website, the specific document is for the Modern World Chapter of the History-Social Science Framework for California Public Schools’ grade 10 students.Sankei Shimbun, the Japanese daily, said that California is the first U.S. state to include a section about Japan’s sex slavery in their public education curriculum. Although the CDE website does not specify, the Japanese paper reported that the U.S. state will finalize the revised proposal for the new curriculum in May next year, after reviewing public opinions on the matter.Scholars estimate up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea and China, were forced to work as sex workers for Japanese soldiers during the war. Despite Seoul’s repeated demands for an apology and legal compensation for the victims, Tokyo has repeatedly claimed that all reparations were settled in the 1965 South Korea-Japan Normalization Treaty. Of the 238 registered Korean victims of Japan’s wartime crimes, 192 had died as of this month, with 46 survivors remaining.In January, major U.S. publishing company McGraw-Hill rejected a request by Japan’s foreign ministry to “make changes” to specific passages in a history textbook about women sexually enslaved by the Japanese during World War II. When acknowledging it had contacted the New York-based publishing house in December last year, Tokyo said in a statement the textbook included “grave errors and descriptions that conflict with our nation’s stance,” according to the Japan Times.

A 57-year-old man surnamed Cho was shot dead by four strangers who broke into his house early Sunday in Malvar, Batangas. The suspects ran away after stealing money and valuables, Manila authorities said. The Korean National Police Agency said it sent three police officers and one gun expert to the crime scene to help investigate the case. “As the police investigation is based on national sovereignty, (Seoul) is not directly probing the case, but supporting the scientific investigation with Manila’s permission. We are seeking a cooperative investigation that is almost like a direct probe,” said Kang Sin-myeong, commissioner general of the NPA.This is the first time that Korean officers are taking part in criminal investigations overseas. The Philippines investigators are probing whether the case was merely a robbery or related to Cho’s business dealings. The victim was reportedly running his own architecture firm, they said. Cho is the 11th Korean murder victim in the Philippines this year. Earlier last month, the police chiefs of the two countries reached an agreement to send English-speaking Korean officers to Manila whenever Koreans became victims of crimes such as murder, kidnapping, robbery or rape. Public concerns have escalated over the safety of Korean residents and tourists in Philippines as more have become crime targets. A total of 39 Koreans have been murdered in the last four years, according to police data. About 40 percent of Korean murder cases abroad have taken place in the Philippines since 2012. The Korean authorities suspect that Manila’s lax gun control and insufficient investigation system have contributed to the rise of violent crime amid the state’s sluggish economy. While the Manila government runs a gun permit system, penalties have rarely been imposed for violating the rule, leaving about 1 billion illegal weapons in circulation across the country. In addition, investigation techniques such as fingerprint analysis or inquiry methods are not yet well developed, posing challenges to finding suspects, they added. According to the Philippine police, over 885,000 crimes took place in the country in the first half of this year, jumping 46 percent on-year, with violent crimes -- such as murder, rape and robbery -- surging by 37 percent. As part of efforts to better protect Koreans, the two states set up a “Korean Desk” in Manila in 2012 to deal with Korean-involved criminal cases. One Korean resident officer works with four Filipino officers, officials said. With one more desk launched in Angeles, Seoul investigators made an agreement with Manila to expand the number of desks in five new regions soon. The Seoul government also vowed to provide 130 police cars and 142 motorcycles over the next three years to better improve the infrastructure of the Philippines’ police system. It will also seek to expand the number of surveillance cameras in regions where many Koreans reside or travel. About 100,000 Koreans live in the Philippines and an average of 1 million Korean tourists visit the country every year.

The current conditions of his wife and child were not known. Local law enforcement authorities are investigating into whether it was a simple robbery or if it was committed out of resentment by an acquaintance.The incident raised the number of South Koreans killed in the Southeast Asian country to 11 this year.The National Police Agency said they will dispatch a squad comprised of three police officers specialized in a crime investigation and one from the National Forensic Service later on Monday.It would be the first time that Seoul's police were send its officials abroad to probe into the crime that took place in a foreign country. ""Investigation is an activity based on sovereign rights, thus we are planning to support and advise the local authorities on scientific probe based on their prior approval,"" said Kang Sin-myeong, the National Police Agency Commissioner-General.The two country's law enforcement authorities made an agreement last month that calls for collaboration on growing violent crimes, such as murder and robbery, aimed at Korean nationals.Ten South Koreans were killed in the Philippines last year, while 13 Korean nationals were murdered in 2013, according to South Korea's Foreign Ministry.In November, the ministry imposed a travel ban on some areas of the Philippines. Under relevant South Korean law, those who visit an area under a travel ban could face up to one year in prison or up to 10 million won ($8,700) in fines.Seoul and Manila are planning to establish five additional task forces to deal with crimes against Koreans in the Philippines, including one in the country's resort island of Cebu, the police said.  Currently, the Philippines has two such teams under regional police agencies in Manila and the northern Philippine city of Angeles.

Police found a digital timer and a bundle of pipes presumed to be carrying explosives in the restroom at the shrine.  Chon arrived in Japan on Nov. 21, two days before the incident took place. He returned home on Nov. 23, the date of the alleged bombing incident.  South Korea and China view the Yasukuni Shrine -- which honors over 2.4 million war dead, including 14 convicted Class-A war criminals -- as a symbol of Japan's past imperialism.  Many South Koreans still harbor deep resentment against Japan over its 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula.  The Yasukuni case, however, will likely only have a limited impact on Seoul-Tokyo ties, observers said.  ""It's an isolated case,"" a diplomatic source said.

That followed the Japanese government's widely denounced demand that the American publisher alter the description of the sexual slavery issue in the text.  The latest statement by the right-wing Japanese scholars also came in response to a landmark statement issued in February by 20 American historians and later co-signed by nearly 500 scholars around the world in which the scholars denounced Japan's pressuring of the American publisher as an attempt to ""censor history.""  The Japanese scholars claimed in the latest statement that the McGraw-Hill textbook contains accounts that ""are completely without supporting historical evidence.""  ""We have to say that the credibility of the McGraw-Hill textbook as a whole should be seriously questioned as 8 errors of fact in only 26 lines, mentioned earlier, on the comfort women were found in the textbook,"" the Japanese scholars said in the statement.  McGraw-Hill has long said it ""unequivocally"" stands by what's written in the textbook.  Alexis Dudden, a professor at the University of Connecticut who has been at the forefront of efforts to denounce Japan's attempt to water down the crime, said that the Japanese historians' claims ""couldn't be farther from the truth.""  ""It's not natural that a government intervenes in academic publication.

(Yonhap)As of Friday, 464 of 480 students from Seoul National University Law School have submitted the dropout documents to the dean’s office, while students from Ewha Womans University remain undecided on when to hand in the papers. After the respective administrations review their documents, a final decision on the dropouts will be made.The move is in protest against the Justice Ministry’s announcement Thursday to maintain the state-run bar exam -- originally slated for removal in 2017 -- until 2021, citing public opinion polls that showed 85.4 percent of the respondents saying it was too early to scrap the exams.The bar exam -- introduced in 1963 -- was set to be abolished during the previous Roh Moo-hyun administration, with the National Assembly passing an act to set up law schools in 2007. Officials cited academic elitism as a prevalent problem of the system, as the majority students who passed the exam were from a handful of top-notch education institutes.But the public opinion has turned sour over the past few years in light of the hefty costs of attending law schools -- ranging from 10 to 30 million won ($ 8,650-$25,922) a year -- coupled with admission scandals involving lawmakers.While the Justice Ministry vowed to find solutions that would minimize possible side effects of the system by 2021, it was met with a massive backlash from the law school students who accused it of breaking its pledge.“The biggest problem is that the ministry went back on its words just to become the patron of a bunch of ‘wailers,’” said a student from SNU Law School who declined to be named. “We (the students) know that law schools have some issues that need to be addressed and improved. But the solution should come from within the institutes, not in retrograding to the old system of bar exams.”Civic groups like the People’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy have also denounced the government’s decision, saying that the ministry, not the law schools, is responsible for hindering the system from settling down.The Korean Association of Law Schools -- of which 25 law school chiefs are members -- held a general meeting Friday and discussed measures against the government policy. This included possible boycott of setting questions for the state bar exam.“A heated reaction from (law school) students is only natural as the decision broke coherence and stability of their policy,” one of the law school heads told local media. The government’s attempt to find a middle ground has also failed to satisfy those seeking permanent continuation of the bar exams, namely the local lawyers’ group. The Korean Bar Association issued a statement Thursday condemning the ministry for “turning down the majority of Korean people hoping to retain the bar exam.”Other relevant organizations such as the Supreme Court and the Education Ministry also showed discontent saying the Justice Ministry did not discuss the issue with them.As the backlash surged, the Justice Ministry took a step back on Friday and said its decision was not final. But the latest statement appeared to have backfired when the KBA denounced the decision as “giving in to the pestering by law school students.”By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","office on friday in protest ,university law school submit dropout ,pestering by law school students ,thursday condemning the ministry for ,to abolish the bar exam","['Korea', 'the University of Seoul Law School', 'the Justice Ministry', 'Lee Cheol - hee', 'korean', 'Seoul National University Law School', 'Justice', 'Yonhap)As', 'Seoul National University Law School', 'Ewha Womans University', 'the Justice Ministry ’s', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'the National Assembly', 'the Justice Ministry', 'SNU Law School', 'the People ’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy', 'the Korean Association of Law Schools', 'the Korean Bar Association', 'korean', 'the Supreme Court', 'the Education Ministry', 'the Justice Ministry', 'the Justice Ministry', 'KBA', 'Yoon Min - sik']",4,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.49927518 -0.02554224

The couple tied the knot 42 years ago but has been separated since 1984, following the plaintiff's series of affairs. He started to live with his mistress in the mid-1990s.Without any economic support from the plaintiff, his 67-year-old wife raised their three children while working and supporting her parents-in-law.South Korea does not allow the spouse responsible for the breakdown of the marriage to file a divorce lawsuit except for some exceptional cases.A district court, however, ruled in favor of the husband, saying enough time has passed to make it meaningless to place the blame.An appeals court overturned the ruling and said he is still responsible for the rocky marriage and pointed out that the wife not wanting to get a divorce is not out of a retaliatory spirit.In September, the Supreme Court started allowing more exceptions for divorce suits while maintaining the country's ""fault divorce"" system, in which the spouse responsible for the breakdown of the marriage is not allowed to file a divorce lawsuit.In a 7-6 ruling, the top court said it is too premature to change the law in consideration of the country's social and economic conditions. But it expanded the scope of grounds for exceptions: when the spouse at fault is sufficiently taking care of his/her partner and children to make up for the fault and when it is meaningless to place the blame after many years.

Nearly 50 years after repeated and failed attempts to revise the law, lawmakers managed to add religious workers to the taxable list despite vehement opposition from South Korea’s big churches, one of the most influential voting groups in Korea’s conservative bloc. Korea is the only country that exempts religious leaders from taxation among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development members.  Members of the National Assembly attend a plenary session on Wednesday. (Yonhap)But the prospects of implementing the bill remain to be seen as the big church groups and religiously conservative lawmakers continue to oppose the tax scheme. Mindful of the opposition, lawmakers decided to implement the law from 2018, a year after the 2016 general elections and 2017 presidential election. They also decided to exempt religious organizations from taxation and provide them with wider tax benefits than given to average taxpayers. For example, a religious leader whose annual income is less than 400 million won ($344,000) can enjoy an 80 percent tax credit. Their spending on student loans, food expenses and travel costs are classified as nontaxable income. The tax rate ranges from 6 to 38 percent depending upon their income brackets. But some Korea’s big churches dismissed the legislation as a “premature” move that neglects to acknowledge that most churches are struggling to finance their organization during the economic downturn. “(The government) should make churches voluntarily pay their taxes, as opposed to enacting a law that forces churches to pay,” said the Christian Council of Korea, one of Korea’s biggest church associations, in a statement released Wednesday. While urging the government to forgo implementation, the CCK threatened to launch an “anti-campaign” during the 2017 general election against those lawmakers endorsing the move. In a vote during Thursday’s plenary session, 195 lawmakers approved the bill, while 20 opposed and 50 abstained. Faced with pressure, some lawmakers who enjoy popularity among Christian groups upped their opposition. The coalition of lawmakers from the ruling Saenuri Party and main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy voiced their concerns over the negative impacts of the taxation scheme. Highlighting that Korean Protestants were the main supporters of the Saenuri Party in the past elections, Rep. Lee Jae-oh, who also works as a deacon in his church, asserted that the government should push for implementation after his party wins the 2017 and 2018 elections. Other Saenuri Party members hinted at the possibility the administration who took power after 2018 would scrap the legislation. Rep. Kang Suk-hoon noted that the Assembly would revisit the bill unless the general public reaches consensus on the bill. Rep. Lee Seok-hyun of the NPAD, vice speaker of the Assembly, went as far as to say that “if we as religious people, try to impose taxes on money that we have given to Jesus and Buddha, how could we see their face after we die?”  According to a survey by local pollster Mono Research in November 2014, 75.3 percent of respondents said that the government should impose taxes on religious leaders. Since 1994, religious figures in Catholic churches have paid taxes. Buddhist temples and most Christian churches have agreed with the move. By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@koreaherald.com)","thursday plenary session 195 lawmakers ,some korea big churches dismissed ,general election against those lawmakers ,assembly late wednesday passed legislation ,big churches dismissed the legislation","['the National Assembly', 'south korean', 'South Korea ’s', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'the National Assembly', 'Korea', 'the Christian Council of Korea', 'Korea', 'CCK', 'christian', 'Saenuri Party', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'korean', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Lee Jae - oh', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kang Suk - hoon', 'Assembly', 'Lee Seok - hyun', 'Assembly', 'Buddha', 'Mono Research', 'catholic', 'buddhist', 'christian', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.60253948  0.64260143

The two states also agreed last year to expand the number of desks, opening them in 10 other regions in the country. Once Korean-related criminal cases are reported, the team members will immediately fly to the Philippines and take part in investigations.

As per the law, schools are prohibited from teaching English to first- and second-graders as part of their curriculum. A revised version of the law, which took effect last September, states that after-school classes are an exception.But the group pointed out that after-school English classes at these elementary schools ― which ranged from one to three hours a day ― have become mandatory for all students. For example, school buses are operated only after the “after-school” English classes finish.The classes were conducted virtually as part of the regular curriculum, complete with evaluations and report cards, the group said. “Conducting English classes like regular classes that are part of the curriculum, holding tests for students and grading them are all blatant violation of the law,” the group said, calling for a special inspection by the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education to ensure that the schools abide by the laws.SMOE declined to comment on the matter, adding they have not considered any steps to be taken against schools violating the regulations. In 2013, SMOE found that 30 private elementary schools violated regulations related to curriculum.Banning English lessons for younger students is part of the Park Geun-hye administration’s effort to curb “advanced learning,” which refers to students prematurely studying material for older students. By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","30 private elementary schools violated ,private elementary schools violated regulations ,banning english lessons for younger ,private elementary schools in seoul ,curriculum banning english lessons for","['Seoul', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education', 'SMOE', 'SMOE']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.25280434  0.21552783

Albeit crude, the small devices had taken photos of major military installations on border islands, potential infiltration routes and the presidential palace in downtown Seoul, kindling concerns over a potential security breach and lax air defense. Boosted by the brisk advancement of aerospace power following two World Wars, drones have revolutionized modern warfare over the last few decades. Despite persistent controversy over civilian casualties from U.S. drone strikes, such as in Pakistan and Yemen, the killing capabilities, greater public acceptance and lower political risks have made the weapons more appealing for leaders, compared with the often drawn-out bloodshed of using conventional ground forces. They are also at the forefront of Washington’s ongoing campaign in the Middle East to eliminate the Islamic State extremist group. With countries around the globe racing to roll out better performing unmanned aerial vehicles, South Korea is striving to strengthen its entry into the market.  An illustration of the corps-level drone being developed by Korea Aerospace Industries. (KAI)On the military front, the Daejeon-based Agency for Defense Development began delving into the technology in the late 1970s, seeking to introduce a miniature air launch decoy codenamed Solgae (black-eared kite) with technical assistance from the U.K. The project was called off by the Air Force in the mid-1980s before it could materialize, but did kick-off the Army’s drive to produce a battalion-level reconnaissance drone. In 2000, the ADD and Korea Aerospace Industries launched the country’s first homegrown UAV ― nicknamed the Songgolmae, RQ-101 or Night Intruder-300 ― and its deployment started two years later. A fixed-wing UAV with a 200-kilometer range and 45-kilogram payload capacity, the aircraft is designed to serve various missions such as aerial and battlefield surveillance, reconnaissance, target acquisition and bombing guidance, transferring real-time images even in unfavorable environments. State-run think tank and defense companies have since continued to study key technologies including those for autonomous takeoff and landing, multiple drone control and collision detection and avoidance. The government, for its part, has devised a road map to boost the industry in line with its mid- and long-term defense reform plans and as a fresh growth engine. “From the envisioned division-level drone to stealthy combat aircraft, we are putting much of our input into UAV development based on our 20-years-plus of experience,” a KAI official says. “It may sound new to the general public, but has a long history not just internationally, but also at home. We want to be a leader in the area as much as in other domains.” The efforts, however, have hit numerous snags. Though restarted in 2013, an ambitious 2006 program for a propeller-driven, long-endurance mid-altitude UAV was nearly scrapped in 2011 in the face of criticism that it overlapped with Seoul’s plan to adopt Northrop Grumman’s RQ-4 Global Hawks high-altitude spy planes. Currently, the ADD with KAI and Korean Air are respectively carrying out projects to develop division-scale UAVs. Another major prospective program is under way by the state-funded Korea Aerospace Research Institute and the national flag carrier, which has in recent years been expanding its foray into aircraft manufacturing, for a Predator-like surveillance and reconnaissance drone called the KUS-15. They have already completed developing a “smart, next-generation” UAV system consisting of tilt-rotor air vehicles capable of vertical takeoff and landing and sending real-time imagery information from distant places at all hours.“The industry consensus is that the U.S.’ F-35 and F-22 will be virtually the last manned fighters,” said an official at the Korea Defense Industry Association. “With drones rising as a global trend, many firms are investing in their development, but the key is performance.”Global spending on UAV programs is forecast to triple to about $14 billion over the next decade in military, commercial and consumer markets, with military research and development outlays set to add another $30 billion during the same period alone, according to a study released last August by Teal Group, a Virginia-based aerospace and defense market survey firm. Drones were also a key feature at a defense trade show in Bangkok early this month, with France’s ECA Group, Israel’s Aeronautics, Thailand’s Avia and other companies showcasing their products. “The market for UAVs looks very strong, increasingly driven by new technologies, such as the next generation of unmanned combat systems, and the development of new markets such as civil and consumer drones,” says Philip Finnegan, director of corporate analysis and coauthor of the study. “Our 2015 UAV study calculates the UAV market at 72 percent military, 23 percent consumer, 5 percent civil cumulative for the decade,” he notes, adding that civil UAVs will likely post the fastest growth of the three, albeit from a relatively low base.  (KAI)At a meeting with a national science technology advisory panel presided over by President Park Geun-hye last March, the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning unveiled its goal of securing 10 percent of the international market for remotely piloted machines ― aerial, ground and maritime combined ― by 2025 by nurturing 650 related firms and helping them rake in 15 trillion won ($13 billion) in total annual revenue. To that aim, Seoul is funneling millions of dollars into the initiative and refining regulations and administrative frameworks, while harnessing cooperation with other leading countries, including Israel. The two nations agreed in July 2014 to scale up their $2 million joint industrial research and development fund to boost technology sharing in UAV development and four other fields. Under the current rules, operators of drones weighing over 150 kilograms are required to seek government approval before use, while lighter ones are subject to registration, with exceptions for military systems and noncommercial devices weighing 12 kilograms or lower. As of July, 716 units are on the list, nearly a threefold jump from 2013, according to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. More than 582 businesses and 850 people have signed up as operators, up from 116 and 64, respectively, over the same period. “A small-scale market once dominated by aviation experts and club members is now expanding to embrace amateurs and ordinary people who use drones for crop-dusting, filming, land surveys or other industrial purposes,” the ministry said in an analysis released in September. Yet South Korea has a long way to go to become a major powerhouse, officials and experts say. They assess that the country ranks seventh in the world in terms of technological capabilities, falling behind the U.S. and other forerunners due to its lack of “core” know-how, professional manpower and infrastructure. The weight-based standardized current regulatory regime also needs to undergo a comprehensive overhaul and include concrete yardsticks, such as for penalties for unauthorized flights or safety certifications, so as to help minimize the public’s safety, ethical and privacy concerns. “While constant support for indigenous technological development and outside assistance is vital, we need to establish regulatory standards based on drone specifications, amend laws to allow realistic criteria for punising for illegal operations, and craft rules for safety certification, mandatory insurance coverage and personal information protection,” a future planning ministry official said, requesting anonymity due to internal policy.

This workplace drudgery has become fodder for popular dramas such as “Misaeng,” which last year on tvN satirized the “incomplete lives” of the country’s salaried men and women.According to a November report by the Bank of Korea, the employment quality of a Korean worker -- measuring stability, salary, work hours, personal development and industrial safety -- was below the average of the 27-member OECD, dragging down the country’s productivity and growth. Korean employees were also among the least motivated in the world, and the country suffered seriously from emigration, according to the World Talent Report 2015. With soaring household debt, downward investment, weak employment figures and a low birthrate, pundits have urged overhauling the nation’s entire framework. (From left) CICI president Choi Jung-wha, Singapore Ambassador Yip Wei Kiat, Google head of Chromecast and TV at Asia-Pacific Mickey Kim, the Turkish ambassador’s spouse Pinar Okcal, Ambassador Arslan Hakan Okcal and Kuwaiti Ambassador Jasem Albudaiwi pose at the Corea Image Communications Institute’s “Korea CQ Forum” at the Singaporean ambassador’s residence Tuesday. Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldAt the Corea Image Communications Institute’s “Korea CQ Forum” on Tuesday, Google executive Mickey Kim talked about his experience in Silicon Valley from 2007-13, illuminating a path for Korean companies. “An immeasurable gap exists between the company cultures of Korea and America,” Kim said at the Singaporean ambassador’s residence. “Silicon Valley being home to Google, Apple, Facebook, Twitter, HP, Intel, Oracle and Yahoo, there is something special about this place.”The southern San Francisco Bay Area is a mecca of high-tech research and development, accounting for one-third of all venture capital investments in the U.S. The cluster earned its name in the 1960s and ’70s from the silicon chip manufacturers located in the Santa Clara Valley.Kim argued that the Silicon Valley enterprises gave workers autonomy over their initiatives, unlike in Korea, where the companies define and drive their projects. “Whereas Korean workers are bound by their ‘face time,’” Kim noted, referring to the time expected in office, “nobody cared what time colleagues arrived and went home in Silicon Valley.” Employees managed their schedules and meetings flexibly using software, and freed themselves from “face time,” he said. “The idea was to give workers maximum freedom, but with complete responsibility.” Kim quipped: “Whereas Korean executives would stress, ‘A crisis is coming! We’re on the brink of a precipice! Let’s tighten our belts and work harder!’ Silicon Valley executives would say, ‘We’ve come this far and are moving toward this goal. Let’s seize these specific opportunities.’” Silicon Valley workers evaluated their performances quarterly, identifying their objectives and results, which were assessed by peers and managers.The evaluation classified workers as “meeting,” “exceeding” or “failing” expectations, weighing heavily on their salaries, bonuses and promotion prospects, Kim revealed. By “meeting” the goals, he or she could continue in their current position, but not be promoted. Those consistently “exceeding” them were fast-tracked up the hierarchy, contrary to Korea, where it has largely been based on seniority. The managers also exercised great authority over their associates and projects, and executives assisted them as “mentors.” “When visitors come to Silicon Valley they are most surprised by workers playing beach volleyball, swimming and lying on the grass during work hours,” Kim said. “But what they do not see is the coldhearted evaluation underneath.” California having large populations of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, workers were “sensitive” about the diversities of religion, gender, race, age and marital status, Kim asserted. Furthermore, networking occurred year-round, creating new partnerships and friendships; firms encouraged different ways of reaching objectives through slow and strenuous consultation. Members of the Corea Image Communications Institute’s “Korea CQ Forum” pose at the Singaporean ambassador’s residence Tuesday. Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldSingaporean Ambassador Yip Wei Kiat said that Singapore’s corporate culture was a mix of international best practices and traditional local operations, particularly among start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises.Many of the SMEs in logistics, transport, construction consulting, retail, food and beverages were homegrown, he explained, noting that Singapore had always relied on foreign talent and capital to compensate for its lack of natural resources. “Singaporean companies may not be as liberal as the Silicon Valley firms, but they are definitely one of the most open in Asia,” Yip said, adding that family-owned businesses still followed the “Asian” or “Confucian” ways of business.“Our philosophy has been to bring in the best from abroad and adapt it locally,” he highlighted. “Promotion based on meritocracy and strict performance evaluation are very much how Singapore works now, both in the private and public sectors.”Touching on the launch of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Community, which was inked during the 27th ASEAN Summit in Kuala Lumpur on Nov. 22, Yip said Korean companies could penetrate the Southeast Asian market from Singapore. As opposed to having separate bilateral arrangements, the envoy said, Korean enterprises could set up operations in different countries covering product development, resource extraction, production and distribution, in an integrated market of 600 million consumers. “Those companies that are unfamiliar with business practices in ASEAN can undertake experiments in Singapore,” Yip pointed out. “For example, a Korean cosmetics firm can tweak and localize its product to the region’s humid climate and unique customs.”The ambassador underscored that the embassy supported collaborations between the SMEs on both sides, helping identify partners and establish incubators before commercialization.

As most of the accused, including well-known lecturers, admitted to the charges, they will be indicted next month, prosecutors said.  (Yonhap)The prosecution raided universities and publishers across the country, seizing evidence such as emails and academic portfolios. It also booked four publishing company employees who are suspected of involvement in the scheme. The professors, mostly in science and engineering majors, are accused of publishing others’ works under their own names by simply changing the book covers to boost their academic profiles ahead of assessments for rehiring. The publishers ignored the practice or even encouraged professors to help offload unsold science books by redesigning them as new ones, prosecutors said.The original authors also allegedly turned a blind eye to the practice under pressure to maintain a favorable relationship with the publishers for future book deals. Some of them are suspected of having taken kickbacks from publishers in return for keeping quiet. The professors in question are likely to be dismissed from their posts if they are found guilty. Universities have policies against rehiring those who have been fined more than 3 million won ($2,600). Those violating the copyright law can face imprisonment of up to five years and a penalty of 50 million won.The alleged collusion among professors and publishing companies shed light on the ethical problems rampant in academia, where plagiarism among professors and teachers has been persistent.Most recently, Changwon National University president Choi Hae-bum was involved in a plagiarism scandal as 33 professors from the school took issue with his doctorate thesis. According to a survey from last year of 417 graduate school students from Korea University, 33 percent of the respondents said they had experienced corruption in the process of conducting research or writing a thesis. “The practice has been prevalent since 1980 in the publishing sector, but it has never been caught,” said Kim Young-jong from the prosecutors’ office. “We will take stern action against the university professors who have little morality to protect innocent students from them.”By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","200 professors for copyright violations ,charge 200 professors for copyright ,200 professors for copyright ,be indicted next month prosecutors ,200 professors from 50 universities","['the Uijeongbu District Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Changwon National University', 'Choi Hae - bum', 'Korea University', 'Kim Young - jong', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.98099798  0.46768942

The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles shedding light on refugees in Korea, their hardships, the systematic fallout, the country’s own history and ways to go forward. The following is the fifth installment. ― Ed.Until asylum seeker Samuel (not his real name) spent several grueling months at the airport in South Korea, he was hopeful that the country would be at the forefront of protecting human rights and accept people like him with open arms. But his hopes were quickly squashed when he was left to languish at the airport’s deportation room in February after being denied asylum and entry into the country at Incheon International Airport.“I would have never come to Korea if I knew the county would treat asylum seekers like this. Does United Nations’ Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon really come from this country?” asked Samuel in his 20s. (Yonhap)He fled his homeland in West Africa due to religious persecution and described the conditions inside the deportation room located at one of the world’s best airports as “ironically worse than a prison cell.” “In the deportation room, lights are always on. We sleep on the wooden tables. We are provided with a blanket and mattress, but airport security guards take them away at 6 a.m. every morning. It is impossible to sleep there,” said Samuel, who spent eight months at the facility located in the international transit zone. “I was offered two small rolls of bread and soda for every meal. There was a toilet inside, but no toothpaste. My friend even used soap to brush his teeth,” he went on. “There was not enough heating or air-conditioning. I felt cold because I am from a warm country.” “When I complained or asked questions, the security guards shouted and swore at me. I was told to go back to my country several times. They treated me so badly,” he said.Hailed by the international community, the Seoul government enacted the Refugee Act in 2013 to guarantee humanitarian protection for asylum seekers. But testimonies about the conditions at deportation and detention facilities appear to lay bare the long road ahead for the country to live up to global standards. Under the new refugee law, all asylum seekers are allowed to apply for refugee status at the port of entry, unlike in the past when those arriving without a legitimate visa were simply repatriated to their countries of origin.The immigration office is supposed to decide within seven days whether to refer asylum seekers to the official refugee application procedures. During this period, they are housed at state-run facilities where relatively proper bedding and meals are offered.  Deportees sit or sleep on a makeshift platform at the deportation room inside Incheon International Airport. (NANCEN)But Samuel was refused his right to claim refugee status in Korea and faced a deportation order, with the immigration office claiming that he had no “clear reason” to seek asylum. Samuel was then transferred to the deportation room at the airport, where he filed a suit with the nation’s administrative court to fight the immigration office’s decision, with the help of refugee advocate organization NANCEN.While waiting for the result, he had no choice but to live at the facility designed only for a short-term stay. “If I didn’t have problems back home, I would have never stayed in the hell-like place for a single second. No one can stay that long under such appalling conditions.” Samuel said. “But I couldn’t go back. I would have been killed.”An official from the Justice Ministry told The Korea Herald that the room is equipped with things needed for basic living, dismissing Samuel’s claims as “untrue.” But it has refused to allow access to the media, citing “security reasons.” The Justice Ministry also said that no one was forced to stay at the facility. “We keep it open to anyone who wishes to come in and stay. They can leave the facility and return freely,” said a spokesperson for the ministry.Yet, Kim Yeon-joo, a human rights lawyer and NANCEN activist representing Samuel, called the deportation room “a de facto detention center,” given the asylum seekers have nowhere else to stay.Some of the long-term residents there reportedly fell ill due to sleep deprivation, poor quality of food and lack of sanitation, but they had no access to medicine. “Without any access to legal counsel or the outside world, the lives of the asylum seekers at the deportation facility are in the hands of airport security guards,” the lawyer Kim said. “But their illnesses are ignored until they show visible symptoms like seizures.” Such human rights violations shed light on the legal limbo in which asylum seekers are being kicked around by the government and airlines who seek to shift responsibility onto each other for the unexpected long-term residents.  A roll of bread and can of soda provided for a meal at the deportation room inside Incheon International Airport. (NANCEN)Under the Convention on International Civil Aviation, airlines that flew the deportees without properly checking documents should cover the costs of looking after them until they return to their countries. The Korean immigration law, meanwhile, stipulates that all deportees should be the responsibility of the Airport Operators Committee, a group of airlines managing and operating the deportation room.An airport official told The Korea Herald on condition of anonymity that the company is baffled by the rising number of those staying at the deportation room for a long time and tries to return them to their countries as soon as possible. “But the asylum seekers stuck in the deportation room should also be protected by the government within the legal framework,” Kim said. “It should be the government’s responsibility, not the companies, to take care of them.” Samuel finally stepped onto Korean soil in October ― the government considers the security zone of the airport to have a different status ― after the court ruled in his favor, saying the immigration office had no authority to decide whether to begin the process of refugee application. It also added that the decision to deprive asylum seekers of the chance to claim asylum should only be made in exceptional cases. Refugee rights activists here have accused the immigration office of abusing its authority to bar asylum seekers from pursuing their rights to apply and thus violating the international refugee law.The international refugee law stipulates the principle of non-refoulement, advising the member nations not to deport any asylum seeker who fears persecution back home. From January to June this year, only 38 percent of those seeking asylum at the port of entry were accepted into Korea and referred to the refugee determination procedures, according to data obtained by NANCEN. Kim pointed out that the Justice Ministry has been quite defensive in implementing the refugee law out of concern that it might prompt a mass inflow of migrants.“But once the government joined the international drive to take in refugees, it should help asylum seekers pursue their rights,” Kim said.In its defense, the Justice Ministry has underscored the importance of distinguishing those who can pose a threat to the national security from “real” asylum seekers. It said potential terrorists could enter in the guise of asylum seekers.“If we accept everyone into the country because they applied for asylum at the airport, we have no way to deny those who are not supposed to be in the country. So we are running the prescreening process to keep them out,” the ministry official said.Refugee activists in unison voiced concerns for incoming asylum seekers, following the deadly terrorist attacks in Paris on Nov. 13 that led to the government vowing to tighten immigration controls.“We think it could further lower the chances for asylum seekers at the airport to be referred to the application process,” Kim said. A Kashmiri man, who wanted to be only identified as Musa, experienced similar human rights violations at the immigration detention center in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province.Musa, a 33-year-old former politician fighting for independence of Kashmir, was handcuffed and transported to the detention center in late 2013 after being caught traveling to South Korea on a forged passport. Campaigning for the independence of Kashmir ― a flashpoint between India and Pakistan for more than six decades ― he claims he had to buy a passport from a Pakistani broker to escape political persecution. “I was not a criminal, but an asylum seeker. But I was locked in the detention center the whole time. In Korea, applying for asylum is a crime,” Musa told The Korea Herald. Since the enforcement of the Refugee Act, asylum seekers can apply for refugee status at detention centers, too. While the application process is underway ― which takes up to three years ― asylum seekers are taken into custody at the detention center without knowing when they will be released. “Prison would be better than the detention center. At least, criminals know how long they will stay there, but we just have to wait endlessly,” said Musa, who spent one year and seven months there.“We cannot go outside, move around and exercise. We cannot use the Internet or read newspapers,” said the man, who was detained with 16 people in a small room with iron bars. “The only way to connect to the outside world is to use a pay phone inside the room.” The detainees are taken outside the detention rooms only twice a week for 20 minutes each while immigration officers search their rooms. “But when I tried playing with a ball during the so-called exercise session, I was stopped,” Musa said. “We wake up early in the morning and spend all day just sitting in the prison cell,” he went on. “Some detainees fall mentally ill and attempt suicide.”A month after he was detained, he started to write a petition to the head of the detention center, asking for access to international news channels, the Internet and proper food. He even went on a hunger strike on multiple occasions, for as long as 57 days. But whenever Musa stood up for his rights, he was isolated in a separate room. “Without the right to access information and legal counsel, it is impossible to prepare myself to defend my case. Then, I become more likely to be rejected refugee status,” said Musa, who has been temporarily released from the detention center for health reasons. One can be released for medical treatment but the process to prove the illness is gruesome and costly. Therefore, Musa’s case is extremely rare, according to sources.The situation for Muslims could be even worse as they can only eat halal food processed according to Islamic law. A 30-something Bangladeshi detainee, who wanted to be identified as Amin and has been held for two months now, said that he now lives on kimchi (Korean cabbage dish), rice and water. “I spend all day doing nothing but praying,” Amin told The Korea Herald. “I just want to get out of here, pack my things and go to another country to find shelter.”Kim Jong-chul, a human rights lawyer for Advocate for Public Interest Law, addressed the need for the revised law to limit the length of stay of foreign detainees at the center. Currently, there are no legal clauses stipulating how long detention centers can house foreigners.“The detention center is to detain deportees only for a short term. It is not a place for people to stay for a long time. So life inside the center could be very distressful,” Kim, who began representing asylum seekers in 2007, told the Korea Herald. “There should be legal guidelines to limit how long foreign detainees can stay at the detention facilities,” he said. “Also, the ministry should speed up the lengthy refugee-screening process for asylum seekers being detained.” The Justice Ministry said, for its part, that it had its own difficulties in processing the growing number of refugee applications and foreign nationals trying to enter the country due to lack of staff members and budget. “There are certain people who illegally reside in Korea, get caught by immigration officers and all of a sudden apply for refugee status when they face deportation,” said Kim Young-jun, the head of the immigration office, citing the possibility that asylum seekers are abusing the system to extend their stay in Korea. “While the number of incoming and outgoing passengers has soared, the number of immigration officers dealing with border controls and refugee applications remains the same,” he added. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","refugees in korea their hardships ,lengthy refugee screening process for ,light on refugees in korea ,seekers following the deadly terrorist ,asylum seekers following the deadly","['South Korea', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea', 'Ed', 'Samuel', 'South Korea', 'Korea', 'United Nations', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Yonhap)He', 'West Africa', 'Samuel', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'NANCEN.While', 'the Justice Ministry', 'the Korea Herald', 'the Justice Ministry', 'Kim Yeon - joo', 'Samuel', 'Kim', 'korean', 'the Airport Operators Committee', 'the Korea Herald', 'Kim', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Kim', 'the Justice Ministry', 'Kim', 'the Justice Ministry', 'Paris', 'Kim', 'Kashmiri', 'Musa', 'Hwaseong , Gyeonggi Province', 'South Korea', 'India', 'Pakistan', 'pakistani', 'Korea', 'the Korea Herald', 'Musa', 'Musa', 'Musa', 'Muslims', 'islamic', 'Bangladeshi', 'Amin', 'korean', 'amin', 'the Korea Herald', 'Jong - chul', 'Advocate for Public Interest Law', 'Kim', 'the Korea Herald', 'the Justice Ministry', 'Korea', 'Kim Young - jun', 'Korea']",10,"[ 3.          0.          3.         ... -0.40166718  0.32395458

It brings together the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations plus its eight dialogue partners -- South Korea, China, Japan, the United States, Russia, Australia, India and New Zealand.  The leaders also agreed to cooperate to counter terrorist and violent extremist ideology, and to invest in enhancing the ability of communities and individuals to challenge terrorist propaganda.  The statement is the latest in a series of moves by world leaders to galvanize international efforts to tackle terrorism following the recent deadly terrorist attacks in Paris that killed more than 120 people.  In Turkey, Park and other leaders of the G-20 summit condemned the deadly attacks in Paris and said they ""remain united in combating terrorism.""  In Manila, Park and other leaders of the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum also strongly condemned terrorism and called for international cooperation and solidarity in the fight against terrorism.  Also Sunday, most of the leaders of the East Asia Summit shared the view that territorial disputes in the South China Sea should be peacefully resolved, noting the freedom of navigation and overflight should be guaranteed, according to Cheong Wa Dae, South Korea's presidential office.  The presidential office said various opinions over the South China Sea were put forward at the summit, in a thinly veiled reference to a rift in the region.  China has been pushing land reclamation projects in the South China Sea, creating tension with the U.S. and some Southeast Asian countries, including the Philippines.  ""I hope that all relevant countries contribute to promoting peace and stability in the South China Sea by complying with pledges not to seek militarization"" in the disputed region, Park said at the summit.  In September, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that ""China does not intend to pursue militarization,"" in a joint news conference with U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House.  South Korea has a strategic interest in the South China Sea as it is a key shipping route through which 30 percent of South Korea's exports and 90 percent of South Korean energy shipments pass.  Separately, Park called on member states of the East Asia Summit to speak with one voice to North Korea to help resolve the dispute over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program.  South Korea, China, Japan, the U.S. and Russia have been involved in the long-stalled negotiations to coax North Korea into abandoning its nuclear program.  Still, North Korea has repeatedly vowed to develop its economy and nuclear arsenal in tandem, despite repeated warnings from Seoul and Washington that the policy is a dead end for the country.  ""North Korea should recognize that it can never get what it wants with its nuclear program, and give up the nuclear program and hold the hands of dialogue and cooperation extended by the international community,"" Park said in a separate summit with ASEAN.  Meanwhile, Park had a brief encounter with U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon at the summit in Kuala Lumpur. It came amid lingering speculation that Ban might visit North Korea.  Ban did not talk as he walked through the lobby of a hotel in Kuala Lumpur when asked by a Yonhap news reporter if he is willing to visit Pyongyang in December.  Last week, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said discussions were under way about Ban's eagerness to play a constructive role in the Korean Peninsula situation, ""including traveling there."" Also Sunday, Park held a separate bilateral meeting with Australia's new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and they agreed to boost cooperation in economy and cyersecurity.  The leaders of the East Asia Summit also vowed to strengthen national and regional capacities to prevent, detect and respond to infectious disease threats.  Park left for home late Sunday.

Moreover, the book describes the United States as an ""enemy of Japan"" for using the term ""sex slaves"" to describe the atrocity.  Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mainly from Korea, which was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. But Japan has long attempted to water down and deny responsibility for the atrocity.  The sexual slavery issue has been the biggest thorn in frayed relations between Japan and South Korea, with Seoul demanding Tokyo take steps to address the grievances of elderly Korean victims of the atrocity and Japan refusing to do so.  Early this month, South Korean President Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe held the first summit talks between the two countries in more than three years and agreed to accelerate negotiations to resolve the issue.

President Park Geun-hye (right, back row) talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (left, back row) as they stand for a photo session at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Manila, the Philippines, Thursday. (Yonhap)Citing a Tokyo official, the Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun reported that Abe made the demand during his first-ever bilateral summit with South Korean President Park Geun-hye at Cheong Wa Dae on Nov. 2.Seoul’s Foreign Ministry said the report was “different from the truth.”“We would like to refrain from divulging the content of the summit,” ministry spokesperson Cho June-hyuck told reporters. “We express regrets over the fact that there have been reports from Japan that are not true or distorted.” According to the report, Abe called for the removal of the statue in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul and reiterated that the issue of the Korean victims -- euphemistically called comfort women -- has already been settled through the 1965 treaty that normalized bilateral ties.The report also said that Tokyo is considering establishing a follow-up to the botched Asian Women’s Fund that Japan set up in 1995 for Asian victims, many of whom were Korean. It has also considered sending a letter from the prime minister to each of the victims, the report said. The civilian-financed Asian Women’s Fund failed, as it was intended to show that Japan was taking “moral responsibility” for the past atrocity. It was dissolved as the victims called for “legal” reparations and apologies, not just financial compensation.The statue, also known as “Peace Statue,” was set up in December 2011 by civic groups including the “Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan.” The monument has been installed to highlight demands for Japan’s sincere apology and adequate compensation for the victims.Since April 2014, the two sides have held 10 rounds of director-general-level talks on the comfort women issue. But no significant progress has yet been reported. Japan has maintained the issue was already settled under the 1965 treaty. Article II of the treaty states the problem concerning property, rights and interests of the two contracting parties and their nationals has been settled “completely and finally.”However, Seoul claims the issue was not on the agenda for the negotiations over the treaty at the time, given it was only in the 1990s that victims and civil society began raising the issue. It also claims it is a wartime human rights issue that should be dealt with separately from the treaty.During the latest round of negotiations over the issue last Wednesday, the two sides failed to bridge their differences and decided to hold another round of talks “at an early date” in line with their leaders’ agreement to accelerate the negotiations over the issue.There are 47 known surviving Korean victims, who are an average of 89.2 years old.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","news report thursday president park ,report thursday president park geun ,drafted for military sexual slavery ,summit with south korean president ,philippines thursday yonhap citing tokyo","['japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'korean', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Park Geun - hye', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Manila', 'Philippines', 'Tokyo', 'japanese', 'Asahi Shimbun', 'Abe', 'south korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Foreign Ministry', 'Cho June - hyuck', 'Japan', 'Abe', 'the Japanese Embassy', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'Tokyo', 'Asian Women ’s Fund', 'Japan', 'asian', 'korean', 'Asian Women ’s Fund', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'Song Sang - ho']",3,"[ 0.          7.          5.         ... -0.41095582  0.83981729

The bombardment escalated into artillery engagement between the Koreas, killing two South Korean soldiers and two other civilians.This year's memorial service scheduled for Monday at the War Memorial in Seoul will gather together about 4,000 government officials and residents of the frontline island under the slogan ""The united power of the people could defend the country from North Korean provocations,"" according to the Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs. President Park Geun-hye plans to deliver a video message to the ceremony, which will overlap with her foreign trip. The ceremony will also include a performance where elementary students from the island will re-enact the 2010 engagement. Marine Corps servicemen also plan to stage a group dance performance in commemoration. ""The fifth anniversary ceremony of the Yeonpyeong bombardment provocation will be an opportunity to commemorate the sublimity of the victims' sacrifice and cement the country's security determination,"" an official from the ministry said. No official records are available on what damage the engagement incurred on the North Korean side, but a local media outlet specializing in North Korea has said it killed about 10 North Korean soldiers and wounded 30 others. Since the artillery attack, South Korea increased the number of Marine Corps troops stationed on Yeonpyeong and four other adjacent frontline islands by 1,200 to nearly 5,000 while deploying more artillery pieces in efforts to prevent a repeat of similar attacks.

He was rushed to a nearby hospital, but died, the Justice Ministry confirmed. The police conducted an autopsy on his body in March and sent the case to the Incheon District Prosecutors’ Office. His body was transported to his home country in April upon his family’s request.  (Picture not directly relevant to topic)In early November, the prosecutorial probe ended, but the cause and circumstances surrounding the death remain unknown.“We couldn’t confirm the cause of his death, but we concluded that he died while being subdued by the immigration officers,” an official from the Incheon District Prosecutors’ Office told The Korea Herald. “But we cannot file charges as we don’t know the cause of his death.”Refugee rights activists here raised the possibility that the immigration officers might have physically abused him while subduing him to take him to the airport for deportation from Hwaseong detention center, where he was staying.“We had asked for related documents including his death certificate and reports on his life at the detention center, but the government kept saying it cannot disclose the information as a probe was underway,” Kim Seong-in, secretary-general of refugee rights group NANCEN, told The Korea Herald. In Korea, citizens and civic groups have the right to information about public administration. It should be provided within two weeks. “But I wonder why they have still not provided us with the information even after the probe concluded,” he said. “Does the Justice Ministry have something to hide?” According to testimonies from foreigners who were forcibly deported from Korea, human rights abuses often take place especially during the deportation process. They claimed that the immigration officers handcuffed them, covered their faces with a cloth and turned off lights inside the bus to beat them up. A Pakistani witness, who was detained at the same time as the late Moroccan, explained that he had strongly resisted the deportation order and was forcibly dragged to the airport. The Moroccan feared he would face persecution back home, the witness said, wishing to remain anonymous.“If the Korean government did not force him to go back home, he would still be alive,” he told The Korea Herald.Kim of NANCEN said the government should clarify what really caused Mahammad’s death so as to prevent recurrences.The young Moroccan entered Korea on a tourist visa last year and stayed past its expiration. He was arrested for theft and transferred to Hwaseong detention center where he applied for refugee status in January due to religious reasons. Since the enactment of the Refugee Act in 2013, asylum seekers can apply for refugee status at the detention centers and are deported if denied. The applicants wait in the detention center until the result comes out, which normally takes up to three years. The former and current detainees The Korea Herald met all likened the detention center to “prison” due to what they called appalling conditions inside. The Moroccan could not cope with the ill treatment and even swallowed two batteries attempting suicide while at the detention center, the Pakistani fellow detainee said. According to a report by Korean Bar Association, some 16 detainees are locked in one room with iron bars and cannot freely get out, move around or use the Internet to connect to the outside world. They can only step outside the building twice a week for 20 minutes each. The Justice Ministry, however, said the teenager’s death had nothing to do with how he was treated or the conditions at the detention facilities. “He had mental health problems and attempted suicide a few times. He went to the hospital three times for such abnormal actions,” an official from the ministry explained. The ministry said he had not responded to its request for interview six times, which gave it legal ground to deny asylum and order him to leave the country.But the authorities did not respond to The Korea Herald’s request to confirm the conditions inside the detention center.The Refugee Act stipulates that those seeking asylum in Korea cannot be deported during the application process. But the law also states that the Justice Ministry can end the refugee application process when asylum seekers do not present themselves for interviews for more than three times.

(123rf)According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, the world’s largest medical library, while a virus or bacteria can cause ear infections, antibiotics do not help viral infections.Korea also revised relevant laws last year stating that prescription of antibiotics is only advised for those aged 24 months and under with confirmed diagnosis. In other cases, the doctors are advised to monitor symptoms such as pain and fever for two to three days.But HIRA’s latest survey showed that 84.4 percent of the kids aged between two and seven and 82.5 percent of them between seven and 15 were prescribed antibiotics.“As it is difficult to discern ear infection due to a virus to those from bacteria, parents who are worried about complications wish to use the antibiotics immediately. There needs to be cooperation from the medical professionals and change in perception among the citizens for appropriate use of antibiotics,” HIRA said.It added that it would look into ways to revise the standards for using antibiotics, as abusing them could lead to antibiotics resistance and tolerance.From news reports","viral infections korea also revised ,ear infection 90 percent of ,10 prescribed antibiotics for children ,ear infection 90 percent ,out of 10 prescribed antibiotics","['South Korea', 'the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service', 'Netherlands', 'Denmark', 'Norway', 'the U.S.', 'Korea']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.47856823  0.30996594

President Park Geun-hye is greeted by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as she arrived at the venue for the Group of 20 summit in Antalya, Turkey, on Sunday. (Yonhap)On the first day of the two-day summit, Park discussed ways to strengthen cooperation to eliminate the global threat of violent extremism as the event was taking place two days after a series of deadly attacks in Paris by the Islamic State group.Leaders were to discuss how to coordinate policies for inclusive and robust growth in Antalya, a resort Turkish city near the Syrian border. But with the deadly attack in Paris sparking global anxiety, leaders called for an immediate and concerted effort to tackle terrorism and go after the terrorist networks stretched worldwide.On the sidelines of the G20 summit, Park was to hold a bilateral meeting with British Prime Minister David Cameron to seek ways to expand economic cooperation, and bolster ties on regional security and on North Korea.Before she left for Turkey, Park offered deep condolences over the deadly attacks in France that left at least 129 people dead. “My people and I convey deep condolences,” Park said in a telegram of condolence.“Terrorism is a crime against humanity. It is never justified and should not be tolerated in any circumstance,” Park said.Park also said in the message to French President Francois Hollande that South Korea strongly supports French efforts to root out terrorism and vowed to join international antiterrorism efforts.“The South Korean government will support France’s antiterrorism efforts and actively cooperate with the international community to curb terrorism,” she said.The G20 summit was Park’s first leg of a 10-day tour. After Turkey, she plans to visit the Philippines and Malaysia for separate regional summits. In the meetings, she is expected to meet Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, just a few weeks after they had their first-ever meeting Seoul in which they agreed to speed up talks on Korean women forced into sexual slavery during the World War II, within this year.By Cho Chung-un and news reports (christory@heraldcorp.com)","antalya turkey on sunday yonhap ,countermeasures against terrorism president park ,10 day tour after turkey ,turkey on sunday yonhap on ,turkey on sunday yonhap","['south korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Paris', 'Group of 20', 'Turkey', 'Park Geun', 'turkish', 'Recep Tayyip Erdogan', 'Group of 20', 'Antalya', 'Turkey', 'Park', 'Paris', 'Islamic', 'State', 'Antalya', 'turkish', 'syrian', 'Paris', 'G20', 'Park', 'british', 'David Cameron', 'North Korea', 'Turkey', 'Park', 'France', 'Park', 'Park', 'french', 'Francois Hollande', 'South Korea', 'french', 'south korean', 'France', 'G20', 'Park ’s', 'Turkey', 'Philippines', 'Malaysia', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'Cho Chung - un']",13,"[ 1.          0.          1.         ... -0.80367231  0.57882732

The ministry said it caught 4,751 foreigners in breach of immigration law including some 3,600 who worked here without a visa. The rest were people whose visas had expired. The ministry has carried out an intensive crackdown against illegal immigration since September in cooperation with police and other ministries. Under the Immigration Control Law, immigration offices can take foreign nationals who are illegally working in Korea into emergency custody and issue them exit orders. The foreign workers are subsequently repatriated to their home countries unless they are granted refugee status.Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese accounted for the highest numbers of people caught. Most of them were found to have worked in factories, construction sites, massage parlors or bars, the authorities said.

The recent government order appears to be aimed at tightening the government's control of North Korean workers living overseas amid a growth of defections, as well as the recently reported abduction of a North Korean doctor in Libya. Earlier this year, North Korean sources said that North Korea is dealing with a growing number of defections by overseas workers, who are under severe pressure to meet their monthly dollar-earning quotas. In May, a North Korean doctor and his wife were reported to have been abducted by an armed Islamic group in Libya. More than 50,000 North Koreans are currently working overseas to earn foreign currencies for the North Korean government, according to a human rights report submitted to the United Nations last month by Marzuki Darusman, U.N. special rapporteur on the human rights situation in North Korea.China, Russia, Cambodia, Kuwait, Ethiopia, Libya, Malaysia, Mongol, Myanmar, Poland and the United Arab Emirates are among the hosts of North Korean workers, he said.

They are eager to be the first ones in office, and for a reason.It used to be no different for young intern Jeon -- she wished to be identified only by her family name -- until all her hard work came to naught. She used to begin her day at the office by making coffee for her seniors, and couldn’t imagine dozing off or slacking, for everyone in her team was watching her -- job performance and attitude would be evaluated when hiring full-time workers after the internship.Jeon endured everything -- from tedious chores to fawning over her weird boss who would frequently leer at her. Despite all these efforts and perseverance, all she was left with after her internship was a text message which read, “We’re sorry but we have decided not to move your application forward.”“I was devastated,” said Jeon, who is back on the sluggish local job market, saying she feels like she has wasted her precious time on a wild goose chase.   Young job seekers look at job postings on a bulletin board (Yonhap)This is not an isolated case. According to government statistics, one out of five young job seekers begin their career paths as nonregular workers, such as interns or trainees. Many businesses hire new workers through internships through which the companies offer full-time positions to a certain portion -- ranging from 50 to 90 percent -- of high-performers. In this way, companies can identify potential employees who are also trained and experienced through the probation period.  Every year, tens of thousands of young Koreans enter into exploitive work arrangements, working overtime and mostly doing menial works for little or no pay, because they consider it as a rite of passage to be admitted into the white-collar world. These desperate jobseekers can barely complain or speak up against their poor working conditions, for disobedience could jeopardize possible job opportunities. “Nobody complains about working overtime,” said Choi, who gained a permanent position at a public firm last year through a 6-month internship at the company. “There was also fierce competition among interns. They were willing to work overtime and nobody asked for the rightful reward as long as they could become regular workers.”Heavy strain and worries are what torment these young people most, since they have to cast their dice on the internship -- they might be wasting their precious time for nothing. Also, they might have to make excuses in their next interviews, while their certificates and English test scores -- which often cost them significant amount of effort and money -- expire in two years. Some even suffer from the fear of being around people, as families and relatives meddle and put heavy strain on them.For female interns, the reality is even harsher. A 22-year-old college student Jang, who recently did an internship at an architectural firm, had to put up with her boss who would pass offensive sexual comments on her body. A few years earlier, a congressman was under fire for sexually harassing his intern. Likewise, female interns are often targeted for sexual harassment. Internships are supposed to provide on-site experience for the fresh graduates, while it can work as a system to find potential future hires for employers. Companies, however, often take advantage of the system and view it as an opportunity to exploit the plight of cheap and passionate workers. Earlier this year, a local social commerce firm, Wemakeprice.com, drew flak for firing all of its 11 interns after hiring them for two weeks. But such tyranny never seems to stop. Recently, a local financial firm reportedly laid off more than half of their interns due to financial problems.In April 2013, a 20-something Korean man hanged himself in his apartment. The young man had begun his sales internship at an insurance firm few months earlier, but had been reportedly suffering from work pressure, due to bad sales performance. Who are pushing the young job seekers to death? The need seems to be growing for more decent jobs for fresh graduates and strict legal guidelines that protects the young, desperate job seekers.By Ko Ji-seon (jiseonko@heraldcorp.com)","making coffee for her seniors ,youngsters rushing to the subway ,interns due to financial problems ,working overtime to sexual assaults ,also fierce competition among interns","['hardship', '”“I', 'young', 'Koreans', 'Choi', 'internship', 'Wemakeprice.com', 'korean', 'Ko Ji - seon']",1,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.09329136  0.29193524

However, those who can confidently say that they had an efficient internship experience are small in number. This, in part, many take internships without adequate information about a position, while some say that many internships do not offer much by way of experience needs for specific fields. Here are details of some internships which are worth doing in your undergraduate days.Interns are making a presentation based on team projects during the National Assembly internship (Korean League Of Women Voters)National Assembly With the purpose of raising students’ interest and understanding of politics, and to foster next generation leaders, internships at the National Assembly occasionally makes available internship opportunities. It is usually hosted by legislators themselves directly, posting a recruitment notice on the National Assembly’s official website or by the Korean League of Women Voters.Interns assist aides or secretaries who are in charge of duties including, data investigation, data reviewing and preparing for parliamentary inspection. They also receive training for legislation proposal through team projects. “There are times when interns’ refreshing ideas gives practical help in putting out real legislative motions,” said Kim Sung-ok, the central chief of the federation.During the internship period, quite a few students actually get hired as aides or secretaries, or at least dream to be one.Consultation company“The relationship between consulting company and client can be compared to that between a doctor and patient. It can pinpoint the client company’s problems, which can be difficult for insiders to spot,” said an executive who was an intern in one of the top three consulting companies in Korea.In order to make an accurate diagnosis for the client, precise information analysis is essential, which is the interns’ main duty.As accurate data analysis strengthens the basis of the company’s operations, and an intern’s job cannot be neglected.“However, it depends on the interns’ capability of conducting their duties, whether to take part in practical working process of arranging for certain events or programs which are requested by the client,” said 24-year-old Choi, who worked at a PR consulting company before. Though consulting company usually refers to ‘management’ consulting companies, it can also include ‘PR’ or ‘advertisement agency’ in the broad sense.Architecture firmAn architecture firm is different from a construction firm, in that it is in charge of design and construction supervision of structures, which are to be built.In Korea, Samoo, Changjo and Heerim are some of the well-known architecture firms.The interns’ main duty is to draw the accurate design for blueprints, using computer programs and produce models -- a miniature of the actual structure.Surnamed Song, 26, who worked in a series of big and small architecture firms after majoring in the field as an undergraduate, said, “It’s also the interns’ share to make presentation materials, regarding the drawn design and blueprints, to explain those to the superiors.”Meanwhile, though it differs according to the scale of the company, it is difficult for the majority of interns to suggest practical ideas, which have a direct influence on the company.Apart from the opportunities mentioned above, other innumerable types of internships exist.The more one is informed of the specifics and gets to experience a differentiated internship, the more efficient it will be in terms of apprehending one’s aptitude and choosing a career path as well as standing out in the process of getting a job, such as during an interview.

The issue of forced labor is becoming increasingly urgent as most surviving victims are well over 80 years old and may die before they receive compensation or an apology from the Japanese firms.It is unclear how many people were mobilized for forced labor and died. Some civic groups claim the number of conscripts goes up to a million or more.The Japanese government, as well as the companies that used forced laborers, however, have refused to pay any compensation, saying all issues regarding its colonial rule, including sex slavery and monetary reparations, were covered by the 1965 package.

One of the key pending issues is a demand by former Korean sex slaves for an apology and compensation from Japan.Park warned that the issue would become ""a heavy historic burden"" on the Japanese government, as well as on future generations in Japan, unless it is addressed.The issue has gained urgency in recent years as the victims are dying off. In 2007, more than 120 South Korean victims were alive, but the number has since dropped to 47, with their average age standing at nearly 90.""I expect the Japanese government to quickly present a solution that is acceptable to the victims and deemed reasonable by the Korean people so that the Japanese government will help restore the honor of the 47 surviving victims and heal their wounds before they pass away,"" Park said in a joint interview with major news agencies in the Asia-Pacific region.The interview came days before Yonhap News Agency is set to host the executive board meeting of the Organization of Asia-Pacific News Agencies.Earlier this month, Park met with Abe in their first bilateral summit and they agreed to expedite consultations for the early resolution of the issue, without specifying a time frame.""I believe now is high time to make a decision to attend to the wounds from the past and heal them,"" Park said.Park's comments came just days after South Korea and Japan failed to produce any specific deal in their latest round of talks on the issue.The two neighbors plan to hold the next round of talks as early as possible. No specific date has been set yet South Korea demands Japan acknowledge its responsibility for the sex slaves, while Japan insists the issue was settled under the normalization treaty of 1965.Separately, Park offered a conditional summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.""There is no reason not to hold an inter-Korean summit if a breakthrough comes in solving the North Korean nuclear issue and progress is made in improving the South-North relationship,"" Park said.""But it will be possible only when the North comes forward for a proactive and sincere dialogue. What counts most is North Korea's sincerity and determination to act on its words.""Despite international pressure, North Korea has vowed to develop its economy and nuclear arsenal in tandem, viewing its nuclear programs as a powerful deterrent against what it claims is Washington's hostile policy.Park's two liberal predecessors held summit talks with then North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, the late father of the current leader, in Pyongyang in 2000 and 2007, respectively. Kim Jong-il died of heart failure in 2011.Park called on North Korea to faithfully implement what has been agreed upon and gradually build trust with South Korea.South and North Korea have agreed to hold high-level talks under the August deal that defused military tensions sparked by a land.

General Assembly adopted a landmark resolution calling on the Security Council to refer North Korea's human rights abuses to the International Criminal Court. It is poised to adopt a similar resolution next month.Marzuki Darusman, U.N. special rapporteur on the human rights situation in North Korea, urged the international community to work on ensuring the North's accountability for what the world body called ""crimes against humanity.""""This year, another resolution will be tabled because not much change has happened in North Korea since last year. In fact, I don't think any changes have taken place,"" Darusman said in an interview with Yonhap News Agency held on Tuesday in Seoul.Darusman was in Seoul to attend a global conference on the North's human rights records to be held on Wednesday.North Korea has long been branded as one of the worst human rights violators. Pyongyang has bristled at such criticism, calling it a U.S.-led attempt to topple its regime.Darusman said in his recent report to the U.N. that there are widespread human rights abuses in the North such as summary executions and torture.He also said that more than 50,000 North Koreans have been forced to work abroad, mainly in China and Russia as the North seeks to earn hard currency. Pyongyang is under heavy sanctions by the Security Council for its nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches.The U.N. rapporteur claimed that there is the need to apply the concept of ""universal jurisdiction"" to North Korea's rights abuses.The exercise of universal jurisdiction allows states to investigate and prosecute those who commit crimes against humanity, regardless of where such atrocities are committed or the criminals' nationality.""It means that any court in the world should be able to address any case that is related to the DPRK with the regard to its human rights violations,"" he said. The DPRK is the acronym of the North's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.Darusman said that the move would pave the way for making North Korean perpetrators accountable for such crimes, voicing hope that the U.N. could initiate discussion on the issue.""Universal jurisdiction will help effectively make the accountability process universal and spread out throughout the world. That means there is no escaping from wrongdoings that have been committed on their people,"" he added.Darusman said he is ""ready"" to visit North Korea if Pyongyang invites him so that he could have a ""deeper understanding"" about the North's situation.In October last year, the North offered to allow him to visit the reclusive country in exchange for dropping the clause on the referral of the North human rights issue to the ICC in the resolution. At that time, he urged the North to invite him unconditionally.He also stressed the need for the South Korean government to increase humanitarian assistance to the impoverished North.""I think (the provision of) humanitarian aid should be separated from political issues because it is aimed at easing the suffering of people in the DPRK,"" Darusman added.South Korea is seeking to spur civilian inter-Korean exchanges, but the government's aid to the North have been largely small since Seoul imposed sanctions on Pyongyang following the deadly sinking of a warship in 2010.""It should be disconnected to any immediate political issues,"" the U.N. rapporteur said, adding that South Korea should be at the forefront of extending such assistance to the North.

73,73,Bad history teaching threatens children’s souls: Park,"President Park Geun-hye on Tuesday spoke up about her administration’s controversial reintroduction of state history textbooks, saying inaction threatened the “souls” of young Koreans.“One would have no soul without knowing the history of one’s country, and learning it in a wrong way would turn one’s soul into an abnormal one,” she said at a Cabinet meeting. President Park Geun-hye speaks during a Cabinet mee...","President Park Geun-hye on Tuesday spoke up about her administration’s controversial reintroduction of state history textbooks, saying inaction threatened the “souls” of young Koreans.“One would have no soul without knowing the history of one’s country, and learning it in a wrong way would turn one’s soul into an abnormal one,” she said at a Cabinet meeting. President Park Geun-hye speaks during a Cabinet meeting, Tuesday. (Yonhap)Park urged the National Institute of Korean History in charge of the publication to put efforts into gathering the “best” experts in the field to author the books to be used in middle and high schools from 2017.“The government has promised the people it will create a proper history textbook that contains the proud history of ours. For this it is of the utmost importance to create a pool of writers with that capacity,” she said.Park’s comments came as the NIKH has been facing difficulties lining up writers. One of the lead authors, professor Choi Mong-lyong, resigned over sexual harassment allegations last Friday.As opposition among progressives continued against the state-authored textbooks, the NIKH said Tuesday it had secured 75 potential authors including 25 volunteers that submitted their names during the recruitment period that ended Monday. The institute said the list would remain confidential for now for security reasons.Park also took aim at opposition political parties, which agreed to resume the parliamentary schedule over the weekend despite the ongoing textbook brawl to tend to budget reviews and pending bills. “The textbook issue should not and cannot be subject to political fighting,” she said.Park further elaborated on some of the contentious points, including the date of South Korea’s foundation.“The future of the Republic of Korea that has the history of division depends on our youth at this important juncture where we must realize reunification. It depends on their sense of pride and accurate perception of history,” she said.She said that current textbooks describe the year 1948 as the foundation of the South Korean “government” while it specifies North Korea as a state as being established the same year. Conservatives see this as implicitly favoring North Korea.Progressive scholars say the establishment of the “South Korean government” is meant to uphold the Constitution that states the current government succeeds the provisional government established in 1919.She added that the textbooks also depict both Koreas to be at fault for the Korean War (1950-1953) and that South Korea’s “economic development praised by the world is described as being antilabor and only depicts the negative side of the conglomerates and thereby stokes antibusiness sentiment.”The opposition has been claiming the new textbooks will aim to glorify the past pro-Japanese and dictatorial governments of the 1960s and 1970s, including rule under former President Park Chung-hee, the late father of Park, by highlighting the rapid industrialization and economic growth.The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy immediately shot back at Park’s remarks.“It is shocking how preposterous (Park’s comments) sound,” said NPAD spokesman Kim Seong-soo in a statement.“It indeed must be a scary situation as, according to the president, our public has distorted souls by having learned from the wrong textbooks.”Park also pressed lawmakers to speed up the review and approval of key bills, including those aimed to boost the economy, create jobs and reform the labor sector.The president specifically urged for the prompt ratification of free trade agreements with China, New Zealand and Vietnam.“If the National Assembly neglects these bills and leaves them to be disposed of automatically, the people shall not condone it,” she said.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","history textbooks saying inaction threatened ,cabinet meeting tuesday yonhap park ,about her administration controversial reintroduction ,sexual harassment allegations last friday ,speaks during cabinet meeting tuesday","['Park Geun - hye', 'Koreans', 'Cabinet', 'Park Geun', 'Cabinet', 'the National Institute of korean History', 'Park ’s', 'NIKH', 'Choi Mong - lyong', 'NIKH', 'South Korea ’s', 'the Republic of Korea', 'south korean', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'south korean', 'Koreas', 'South Korea ’s', 'pro - japanese', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Park', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Park ’s', 'Park ’s', 'NPAD', 'Kim Seong - soo', 'China', 'New Zealand', 'Vietnam', 'the National Assembly', 'Cho Chung - un']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.21781866  0.24249138

They have held talks since April 2014, but no significant progress has been made.Park Ok-seon who was forced into forced sexual slavery by Japan`s Imperial Army during World War II watches news on the summit between South Korean President Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Nov. 2, at a home in Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province. (Yonhap)Seoul’s Foreign Ministry said that Lee Sang-deok, director general of Northeast Asian affairs at the ministry, will hold talks with Kimihiro Ishikane, director general of the Japanese Foreign Ministry’s Asian and Oceanian Affairs Bureau, who recently succeeded his predecessor Junichi Ihara.Since the first round of the talks, Japan has maintained the issue was already settled under a 1965 treaty normalizing bilateral ties. Seoul claims the “humanitarian” issue should be separate from the treaty, and the issue was not on the agenda for the negotiations over the treaty at the time.The leaders of the two neighbors have presented their desire for an early resolution of the issue involving the sex slaves euphemistically called comfort women. There are 47 known surviving Korean victims, who are an average of 89.2 years old.Reiterating that Tokyo’s position over the issue remains unchanged, Abe told a parliamentary budget session that his government would exert efforts to settle the issue.“There is no change in our stance that (the issue of the comfort women) has legally been settled through the (1965) treaty,” he said. “During the summit (with Park), the two sides shared the understanding that (the comfort women issue) should not be a hurdle to bilateral efforts to forge a future-oriented relationship. (We also) shared the need to accelerate the negotiations aiming for an early resolution.”During a Cabinet meeting, Park renewed her calls for an early settlement of the issue.“During the bilateral summit, the two countries agreed to speed up negotiations over the Korean victims. (I) hope (the two sides) will strive to settle this issue at the earliest possible date,” she said.The major bone of contention is Tokyo’s refusal to take legal responsibility for the wartime atrocity. Tokyo has previously taken steps to take “moral responsibility” such as establishing the civilian Asia Women’s Fund, which Korean victims dismissed as insincere. But it has refused to offer legal reparations and apologies.The two sides have been struggling to gain more concessions from each other based on the three-point “Sasae proposal,” which was made by then Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Kenichiro Sasae in 2012. The three points were a direct apology by the Japanese prime minister, the Japanese ambassador’s delivery of a letter of apology to the victims and a compensation fund from the Tokyo government.

The new commercial, currently in production, is aimed to curb smoking among Koreans more effectively, using a combination of possibly disturbing images and messages, said Choi Shin-gwang from the Health Ministry. “We’ve been told that the current commercial with the ballet dancer is not strong enough,” Choi told The Korea Herald. “We are trying to come up with a new commercial that is more powerful.”A scene from the Health Ministry`s current antismoking TV ad, featuring ballet dancers expressing the agony of smoking’s side effects through dance movements. (A screen capture)Choi, a public health official at the ministry, said the new commercial may contain images that may be “painful” to watch. He refused to share further details about the content of the production.The ministry’s move, however, may find criticism for lacking efficacy despite its severity, according to previous research.A 2011 study by the University of Missouri-Columbia found that using a combination of disturbing images and threatening messages to prevent smoking was not effective. According to the study, those who were exposed to highly disturbing antismoking ads, including both graphic images and messages, in fact had a lower emotional response than those who saw ads that only included either a message or an image.“Simply trying to encourage smokers to quit by exposing them to combined threatening and disgusting visual images is not an effective way to change attitudes and behaviors,” the study said. “Effective communication is more complicated than simply showing a disgusting picture. That kind of communication will usually result in a defensive avoidance response where the smoker will try to avoid the disgusting images, not the cigarettes.”South Korea is home to almost 10 million smokers, and an estimated 57,000 die each year due to smoking-related diseases including lung cancer. Last year, the country had one of the highest smoking rates for adult males among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations, at 43.7 percent, surpassing the OECD average of 26 percent. The National Assembly last year approved an 80 percent increase in the price of cigarettes in an effort to curb smoking. The new bill took effect on Jan. 1. Smokers have opposed the measures, claiming it was a way for the government to collect more taxes at their expense.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","antismoking tv commercial starting next ,curb smoking the new bill ,dance movements the new commercial ,antismoking tv ad featuring ballet ,lung cancer last year","['South Korea ’s', 'Health Ministry', 'Koreans', 'Choi Shin - gwang', 'the Health Ministry', 'Choi', 'the Korea Herald', 'Health', 'the University of Missouri - Columbia', 'Korea', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'OECD', 'the National Assembly', 'Claire Lee']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4859094   0.12839809

Over a week ago, she met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Seoul, and they agreed to accelerate negotiations to resolve the issue.South Korea and Japan have failed to produce any significant progress in their working-level talks on the issue. It remains unclear if the latest agreement will have any influence on upcoming negotiations on the issue.The sides have long been at odds over territory and other historical disputes stemming from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula.South Korea demands Japan acknowledge its responsibility for the sex slaves, while Japan insists the issue was settled under the normalization treaty of 1965.Park also reiterated that the issue of history textbooks for secondary students is not something that should be at the center of a partisan strife.She said top experts from various fields will join the panel for state history textbooks, noting that most of the authors of history textbooks are tilted toward a specific ideology, in an apparent reference to left-wing ideology.The government recently announced it will revise the current textbook publication system so that middle and high school students will learn Korean history through national textbooks starting in the 2017 school year.Currently, history textbooks for secondary schools are published by eight private publishing companies pending government approval.Park said the current history textbooks described South Korea's history negatively and minimized North Korea's provocations against South Korea. They also make it seem as if South Korea is to blame for the division of the Korean Peninsula.The Korean Peninsula was divided into the capitalistic South and the communist North after its liberation from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule. Tank-led North Korean troops invaded South Korea on June 25, 1950, starting the Korean War. The war ended in 1953 in a truce, not a peace treaty.Park also pressed lawmakers again to pass a set of free trade deals South Korea has clinched with its trading partners, including China, to boost Asia's fourth-largest economy.South Korea and China signed a free trade agreement in June, though the deal has yet to be ratified by the respective legislatures of Seoul and Beijing.Park and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang have recently met and agreed to cooperate to ensure the bilateral free trade deal will take effect within this year.South Korea has clinched a series of free trade agreements with major trading partners, including the United States, in recent years to boost growth in a country where exports account for about half of its gross domestic product.

But when it comes to male sex workers, South Korea’s Ministry of Gender Equality -- which is in charge of regulating the nation’s illegal sex trade business – currently has no statistics. “We’ve actually never had any data or reports on them,” said Choi Soo-young from the ministry’s Women’s Right Support Division.  Illustration by The Korea HeraldIt’s been more than 10 years since South Korea enacted its antiprostitution law, which criminalized both the buying and selling of sex. Yet the nation’s adult industry still flourishes, with new forms of the sex trade emerging.With or without the Gender Ministry’s willingness to tackle such sex services targeting women, these male “massage therapists” have existed for at least 10 years in Seoul, according to reports and sources. And the industry may be more thriving now than ever-- all behind closed doors. According to a 2005 investigative report by local weekly Ilyo Seoul, parlors that offer erotic massage services, including genital stimulation, were becoming increasingly popular among women in their 30s, especially in Seoul’s posh districts including Apgujeong and Cheongdam. Almost all services were given by male masseurs, who would sometimes use extra equipment, such as adult sex toys for women, upon request.Today, the services for women have become even more discreet in the country where sex services for men, on the other hand, have been relatively more common and therefore face wider crackdowns. “You don’t have to worry about getting caught (by the police) at all,” the male sex worker assured. “We either visit our client in her house (for the service), or meet her in a motel room. We are not doing this at a parlor. It’s all private. There’s no way the authorities are going to find out.”The man offers three massage options -- courses A, B and C. Course A is an hour-long service consisting of a regular aromatherapy massage. Course B adds “sensual touches” to the mix. Those who choose to get the Course C, which costs 200,000 won ($177) per single session, can make any request they want, including intercourse. “Almost every client chooses to get Course C,” he said. And it’s not even that hard to find such services online. Searching “yeoseong (women) massage” in Korean on popular search engines including Google and Naver, tens of thousands of results appear. One of the popular massage services for women is called the “Handsome Boy Massage,” while another is called “Luxury Aroma.” Some websites, upon logging in, offer seminude photographs of their massage therapists. The photographs remind one of bodybuilding competitions.“Women like getting facials done,” the sex worker said. “It’s almost like that. I think (our services) established itself as a part of leisure culture. A lot of our clients are young women (in their 20s). Some women would (go to a motel) together with friends and get the service at the same time, in separate rooms.”Shin Jeong-ae (not her real name), a 51-year-old married woman, has been receiving such massages, without intercourse, for the last four years. In 2011, she had a number of health issues, including chronic indigestion and leg pain. “I thought massage was a better option than working out,” she said. “My friend recommended it and I went for it.”Shin usually asks her male therapists visit her home for the services, which she describes as “similar to caressing between a man and a woman.” Most of her therapists are in their late 20s or early 30s. “It’s such a stress-reliever,” she said. “My body feels so light after getting the services. It also helps with indigestion.”Shin said she has a stable marriage with her husband, and does not feel bad about getting such services. “I don’t feel bad. It’s just massage,” she said. “But I once thought (while getting the service), oh, now I can sort of understand why people cheat.”Sung Kyung-won, an expert in sex education, said the idea that men usually have higher sex drive than women is largely a myth. “I think buying sex has to do with power. Those who do it want to assert their dominance through purchasing sex,” she said. “I think more women would’ve paid for sex in the earlier years if they had the power and financial means to do it. I’m not saying that it’s morally right. But such an industry obviously exists because there is a demand. And more women are becoming financially independent.”Indeed, the male sex worker said most of his clients are women with stable jobs and income. He said he also has an option of saying no to a client’s request to have intercourse. “If I really don’t like the client, I’d just finish the service by giving the massage only for the entire two hours. And then I’d lie that I don’t give the ‘special’ treatments and she would call someone else for such services,” he said. “But I can’t do this too many times because it will make my employer unhappy.”The services’ main clientele also includes female sex workers, who visit these women-only clubs as a way of releasing their work-related stress. “I’d assume many female sex workers, especially those who work in bars and drink a lot at work, would use those massage services,” said a former female sex worker, who spent almost 20 years in the industry and preferred to remain anonymous. “I know female sex workers who would visit those female-exclusive bars and clubs, and make the male workers go through exactly what they had to endure while serving their male clients, such as masturbating in public. The women would go crazy if they didn’t release their stress.”While the male sex worker could afford to mostly greet clients who are “physically attractive and financially stable,” the range of clients received by the former female sex worker was less selective, and sometimes included those experiencing sexual dysfunction. She spent most of her income as a sex worker paying off her family debt. She never married. The male sex worker, in the meantime, works as a freelancer in the health and fitness sector, and dreams of running his own business one day. He also dates women, keeping his part-time job a secret. “Of course they (his ex-girlfriends) didn’t know,” he said. “I can never let them know that.”By Claire Lee and Suk Gee-hyun(dyc@heraldcorp.com) (monicasuk@heraldcorp.com)","male sex workers south korea ,korea herald will publish three ,korea sex industry the following ,sex workers south korea ministry ,illegal sex trade business currently","['South Korea', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea', 'the Korea Herald', 'South Korea ’s', 'South Korea ’s', 'Ministry of Gender Equality', 'Choi Soo - young', 'the ministry ’s Women ’s Right Support Division', 'the Korea HeraldIt ’s', 'South Korea', 'Gender Ministry ’s', 'Seoul', 'Ilyo Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Apgujeong', 'Cheongdam', 'Korean', 'Google', 'Naver', 'Luxury Aroma', 'Jeong - ae', 'Kyung - won', 'Claire Lee']",1,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.79131252  0.46606186

I‘ve sparked dispute concerning the NIKH. I’ll resign (as author of the) textbook, too,” he said, adding he did not want to burden the state-run institution. The NIKH is commissioned by the Education Ministry to oversee the publication process for the secondary education history textbooks.Choi, who was to be one of six main authors, had a meal with four local reporters Wednesday after the NIKH revealed the plans for the publication at a press conference. He allegedly uttered sexually offensive words and initiated inappropriate physical contact with a female reporter. He denied there was any contact, but admitted to “some jokes,” saying he is always like that.The 70-year-old scholar had already been embroiled in controversy after revealing in a Wednesday interview with local media that Hyun Jung-taik, senior presidential secretary for policy coordination, had called him and requested he attend the NIKH’s press conference on that day, giving aid to the administration. He also said he was a “shield” for the government in the implementation of the contentious policy. The news fueled speculation that Cheong Wa Dae was pressuring scholars to support the textbook. Choi denied the phone call the next day, then flip-flopped again later, saying that while there was a phone call, it was just a conversation between old friends.The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy said the fiasco with Choi was a “disaster caused by the reckless and forced nature of the state textbook policy” and urged President Park Geun-hye to scrap the plan.Later in the afternoon, the NIKH confirmed Choi’s resignation and said he apologized to the female reporter in question.“Choi told us that he wishes his resignation does not tarnish the true purpose of ‘correct history textbooks,’” it said.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","harassed female reporter professor emeritus ,secondary education offered his resignation ,media friday he was leaving ,after revealing in wednesday interview ,apologized to the female reporter","['Seoul National University Choi Mong - lyong', 'the National Institute of korean History', 'I‘ve', 'NIKH', 'NIKH', 'the Education Ministry', 'Choi', 'NIKH', 'Hyun Jung - taik', 'NIKH', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Choi', 'Park Geun', 'NIKH', 'Choi ’s', 'Yoon Min - sik']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42435449  0.24925938

President Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe hold a summit at Cheong Wa Dae this week. (Yonhap)A Seoul official on Friday said it was Tokyo that should first propose solutions to the issue involving Korean victims of the colonial-era atrocity. His remarks came a day after Koichi Hagiuda, Tokyo’s deputy chief cabinet secretary, said in an interview “the ball is in Seoul’s court.”  “Japan should put forward solutions that could be understood and accepted by Korean victims, from the perspective that the one who created the problem should solve the problem,” a Seoul official told media, declining to be named.At the first-ever summit between President Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Seoul on Monday, they agreed to accelerate their negotiations over the issue. But they did not set a deadline for the settlement of the issue.  During his meeting Wednesday with Sadakazu Tanigaki, the secretary-general of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, Abe reportedly said it would be difficult to settle the issue if the two sides fix a deadline for the resolution. Observers said his remarks underscored the difficulty in reaching a solution in the coming months. Since April 2014, the two sides have held nine rounds of director-general-level talks on the issue of the “comfort women,” as the wartime sex slaves are euphemistically known. But no significant progress has yet been reported. Tokyo has long argued that the issue was already settled under a 1965 treaty normalizing bilateral ties. Seoul claims the “humanitarian” issue should be separate from the treaty, and the issue was not on the agenda for the negotiations over the treaty. After the bilateral summit, a flurry of Japanese news reports on possible solutions came out. One possible solution in the reports was a humanitarian financial support similar to the botched Asian Women’s Fund. Japan set up the fund in 1995 to offer “atonement money” to Asian victims, many of whom were Korean.Financed by civilian donations, the fund was intended to show that Japan was taking “moral responsibility” for the past misdeed. But it was dissolved as the victims called for “legal” reparations and apologies, not just financial compensation.Seoul and Tokyo refuse to divulge the contents of their hitherto working-level negotiations over the issue. Observers presume that they have been struggling to gain more concessions from each other based on the “Sasae proposal.”During his visit to Seoul in March 2012, then Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Kenichiro Sasae made a three-point proposal. The three points were a direct apology by the Japanese prime minister, the Seoul-based Japanese ambassador’s delivery of a letter of apology to the victims and a compensation fund from the Tokyo government. The negotiations failed as Seoul demanded Japan recognize its “state responsibility” for the sexual slavery. Currently the number of known surviving Korean victims stands at 47. Their average age is 89.2 years old.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","upcoming consultations president park geun ,after the bilateral summit flurry ,yonhap seoul official on friday ,bilateral summit flurry of japanese ,abe in seoul on monday","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Park Geun', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Yonhap)A Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'korean', 'Koichi Hagiuda', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun - hye', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Seoul', 'Sadakazu Tanigaki', 'Liberal Democratic Party', 'Abe', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'japanese', 'Asian Women ’s Fund', 'Japan', 'asian', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Sasae', 'Seoul', 'japanese', 'Kenichiro Sasae', 'japanese', 'Seoul', 'japanese', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'korean', 'Song Sang - ho']",18,"[ 1.          6.          4.         ... -0.44204018  0.67122287

In terms of the normalization of their relations, the summit itself carries considerable meaning,” said Lee Won-deog, Japan expert at Seoul’s Kookmin University.Lee also noted that Abe indicated he could make some concessions on the issue of Korean victims of Japan’s wartime sexual slavery. His position has been that it was settled completely through a 1965 treaty that normalized bilateral relations.“Abe agreed to accelerate the negotiations, although his consistent position has been that the issue has already been resolved. To put the outcome of the summit in a positive light, this could be an indication of some progress on the issue,” he said.However, the two leaders failed to set a deadline for resolving the issue. Some observers noted that Abe’s agreement to accelerate negotiations was just a diplomatic gesture to prevent Park, the host of the high-stakes summit, from losing face. “What Abe agreed to was something he did to cater to Seoul’s position as he came here as a guest. I believe the possibility of Japan taking relevant action on the sexual slavery issue that meets Seoul’s expectations is very slim,” said Nam Chang-hee, diplomacy professor at Inha University.“Unless Seoul offers something in return that matches the level of Japan’s potential concessions on the sexual slavery issue, Japan may not change its stance.”Since April 2014, the two sides have held nine rounds of director-general-level talks over the issue of the victims, euphemistically called comfort women. But no clear progress has been reported so far, indicating the difficulties addressing an issue that Seoul regards as the wartime human rights issue that goes beyond the bilateral issue.The comfort women issue is one of many issues that have long strained bilateral relations.Japanese conservative politicians have visited the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo that honors the Japanese war dead, despite strong protests from Seoul and Beijing. Tokyo has also stepped up its sovereignty claim to Korea’s easternmost islets of Dokdo, which Japan calls Takeshima.Japan’s distortion of history in school textbooks has also aggravated diplomatic friction. Japan’s moves to push the limits of its pacifist constitution to allow it to exercise the right to collective self-defense and expand its security role have also sparked security concerns to Japan’s onetime colony.Describing Monday’s summit as a bilateral step to widen the possibilities of settling an array of thorny issues, Nam of Inha University stressed the need for Seoul to employ a well-thought-out policy on Japan rather than applying “only pressure” on it to settle the issues.“Currently, Japan’s political landscape is not favorable for South Korean diplomacy as Japan’s opposition forces crumbled with conservative politicians dominating both chambers of Japan’s legislature,” he said.“Thus, to induce some change in Japan’s stance, Seoul needs to employ a smarter approach rather than being too straightforward and ratcheting up pressure on Japan to address the thorny issues. This will not work, even though it did to a certain extent in the 1990s when Japan’s Socialist Party held political influence.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","monday to speed up negotiations ,sexual enslavement of korean women ,first summit between president park ,monday summit as bilateral step ,despite strong protests from seoul","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Japan', 'China', 'Lee Won - deog', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Kookmin University', 'Lee', 'Abe', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Abe ’s', 'Park', 'Abe', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Nam Chang - hee', 'Inha University', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'japanese', 'Tokyo', 'japanese', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Tokyo', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Takeshima', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Nam of Inha University', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'south korean', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'Japan ’s Socialist Party', 'Song Sang - ho']",9,"[ 1.         18.          2.         ... -0.16448545  0.5016095

One of the key pending issues is a demand by former Korean sex slaves for an apology and compensation from Japan.  Japan has so far refused to comply with the demand, insisting that the comfort women were recruited by civilian profiteers and its wartime military-led government was not directly involved.  The issue has gained urgency in recent years as the victims are dying off. In 2007, more than 120 South Korean victims were alive, but the number has since dropped to 47, with their average age standing at nearly 90.  Historians estimate that more than 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were sexually enslaved by Japanese troops during World War II.        The two leaders also agreed to continue to cooperate on North Korea's nuclear weapons program.  South Korea and Japan have been involved in the long-stalled negotiations, along with the U.S. and other regional powers, to try to coax North Korea to abandon its nuclear program.  On Sunday, Park and Abe held a trilateral summit with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in Seoul, and they agreed to make efforts for a quick resumption of the nuclear talks that also involve China and Russia.  Still, there are signs of progress in resuming the talks that were last held in 2008.  North Korea has recently hinted that it may conduct another nuclear test and vowed to launch a series of satellites as part of its space development program. Seoul and Washington view a satellite launch as a cover for testing the North's ballistic missile technology, which is banned under U.N. resolutions.

Chinese railway authorities opened the memorial hall earlier last year honoring the Korean independence hero Ahn Jung-geun, who assassinated the Korean Peninsula's first Japanese governor-general, Hirobumi Ito, at a railway station in the northeastern Chinese city of Harbin in October 1909.  The assassination was a watershed moment in Japan's 36-year colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula that began in 1910. The authorities will gradually renovate the Harbin railway station, where Ito was killed, by 2018, and the size of the memorial hall will be expanded to as large as 500 square meters from the current size of 200 square meters, according to the Chinese officials. ""Construction of a new memorial hall is expected to begin in the first half of next year,"" a memorial hall official said. Yang Xinglong, head of the memorial hall, said, ""We will display more exhibits to let more people understand martyr Ahn's spirit of the anti-Japanese movement and peace in line with the expansion of the memorial hall."" Ahn is viewed in both Korea and China as a symbol of the fight against Japan's Imperial Army, but Japanese officials have drawn criticism by describing him as a terrorist.The memorial hall at the Harbin station has attracted about 200,000 visitors so far.

Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea speaks during a meeting of vice education superintendents Monday at Sejong Government Complex. (Yonhap)Ministry officials at the office denied entry to the lawmakers, turned off the lights and called the police, with the standoff lingering on to the next day.The NPAD claimed that the unknown team has been reporting directly to the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae, on grounds that the team in question had a folder marked “BH,” meaning Blue House (Cheong Wa Dae). NPAD member Kim Tae-Nyeon raised suspicion that the ministry had secretly operated the team since September, well before the ministry made its decision official. In an emergency briefing the next day, the ministry explained that the claims that it was running a secret task force were baseless, and that the team on history education had increased staff due to a spike in their workload.“We have no reason to hide the team, as it is not newly created but an already-existing one. Transfer records do not exist because (the officials) have not been relocated, but temporarily shifted,” said a ministry official in charge of the team. He claimed that the office was set up in Seoul, not in Sejong City where the ministry is based, because the government complex did not have sufficient room. He added that the officials at the office may have called the police because they panicked at the unscheduled visit by lawmakers and the media that accompanied them. The official denied that the ministry set up the team specifically to deal with the state textbooks, and said it had increased staffing to address the explosive increase in the parliament’s demand for data, and to deal with the media. He denied allegations that the team was directly reporting to Cheong Wa Dae, saying that he was heading the operation. But the official said that he only learned of the overnight standoff this morning via media coverage. A public statement denying the NPAD’s accusations was issued around midnight under the name of the Education Ministry. The special team will continue operations until Nov. 2.Parties were at loggerheads over the new allegations. NPAD floor leader Lee Jong-kul accused President Park Geun-hye of secretly pushing ahead with the state textbook plan, while the ruling Saenuri Party’s leader Kim Moo-sung accused the opposition of “forcibly imprisoning” the ministry officials in the office.With the dispute over state history textbooks showing no signs of fading out, some members of the ruling party have expressed opposition to the plan.Rep. Chung Doo-un, among the few Saenuri members who have opposed the policy, said that the state history textbooks was a “disaster” and urged the government to “admit to making a mistake.”“Public opinion is against the government because of (the state textbook). It is virtually a boon for the opposition. The government is reviving the opposition, which is suffering from faltering public support, with the policy,” he said in a radio interview.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","school history textbooks sunday alleging ,school history textbooks sunday ,history textbooks sunday alleging that ,of school history textbooks sunday ,lawmakers staged an overnight standoff","['Education Ministry', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'the National Institute for International Education', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'Cheong', 'Dae', 'Blue House', 'NPAD', 'Kim Tae - Nyeon', 'Seoul', 'Sejong City', 'the Education Ministry', 'Lee Jong - kul', 'Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party ’s', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Chung Doo - un', 'Saenuri']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.06227184  0.37020794

The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles shedding light on refugees in Korea, their hardships, the systematic fallout, the country’s own history and ways to go forward. The following is the third installment. - Ed.From late President Kim Dae-jung to conscientious objectors and North Korean defectors, South Korea’s history has been dotted with marks of refugees since the country’s liberation in 1945. While stepping up efforts to embrace asylum seekers from across the border and around the world since the enactment of Asia’s first standalone refugee act in July 2013, Seoul has seen a constant rise in the number of its own citizens who obtained foreign citizenship for political and other reasons. As of December 2014, 481 refugees and 285 asylum seekers of South Korean origin live overseas, while 1,173 refugees, 3,489 asylum seekers and 204 stateless persons from abroad reside here, according to the U.N. Refugee Agency. Between 1951 and January 2013, 559 South Koreans were granted a refugee status, with another 186 undergoing screening. As for North Koreans, the figures reached 1,110 and 1,027 during the same period. The 1951 Refugee Convention outlines a refugee as someone who “owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.” Seoul signed the treaty in 1992. Civic activits stage a performance supporting conscientious objectors outside the Constitutional Court in Seoul in July, during a public hearing on whether to allow people to refuse mandatory military service based on their religious or personal beliefs. (Yonhap)Tokyo’s 1910-45 occupation on the peninsula in particular gave birth to various breeds of refugees who had to cross the border for forced labor, independent movement or other reasons. Now millions of ethnic Koreans -- the refugees’ descendants -- live across Japan, China, Russia and Central Asia. In 1947, the Japanese government demanded Koreans residing in Japan to register as foreigners in an apparent attempt to make them exempt from social security and other benefits, even though they did not have a nationality to inscroll because no government had yet been established on either side of the peninsula following its liberation. Even after the territorial division the next year, many did not choose a South or North Korean nationality, nor were they naturalized as Japanese. The number of stateless “Zainichi“ (meaning residing in Japan) is projected to stand at some 30,000 now, classified by Tokyo for administrative reasons as having Joseon citizenship. Their decades-long struggle is not confined to social discrimination at their second home. Their motherland, too, has been failing to facilitate what the people see as minimal civil liberty, such as freedom to visit.   Their lack of passports makes any overseas travel difficult, as they must acquire a reentry permit from the Japanese government on each return trip. To visit South Korea, they also need to apply for a travel certificate, but are often denied for unclear reasons or forced to change their nationality. In December 2013, Seoul’s Supreme Court ruled against Jeong Young-hwan, who raised a suit in 2009 against the South Korean consulate-general in Osaka for rejecting his request for a travel certificate. A “Joseon” national and university researcher on Korean studies, he had not had much difficulty traveling to Seoul until then, but the conservative Lee Myung-bak government denied it because he visited Pyongyang in 1999 and met an official of a pro-North Korea organization in Japan in 2006. The come-off of Jeong’s years-long legal battle came as a shock to many other Zainichi and activists. It also ran counter to the National Human Rights Commission’s 2009 recommendation to the foreign minister to correct customs that officials at overseas diplomatic missions urge or coax stateless Koreans in Japan to pick one nationality.  “The fact that South Korean nationality held concurrently with permanent residence of Japan is inadequate as a nationality has long been a contentious issue in Zainichi public discourse, especially during the intense confrontation between North Korea and South Korea against the backdrop of the Cold War,” said Moon Young-min, an art professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in the journal Japan Focus earlier this year. “Given the combination of the colonial past and contentious postcolonial involvement with Cold War politics by Zainichi Koreans, which virtually split the expatriate community into the North Korea-supporting camp and the South Korea-supporting camp, naturalization continues to carry a certain weight as a litmus test of one’s allegiance and integrity.” A more renowned exile is late President Kim Dae-jung, who had fought against political persecution as a prominent opposition leader during the dictatorship under Park Chung-hee. He took asylum twice -- in Japan in the 1970s and in the U.S. in the 1980s -- amid several assassination attempts, kidnapping, imprisonment, house arrest and other hardships. Long after democracy flourished on this soil and the Nobel laureate’s presidency ended, the country continues to struggle to transform into a safe asylum provider, due in part to the ongoing territorial division and inter-Korean face-off. In recent years, a growing number of North Korean defectors resettled in the South opt to leave for a third country such as the U.S., Britain or Australia. The primary rationale behind the exodus was to access a better social safety net and break free from social exclusion and cutthroat competition against more affluent, better educated South Koreans in an already saturated job market. Defectors here have reported a wide range of social and financial problems. Cultural and educational gaps could take years to overcome. Prejudice among South Koreans is another factor as politics and ideology frame them despite their common ethnicity. A 2011 survey on 8,299 defectors by the North Korean Refugees Foundation showed that more than 30 percent earn less than 1 million won ($890) a month. The jobless rate averaged at 12.1 percent -- 3.3 times the general population’s 3.7 percent.Critics have called on the government to set up a system to help defectors land a more secure job and plan for their later years.With all physically able young men being subject to compulsory military service for about two years here, meanwhile, Seoul has also been taking flak for incarcerating conscientious objectors despite the religious freedom enshrined in the constitution. In 2012, Lee Ye-da became the first conscientious objector to earn the refugee status in France. The 24-year-old has since been in the forefront of the campaign against the practice. He was one of the 5,723 people who have refused to serve in the military over the past 10 years, according to data submitted by the Defense Ministry to Rep. Jin Sung-joon of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy. Of the 5,215 who received a criminal penalty, 599 are currently in jail. Watchtower International, a Jehovah’s Witnesses nongovernmental organization, estimated that since 1950, 18,060 conscientious objectors have been put in prison in South Korea. The issue was once again highlighted in the U.S. State Department’s annual international religious freedom report released this month and a deliberation last week on Seoul’s implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in Geneva.“While absolved of any additional military commitment, after serving time in prison conscientious objectors had a criminal record that could affect future employment opportunities, including limitations on holding public office or working as a public servant,” the U.S. document said. To stem the outflow of refugees and preserve the right of the objectors, the U.N., the U.S. and other countries and civic groups have urged the Constitutional Court here to decriminalize conscientious objection and the government to devise an alternative service system. Seoul remains cautious given unsettled worries that any substitute measure may well be taken advantage of by potential evaders, though it apparently acknowledges the criticism. In January, President Park Geun-hye reduced sentences by one to four months for about 100 Jehovah’s Witness objectors in prison.“Military service is a national obligation under the constitution, and the Supreme Court and Constitutional Court have also ruled for punishment on vetoers,” Vice Justice Minister Kim Joo-hyun said during the deliberation in Geneva last Friday. “An alternative service system is an issue that can be considered as the security situation on the peninsula changes and public consensus builds.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","refugees in korea their hardships ,light on refugees in korea ,korean defectors south korea history ,of ethnic koreans the refugees ,on refugees in korea their","['South Korea', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'north korean', 'South Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'the U.N.

They are euphemistically called ""comfort women.""Pillay, a South African lawyer, is known as a life-time advocate of human rights.

101,101,Debate brews over talks of new retirement age in Korea,"The Korean government’s proposal to raise the state pension age from 65 to 70 in its attempt to save on the cost of welfare programs is facing fierce opposition from the elderly population as well as local experts and critics.　Once the proposal is implemented, those aged 65-69 will become ineligible to receive all state welfare benefits for the elderly, including state pension payments and free public transportatio...","The Korean government’s proposal to raise the state pension age from 65 to 70 in its attempt to save on the cost of welfare programs is facing fierce opposition from the elderly population as well as local experts and critics.Once the proposal is implemented, those aged 65-69 will become ineligible to receive all state welfare benefits for the elderly, including state pension payments and free public transportation. The proposal was recently released after the Korea Senior Citizens’ Association, one of the largest representative bodies of Korean senior citizens, publicly showed its support to the government’s plan to raise the retirement age back in May. Senior citizens protest against the Welfare Ministry`s policies for the elderly. (Yonhap)“We have decided that this is the right way to coexist with the younger generation, who are struggling with unemployment,” said Kang Se-hoom from the KSCA, which has some 3 million members. “We hope that the change of the retirement age can help the government create more (welfare) programs and jobs for young Koreans.”However, a man who has connection to the organization, who did not wish to be named, said the number of KSCA members in their 60s is very small compared to those currently aged 70 or older, and therefore the vast majority of the members won’t be affected even if the retirement age changes. The KSCA refused to give the exact numbers of members in the 60s and those aged 70 or older. According to the man, the KSCA has been receiving aggressive requests to support the government proposal from the public transit companies, who claimed that the exemption of public transportation fares among the elderly has been one of their major cases of deficits. The fares have been free for all citizens aged 65 or older since 1984. Last year, Seoul Metro, a public corporation that runs Seoul Subway Lines 1, 2, 3, 4 and 9, reported net losses of 158.7 billion won ($139.9 million), mostly caused by fare exemption for the elderly. The Health Ministry predicts that some 2.3 trillion won in welfare programs will be saved once the retirement age is raised to 70 from the current 65. However, Nonyeon Union, a group of elderly unionized workers, warned that raising the retirement age would result in more suicides among the elderly. Korea’s elderly suicide rate has more than tripled since 2000, almost four times higher than the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development average as of 2010. Almost 50 percent of the entire elderly population are living below the poverty line as of last year, partly because of inadequate public welfare programs. “One of the government’s reasons for proceeding with this proposal is that, more than 80 percent of the elderly population in Korea does not define those in their 60s as ‘senior citizens,’ according to their recent survey,” said Koh Hyun-jong from the union. “I’m sure one would feel flattered if she or he is told that they look younger than they actually are. But feeling flattered cannot compensate for what we need in order to survive during our postretirement age.”Professor Lee Geum-yong from Samgmyung University said changing the retirement age can have a critical impact on the lives of those aged 65-69, especially those who don’t have a postretirement plan.“(In Korea), the quality of one’s life can worsen significantly after he or she retires,” he said. “Getting a job that pays enough after retirement is not easy. The current welfare programs are not enough for one to have an income that he or she used to have before retiring from their job.”A recent report showed that transfer payments, such as social retirement benefits and public pension payments, only make up about 28.8 percent of the average income of the Korean elderly, while they account for almost 70 percent of the average income of senior citizens in many European countries, such as Denmark and the U.K.  The high elderly poverty rate and inadequate public transfer payments mean that most of the Korean elderly must stay employed, even if they don’t want to, or financially depend on their family members or children in order to live above the poverty line, the report claimed.

Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony from 1910-45.""I think South Korea and Japan should move toward a new future together based on the spirit of a correct recognition of history and friendship and good neighborliness,"" Park said in a video message to a South Korea-Japan friendship meeting at a Seoul hotel.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made a similar call in a separate video message, saying South Korea and Japan are the ""most important"" neighbors that share strategic interests.""I would like to further develop relations with South Korea,"" he said, adding that people-to-people exchanges are important.Park is set to host the leaders of China and Japan for a trilateral summit in early November.A trilateral summit has not been held since May 2012 due to tensions over Japan's attempts to whitewash its wartime atrocities and colonial occupation.It remains to be seen whether Park and Abe will hold their first bilateral summit on the sidelines. Park said last week that the three-way talks could be an opportunity to meet separately with Abe.However, South Korea recently denounced Japan for Abe's offering to a Tokyo war shrine and urged it to demonstrate by action its humble reflection and repentance.South Korea and China view the Yasukuni Shrine -- which honors over 2.4 million war dead, including 14 convicted Class-A war criminals -- as a symbol of Japan's past imperialism.

The nation’s worst maritime accident killed more than 300 people, mostly students on a school trip. “Without any evidence that the rumors about Park’s relationship with a man were true, it seems like the accused intended to spread the rumors, pretending that it is for the public good,” prosecutors said in court. “The accused did not even try to verify the rumors.”The court is expected to hand down a sentence for Kato on Nov. 26. In his defense, Kato said that he did not have an intention to defame her. “I only meant to deliver objective reports on Korean politics and society as Japanese take great interest in President Park’s moves,” he said in final testimony. Kato’s lawyer argued the whereabouts of the president is a public matter and Kato wrote the column based on circulating rumors that were already published in the Chosun Ilbo, South Korea’s largest newspaper. The column in July last year questioned Park’s whereabouts on the day of the ferry sinking, triggering rumors that she might have been with a man at the time. “The Japanese government has strongly demanded the Korean government reasonably respond to the case from the perspective of bilateral ties and freedom of press, expression,” Yoshihide Suga, the spokesperson for the Japanese government said at a press briefing in Tokyo on Tuesday, voicing concerns and regret over the penalty sought for Kato. Sankei Shimbun also expressed astonishment and anger at the move, asking the Korean prosecution to make a ruling based on democratic values and “international common sense.” Reporters Without Borders urged the South Korean judicial system to refrain from imposing a jail sentence on Kato, calling it a “real threat” for journalists and viewing it as the government's desire to tighten controls on media.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","of defaming south korean president ,jail term for japanese journalist ,indicted last october for running ,sparked fury from japan prosecutors ,libel the south korean president","['japanese', 'south korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Japan', 'Tatsuya Kato', 'Seoul', 'japanese', 'Sankei Shimbun', 'south korean', 'Tatsuya Kato', 'Yonhap)Kato', 'Park', 'Jeong Yun - hoe', 'Park', 'Kato', 'Kato', 'korean', 'Japanese', 'Kato ’s', 'Kato', 'South Korea ’s', 'Park ’s', 'japanese', 'korean', 'japanese', 'Tokyo', 'Kato', 'korean', 'south korean', 'Kato', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",12,"[ 0.          1.          3.         ... -0.47488555  0.23332894

Last week, he and 23 colleagues at Pusan National University joined a nationwide move by professors to refuse to participate in the creation of state history textbooks.“The concept of ‘one history’ is basically against the essence of history education, which is to allow, encourage various interpretations (of history) by students,” said Yang, who doubles as the chief of the Korean Association of History Education.  Yang Jung-hyunHe voiced concerns that state-authored books will attempt to favorably depict controversial figures like former President Park Chung-hee. “It was only under Japanese Imperialism and (Park’s) Yushin dictatorship that state textbooks were used, with the sole intent of justifying the unlawful monopoly of power by imposing a monolithic historical view on students. Reviving the state history textbooks will send the wheels back to the times of the dictatorship,” he said. Yang added that the Korean Constitution states that education should be impartial and politically neutral, which is impossible if a certain party monopolizes the publishing rights. Speaking from past experience authoring a state-commissioned middle school history textbook published in 2002, Yang pointed out that writers of state textbooks are structurally subject to government influence even if the administration is not a dictatorship. In nearly two years of tussle over state history textbooks, both the conservative administration and ruling Saenuri Party were in tandem in emphasizing that current history textbooks are biased in favor of the leftists, and even favorably depict North Korea. Party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung claimed that historians are 90 percent leftists while the Education Ministry said the current textbooks looked like they were published in Pyongyang.For example, the ministry and the party pointed out that all textbooks depicted in-depth the North’s juche ideology ― the backbone of Pyongyang’s dictatorial regime ― accusing them of blindly repeating North Korea’s descriptions about itself. Saenuri last week hung a placard saying, “Our children are learning juche ideology!” across the country, which they took down a day later after it was revealed that the textbooks also criticize the juche idea.Yang, who dismissed Kim’s claim as “not even worth mentioning,” said such claims are taken out of context. He said as the two Koreas are still technically at war, it makes sense for South Korean students to learn about their hostile neighbor. “Know your enemy, they say. Students of course must know about the situation and ideas of North Korea.”“How could a textbook that glorifies North Korean ideology pass the state inspection? If the textbooks are indeed (biased), the president and the education minister should resign,” he said. The ministry has also accused current textbooks of having numerous errors. Proponents of the state history textbooks say the quality issue can be resolved when the government takes over. But Yang said state-published textbooks would not necessarily guarantee better quality.“From my experience, the state history textbooks do not have to worry about quality because there will be no competition. But privately published books have to compete with each other, giving them an incentive to consider what the students are interested in and what the teachers need,” he said. “This is actually what the ministry touted as the biggest advantage of the private publishing system when it was introduced back then.”Yang raised suspicion that the newly published books will be reminiscent of a textbook by Kyohak Publishing Co., which was accused of being poorly written and biased in favor of conservatives. The PNU professor added that while past publishing of state textbooks took over two years, the ministry’s plan to use the state textbooks from March 2017 only allows the government a year to author the books. “The short period of time indicates that the true intent of the state textbook system is not in producing the best textbook possible,” Yang said. “It seems to me that President Park is compelled to see the state textbooks put to use before her tenure is over, as 2017 is her last year in office.“This makes me suspect that Park is looking to shine a positive light on her father’s rule,” he added, echoing concern voiced by opponents of the state history textbook.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","tussle over state history textbooks ,move by professors to refuse ,reviving the state history textbooks ,current history textbooks are biased ,commissioned middle school history textbook","['the Education Ministry', 'Yang Jung - hyun', 'Pusan National University', 'Yang', 'the Korean Association of History Education', 'Yang Jung - hyunHe', 'Park Chung - hee', 'japanese', 'Yang', 'Yang', 'Saenuri Party', 'North Korea', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'the Education Ministry', 'Pyongyang', 'North ’s', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea ’s', 'Saenuri', 'Yang', 'Kim ’s', 'Koreas', 'south korean', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'Yang', 'Kyohak Publishing Co.', 'PNU', 'Yang', 'Park', 'Park']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43024135  0.13829887

Following the creed enforced by the country’s then-governing political group the National Party, apartheid separated the multiethnic state, communities and families of South Africa, gating white privilege while downgrading black and minority rights. The South African embassy, in collaboration with the Korean Cultural Association, held a film screening event Thursday at the Seoul Museum of History with the movie “Skin,” in an effort to shed light on South Africa’s dark history. “Skin” is a 2008 biographical film based on the true story of Sandra Laing, a South African woman born to white parents, whose race was classified and reclassified by the government as being “black.”The bulk of the plot takes place in the mid-1960s in the thick of a racially charged era, portraying the inner contradictions of segregation on multiple personal levels.  South African Ambassador Nozuko Gloria Bam at a film screening event at the Seoul Museum of History on Thursday. Joel Lee/The Korea HeraldIn an interview with The Korea Herald, South African Ambassador Nozuko Gloria Bam said that since the democratic election of late Nelson Mandela in 1994, South Africa has made “significant progresses” across comprehensive spheres, including legal and political institutions, education, health and housing. “South Africa walked away from the precipice of war and bloodshed to create a democratic state based on a progressive constitution,” she said. “The end of apartheid restored dignity to all South Africans, rolling back the shadow of history and broadening opportunities for all.” The ambassador stressed that despite the advances made in building an inclusive society, healing the wounds of the past and redressing decades-long inequalities remained government imperatives. As one of the most unequal economies in the world, the privileges attached to race, class, space and gender have not been fully reversed, she pointed out. As an example, blacks received inferior education that would ensure inferior positions in society, the ambassador said, as vividly depicted by protagonist Sandra in a segregated white school. From 1960 to 1983, 3.5 million nonwhite South Africans were forcibly removed from homes into segregated neighborhoods, a scene mentioned in the film. Japanese, South Koreans and Taiwanese immigrants, with whom South Africa maintained diplomatic and economic relations, were given an “honorary white” status out of “white,” “black,” “colored” and “Indian” racial classifications, while Chinese descendants of migrant workers from the late 19th century were labeled “colored.”John Redmond, a British freelance journalist and long-time resident of Korea who lived in South Africa in the 1970s, told The Korea Herald of his firsthand experience of apartheid. “It was very horrible and I hated it even as a privileged white guy,” Redmond said. “Many people were opposed to it for sure, including Afrikaners. The rich and powerful whites tended to be more vocal about it, either for or against, as they did not have to fear losing their jobs.” Redmond, who visits Cape Town each year, said that the younger generations born after 1994 had “no concept of apartheid whatsoever,” although the older generations still had “lingering doubts about things.” More tolerance is being seen in sports, music, art and fashion these days, he noted, indicating that black and white athletes perform well together in rugby, cricket and surfing.

(Yonhap)At Hanwha Resorts, a total of 394 people will be briefed on an array of issues including details about the reunions at Mount Geumgangsan, their health care and what they should be cautious about in the communist state.They have been given the opportunity to attend the first round of the reunions, as 96 families in the North, which Pyongyang has selected, have sought to meet them. The first round will continue through Thursday, followed by the second and last round that will end next Monday. During the second round, 255 people from 90 families, which the South’s Red Cross selected through a computer lottery, will meet their relatives in the North.The reunions, which will be the first since February 2014, were arranged after the two Koreas reached a comprehensive agreement on Aug. 25 to ease cross-border tensions, seek regular high-level talks and bolster civil-sector exchanges.On Tuesday, a total of 541 South Koreans including 118 staffers to facilitate the reunions and 29 press people will travel to Mount Geumgangsan. During the three-day program, the participants will meet their relatives six times -- each for two hours. They will meet for two group reunions, a welcome reception, one individual gathering, one joint dinner session and farewell reunions. Seoul authorities have paid much attention to the health care of the participants as there are more old family members -- a reason they increased the number of medical staffers to 18 from 12 in the previous 2014 reunions. Dozens of the participants are in their 90s. Seoul has regarded the issue of the separated families as an urgent humanitarian one, as many family members pass away due to old age each year.It is presumed that more than 60,000 people, including more than 1,000 South Korean nationals living abroad, remain alive. The South Korean side has sought to exchange lists of the surviving members of families with the North, allowing the families to exchange letters and meet through video links, in addition to holding the reunions on a regular basis. But it remains unclear whether the North will agree to Seoul’s proposal, as it could potentially enable the flow of outside information into the highly controlled society and pose a threat to the dictatorial regime, observers said.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","session and farewell reunions seoul ,400 south koreans will gather ,gangwon province on sunday yonhap ,civil sector exchanges on tuesday ,red cross workers check wheelchairs","['South Koreans', 'Sokcho', 'Gangwon Province', 'Red Cross', 'Sokcho', 'Gangwon Province', 'Yonhap)At Hanwha Resorts', 'Pyongyang', 'the South ’s', 'Red Cross', 'Koreas', 'South Koreans', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'south korean', 'Seoul', 'Song Sang - ho']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3253608   0.6211732

There were seven writers but now the government will put in some 30 writers,"" Hwang said during the National Assembly interpellation session. Currently, secondary school history textbooks are published by eight private publishing companies after being approved by an independent textbook review committee of experts.

(Yonhap)Their announcement is on the coattails of professors from Yonsei University saying they would not “be involved in any way concerning the state history textbooks.” Other major universities including Seoul National University are expected to follow suit as hundreds of professors in history-related departments across the country have criticized the ministry’s plans for state textbooks.It is widely seen as backlash to the government and ruling Saenuri Party’s claims that the currently privately published textbooks are written in favor of liberals, and that 90 percent of historians in the country are leftists. Several scholars have raised suspicion that government intervention will result in a textbook that suits the taste of those in power. “State history textbooks will make history education a tool for politics. I don’t think scholars will be able to participate impartially as authors since the reintroduction of state textbooks is very political in nature,” Chung Yong-wook, a professor of contemporary Korean history at SNU, told local media. Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea, however, said the ministry has already contacted and made an agreement with several scholars who will participate as authors. Reports have suggested the scholars are seven educators that had a private meeting with Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn and Vice Education Minister Kim Jae-choon last month, five of whom are conservatives that publicly welcomed the state history textbooks. Kim Jung-bae, the head of the National Institute of Korean History that will be in charge of the history textbooks, said the authors for the state-issued textbooks in the 1970s were more competent than the authors of today.History textbooks of the 1970s, which were published under former President Park Chung-hee ― whose dictatorial rule spanned across the 1960s and 1970s ― were the original subject of controversy, as they had been accused of whitewashing the Park regime. Its description of the May 16 military coup, through which Park rose to power ― a “revolution that aimed to eradicate corruption and save the country from the threat of political confusion and terrorism” ― is one of the most contentious issues.Meanwhile, points accused of being “pro-leftist” by the government are expected to be addressed in authoring the new book. The ministry pointed out that the books’ description saying North Korea distributed land to farmers for free after Korea was liberated from Japan could lead to a positive perception of the country.The ministry also took issue with the use of the term “People’s Army” to refer to the North Korean army, while saying the description that North Korea established a government immediately after the South had conducted a general election could lead to students believing that the governments of the two Koreas are equal. South Korea does not legally recognize the Pyongyang government as a legitimate state.Portions about founding President Syngman Rhee are also expected to be tweaked. One of the textbooks states that Rhee’s passive approach to punishing those who were pro-Japan during Japan’s 1910-1945 colonialism of Korea was one of the reasons people turned against him. The ministry said that it was overly critical of Rhee. Securing a 4.4 billion won ($3.8 million) budget for the textbooks is also one of the looming challenges. Persuading the opposition lawmakers who are actively against the notion to sign off on the budget is expected be tough.The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy has said it will not cooperate in allocating the budget for the textbooks. Progressive education superintendents across the country, meanwhile, have vowed to author an alternative textbook for Korean history to complement what they suspect will be a lopsided history lesson in favor of conservatives. “I plan to create selective subjects such as historical philosophy, history and humanities, while allocating a budget to create separate certified textbooks,” said Jang Hui-guk, the education chief for Gwangju and the leader of education superintendent meetings in Korea.Korean law stipulates that an education chief is entitled to create a supplementary textbook, although it cannot replace the government-approved official textbook. The Education Ministry said it will pursue legal actions if the superintendent-certified textbooks are politically biased.Seoul education chief Cho Hi-yeon, who supervises education for the country’s capital and most populous city, has yet to participate in the “supplementary textbook” movement, although he publicly announced his disapproval of the state history textbooks.An official from the Seoul education office said that the supplementary textbooks are certainly considered an option, but are unlikely to completely replace the state textbooks. “The terminology being used in the media is ‘textbook,’ but it is more like teaching materials that we already use to supplement the classes,” he said.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","reinstate government published history textbooks ,reinstate state authored history textbooks ,history textbooks from private publishers ,state published history textbooks 한국사 ,history textbooks said the authors","['the Education Ministry', 'Kyung Hee University', 'Korea University', 'Seoul', 'Yonsei University', 'Seoul National University', 'Saenuri Party ’s', 'Chung Yong - wook', 'korean', 'SNU', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Kim Jae - choon', 'Kim Jung - bae', 'the National Institute of korean history', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Park', 'Park', 'North Korea', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'People ’s Army', 'north korean', 'North Korea', 'Koreas', 'South Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Syngman Rhee', 'Rhee', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'korean', 'Jang Hui - guk', 'Korea', 'korean', 'the Education Ministry', 'Seoul', 'Cho Hi - yeon', 'Seoul']",12,"[ 1.          2.          3.         ... -0.32147443  0.88765657

But scholars and the opposition lawmakers have pointed out that most of the points used as evidence of “left-leaning bias” are false, heralding further head-butting over the issue.  Members of a conservative civic group protest against NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in (right) and other party members who were holding a rally opposing the government’s revival of state-published history textbooks in Yeouido, Tuesday. (Yonhap)Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea along with National Institute of Korean History chief Kim Jung-bae, who will be overseeing the textbook production process, said Monday the rampant distortion in the textbooks by historians’ own viewpoints has forced the government’s hand in taking over publication rights. Currently South Korea allows eight private publishers to author history textbooks and authorizes them if they are up to standards.The stern warning by the ministry is coupled with an unconfirmed claim by ruling Saenuri Party leader Kim Moo-sung that 90 percent of Korean historians are leftists.One of the points made by Hwang was that some textbooks, including one from local publisher Mirae-N, claims that both Koreas shared responsibility for the 1950-53 Korean War that was sparked by the North’s invasion on June 25, 1950.The textbook describes the situation as the two Koreas being involved in frequent minor skirmishes at the border prior to the war. The description also said that South Korea’s first President Rhee Syng-man insisted on South-led unification and anticommunism while the North looked to communize the peninsula, which proponents of the state textbook took as evidence that privately authored textbooks treated the two Koreas the same and equally responsible for the war.But Rep. Do Jong-hwan of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy claimed the Mirae-N textbook states that North Korea invaded the South, and carries a detailed description of Pyongyang’s battle orders delivered to frontline forces three days before the war. Another point made by Vice Education Minister Kim Jae-Choon was that one of the textbooks used the word “dictatorship” 24 times to describe South Korean politicians while using the word only twice for the North. But Cho Han-kyung, the president of the Association of Korean History Teachers, said the disparity comes from the textbooks dedicating a much larger proportion of the content to South Korean politics than politics of the North. “There has been only one hereditary regime in the North, while Seoul has had several dictatorial administrations,” he said. “The current textbook only describes the history of North Korea in a single subsection.”Another accusation the ministry threw out was that the textbooks were justifying North Korea’s juche (self-reliance) ideology, which is the foundation of state founder Kim Il-sung’s dictatorship. But opponents counter that while both textbooks from Kumsung Publishing and Chunjae Education, which have been accused of teaching the juche idea, explain what it is, they also say that it ultimately led to the personal idolization of Kim Il-sung and him monopolizing power. They say the idea was used as an excuse to control the citizens by executing anyone opposing him. The more pressing matter is that some of the ideas that are expected to be included in the new textbooks can prompt further ideological controversies. NIKH chief Kim said that the descriptions in the textbooks that say “the Korean government was founded in 1948” are wrong, saying it should instead say “Korea was founded in 1948.” He said that the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea established in 1919 was by definition, provisional. Kim’s comments ran counter to Korean constitutional law that the country inherits the tradition of the provisional government. He later backed down and declined to answer exactly when he believed the country was founded.Further confusions loomed large as ministry officials also showed mixed views on details. While Kim said controversial theories and opinions cannot be written in the textbooks, Vice Minister Kim Jae-choon said a dominant theory can be introduced along with minority opinions, hinting at a long, perilous way for the fledgling, reborn state history textbook.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","rally opposing the government revival ,that current textbooks are biased ,conservative civic group protest against ,sung dictatorship but opponents counter ,history teachers said the disparity","['the Education Ministry ’s', 'NPAD', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Yeouido', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'National Institute of Korean History', 'Kim Jung - bae', 'South Korea', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'korean', 'Hwang', 'Mirae - N', 'Koreas', 'Koreas', 'South Korea ’s', 'Rhee Syng', 'Koreas', 'Jong - hwan', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Kim Jae - Choon', 'south korean', 'Cho Han - kyung', 'the Association of korean History Teachers', 'south korean', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'North Korea ’s', 'Kim Il - sung', 'Kumsung Publishing', 'Chunjae Education', 'Kim Il - sing', 'nikh', 'Kim', 'korean', 'Korea', 'the Provisional Government', 'the Republic of Korea', 'Kim', 'korean', 'Kim', 'Kim Jae - choon', 'Yoon Min - sik']",4,"[ 1.          0.          3.         ... -0.35698494  0.75131571

(Claire Lee/The Korea Herald)The two activists were to show up at the audit as witnesses of the Gender Ministry’s recent denial of LGBTI rights, involving the Daejeon Metropolitan City’s newly revised charter of gender equality. In August, the ministry sent the municipal government of Daejeon an official order to delete the charter’s newly introduced articles guaranteeing LGBTI rights, after receiving complaints from gay rights opponents and religious groups. “Every other witness, six of them, who had been previously scheduled to attend the audit ended up attending the audit,” said Na Young, one of the LGBTI activists protesting against the ministry and the committee. Rep. You Seung-hee’s office denied the accusations. “The chairwoman of the committee cannot finalize the list of witnesses by herself,” said Kim In-ah from Rep. Yoo’s office. “It’s untrue that Rep. You denied their entry.”Women and human rights’ activists have been demanding the ministry recognize and validate LGBTI rights as a gender issue, while the ministry has said the rights of sexual minorities are irrelevant to the Gender Equality Act. It instead explained that the issue falls under the Human Rights Commission and the National Human Rights Commission Act.The activists tried to hand deliver a letter to Gender Minister Kim Hee-jung after the audit session. As the minister refused to accept it, Kim’s secretary accepted it instead. The activists said they told the secretary that the particular incident involving the Gender Ministry and the gender equality charter of Daejeon will be addressed at a meeting with U.N. Women’s Policy Director Dr. Purna Sen in New York later this month.

The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles shedding light on refugees in Korea, their hardships, the systematic fallout, the country’s own history and ways to go forward. The following is the second installment. - Ed.


When Yiombi Thona, a former spy agent for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, finally stepped foot on Korean soil in 2002, he did not expect it to take as long as six years to gain refugee status and settle down here.

“When I first applied for asylum in 2002 with the Justice Ministry, officials said that they didn’t have any protection programs for refugees,” said Thona in an interview with The Korea Herald. He had escaped his motherland after being tortured and jailed for being a whistle blower on a dubious deal between the government and the rebel army. 

“I only had a small bag, small money, no house, no job ... literally nothing when I arrived. … But the ministry didn’t care at all and just told me not to work (illegally),” said Thona, who was recognized as a refugee in 2008. He now teaches NGO studies at Gwangju University. 

“But I had to survive. So I worked illegally at factories. Everybody needs to be fed, right?”

Back then, South Korea had no legal measures to protect asylum seekers’ basic rights, which forced them to work illegally for several years until the authorities decided whether their refugee claims were genuine or bogus.

Since then, the situation has improved to some extent, especially after the Refugee Act that came into force in 2013, although chronic problems linger.  
South Korea’s first engagement in the international refugee movement dates back to 1992 when it joined the U.N. Refugee Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. 

Since the country began to accept refugee applications in 1994, some 11,172 people have applied for asylum while only 496 were granted refugee status as of May. Its refugee acceptance rate stands at 4.4 percent, far lower than the U.N. average of 38 percent. 

Amid growing international criticism against the Korean government for its poor treatment of asylum seekers, the country enforced the independent Refugee Act in 2013 to guarantee a minimum level of humanitarian protection for the forcibly displaced. 

The Refugee Act largely notifies benefits for asylum seekers, with the government being obliged to offer them monthly living expenses and government-run housing in the first six months after their application. The applicants are also granted a work permit to get a job after the six-month period while their claims are being processed. 

Another significant accomplishment, experts said, is that asylum seekers are now allowed to apply for refugee status at the port of entry, unlike in the past when those arriving without legitimate visas were immediately deported to their countries of origin. 

The law also stipulates the asylum seekers’ rights to be given fair access to application procedures. They can ask for qualified translators, video recordings of application interviews and necessary procedural information. 

South Korea also participates in the U.N.-led resettlement program, with the government planning to take in 30 refugees from the border town between Thailand and Myanmar this year alone.

The Korean office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees called such improvements a step to become “an advanced country” in hosting refugees. 

“We think highly of the Korean government for enacting the independent refugee protection law despite the relatively low number of asylum seekers,” said Shin Hye-in, a spokesperson for UNHCR. “And the refugee law itself upholds international standards.”

The invocation of the law, coupled with the escalating conflicts in war zones across the world, drove up the number of those seeking asylum in Korea by 84 percent from 1,574 in 2013 to 2,896 in 2014, according to the Ministry of Justice.

The landmark law has potential elements to improve asylum seekers’ lives, but it continues to fail to be properly implemented and extended to those really in need of protection, experts said. 

“Most of the problems fundamentally arise from the lack of budget,” Ryu Eun-ji, a case manager for a refugee rights group NANCEN, told The Korea Herald.

While financial support is provided for the first six months under the Act, only 124 asylum seekers, 8 percent of the total 1,633 in the January-May period, received between 200,000 ($172) and 400,000 won per month, according to the report published by NANCEN.

Some 85 percent of the asylum seekers did not apply for the government subsidies at all because they either were not aware of the benefits or chose to forgo the fund that is lower than the nation’s monthly minimum wage of 1,116,220 won.

To better accommodate the rising number of asylum seekers, the authorities opened refugee aid facilities in February near Incheon International Airport, which scarfed up a major portion of the budget. 

The facilities, ironically, can only house 83 newcomers for up to six months, the report said. 

Ryu also took issue with the Justice Ministry’s “ambiguous” standards in deciding whom it grants a placement in the refugee help center and monthly living expenses. 

The Justice Ministry, for its part, argued that it has internal policies to decide recipients of living expenses and accommodation. 

“We make a decision depending on the applicants’ income, ability to support their family and their type of housing,” the official said, admitting the amount of support might not be satisfactory. “But we have no choice due to the budget shortfall.” 

A low understanding of refugees and asylum seekers in Korean society is another discouraging factor for them to claim their rights.

While the law enables the asylum seekers in legal limbo to work with a permit past the first six months upon application, the regulations do not reflect reality, a Bangladeshi asylum seeker said.

“Unfortunately, employers are not aware of the G-1 visa or what an asylum seeker means,” Nazmul Hossain, who applied for asylum in 2012, told The Korea Herald. “They are also not tolerant enough to let us go to the administrative courts and immigration offices several times a month during the refugee screening process.” 

When asylum seekers don’t speak fluent Korean or English, as in most cases, their request for a work permit is often refused, Hossain said. And the G-1 visa needs to be extended every six months, which further lowers their chance of securing a job. 

“Even I would hate to hire someone like us who needs to take time off work that often,” Hossain said, pointing to the need for grassroots government officials to fully understand the refugee law first.

Such technical problems persist among those who have been granted the refugee status.

“The biggest problem lies in the big gap between the authorities and those enforcing the law at the grassroots levels,” said a 35-year-old Ugandan, who wished to be identified as Daniel. “The law is in place, but officials at local governments have no idea about how to help me.”

“When I go to foreign countries, I cannot travel on a Ugandan passport and I need a travel document, but immigration officers just don’t know what to do during immigration control,” Daniel said.

“The authorities don’t seem to be interested in raising awareness on refugees’ rights or educating government officials,” he added. “Does South Korea’s refugee law only exist to please the international community?”

Despite the government hailing itself as the first Asian country to enact the Refugee Act, pro-refugee lawyers and activists mostly portray it as “incomplete,” calling on the parliament to add clauses and revise unclear ones. 

Kim Jong-chul, a public interest lawyer for Advocates for Public Interest Law, told The Korea Herald that many human rights violations take place when asylum seekers are taken into custody at detention centers to go through the refugee application process. 

With the refugee law enabling asylum applications at the port of entry, those applying for refugee status upon arrival or traveling on forged visas are locked at the airport’s detention center until the government decides whether to process their application. 

“Although many asylum seekers are held at detention rooms for various reasons, there are no legal grounds to limit the length of their stay or protect their rights at the deportation centers,” Kim said, citing detainees who are reportedly living on a chicken burger and Coke for every meal without proper bedding. 

The Justice Ministry is supposed to decide within seven days whether to refer asylum seekers to the legal application process in the country. But some asylum seekers, who are refused from applying, choose to endure the poor treatment hoping for a change in the decision.

“As the detention centers were designed only for short-term detention, asylum seekers there cannot have access to legal counseling or the outside world,” Kim said. “The procedures at the airport or harbors should be more articulate and systematic.” 

Another loophole can be found in the clause stating asylum applicants’ rights to record or videotape their interviews with immigration officers, according to a report published by APIL.

Despite the existence of the law, only 80 out of 1,770 interviews were videotaped last year.

The law stipulates that the interviewer “may not” refuse the request, but the lawyers’ group said recording should be mandatory for asylum seekers who would rather stay silent in fear that their request might upset the interviewers and adversely affect their application. 

“The recording and videotaping, however, are crucial for asylum seekers as they often don’t remember what they said during the interviews due to excessive pressure,” the report said, noting that “the consistency” in applicants’ testimonies is closely linked to their credibility in the refugee screening process.

As of May, a total of 713 Syrians sought asylum here, but only three of them have succeed in securing refugee status. Some 577 of them were allowed to reside and work in Korea on humanitarian grounds, which is valid until the conflicts abate in their country. 

While the statistics may sound promising, experts said that the government’s overuse of humanitarian status is one of the biggest controversies.

“The government is using the humanitarian status visa to dodge the burden to socially and financially support Syrian refugees,” said Lee Il, a human rights lawyer at APIL. “Many of the Syrian asylum seekers actually deserve refugee status, but the government sees all of them as a collective group fleeing the war-torn country.”

If applicants don’t qualify for asylum, but there is a well-founded fear of persecution or real risk of serious harm in their home countries, the Justice Ministry offers them a humanitarian status visa in accordance with the Refugee Act. 

But unlike its name, the visa restricts its holders from meeting their basic human rights, Lee claimed.

While refugee status holders are granted an F-2 visa, which entitles them to social welfare benefits and rights to bring their families and freely travel outside Korea, those allowed into the country on humanitarian grounds obtain a G-1 visa, the same visa granted for asylum seekers. 

“Humanitarian visa holders are locked in Korea like on an island without any rights to bring their family or travel outside Korea,” Lee said.

Lawmakers have proposed eight separate revisions to the refugee law so far.

Rep. Hong Il-pyo of the ruling Saenuri Party suggested in his bill that the recording of interviews be mandatory and translation be offered when necessary. 

The opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy’s Rep. Won Hye-young also put forward a bill clarifying procedures for those seeking asylum at the port of entry and enhancing health benefits for humanitarian status holders. 

But prospects for the passage of the bills remain bleak, with no discussion on any of the revised bills this year as the politicians remain largely distracted with the upcoming general elections next year.

Pro-refugee activists and lawyers The Korea Herald interviewed stressed one thing in unison: the need for raising awareness on refugees in Korean society. 

“There should be a broad consensus in Korean society that refugees are ordinary people like us facing troubled times, so we should protect them,” the lawyer Kim said.

Earlier this month, the party also launched a special committee aimed to improve the current textbooks that they claimed were confusing and self-depreciative about Korean history and politically biased as they were authored by leftist historians.The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, in counteraction, held an emergency meeting and criticized what they said was President Park Geun-hye’s move to whitewash and glorify her late father former President’s Park Chung-hee’s iron-fisted rule in the 1960s and the ’70s.NPAD floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul proposed the Saenuri Party to hold a parliamentary investigation into the current textbooks and the authorization process before pushing ahead with introducing the new system.His proposal was in response to Saenuri Rep. Lee Jung-hyun’s earlier comment that the controversial makeup of current textbooks that brought division and bias requires a national audit. Lee is one of President Park’s closest aides.While the ministry is yet to make an official announcement of its decision -- which is slated to happen early this week -- the ruling camp is said to have prepared for the introduction of the state-authored textbook upon President Park’s orders.In February last year, Park told the Education Ministry to “prepare measures to improve, such as by developing a balanced history textbook based on facts.”Sources have said that the government appears to have decided to have a state-run agency author the textbook under its supervision, noting that reinforcing the authorization process would fall short of serving its purpose as the progressive Korean Teachers and Educational Workers Union would block selection of certain textbooks. The government has claimed that of the eight textbooks currently published by private houses, only one is conservative and the other seven are authored by mostly the same leftist authors.Sunday’s meeting was presided by Saenuri chief policymaker Rep. Kim Jung-hoon, and also attended by chairwoman of the special history textbook committee Rep. Kim Eul-dong. They reportedly shared views that current history education was being manipulated by the leftists’ ideological and political purposes and that normalization of the textbook was necessary for a balanced view on history and integration of the people.They also reportedly discussed ways to promote the move to the general public, such as by distributing casebooks to parents and students with a list of distorted and erroneous historical events and interpretations written in the current textbooks. The special committee is also set to produce various programs tailored for social networking platforms as well as arranging public hearings and seminars.“Some from the opposition are suggesting that the history textbook issue is relevant to the incumbent government’s ideological propensity, but that is absurd,” said Rep. Kang Eun-hee, a member of the special committee.The opposition, meanwhile, has been taking issue with what they said was President Park’s long-held goal of “setting straight” the accomplishments of her father ever since he was assassinated by his intelligence chief in 1979.They are said to be contemplating holding rallies and moving to link the government’s move with other key issues that they hold sway to, such as the approval of major economic or budget bills. They are also reportedly considering pushing for the resignation of the education minister.“It took years of democratic movements to change the state-authored textbook, the remnant of Yushin, to state authorization. No conspiracy that attempts to turn back time of the Republic of Korea will succeed,” said NPAD spokesman Kim Sung-soo. Yushin refers to the constitutional amendment by the Park Chung-hee administration that allowed him to stay in power.The minor Justice Party also vowed to fight alongside NPAD against the government’s move.“The Education Ministry and the ruling party claim that the authors of the textbook are leaning to the left. But such an argument is based on data compiled by ultrarightist groups,” said Justice Party floor leader Rep.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility but Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said there were “strong signs” that the two explosions _ which struck 50 meters (yards) apart just after 10 a.m. _ were suicide bombings. He suggested that Kurdish rebels or Islamic State group militants were to blame.The two explosions occurred seconds apart outside the capital’s main train station as hundreds of opposition supporters and Kurdish activists gathered for the peace rally organized by Turkey’s public workers’ union and other groups. The protesters planned to call for increased democracy in Turkey and an end to the renewed violence between Kurdish rebels and Turkish security forces. The attacks Saturday came at a tense time for Turkey, a NATO member that borders war-torn Syria, hosts more refugees than any other nation in the world and has seen renewed fighting with Kurdish rebels that has left hundreds dead in the last few months. Many people at the rally had been anticipating that the rebels of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, would declare a temporary cease-fire _ which it did hours after the bombing _ to ensure that Turkey’s Nov. 1 election would be held in a safe environment.Television footage from Turkey’s Dogan news agency showed a line of protesters Saturday near Ankara’s train station, chanting and performing a traditional dance with their hands locked when a large explosion went off behind them. An Associated Press photographer saw several bodies covered with bloodied flags and banners that demonstrators had brought for the rally. “There was a massacre in the middle of Ankara,” said Lami Ozgen, head of the Confederation of Public Sector Trade Unions, or KESK.  The state-run Anadolu Agency said the attacks were carried out with TNT explosives fortified with metal ball-bearings.Turkey’s government late Saturday raised the death toll in the twin bomb blasts to 95 people killed, 248 wounded. It said 48 of the wounded were in serious condition.Selcuk Atalay of the Turkish Medical Association’s Ankara branch put the death toll at at least 97 and feared the toll could rise even higher, since several of the wounded were in serious condition with burns. (Yonhap)“This massacre targeting a pro-Kurdish but mostly Turkish crowd could flame ethnic tensions in Turkey,” said Soner Cagaptay, an analyst at the Washington Institute.Cagaptay said the attack could be the work of groups “hoping to induce the PKK, or its more radical youth elements, to continue fighting Turkey,” adding that the Islamic State group would benefit most from the full-blown Turkey-PKK conflict.“(That) development could make ISIS a secondary concern in the eyes of many Turks to the PKK,” Cagaptay said in emailed comments, using another acronym for IS militants.Small anti-government protests broke out at the scene of the explosions and outside Ankara hospitals as Interior Minister Selami Altinok visited the wounded. Some demonstrators chanted “Murderer Erdogan!” _ referring to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whom many accuse of increasing tensions with Kurds to profit at the ballot box in November. Erdogan denies the accusations.Later Saturday, thousands gathered near Istanbul’s main square denouncing the attacks and also holding the government responsible.The Turkish government imposed a temporary news blackout covering images that showed the moment of the blasts, gruesome or bloody pictures or “images that create a feeling of panic.” A spokesman warned media organizations they could face a “full blackout” if they did not comply.Many people reported being unable to access Twitter and other social media websites for several hours after the blasts. It was not clear if authorities had blocked access to the websites, but Turkey often does impose blackouts following attacks.At a news conference, Davutoglu declared a three-day official mourning period for the blast victims and said Turkey had been warned about groups aiming to destabilize the country. “For some time, we have been receiving intelligence information based from some (Kurdish rebel) and Daesh statements that certain suicide attackers would be sent to Turkey... and that through these attackers chaos would be created in Turkey,” Davutoglu told reporters, using the IS group’s Arabic acronym.“The (Kurdish rebels) or Daesh could emerge (as culprits) of today’s terror event,” Davutoglu said, promising that those behind the attacks would be caught and punished.Davutoglu said authorities had detained at least two suspected would-be suicide bombers in the past three days in Ankara and Istanbul. Authorities had been on alert after Turkey agreed to take a more active role in the U.S.-led battle against the Islamic State group. Turkey opened up its bases to U.S. aircraft to launch air raids on the extremist group in Syria and carried out a limited number of strikes on the group itself. Russia has also entered the fray on behalf of the Syrian government recently, bombing sites in Syria and reportedly violating Turkish airspace a few times in the past week.On a separate front, the fighting between Turkish forces and Kurdish rebels flared anew in July, killing at least 150 police and soldiers and hundreds of PKK rebels since then. Turkish jets have also carried out numerous deadly airstrikes on Kurdish rebel targets in northern Iraq.  Erdogan condemned Saturday’s attacks, which he said targeted the country’s unity, called for solidarity and canceled a planned visit Monday to Turkmenistan.“The greatest and most meaningful response to this attack is the solidarity and determination we will show against it,” Erdogan said.President Barack Obama offered condolences to Erdogan in a phone call Saturday. The White House said in a statement that Obama affirmed that the U.S. will stand with Turkey in the fight against terrorism. Critics have accused Erdogan of re-igniting the fighting with the Kurds to seek electoral gains _ hoping that the turmoil would rally voters back to the ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP.  Electoral gains by the country’s pro-Kurdish party caused the AKP, founded by Erdogan, to lose its parliamentary majority in a June election after a decade of single-party rule. The attacks Saturday, which even surpassed twin al-Qaida-linked attacks in Istanbul in 2003 that killed some 60 people, also drew widespread condemnation from Turkey’s allies.Turkey’s state-run news agency said President Barack Obama called Erdogan to extend his condolences. The Anadolu Agency, citing unnamed officials, said Obama told Erdogan the United States would continue to side with Turkey in the fight against terrorism. It quoted Obama as saying the U.S. “shared Turkey’s grief.”Erdogan earlier said the twin bombings aimed to destroy Turkey’s “peace and stability.” Anadolu said the two leaders agreed to talk more in the coming days.German Chancellor Angela Merkel sent her condolences, calling the attacks “particularly cowardly acts that were aimed directly at civil rights, democracy and peace.” “It is an attempt at intimidation and an attempt to spread fear,” she said. “I am convinced that the Turkish government and all of Turkish society stands together at this time with a response of unity and democracy.”NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said “there can be no justification for such a horrendous attack on people marching for peace... All NATO allies stand united in the fight against the scourge of terrorism.”Saturday was the third attack against meetings of Kurdish activists. In July, a suicide bombing blamed on the Islamic State group killed 33 peace activists, including many Kurds, in the town of Suruc near Turkey’s border with Syria. Two people were killed in June in a bomb attack at the pro-Kurdish party’s election rally.“This attack (Saturday) resembles and is a continuation of the Diyarbakir and Suruc (attacks),” said Selahattin Demirtas, leader of the Turkey’s pro-Kurdish party.  He held Erdogan and Davutoglu’s government responsible for the latest attack, saying it was “carried out by the state against the people.”In the aftermath of the Ankara attack, the PKK declared a temporary cease-fire. A rebel statement said Saturday the group is halting hostilities to allow the Nov. 1 election to proceed safely. It said it would not launch attacks but would defend itself.The government has said there would be no letup in its fight against the Kurdish rebels.“Our operations (against the PKK) will continue until they lay down arms,” Davutoglu said late Friday.

122,122,Suspect denies charge in Itaewon murder trial,"The key suspect in a reopened murder case denied his charges of stabbing a South Korean college student to death in Itaewon, Seoul, nearly two decades ago at the first court hearing on Thursday. Arthur John Patterson, a 35-year-old U.S. citizen, was extradited to Korea late last month to face a new trial on charges of murdering Cho Joong-pil, 22, in 1997 at a Burger King restaurant in Itaewon, a multicultural distri...","The key suspect in a reopened murder case denied his charges of stabbing a South Korean college student to death in Itaewon, Seoul, nearly two decades ago at the first court hearing on Thursday. Arthur John Patterson, a 35-year-old U.S. citizen, was extradited to Korea late last month to face a new trial on charges of murdering Cho Joong-pil, 22, in 1997 at a Burger King restaurant in Itaewon, a multicultural district frequented by expats residing in Seoul. Arthur Patterson (Yonhap)At the hearing, Patterson accused Korean-American Edward Lee of killing Cho, who was found on the restroom floor with several wounds to his neck. Cho died in transit to a hospital. On Thursday morning, Patterson looked pale and nervous in the green prison uniform as he walked into the court room with more than 100 in attendance.“Patterson said he could not admit to the charge as Edward Lee stabbed the victim,” Oh Byung-joo, Patterson’s lawyer, said on his behalf in the courtroom. “The crime was committed without a motive or purpose, which could only have been done by a person who was either crazy or under the influence of drugs,” Oh said, citing Lee’s record of drug abuse and dealing. Lee, now 36, was also at the crime scene and sentenced to 20-year jail term in an appeals court for murdering Cho. But Lee was later cleared of the murder for lack of evidence in the retrial ordered by the highest court. In what many see as botched investigation, Patterson was indicted on lesser charges including destruction of evidence and possession of an illegal weapon at the time. A year later, prosecutors launched a new probe into the murder case, viewing Patterson as the prime suspect. But Patterson fled to the U.S. after the government failed to renew his travel ban. This time, the prosecution vowed to revisit evidence and collect more testimonies to prove Patterson’s guilt in the fresh trial. Given the location of the stabbing, the prosecution initially ruled out the possibility that Patterson, who is shorter than the victim, stabbed Cho. But newfound evidence, the victim’s backpack, allegedly indicated otherwise. The prosecution also said it had already secured testimonies from Patterson and Lee’s friends who witnessed them leaving the crime scene. But Patterson’s lawyer questioned the credibility of the evidence provided by the prosecution, including the backpack and Patterson’s bloodstained T-shirt, asking the judges to closely look into them. Patterson’s lawyer also took issue with Korea’s double jeopardy rule banning a defendant to stand trial over the same charge for a second time, even if new evidence comes to light. Patterson was already convicted of destroying evidence and carrying a weapon and served his jail term until he was freed in special amnesty in 1999.But the prosecution refuted his claims, saying that Patterson was indicted on a murder charge this time. Another sticking point is whether the statute of limitations on murder could apply to Patterson. If Patterson were found to have intentionally fled to the U.S. in 1999 to avoid being punished here, his statute of limitations could be extended, making it possible for the prosecution to further investigate the case. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","stabbing south korean college student ,korean college student to death ,suspect in reopened murder case ,of stabbing south korean college ,stabbing south korean college","['south korean', 'Itaewon', 'Seoul', 'Arthur John Patterson', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'Cho Joong - pil', 'Burger King', 'Itaewon', 'Seoul', 'Arthur Patterson', 'Patterson', 'korean - American', 'Edward Lee', 'Cho', 'Cho', 'Patterson', 'Edward Lee', 'Patterson', 'Cho', 'Lee', 'Patterson', 'Patterson', 'Patterson', 'U.S.', 'Patterson ’s', 'Patterson', 'Cho', 'Patterson', 'Patterson', 'Patterson ’s', 'Korea ’s', 'Patterson', 'Patterson', 'Patterson', 'U.S.']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.02397178  0.12476639

The last family reunions were held in February last year.Last month, the two Koreas agreed to hold a new round of reunions in late October. But its prospects were thrown into doubt after Pyongyang later threatened to scrap the agreement citing Seoul's criticism of the North.""As of May 2015, of the 129,668 applicants for the reunions arranged by the Red Cross societies of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea since 2000, only 1,956 had benefited from face-to-face meetings and 279 from video reunions,"" Darusman said in the report.""Most strikingly, nearly half of the applicants (62,028) have passed away during the past 15 years owing to their advanced age.The special rapporteur finds the situation very disconcerting and sincerely hopes that regular family reunions will resume without delay,"" he said.Darusman urged the North to allow separated families to reunite without delay and use unmonitored communication facilities, such as telephone, mail and e-mail.In the Sept. 8-dated report, which was posted on the U.N. website this weekend, the special rapporteur also renewed his calls for the U.N. Security Council to refer the communist nation to the International Criminal Court for human rights abuses.""Efforts must be undertaken to ensure the accountability of those responsible for human rights violations, including through referral by the Security Council of the situation in the country to the International Criminal Court, while continuously seeking engagement with the authorities to bring relief to the people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,"" he said in the report.The report included the latest developments in the North's human rights abuses, such as summary executions, abductions, arbitrary detention and exploitation of its people working overseas. ""More than ever, the international community should stay the course in its efforts to address the human rights situation in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea profoundly and meaningfully,"" the special rapporteur said.""Victims and their relatives, both inside and outside the country, have suffered for far too long, and their demands for justice and accountability cannot go unheeded,"" he said.Darusman said the General Assembly should reiterate its condemnation of the ""long-standing and ongoing systematic, widespread and gross violations of human rights"" in the North and reaffirm the international community's responsibility to protect North Korean people from crimes against humanity.He also urged Pyongyang to immediately halt all human rights violations, dismantle all political prison camps, allow all abductees to return to their countries and engage genuinely in bilateral talks with South Korea on issues of mutual interest.

The report, “Teachers in Asia Pacific: Status and Rights,” analyzed: entry requirements; preservice training; recruitment and deployment; workload; professional development; salaries; retirement; assessment; unions; and school leadership.The study found a mismatch between the supply and demand of teachers in almost all of the countries while showing higher attrition rates in Samoa. Some countries showed overrepresentation of males in senior leadership roles, raising concern that the shortage of females in leadership position may lead to a lack of role models for girls. In South Korea, the percentage of female teachers has consistently been on the rise but the majority of leadership positions are still occupied by men. According to Statistics Korea, women accounted for 76.7 percent, 67.9 percent and 48.9 percent of teachers in elementary, middle and high schools in 2014. But female principals for respective education institutes were only 22 percent, 21.3 percent and 8.9 percent.Working hours and opportunities for professional development was another issue that stood out. Mongolian teachers for example, are expected to work outside the office to fulfill their responsibilities.In case of Korean teachers, they are required to spend far more time on administrative work than average teachers in members of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. OECD’s Teaching and Learning International Survey found that 80 percent of Korean teachers believe that their long working hours are what hinder them from participating in professional development activities.The shortfall in teachers’ development was not derived from lack of trying, the report indicated. “Nevertheless, in many countries the government commitment to professional development is evident, as demonstrated in Uzbekistan and Korea by the recent increases in the budget allocations for it,” the report said. Korea’s Education Ministry mandates an annual 60 hours of job training for teachers.But the work overload for teachers is making it difficult for educators to train themselves, Korean teachers say.Another issue is that teachers in many Asian countries have trouble publicizing their opinions, such as by joining unions. In Cambodia, teachers are considered civil servants and are banned from joining a union, although they can join teachers’ associations. While there is no such taboo in Korea, teachers ― also considered civil servants ― are banned from taking actions that are deemed politically motivated.The study pointed out that factors such as participatory decision making, shared leadership, freedom and independence in the classroom, professional development opportunities, self-efficacy and incentives are all contributory factors to teachers’ performance. It suggested that authorities should recognize teachers’ contributions and insights to enhance their status and increase their morale, while providing them a channel to raise educational concerns and contribute to the policy-making process.“We have entrusted teachers with the critical task of molding the minds of future generations. They need, and deserve, our support to carry out their work,” said UNESCO Bangkok director Kim Gwang-jo. “(The study) is an initial step toward better understanding how teachers are regarded and supported in this region.”By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","problems including overtime work gender ,overtime work gender discrimination against ,teachers in many asian countries ,including overtime work gender discrimination ,overtime work gender discrimination","['UNESCO', 'South Korea', 'Uzbekistan', 'Mongolia', 'Samoa', 'Pakistan', 'Sri Lanka', 'Cambodia', 'Indonesia', 'Samoa', 'South Korea', 'Statistics Korea', 'mongolian', 'korean', 'Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'OECD ’s teaching and Learning International Survey', 'korean', 'Uzbekistan', 'Korea', 'Korea ’s Education Ministry', 'korean', 'asian', 'Cambodia', 'Korea', 'UNESCO', 'Bangkok', 'Kim Gwang - jo']",1,"[ 2.          0.          3.         ... -0.29220197 -0.07394367

(Air Force)They range from sign language translators who act as the gateway to the outside world for the deaf, to soldiers missioned with a crucial role to deliver military information in the world’s last-remaining divided country.In Korea, there are about 1,200 sign language translators. Their job goes beyond translating words into signs to also providing necessary administrative information and help outdoor activities for the deaf whose population here has reached 270,000 last year.Of them, around 500 interpreters hold expertise in translating the gestures of the deaf into proper sign language for those who could not learn the cheirology at an early age.Once certified as sign language translators, they are dispatched to various workplaces ranging from hospitals, courts and broadcasting stations to banks. In the case of courts, the interpreters are assigned per case instead of an individual involved in a lawsuit for privacy reasons. The job of a sign language interpreter requires state-authorized certificates which takes about three to four years to achieve on average.The most important factor of sign language interpretation is not the hands but the facial expression. “The sign language cannot be delivered without facial expression. In vocal languages, people without hearing problems can express the degree of pain or different nuances with the tone of voice. That is what the facial expression does in sign language,” said sign language translator Kwon Na-yeon at Seoul Korean Sign Language Professional Institute. She added that the different grammar order of Korean vocal language and the sign language remains a challenge despite her seven years of experience that calls for continuous training.Woo Jee-hee, 36, who works at a public sign language interpretation center in Seoul, said sign language translation inevitably takes more time.“This is about visualizing the vocal language. It takes usually 1.2 times longer to interpret simultaneously.”Meanwhile, interpretation in the military is also one of the rare fields that requires specialized skills with their work dealing with some of the most security-sensitive and confidential information.On the divided peninsula, military cooperation with the U.S. and other countries remains crucial, and interpreter officers are dispatched to joint military drills and high-level talks. Interpreter officers are picked through a set of exams that include written and verbal tests. Once enrolled, they go through military training and translation education before being designated to posts. There are those assigned to the fields of combined operations with the U.S. troops such as the Combined Forces Command, to those dispatched to the Defense Ministry, Joint Chiefs of Staff and other affiliated organizations that also deal with military cooperation with other countries.The unusual position entails professional terms and concepts that require quick learning and nonstop research. For smooth and accurate interpretation, interpreter officers stress that a strong mentality is essential.“I think the most important traits are mental agility and guts. It’s a highly technical job for which there are little to no scripted events. You need to be able to learn quickly and control yourself not to get intimidated or frozen, even when you’re interpreting matters of great sensitivity with some of the most important decision makers in the world,” said ex-Air Force interpreter officer Cho Koon-ho. He was once in charge of interpreting the live news conference over the probe result of the torpedo attack on the corvette Cheonan in March 2010.

Their job goes beyond translating words into signs to also providing necessary administrative information and help outdoor activities of the deaf whose population here has reached 270,000 last year. Air Force interpreter officers salute at a ceremony in March at the Air Force’s Operations Command in Osan Air Base, Gyeonggi Province, marking their completion of training. (Air Force)Of them, around 500 interpreters hold expertise in translating the gestures of the deaf into proper sign language for those who could not learn the cheirology at an early age.Once certified as sign language translators, they are dispatched to various workplaces ranging from hospitals, courts and broadcasting stations to banks. In the case of courts, the interpreters are assigned per case instead of an individual involved in a lawsuit for privacy reasons. The job of a sign language interpreter requires state-authorized certificates which takes about three to four years to achieve on average.The most important factor of sign language interpretation is not the hands but the facial expression. “The sign language cannot be delivered without facial expression. In vocal languages, people without hearing problems can express the degree of pain or different nuances with the tone of voice. That is what the facial expression does in sign language,” said sign language translator Kwon Na-yeon at Seoul Korean Sign Language Professional Institute. She added that the different grammar order of Korean vocal language and the sign language remains a challenge despite her seven years of experience that calls for continuous training.Woo Jee-hee, 36, who works at a public sign language interpretation center in Seoul, said sign language translation inevitably takes more time.“This is about visualizing the vocal language. It takes usually 1.2 times longer to interpret simultaneously.”Meanwhile, interpretation in the military is also one of the rare fields that requires specialized skills with their work dealing with some of the most security-sensitive and confidential information.In the divided peninsula still technically at war, military cooperation with the U.S. and other countries remains crucial, and interpreter officers are dispatched to joint military drills and high-level talks. Interpreter officers are picked through a set of exams that include written and verbal tests. Once enrolled, they go through military training and translation education before being designated to posts. There are those assigned to the fields of combined operations with the U.S. troops such as the Combined Forces Command, to those dispatched to the Defense Ministry, Joint Chiefs of Staff and other affiliated organizations that also deal with military cooperation with other countries.The unusual position entails professional terms and concepts that require quick learning and nonstop research. For smooth and accurate interpretation, interpreter officers stress that strong mentality is essential.“I think the most important traits are mental agility and guts. It’s a highly technical job for which there are little to no scripted events. You need to be able to learn quickly and control yourself not to get intimidated or frozen, even when you’re interpreting matters of great sensitivity with some of the most important decision makers in the world,” said ex-Air Force interpreter officer Cho Koon-ho. He was once in charge of interpreting the live news conference over the probe result of the torpedo attack on the corvette Cheonan in March 2010. He was directed to interpret the conference just hours before the event, and with little familiarity of the naval and nautical jargons, he crammed the hefty amount of professional information.“The good thing about this job is that you are able to deploy a valued skill-set that makes a meaningful, visible positive impact.

Last month, a 61-year-old South Korean national was shot to death in the city of Angeles.  Last month, the Foreign Ministry requested that the foreign ministry and the state policy agency in the Philippines raise their guard in a bid to ensure the safety of South Koreans living there and Korean travelers.

Lee has been investigated for allegedly embezzling some 14.6 billion won in school funds, some of which is suspected to have been used for bribes to high-ranking government officials. Investigators raided Kim’s office last week and summoned him several times for questioning recently. Prosecutors reportedly have also procured evidence that Lee had been conducting illegal lobbying with politicians as well. Kim, who was unavailable for comment, was transferred to state-run Korea National University of Education on Wednesday, the day prosecutors requested a warrant for him. The ministry claimed it had no specific knowledge of the investigation and that Kim had requested work at a university due to “health related reasons.”According to the KNUE, Kim on Wednesday asked for paid leave for the remainder of the week. The university said they were unaware of the investigation and were “baffled” at the scandal.Kim has held several posts at the ministry for over two decades and headed the office of planning and coordination at Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education before returning to the ministry last December as its spokesman.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","ranking government officials investigators raided ,kickbacks from local college officials ,allegedly embezzling some 14 billion ,conducting illegal lobbying with politicians ,raided kim office last week","['south korean', 'the Education Ministry', 'Kim', 'Lee Jung - hak', 'Sohae College', 'Gusan', 'North Jeolla Province', 'the Jeonju District Prosecutor ’s Office', 'Lee', 'Kim ’s', 'Lee', 'Kim', 'Korea National University of Education', 'Kim', 'KNUE', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.15020485  0.45174211

This rule, however, does not apply to people with work visas, those entering the country to study, and those married to a South Korean citizen. (123rf)In addition, the government even gives 30-50 percent discounts to foreign nationals depending on what kind of visas they hold. A person holding a D-2 study visa can get 50 percent off in terms of the insurance payments they have to make.From 2012 through 2014, this preferential health insurance payment arrangement equaled 4 billion won ($3.3 million) in savings for foreigners, with some 101,162 people and households paying less, it said.""Under the changes, people with work visas will be excluded from the early preferential benefit scheme, and will have to wait like the others,"" the ministry said.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon have expressed hope that North Korea does not go ahead with a long-range rocket launch.The two also shared the view that the isolated country should come forward for dialogue with the international community, Ju Chul-ki, senior presidential secretary for foreign affairs, told reporters after their meeting at Ban's official residence on Friday evening.Park arrived in New York hours earlier for the U.N. General Assembly.Park and Ban, a former South Korean foreign minister, did not hold specific consultations on sanctions the U.N. could impose on North Korea in case Pyongyang launches a long-range rocket, Ju said.North Korea has long been under an array of U.S. and international sanctions for its nuclear and missile programs. A new rocket launch, if carried out, is likely to prompt the U.N. to further tighten sanctions on North Korea.There is speculation that North Korea may launch a long-range rocket in October to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Workers' Party.Seoul and Washington view a satellite launch as a cover for testing the North's ballistic missile technology, which is banned under U.N. resolutions.The North has also suggested that it may conduct a nuclear test in response to what it claims is the hostile policy of the United States and other hostile forces.Park told Ban that North Korea should end its obsession with its nuclear weapons program and have dialogue with South Korea and work toward a peaceful unification.Ban vowed to assist in efforts to promote peace and the development of inter-Korean relations.Last month, South and North Korea produced a breakthrough deal that defused tensions on the Korean Peninsula and set the stage for temporary reunions for families separated since the 1950-53 Korean War.Also Friday, U.S. President Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, held summit talks and reaffirmed their commitment to a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.Xi also said he opposes any action that violates U.N. Security Council resolutions, in an apparent warning against North Korea over its possible rocket launch.Park also unveiled her commitment to contribute to the development of underdeveloped countries, citing Seoul's ""Saemaeul Movement,"" or new community movement.The initiative -- launched by Park's father, then-President Park Chung-hee in the 1970s -- is credited with helping modernize the then-rural South Korean economy.Park made the comment early Friday as she congratulated Ban on the adoption of a new U.N. global agenda at the start of a three-day summit on sustainable development.The new agenda commits every country to taking an array of actions that not only address the root causes of poverty but also increase economic growth and prosperity, and meet people's health, education and social needs, while protecting the environment, according to the U.N.

The Korea Herald will publish a series of articles shedding light on refugees in Korea, their hardships, the systematic fallout, the country’s own history and ways to go forward. The following is the first installment. – Ed.The afternoon was sunny and peaceful, as the crisp wind signaled the coming autumn in South Korea. But the story told by CH Govera, a 30-something man from Ethiopia, in an interview with The Korea Herald at a cafe in Seoul, was worlds away from the tranquility of the day.“I could have been stopped at the airport if it wasn’t so early at 5 a.m. in the morning,” said Govera, choking up with emotion. “I managed to sneak out of the country and I burst into tears when I boarded the plane.”Govera, who was granted refugee status last month after several attempts over the past seven years, had taken a lead in establishing the opposition Coalition for Unity and Democracy back home, also known as Kinijit, ahead of the 2005 election to stand up to the government that had ruled his country for 25 years.“The opposition bloc saw the biggest-ever gains, but the government wouldn’t leave,” Govera said of the election, which triggered chaos that killed nearly 200 people in the postelection violence.“I was soon arrested, jailed and tortured until officials from Red Cross and the United Nations made a visit to my prison,” he said. While living in fear that he might be persecuted, Govera grabbed a rare chance to come to Korea for missionary training in 2008. “I didn’t want to leave as I was only demanding my political rights. But I had to get out of my country to survive,” he said. “I had no luggage, I didn’t tell anyone that I was leaving.”Like many other asylum seekers in Korea, his first choice of destination was not Korea. “My first choice was England or Germany, but I just had to seize any chance to leave the country.” Govera explained that Ethiopians would have to pay brokers a commission fee of $2,000 to $4,000 to secure a legitimate visa to enter Korea. The costs depend on the popularity of the destination, with the visa for the U.S. hovering around $200,000.After twists and turns, Govera was able to apply for asylum, but it took seven grueling years to finally be granted refugee status. “Now, I feel like I am born again.”Syrian refugees participate in a rally calling for the Korean government’s help in front of the National Human Rights Commission in downtown Seoul on Sept. 13. (Yonhap)Govera is one of the 522 refugees as of July who have earned the status in Korea since the country began to accept refugees in 1994.  Korea joined the U.N. Refugee Convention in 1992 and became the first Asian country to enforce the Refugee Act in 2013 to provide international refugees with social protection and residence.The number of those seeking asylum in Korea has surged since the law took effect, with the figure jumping from 423 in 2010 to 2,896 in 2014, according to the Ministry of Justice. But the government has granted refugee status to only a small portion of applicants, with 331 out of 9,155 asylum seekers having won legal status for resettlement during the five-year period.Korea’s refugee acceptance rate stands at 3.6 percent, much lower than the average rate for U.N. member countries, which sits at 38 percent.According to the data, the largest numbers of migrants recognized as refugees were from Myanmar followed by Ethiopia, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Iran, while the biggest portion of refugee applicants were Pakistanis and Egyptians.Nearly half of the asylum seekers applied for refugee status for political or religious reasons. Amid the escalating conflicts within Syria, Korea saw a soaring number of Syrian asylum seekers here, but only three of the 740 applicants have succeeded in securing refugee status so far. Most of the Syrian applicants were granted humanitarian status instead of refugee status, which allows them to work and reside here until the war abates in their country. But those on humanitarian status are guaranteed a lower level of social protection than of refugees.Govera knew he would have to escape from the country to survive, but many others have arrived in Korea for other purposes without knowing they would end up applying for refugee status here.A 23-year-old Ethiopian, who only wanted to be identified by her nickname Mimi, told The Korea Herald that she had never considered herself an asylum seeker. “I meant to go back to Ethiopia to continue my career and activities back home, as there is still so much to be done,” said Mimi, who has been heavily involved in human rights activities and worked for the Ethiopian office of the World Bank for rural development projects before coming to Korea. “While I was in Korea for a two-week human rights training course at a university in Seoul, I found out that the government arrested my father, brother and fellow activists to hunt me down,” said Mimi. “As the government sees me as ‘terrorist,’ my return could put not only myself, but also my family in jeopardy.”Mimi received much-needed help from Refuge pNan, a Seoul-based human rights organization, to process her application for refugee status in January. She is waiting to be interviewed by immigration officers. Mimi herself admitted she was one of the extremely “lucky” cases discovered and helped by human rights activists. Otherwise, she would not have known what steps to take next. Many of the asylum seekers, however, don’t even know whether they are entitled to refugee status, said Kim Jong-chul, a lawyer for Advocates for Public Interest Law. Asylum seekers, thus, are poorly prepared for the application process involving document screening and interviews, which lowers the possibility for them to earn the status.“Once the refugee application is rejected, it seems difficult to reverse the decision in the following stages,” Kim said. Even if migrants know they are in a situation where they can seek asylum, they face difficulties in proceeding with the application due to language barriers, lack of information and financial problems.“When I first arrived in Korea, I didn’t know what to do. I spoke no Korean. Everybody in the immigration office seemed unkind, even angry, and didn’t explain the situation to me,” said a 32-year-old Bangladeshi man, who only wanted to be identified by Amin. Amin fled Bangladesh in 2009 after leading student activists against the government. He entered Korea on a tourist visa with the help of his uncle married to a Korean woman here.“I financially relied on my uncle at first, but I had to leave his house after I saw him and his wife arguing about me,” said Amin, who even spent some time in the streets, homeless. The language barrier hindered him from acquiring information about the application process here, which left him with no option but to stay and work here illegally part-time until someone came to rescue him.  “I didn’t know what to do, but I still had to survive. I knew I wasn’t allowed to work without a work permit, but what options do I have? I cannot go back to my country. I will get killed there,” Amin said.  The Refuge Act stipulates that those who have applied for refugee status are entitled to find employment with a work permit issued by the government six months after the process begins. But the work permit is difficult to get, Amin said.  “I cannot afford to take time off work to apply for a permit and go back to check whether I got it and explain all the process to my boss,” Amin said. Lawyer Kim also pointed out that asylum seekers are on a G-1 visa, which technically doesn’t allow them to work. Despite the enforcement of the Refuge Act, many employers remain unaware that they could hire asylum seekers without any legal problems. “If the work permit is complicated to get, the government should provide asylum seekers with greater social protection,” Kim said. “Without such a measure, it is an irony that the government only tries to track down those forced to illegally work here and deport them.”Just a few days after Amin had the interview with The Korea Herald, he was caught by immigration officers and detained at a foreigner protection center in Hwaseong, where those ordered to leave Korea spend their final days before being sent back to their home countries.“What will happen to me next? I am so scared ...” Amin’s last text message read.Nazmul Hossain, who founded the Refugee Community to help asylum seekers pursue their rights, said that the Refugee Act hasn’t changed the “miserable lives” of asylum seekers here. “I had to go back to the immigration office almost five times to finally get the work permit,” he said in fluent Korean. “Wouldn’t it be more difficult for those who cannot speak Korean and don’t understand the law to practice their rights?”“The slow legal process prompts many of the asylum seekers to give up on asking for a work permit and just get a part-time job illegally, trapping them into a vicious cycle,” he said.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","light on refugees in korea ,asylum in korea has surged ,refugees in korea their hardships ,other asylum seekers in korea ,escalating conflicts within syria korea","['South Korea', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea', 'Ed', 'South Korea', 'CH Govera', 'Ethiopia', 'the Korea Herald', 'Seoul', 'Govera', 'Kinijit', 'Govera', 'Red Cross', 'the United Nations', 'Govera', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'England', 'Germany', 'Govera', 'Ethiopians', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'Govera', 'korean', 'the National Human Rights Commission', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'the U.N.

(Yonhap)Amid the growing angst over Japan loosening its postwar stricture on the use of force, the issue of whether the country is really a potential security threat to Korea, as it was in the early 20th century, has been the subject of public debate.Some experts say that with the export-driven economy sticking to international norms and rules, it can hardly become a security threat, and that Japan expanding its role in support of the U.S. military would be helpful to cope with contingencies on the peninsula.Others, however, talk of the possibility that Japan could revert to the militarism of its past, particularly when nationalist policymakers are leading state affairs, and refuse to fully atone for their country’s wartime misdeeds.With the divergent views, observers say Japan’s pursuit of what it calls a “normal” state with a full-fledged military, which goes beyond the hitherto exclusively defensive security role, will be a double-edged sword.“Japan’s security policy is obviously a double-edged sword for South Korea as it would be helpful in handling North Korea-related security contingencies, and it would also fan public fears about potential security challenges,” said Park Hwee-rhak, political science professor at Kookmin University.“What is important for now is that instead of continuing to talk about the double-edged sword, Korea should think more deeply about how it can actually use the sword for its own benefit.”Public worries over Japan’s new security legislation have reaffirmed that many Koreans still perceive Japan as a possible security threat, a reason why Seoul officials have repeatedly called on Tokyo to carry out its defense policy in a “transparent” manner that promotes regional peace.Seoul’s Defense Minister Han Min-koo reiterated Monday that without Seoul’s request or consent, Tokyo cannot send its forces to the peninsula, even if the U.S. requests the deployment of Japanese forces here.“The wartime operational control is exercised in accordance with the guidelines from leaders of both South Korea and the U.S. Thus, if our president rejects (the U.S. request for Japan’s troop dispatch to Korea), the troops cannot enter South Korea,” he said during a parliamentary session.Analysts say that Japan’s security legislation should be more thoroughly examined to identify aspects that would help South Korea’s security in a crisis, although security concerns seem inevitable, with many Koreans still harboring animosity toward Japan that colonized Korea from 1910-45.“If you check the 11 security laws in detail, there are many elements to strengthen the U.S.-Japan security cooperation to deter North Korea’s military provocations,” said Park Young-june, political science professor at Korea National Defense University.“The laws ensure stepped-up security cooperation on the part of Japan … for instance, Japan’s enhanced rear-area support in case of contingencies involving the Korean Peninsula. The strengthened alliance between the U.S. and Japan, in fact, would help the Korea-U.S. security collaboration in many aspects,” he added.Lee Won-deog, a professor of international politics at Kookmin University, noted that given Japan’s current economic status and aged population, it is highly unlikely for Japan to adopt any militaristic external policy as it did during World War II.“The 20th-century Japan is different from the current 21st-century Japan, although we still have suspicions as to its militaristic past,” he said. “Realistically speaking, Japan does not have the strong economic foundation now to pursue any imperialist policy. Its population is old and shrinking, and it is not in a position to jack up its defense spending to push for any unilateral military policy. That is unthinkable for now.”To prevent a set of worst-case scenarios, including Japan unilaterally intervening in peninsular affairs on the grounds that they could affect its own security, experts say that Seoul needs to strengthen dialogue channels with Tokyo and should seek to establish multilateral security cooperation mechanisms.Regional cooperation mechanisms would help prevent Japan from taking destabilizing military steps and lead the archipelago state to remain committed to its stated goal of making a “proactive” contribution to global peace. “While looking at Japan’s security policy, South Korea needs to take into consideration all possibilities and scenarios. It should not be naive and should remain cool-headed,” said Nam Ki-jeong, a professor at the Institute for Japanese Studies at Seoul National University.“What it can do is to work up diplomacy to lead Japan to move in the right direction within the multilateral security cooperation mechanism. The U.S., China and Russia can also get involved in the mechanism to promote the overall regional peace.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","public worries over japan new ,week of the controversial legislation ,political science professor at korea ,worries over japan new security ,korean emergency japanese prime minister","['Japan', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'korean', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Park Hwee', 'Kookmin University', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Koreans', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Defense', 'Han Min - koo', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'U.S.', 'japanese', 'South Korea', 'the U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Japan ’s', 'Korea', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'South Korea ’s', 'Koreans', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'U.S.-Japan', 'North Korea ’s', 'Park Young', 'Korea National Defense University', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'Lee Won - deog', 'Kookmin University', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Nam Ki - jeong', 'the Institute for japanese Studies', 'Seoul National University', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Russia', 'song Sang - ho']",9,"[ 4.         21.          1.         ... -0.49816018  0.52286071

Teachers need to reimagine what their classrooms should look like.”  U.S. educator Jon Bergmann speaks Thursday during the Global Education Forum 2015, hosted by Daekyo Culture Foundation at Daekyo Tower in Gwanak-gu, southwestern Seoul. (Global Education Forum 2015)Bergmann was in Seoul to attend the Global Education Forum 2015.The flipped classroom is a strategy that reverses the traditional education model to deliver the instructional content ― often in forms of online video lectures ― outside the classroom, partaking in activities in the classroom. Bergmann said the model put students at the center of the learning process, allowing them to learn at their own pace, instead of being fed information by teachers. “It has effects on (students’) learning behavior. Students who might have had trouble with the traditional method can take ownership of their own learning, instead of waiting for teachers to give it to them.The idea of an inverted learning model was initiated back when Bergmann was teaching high school chemistry in 2007. Bergmann and his colleague Aaron Sams had been recording lectures for students who missed classes when they started asking “what is the value of class time if you don’t have to go to the classroom to get information?”Prerecording the lectures and letting students acquire information via videos in advance opens up opportunities for the educators to conduct various creative activities, such as projects and debates in the classroom, according to Bergmann.“This is a way to get schools away from a factory level of teaching; making teachers more valuable than information assimilators,” he said.One of the common perceptions about the flipped classroom is that it is primarily about students studying through lecture videos, which leads educators to focus on creating the video more than the class activities themselves. Bergmann, however, said that flipped learning puts more emphasis on the relationship between students and teachers, as well as among students. “The flipped classroom is not about the (lecture) videos, it’s about active engagements you can have in classrooms,” Bergmann said. “(Classes) are not taught by computers, they’re taught by teachers,” he said.In Korea, the flipped classroom model has been practiced by some 250 schools since 2012. But there has been concern as to whether the new model can establish itself in Korean schools, where much learning is still based on rote memorization from lectures.Bergmann said that while there is a lot of value in rote learning, teachers would need to find balance between rote learning and constructive learning.Finding that balance is important in flipped learning, Bergmann pointed out, which is why the teachers’ role is more important than ever.“To flip a class takes a lot of time. There are no right ways, but there are ways to flip it wrong,” he said. “We need to encourage the teachers. Flipped learning will not make your teaching life easier, but it will make your teaching better.”By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","changed teachers need to reimagine ,students studying through lecture videos ,thursday during the global education ,the teachers flipped learning will ,the lecture videos it about","['U.S.', 'YouTube', 'Jon Bergmann', 'U.S.', 'Jon Bergmann', 'the Global Education Forum', 'Daekyo Culture Foundation', 'Gwanak - gu', 'Seoul', 'Global Education Forum 2015)Bergmann', 'Seoul', 'Bergmann', 'Bergmann', 'Aaron Sams', 'Bergmann', 'Bergmann', 'Bergmann', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Bergmann', 'Bergmann']",1,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.5704695   0.54227382

It is the first time that more than a hundred sets of remains were delivered at once.The forced mobilization was carried out when the Korean Peninsula was a Japanese colony from 1910-45. Many Koreans were conscripted into the Japanese military or drafted to work in the military industrial sector, being deployed to Japan and other countries against their will.Many of them returned home after the 1945 liberation of Korea, following Japan's defeat in World War II, but others remained abroad. Many are believed to have died during the war.It is unclear how many people were mobilized for forced labor and died.

The deadly biological agent was supposed to have been killed before being distributed for research.  The sample was destroyed upon notification from the U.S. Department of Defense, according to the U.S. military in South Korea.  The two defendants, identified only by their surnames Kim and Chung, were not held in custody before trial, and the trial date has yet to be set, according to the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office.  They also scattered about 200 leaflets on the street demanding the resignation of President Park Geun-hye before being arrested by police.  Under South Korean law, holding rallies or demonstrations within 100 meters of diplomatic missions or residences is prohibited.  Several members of Corean Alliance were arrested in a separate case just months before.

148,148,‘I still wake up in the night and cry’,"　Kang Il-chul was only 16 when she was abducted by three Japanese military officers in her hometown of Sangju, North Gyeongsang Province. It was in 1943 in colonial Korea, and Kang had just returned home from school. Her parents weren’t home.　“They said, ‘Put on your shoes and come out,’ and I obeyed,” Kang said in an interview with local media outlets Monday. “I could not resist.

It was in 1943 in colonial Korea, and Kang had just returned home from school. Her parents weren’t home.“They said, ‘Put on your shoes and come out,’ and I obeyed,” Kang said in an interview with local media outlets Monday. “I could not resist. Resisting against Japanese officers meant risking your life at the time. They could kill you at any moment.”Kang’s life as the darling youngest daughter of 12 siblings changed instantly. She was forcibly taken to China to work as a sex slave for frontline Japanese soldiers stationed there. Until Japan’s defeat in 1945, Kang was forced to work in military brothels, enduring both sexual and physical abuse by the soldiers.  Kang Il-chul, a former sex slave for the Japanese military during the World War II, poses for a photo at the House of Sharing in Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province, Monday. (Ministry of Gender Equality and Family)According to Kang’s past testimonies, she was forced to have sex with about 10 to 15 soldiers daily during her years as a slave. When the war nearly ended in 1945, she developed severe typhoid fever. The Japanese placed her outside of the military base to be cremated alive with corpses, thinking she would soon die from the disease. Kang was eventually rescued by Korean independence soldiers stationed in China. The 87-year-old still has scars on her head from the experience. “I still wake up in the middle of the night and cry,” she said. “I can’t control the tears. Sometimes I can’t even sleep.”Some 200,000 women were forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese during World War II, and a handful of the surviving women, including Kang, are spending their final years in the House of Sharing, a special shelter and museum in Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province. In South Korea, most of the victims have already died from old age. There are now only 47 registered survivors, including Kang and nine other women residing at the House of Sharing.Among the victims, Kang is considered one of the most active and vocal women in the movement asking for an official apology from Japan. Last month, she flew to New York to speak at the Holocaust Memorial and Tolerance Center of Nassau County about her experience as a sex slave in an attempt to raise awareness of Japan’s wartime atrocities. Kang is also scheduled to visit the museum again next March to celebrate the opening of a special exhibition featuring her and other victims’ stories. “It’s not always easy to share my story,” she said. “Sometimes I don’t want to do it because I don’t want to cry in front of others while talking about it. But I understand the importance of it now. I have to share it so what I had to deal with does not repeat in the future.”In spite of the victims’ activism and Seoul’s repeated demand for an apology and legal reparations, Tokyo has claimed that all compensation was settled in the 1965 South Korea-Japan Normalization treaty.For Kang, it is not only the abuse she endured that she wants to be compensated for. It also has to do with the loss of her youth, her home, her family and her country, she said. “I don’t know if anyone can even imagine what it means to lose everything like that,” she said. “It was better to be dead.”Kang remembers the Japanese being violent and inhumane toward Koreans in Sangju, even before she was abducted to China. Many, including Kang’s parents, lost their harvest and food to the Japanese officers, who would break into homes abruptly and randomly with swords. “If you resisted, you would be beaten to death on the spot,” Kang said. As children, Kang and her friends would run to the nearest farm and hide by lying with their faces down, whenever they saw Japanese officers. “We never knew what they would do to us,” she said. “I will try my best to live as long as I can to ensure that people remember what I had to endure.”After World War II, Kang married a Chinese man and worked as a nurse in China’s Jilin province until she returned to Korea in 2000. The first place she visited upon her return was her family house in Sangju. The house, which was once filled with her favorite childhood memories, was empty as all her siblings and parents had passed away. As the youngest child of her family, Kang would often sleep next to her mother in the same room. Her parents would save dried persimmons and jujubes from their tree just for her. Even on the day she was taken away by the Japanese in 1943, she rushed home from school to see her mother as soon as possible. Kang never got to say good-bye. “I collapsed on the floor and wailed (the day I returned to my old house),” she said, tearing up. “I’ve always missed my mother. I still miss her terribly.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","abducted by three japanese military ,youngest daughter of 12 siblings ,japan last month she flew ,severe typhoid fever the japanese ,abducted by three japanese","['Kang Il - chul', 'japanese', 'Sangju', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'Korea', 'Kang', 'Kang', 'japanese', 'China', 'japanese', 'Japan', 'Kang', 'Kang Il - chul', 'japanese', 'the House of sharing in Gwangju , Gyeonggi Province', 'Ministry of Gender Equality', 'Kang ’s', 'Japanese', 'Kang', 'korean', 'China', 'Japanese', 'Kang', 'the House of Sharing', 'Gwangju', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'South Korea', 'Kang', 'the House of Sharing', 'Kang', 'Japan', 'New York', 'Japan', 'Kang', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'South Korea', 'Kang', 'Japanese', 'Koreans', 'Sangju', 'China', 'Kang', 'japanese', 'Kang', 'Kang', 'japanese', 'Kang', 'chinese', 'China', 'Jilin', 'Korea', 'Sangju', 'Kang', 'Japanese', 'Kang', '’ve', 'Claire Lee']",2,"[ 2.          3.          1.         ... -0.39726329  0.22657435

""Out of 829 parts that were under review, only 41 were ordered to be modified,"" Judge Ji Dae-woon said.The amendment order had come after some left-leaning historians asked the government to ban a textbook they thought contained a conservative bias.They criticized the textbook published by Kyohak Publishing Co. for being partial to Japan, which colonized the Korean Peninsula from 1910-45, and for glorifying South Korea's past authoritarian governments.There are eight types of history textbooks in South Korea.While ordering Kyohak to revise some parts of its textbook, the Ministry of Education subsequently ordered the other seven textbooks, which had already been approved, to be modified.Historians were asked to clarify details about the 1950-53 Korean War; North Korea's ""juche,"" or self-reliance, ideology; and the 2010 torpedoing of a South Korean warship by North Korea, among other items.

As usual, it did not provide the exact date of his activity.The project began in 2002 and the North aims to complete construction in time to celebrate the 70th founding anniversary of the Workers' Party on Oct. 10.A number of young people and troops have been mobilized to speed up the work, especially since Kim last visited the site in April.""The young people of the DPRK (North Korea) are very admirable as they have waged a high-pitched drive day and night for the past more than 120 days,"" Kim was quoted as saying. ""It could be created only by the young people of the DPRK, educated and trained under the care of the Workers' Party of Korea, and all of them are heroes.""He has demonstrated ""the deepest trust"" in the youth by naming the power plant the Paektusan Hero Youth Power Station, added the KCNA. Paektusan is the highest mountain on the Korean Peninsula, sitting on the North Korea-China border.He was accompanied by Choe Ryong-hae, secretary of the Workers' Party, and Jo Yong-won, vice department director of the party's central committee.Choe traveled to Beijing early this month to attend a high-profile military parade to commemorate a World War II anniversary as Kim's special envoy.

The project, worth 319 million won ($270,000), was initiated last September and will continue through next April. Future soldiers take a psychological evaluation at the Seoul office of the Military Manpower Administration in January 2015. (Yonhap)“The idea itself that the ministry can use soldiers’ personal data at will is a problem,” said Rep. Kwon Eun-hee of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, who revealed the project to the media on Sunday during the parliamentary audit of the government.“It is doubtful whether the database, should it be established, would be helpful to single out maladjusted troops.” The lawmaker also pointed out that concerns about the potential leak of personal data and violation of human rights had been raised by the Ministry of Government Administration and Home Affairs, and even the human rights division within the Defense Ministry.“Without soldiers’ consent about the use of their personal data, the collection of the data and analyses on the specific information of the soldiers should be restricted,” the MGAHA was quoted by Rep. Kwon as saying.Some officials within the Defense Ministry raised the possibility that the project could trigger opposition from draftees and their parents.In response, the Defense Ministry said that it would first analyze the legal matters involving the project and seek to address them, with an aim to establish a comprehensive database that would allow the military to more proactively prevent accidents and suicides.To build the database, the ministry plans to use soldiers’ personal data, the results of their aptitude tests and information from the ministry’s counseling and investigation authorities, the ministry explained in a statement.“The project is needed to better deal with the soldiers that we fear could get into accidents, and better evaluate the stable management of the troops for each unit,” the ministry said.The use of big data analyses to better manage the troops was pushed for as the ministry has been pushing to capitalize on innovative technologies such as information and communications technology and the Internet of Things, or Internet-connected products, under the “Creative Defense” vision.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","april future soldiers take psychological ,crimes including desertions with weapons ,future soldiers take psychological evaluation ,suicides to build the database ,out maladjusted troops the lawmaker","['the Defense Ministry', 'Seoul', 'the Military Manpower Administration', 'Kwon Eun - hee', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'the Ministry of Government Administration', 'Home Affairs', 'the Defense Ministry', 'MGAHA', 'Kwon', 'the Defense Ministry', 'the Defense Ministry', 'Song Sang - ho']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.6503318   0.49762538

Korea currently has state-published history textbooks for elementary schools, but allows eight publishers to author books for middle and high schools. Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea has emphasized the importance of students learning from “one version of history” that will supposedly help students obtain the correct perception of history. Kim Moo-sung, chairman of the ruling Saenuri Party, is also one of most outspoken champions of the state history textbook. But the prospect of state-published history textbooks has prompted concerns from many educators across the country.Education superintendents from Seoul, Incheon and Gangwon and Gyeonggi Provinces released a joint statement Tuesday to decry the attempt.“The state must set the boundary of curriculum based on a social agreement, and allow education of various forms and content within that boundary,” they said, adding that state textbooks are “in disaccord with the values of democracy, autonomy or diversity.”Rep. Kim Tae-nyeon of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy said that 15 of 17 education chiefs in Korea disapprove of state history textbooks for secondary education.In a survey conducted by Kim on 24,195 teachers at middle and high schools throughout Korea, 77.7 percent of the respondents said they oppose the state history textbooks.“As the majority in the education circles oppose the state history textbooks, the government’s attempt to reinstate the system should be abandoned right now,” Kim said. The Korea Teachers and Education Worker’s Union, the nation’s largest left-leaning teachers’ group, also raised objections against the system, along with 2,255 members of the Association of Korean History Teachers who released a joint statement last week.But some groups have said that history textbooks published under the current system fail to impart accurate historical knowledge to students, and that the state needs to take control in authoring a “correct version of history” in textbooks.In a forum held Tuesday at the Korea Press Center in central Seoul, the right-leaning Parents’ Association for Reviving Public Education claimed that the current history textbooks contain content that is biased in favor of the leftists, such as by saying both South and North Korea are responsible for the 1950-53 Korean War.The state history textbook issue is expected to spark a bipartisan standoff during Thursday’s parliamentary audit of the Education Ministry.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","oppose the state history textbooks ,disapprove of state history textbooks ,government to author history textbooks ,day denying local news report ,education chiefs in korea disapprove","['the Education Ministry', 'Korea', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Saenuri Party', 'Seoul', 'Incheon', 'Gangwon', 'Gyeonggi Provinces', 'Kim Tae - nyeon', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Korea', 'Kim', 'Korea', 'Kim', 'the Korea Teachers and Education Worker ’s Union', 'the Association of korean History Teachers', 'the Korea Press Center', 'Seoul', 'Parents ’ Association for Reviving Public Education', 'North Korea', 'the Education Ministry']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.15684012  0.48073727

Ahn Min-suk of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, an average of 63 foreign students benefiting from the government’s sponsorship program each year discontinued their studies and went back to their countries from 2011 through this August.  (Yonhap)Out of 2,186 students on the scholarship program during the 2011-15 period, 270 of them were not able to receive a degree, with the number of such students increasing every year. The biggest reason behind the students quitting their studies was family affairs, followed by health problems, language barriers, failure to adapt to studying in Korea and poor academic performance.A 28-year-old foreign student, who asked not to be named, said that most of the problems arise from foreign students who are not familiar with Korean culture, especially the strict, competitive educational environment here. “I can see the government trying to help us, but some of my friends return to their countries due to problems with host universities,” he told The Korea Herald.“For example, we often have disagreements with our labs over working hours and conditions,“ said the South American, who is required to stay for 12 hours in his university lab every day. ”We often found it difficult to cope with the strict, competitive educational environment here pressuring us to study and work long hours.“Another student from Africa also added that Korean universities are not ”open-minded“ enough to embrace foreign students here. ”I saw some friends having been refused from attending certain classes just because they were foreigners,“ he said. ”It will help us a lot to adjust to the new environment if Korean teachers and students are a bit more fluent in English and open-minded to us.“The lawmaker Ahn said that behind the problem was the lack of systematic support for the foreign students to help them adapt to the Korean environment and culture. He called for a more comprehensive monitoring system to look after the government-sponsored students.The Korean government has stepped up efforts to attract foreign students in recent years through the sponsorship program. Under the scheme, authorities offer the selected students a yearlong Korean language course, a full scholarship and living expenses until they finish earning their degrees at Korean universities. The number of the students sponsored by the Korean government surged from 422 in 2012 to 887 last year, with the government‘s plan to receive as many as 200,000 foreign students by 2023. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","korean government quit their studies ,000 foreign students by 2023 ,selected students yearlong korean language ,186 students on the scholarship ,sponsorship program each year discontinued","['korean', 'the National Institute for International Education', 'Ahn Min - suk', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Korea', 'korean', 'the Korea Herald', 'the South American', 'korean', 'korean', 'Ahn', 'korean', 'korean', 'korean', 'korean']",12,"[ 0.          0.          8.         ... -0.42464548  0.35817882

According to Rep. Jasmine Lee of the ruling Saenuri Party, the national standard on sex education, which cost the government 600 million won ($499,000), was cowritten by a total of 19 individuals. Of them, nine had degrees in nursing, six in public health and four in education. But the writing staff did not include any experts in humanities, such as philosophy, sociology or gender studies, the office added.Lee also revealed that the Education Ministry did not consult with the Gender Equality Ministry when coming up with contents for the guidelines. “Over half of the contents in the guidelines are relevant to philosophy, society, culture and law,” the lawmaker said in a statement. “And it makes no sense that the manual did not include a single expert in humanities as its authors.” A South Korean schoolteacher is preparing for her class in an empty classroom. YonhapThe guidelines, prepared as a manual for sex education for teachers nationwide, have been fiercely criticized by civic groups and experts for its misleading and sexist remarks. Among the criticized statements is “males’ sexual desire can arise quickly on impulse, regardless of time or place,” and that “people of the opposite sex should not be alone together by themselves.” The manual also stated that “date rape can occur in situations where a man spends a lot of money on dates, as it is natural for him to want a commensurate compensation from the woman.”Lee suggested the Education Ministry come up with a new version of the manual to include input from the Gender Equality Ministry and humanities experts. By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","sex education for teachers nationwide ,controversial guidelines on sex education ,ministry controversial guidelines on sex ,sex education for teachers ,for sex education for teachers","['the Education Ministry ’s', 'Jasmine Lee', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee', 'the Education Ministry', 'the Gender Equality Ministry', 'south korean', 'the Education Ministry', 'the Gender Equality Ministry', 'Claire Lee']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45246857 -0.02036379

According to historians, more than 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were coerced into sexual servitude at front-line Japanese brothels during World War II when the Korean Peninsula was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945. Those sex slaves were euphemistically called ""comfort women.""The North Korean magazine criticized the Japanese Imperial Army for committing ""the biggest anti-humane crime, aimed at obliterating the Korean nation."" ""They arrested, imprisoned and killed innocent Koreans at random, and kidnapped and forcibly took 8.4 million young and middle-aged Koreans to the battlefields and backbreaking workplaces at mines, coal mines, construction sites of military establishments, killing over a million,"" the article read. ""200,000 Korean women were reduced to 'comfort women,' sexual slaves of the Japanese soldiers, most of them being buried in alien lands,"" it said. ""It is hard to see in any period and anywhere in the world such horrible crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists,"" it said.""They are the heinous crimes never to be erased nor covered even after lapse of time and replacement of the generations,"" it said. The article also accused Japan of what it calls a ""violent crackdown"" on the de facto North Korean embassy in Tokyo. North Korea and Japan, which have no diplomatic ties, have been at odds over the property of the General Association of Korean Residents in Tokyo, known as Chongryon, which represents North Korean interests in Japan. The Chongryon property has been put up for auction after being seized over unpaid rent. ""The present Japanese authorities, far from making a sincere apology and reparation for this, are stoking up national chauvinism against the DPRK (North Korea) and Chongryon, and running amok with anti-DPRK machinations and violent crackdown on Chongryon in inhumane and immoral ways,"" it said.

(Yonhap)In its Monday edition, the conservative daily carried the column accusing Korea’s diplomacy of being historically subservient to big powers -- China, Russia or Japan -- alternately, and of keeping the “bad heritage” of playing both the U.S. and China.Critics here perceived the column as reflecting the paper’s displeasure over the indictment last year of its former Seoul bureau chief, who was accused of libel after reporting on rumors that Park was staying with a man when the Sewol ferry disaster occurred last April.The Seoul government demanded through its embassy in Tokyo that the Sankei Shimbun retract the column and take steps to prevent a recurrence. But the newspaper reportedly rejected the demand. Cheong Wa Dae refused to handle the case itself, dismissing it as being unworthy of its attention.“We don’t even feel the need to comment on an article of a media outlet in connection with specific figures within Japan, who frequently make brazen claims about the past with their DNA of historical distortions and revisionism,” a Seoul official said, declining to be named.The controversial column came after President Park made a diplomatically tricky decision to attend China’s military parade on Thursday to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II -- a high-profile event to highlight China’s military ascent against the backdrop of its intensifying strategic competition with the U.S.Park’s decision was in tune with her “trustpolitik” initiative to seek regional cooperation in denuclearizing North Korea and promote the overall security in the region, Seoul officials explained. Apparently prioritizing its alliance with the U.S., Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe decided not to attend the event.The conservative paper’s column infuriated Koreans particularly because of its derogatory description of Korea’s diplomacy. “Toward the end of the Joseon era (1392-1910), (Korea) easily changed countries, to which it held flunkeyism, from (Chinese) Qing Dynasty to Japan, and then to Russia,” the column said. “(South) Korea that has inherited that DNA is employing a way (of diplomacy) reminiscent of the Joseon era.”The column’s comparison between Park and Empress Myeongseong, in particular, angered Koreans. The column stated that on the back of Russia’s support in 1895, the empress took power, but she was assassinated months later.The empress was murdered in 1895 by agents under Miura Goro, then the Japanese minister to Korea. Japan, then, thought of her as a major hurdle to its expansionist policy as she was in support of closer ties with Russia.Korea’s political circles exhibited rare unity in denouncing what they criticized as the “ahistorical” column.“The description in the column was a shameful portrait of Japan’s ultraconservatism. We are just left speechless by the brazen facade of its ultraconservatism,” said Kim Yong-woo, spokesperson of the ruling Saenuri Party.“The Sankei Shimbun and ultraconservatives in Japan would be forsaken by Japan’s conscientious people and the international community.”Kim Young-rok, spokesperson of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, also expressed his party’s displeasure.“Before the paper talked about toadyism or whatever, it should reflect on what Japan has done -- its pursuit of the expansion of collective self-defense to allow itself to be able to wage a war while leaning on the U.S.,” he said.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","conservative paper column infuriated koreans ,empress assassinated by japan president ,19th century korean empress assassinated ,assassinated by japan president park ,korean empress assassinated by japan","['japanese', 'Sankei Shimbun', 'Park Geun', 'China', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Park Geun', 'Cabinet', 'Yonhap)In', 'Korea', 'China', 'Russia', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Seoul', 'Park', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'the Sankei Shimbun', 'Dae', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Park', 'China', 'China', 'U.S.Park', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Koreans', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Chinese', 'Japan', 'Russia', 'Korea', 'Park', 'Empress Myeongseong', 'Koreans', 'Russia', 'Miura Goro', 'japanese', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Russia', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Kim Yong - woo', 'Saenuri Party', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'Song Sang - ho']",17,"[ 0.         10.          1.         ... -0.68489015  0.58729851

Several environmental groups, including Green Korea United, said they would seek revocation against the government’s approval for the cable car project on Mount Seoraksan in Gangwon Province, claiming that the decision is invalid as it didn’t strictly follow the procedural rules.Last Friday, the ministry’s national park committee decided by a vote to allow the construction of a 3.5-kilometer cable car on Mount Seoraksan in Yangyang County. The cable car project had been mired in controversy over the ecological impacts and economic feasibility. “Yangyang County’s application for the cable car (that was submitted to the ministry) didn’t cover the ecological values of Mount Seoraksan, violating the ministry’s guidelines,” they said.Civic groups also claimed that the majority of the committee was unfairly composed of public servants who have likely sided with the ministry. They said they would request the Board of Audit and Inspection to examine the procedure followed for the project. They also urged lawmakers to carry out a parliamentary probe into the ministry’s decision and to pass the national park protection law that has been pending at the National Assembly. The law aims at prohibiting the installation of facilities in government-designated nature preservation districts. Yangyang residents and the municipal government have argued that the cable car will not only boost the local economy by bringing over 100 billion won ($85 million) of revenue, but also offer more diverse travel routes for mountain visitors, especially for the elderly and disabled.Environmentalists, on the other hand, have expressed ecological concerns, claiming that the proposed cable car route covers a natural habitat for a number of endangered species, especially an endangered type of mountain goat. Acknowledging the opposition, the ministry ordered the county office to fulfill seven preconditions ahead of starting the project. It includes strengthening safety rules and measures to support endangered species, mapping out facility monitoring and donating partial revenue to a forest protection fund.The project will go ahead once the environment minister gives the final approval. The cable car is scheduled to start running from February 2018 when the PyeongChang Winter Olympics are set to be held.

Judge Kwak Hyung-sub of the Seoul Central District Court ruled that the suit was filed after statute of limitations expired, making the suit null and void. The suit was filed in 2013, more than four years after the sisters’ suicide. According to local regulations, compensation suits must be filed within three years of an incident. In 2004, the older sister began working as a bit-part actor on the suggestion of her sibling, who was hoping to become an actress. The older sister, who was an introvert and had a record of receiving counseling, was soon subjected to sexual harassment by employees of the company managing bit-part actors. The harassments turned to assaults, and the management company’s employees allegedly confined her in a motel room and raped her on numerous occasions. Her assailants are also alleged to have threatened to kill the victim’s mother and to sell off her sister if she resisted. The alleged assailants are also reported to have been aware that others were sexually assaulting the victim, and used the knowledge to force her into performing further sexual acts. The victim filed a police report in December that year, but dropped the charges saying that the facts of the case would be hard to prove and that she was in too much pain recalling the ordeal. She then went on to receive treatment for a number of years, until she killed herself in 2009.A month after the victim’s suicide, her sister followed suit.By Choi He-suk (cheesuk@heraldcorp.com)","years after the sisters suicide ,after the sisters suicide ,two daughters who committed suicide ,the victim suicide her sister ,sisters suicide according to local","['Seoul', 'Kwak Hyung - sub', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'Choi He - suk']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55855012  0.32161796

The plan was revealed in the ministry’s public hearing for the revision of the education curriculum for elementary, middle and high schools, held at the Korea National University of Education in Chungju, North Chungcheong Province. Monday’s hearing covered common subjects for elementary school students, Korean language, Chinese characters and foreign languages. The creation of the separate subject was in response to nationwide calls for a safety education program after last year’s sinking of Sewol ferry that left 305 dead or missing, 250 of whom were high school students on a field trip. While most of the blame fell on the ship’s crew ― including the captain ― who left the vessel without evacuating the passengers, experts across the country also pointed out that the Korean education system failed to equip students with survival skills that could have helped them in the situation. Hong Hoo-jo, a professor of education at Korea University, said schools should be responsible to more systematically teach students how to protect themselves and their friends in emergencies. The ministry also said it is planning to cut the burden of academic work for English and Korean languages, two key subjects, as well as the annual college entrance exam known here as the Suneung. “We assess that (the new curriculum) will cut the amount students that have to study by nearly 20 percent,” a ministry official said. In keeping with the trend of reducing the studying burden, the ministry is planning to abolish a curved grading system for its Suneung English exam. The current grading system sorts students into one of nine ratings based on their relative score.In order to reduce what President Park Geun-hye described as “excessive English education,” the ministry will introduce an absolute grading system, which rates students based on the numerical grade.In addition, the ministry said Korean language in the new curriculum will incorporate a developmental process of communication skills. For example, the elementary school lessons will be primarily based on speaking and hearing, while reading and writing skills will be stressed in high school.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","new curriculum will incorporate developmental ,korea education ministry will introduce ,annual college entrance exam ,education ministry will introduce new ,the new curriculum will incorporate","['South Korea ’s', 'Education Ministry', 'the Korea National University of Education', 'Chungju', 'North Chungcheong Province', 'korean', 'chinese', 'korean', 'Hong Hoo - jo', 'Korea University', 'korean', 'suneung english', 'Park Geun', 'english', 'korean']",4,"[ 0.          0.          4.         ... -0.33113578  0.47623482

In South Korea, the Marriage Brokers Business Management Act require brokers and agencies to provide foreign women and Korean men with full information about their future spouses in the form of authorized documents. Those who fail to abide by the law can face up to three years in prison and a financial penalty of up to 2 million won. Lee allegedly gave their client a piece of paper with a simple profile of the girls, enabling him to choose based on their names, ages and educational backgrounds. The illicit practice, which human rights activists have condemned for treating women and girls like products, remains a popular way for Korean men to find foreign matches.According to the police, many foreign women are coerced into marrying Korean men they hardly know and having sex with them the next day. The lack of information provided by the brokers about potential spouses often leads to cases of marriage fraud, in which foreign wives ended up not entering Korea or running away from their husbands once they settled here, the police said. False advertising is another business tactic prevalent among international brokers. A 51-year-old man, surnamed Dae, was accused of using misinformation to lure customers. He allegedly claimed that his agency had overseas branches and had successfully set up marriages for 24 couples, neither of which was true. Some of the agencies were not even registered with the authorities as required. As part of efforts to avert marriage fraud, the authorities have toughened the requirements on international marriage agencies and brokers, which reduced the number of licensed matchmaking services. The number dropped by two-thirds, from 1,370 in 2012 to 449 in 2014, according to the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family. But the tightened regulations led to the creation of a black market of unlicensed matchmakers, with the number of marriage fraud cases hovering around 600 in recent years. As of January, there are 305,446 marriage migrants in Korea, with 83 percent of them being women.

168,168,Sex trade businesses caught by police nearly triple in 2 years," The number of sex trade businesses caught by police in the past two years has nearly tripled, a report showed Friday, as authorities have led a crackdown against prostitution despite ongoing debate over whether to legalize the controversial industry.

The overall number of businesses offering sex, gambling or similar services apprehended by police dropped to 48,121 last year from 51,652 in 2013 and 55,785 in 2012, the report submitted by the National Police Agency to New Politics Alliance for Democracy Rep. You Dae-woon showed.Of such businesses, more businesses were caught offering sex services, with the number rising to 8,952 cases last year from 4,553 in 2013 and 3,263 in 2012.It showed that while the number of such businesses identified by the police decreased by 13.7 percent, the number of sex trade businesses surged by nearly threefold.Other types of obscene businesses marked a decrease, including those operating on lewd or sexual services and gambling that dropped by 44.6 percent and 24.4 percent, respectively.While the overall number of obscene businesses has dropped consistently since 2012, some regions showed a surge over the two years, the report said.They included Seoul (up 33.1 percent), North Chungcheong Province (18.0 percent), Jeju (8.2 percent) and South Chungcheong Province (3.3 percent).By the number of sex trade instances alone, Jeju showed a tenfold increase from 10 cases in 2012 to 101 cases last year. The numbers increased in Daejeon as well from 21 to 128, and Daegu from 85 to 509.Police said the drastic surge in sex trade operations caught in Jeju stems from the increase in foreign tourism, and the rise in new forms of prostitution, such as via a clandestine mobile sex trading system.“Last year’s number showed a surge especially because we fortified the clampdown as one of the policy goals,” an official said. “This year, we are concentrating on enterprise-level sex traders and other actions that promote prostitution,” the official added.There have been rising calls for more sophisticated ways of catching sex traders as the sex industry was seen finding creative ways to avoid reinforced clampdowns.Another police report in May showed that more than 6,600 cases of prostitution were arranged on the new platforms last year, more than triple the number of cases they caught in 2010. The latest methods of sex trade include the usage of online chat rooms, social networking sites and smartphone applications, the police said. The debate on legalizing prostitution has heated up in South Korea as the Constitutional Court began reviewing the law that criminalizes the sex trade. The court held its first public hearing in April.The antiprostitution law was enacted in 2004 to protect human rights, partly prompted by a fire that killed 14 sex workers who were locked in a brothel in Gunsan, North Jeolla Province, in 2002. The law stipulates that both purchasing and selling of sex carry a penalty of up to one year in prison or a fine of up to 3 million won ($2,560). It gives exemption to people forced into prostitution, leaving only voluntary sex workers -- many of whom oppose the law -- subject to the punishment.From news reports","killed 14 sex workers who ,fire that killed 14 sex ,that killed 14 sex workers ,killed 14 sex workers ,drastic surge in sex trade","['the National Police Agency', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'You Dae - woon', 'Seoul', 'North Chungcheong Province', 'Jeju', 'South Chungcheong Province', 'Jeju', 'Daejeon', 'Daegu', 'Jeju', 'South Korea', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Gunsan', 'North Jeolla Province']",1,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.63020337  0.22779307

The 4,800-kilometer journey was aimed at calling for Japan to resolve the sexual slavery issue.""The Abe administration must fully admit Japan's responsibility for the system of sexual slavery,"" they said, reading a prepared statement. ""Officially, legally and genuinely apologize for inflicting such brutal and egregious violence against women and children and stop committing even more crimes by denying and avoiding its responsibility.""They stressed that no human being should suffer from such brutality.""The only way we can prevent the same crimes from happening again is to educate ourselves and others. Please remember our voice and do your part,"" they said.After Washington, they plan to travel to New York, where they plan to hold rallies in front of the Japanese consulate and the U.N. headquarters. Shim and Baek, who, as part of their mandatory military service duty, served at the police unit guarding South Korea's easternmost islets of Dokdo, which Japan has long laid claims to, said they became interested in the sexual slavery issue after watching an animation film about victims.Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mainly from Korea, which was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. But Japan has long attempted to water down the atrocity.The sexual slavery issue has been the biggest thorn in frayed relations between Japan and South Korea, with Seoul demanding Tokyo take steps to address the grievances of elderly Korean victims and Japan refusing to do so.Earlier this month, Abe issued a statement commemorating the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, but failed gain to offer a clear apology of his own for the sexual slavery issue. ""He lost another opportunity to solve the issue by choosing to skirt blame and the responsibility of giving an apology,"" Lee Jung-sil, president of the Washington Coalition for Comfort Women Issues, said during the rally in front of the Japanese Embassy.

The soldier is expected to recover from the wound, a JCS official said on the customary condition of anonymity.""The mine that exploded this time appears to be our military's M-14 anti-personnel mine,"" the official said, citing plastic debris found at the site, as well as testimonies and the impact of the explosion. ""The exact reason of the explosion is under examination."" An M-14 is a South Korea-used toe popper in a plastic case, intended to disable enemy targets.The JCS had embargoed press reports on the explosion, citing the then on-going high-level talks between South and North Korea.Two South Korean staff sergeants were severely injured when three land mines, which the South concluded were planted by the North, exploded in the southern half of the DMZ in Paju on Aug. 4. The explosion led to South Korea's resumption of anti-North propaganda warfare broadcasts along the border, as well as an exchange of artillery fire, between the countries last week.Amid heightened tensions, the countries reached a breakthrough deal to end hostilities at the border Tuesday.The DMZ is laced with more than 1 million anti-personnel and anti-tank land mines planted by South and North Korea during and after the 1950-53 Korean War.Since the bloody explosion earlier this month, front-line troops have been ordered to wear anti-mine boots and carry mine detectors on patrol missions.

(123rf)Kim is one of some 2,200 fathers who have chosen to take paternity leave in Korea this year, fighting traditional gender roles that have long deterred Korean men from taking paid time off to participate in child care. According to a survey released by the Ministry of Employment and Labor on Tuesday, the number of fathers taking paternity leave in the first half of this year stood at 2,212, up 40.6 percent from the same period a year earlier. Behind the trend is the social atmosphere underscoring an importance of shared responsibility between men and women for family affairs and child care amid women’s rising economic power, an official from the ministry said. Still, it only accounted for 5 percent of those taking time off for child care, highlighting a bigger burden on Korean women than men in raising children. The total number of Koreans on paternity or maternity leave saw an increase of 15.8 percent in the first half from 37,373 the previous year to 43,272.However, workers for large companies were more likely to grab the opportunity for parental leave than those belonging to small and medium-sized enterprises. Nearly 56 percent of the men who took child care leave in the first half were employed at conglomerates with more than 300 staff members. Also, 65 percent of the fathers on paternity leave were concentrated in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province, where most of the conglomerates’ headquarters are located. SMEs, however, were more prone to adopt the policy that reduces working hours and pays less for male workers as an alternative to parental leave. Out of 992 laborers who received a smaller paycheck in return for slashed working hours, 76 percent belonged to SMEs. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","office worker punishing work hours ,korean men from taking paid ,bigger burden on korean women ,fathers taking paternity leave ,30 something office worker punishing","['Kim Ji - hwan', 'Kim', 'Korea', 'korean', 'the Ministry of Employment and Labor', 'korean', 'Koreans', 'Seoul', 'Gyeonggi Province']",4,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.23695537  0.21287635

It also comes as last week's speech by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe stopped short of directly mentioning the Japanese military's sexual enslavement of women during the war.According to the documents, the Japanese military forced dozens of Korean women to work as sex slaves when it set up military brothels in northeastern Chinese regions, including Mudanjiang, in October 1941. The women were among about 2,000 Korean women who were forcibly recruited by the Japanese military in the 1940s, the state-run China News Service reported, citing the documents. Historians estimate that more than 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were coerced into sexual servitude at front-line Japanese brothels during the war. From 1910 to 1945, the Korean Peninsula was a Japanese colony.

""I was very surprised and heartbroken upon hearing the news of your injuries,"" Park was quoted by the official as telling Kim on the phone Saturday. Kim lost one leg in the explosion. The president pledged the government's best support for the recovery and rehabilitation of the wounded soldiers, also extolling the courage they have shown during and after the explosion, according to the official.Kim promised Park a quick recovery, the official also said.Calling Staff Sgt. Hah, who lost both legs, Park said, ""You and other service members have greatly touched the heart of the public.It was an unfortunate provocation that should not have happened."" Park's message came as military tension is escalating at the border over the attack. North Korea denied its involvement in the explosion, threatening to shoot down loudspeakers on the border that the South Korean military is using for propaganda warfare against the North as a retaliation measure. On Monday, Park called on the military to maintain tighter combat readiness against North Korea and denounced the recent mine explosion as a ""clear military provocation that was intended to kill or injure our soldiers.""

Born in 1926 to China-based Korean independence activists in today’s Manchuria, she had studied English and Chinese as well as Korean, while participating in her parents’ fierce military activism starting at age 14.Now 89, Oh is a retired teacher and a recognized independence activist. “My father emphasized the importance of education for me and my sister. Even when he was imprisoned by the Japanese, he would send my mother letters from jail to make sure she sent us to school no matter how difficult the circumstances were,” she said. “Not many girls at the time had the privilege of having a father like that.”Oh’s life story ― the former activist worked as a teacher full-time for 37 years from 1954-1991 while raising her three children ― contrasts and resonates with the younger generation of today’s Korea, where twice as many women as men still experience career disruptions. Only 50 percent of all women participate in the workforce, in spite of their high levels of education. According to scholar Joo Jae-seon’s latest research for Korea Women’s Development Institute, the number of Korean high school girls who enrolled in post-secondary education increased dramatically by 40.3 percentage points, from 34.3 percent in 1965 to 74.6 percent last year.  Korea`s first nurses Kim Martha (right) and Lee Grace (Korean Nurses Association)Despite their rising education levels, Korean women’s employment rate increased by just 15.2 percentage points in 1963-2014, from 34.3 percent to 49.5 percent. The average amount of hours a married woman spent on domestic affairs daily also decreased by only 32 minutes since 1999 until last year, from four hours and 30 minutes to four hours and 18 minutes.“As South Korea experienced rapid economic development, Korean parents very quickly embraced the idea that they should educate their daughters as much as their sons,” said Joo.“But the idea of their daughters getting a paid job was a different matter. Even until the 1990s, the general notion was that a woman’s primary duty, regardless of her education level, was to nurture her children well. As the statistics show, Korea is not making good use of its high-equality human resources because of the still-existing gender inequality.”Activist Oh’s life story, along with the ones of other women advocates for Korean independence, is being featured at a special exhibition commemorating the 70th anniversary of Korea’s liberation in Seoul. The women’s achievements are not only important to Korea’s modern history, but also give a significant meaning to today’s Korean feminism and the pursuit of gender parity, experts said. “Korea’s gender equality certainly still has a long way to go,” said Lee Sung-sook, the director of the National Women’s History Exhibition Hall. “But without figures like Oh ― there were many remarkable women who fought against inequality in this country ― we wouldn’t have the foundation for changes that need to be made in the future.”As Lee pointed out, Oh wasn’t the only pioneering woman in Korea’s modern history. Almost 20 years before Oh was born, Kim Martha, a former abused housewife, became the first Korean nurse in history. Before her husband disappeared on her with their two children, the fingers of her right hand and her nasal bone were cut off by her jealous spouse with a knife. Lee never got to see her children after her husband left her. Despite her disabilities, she managed to get a job as a maid at a hospital run by American doctors and missionaries, and was eventually admitted as a student at Korea’s first nursing school and became a nurse upon her graduation in 1908. Her colleague, Lee Grace, had been a servant for an aristocratic family and had been walking with a hobble after suffering a childhood disease that was left untreated. Lee’s leg fully recovered after treatment by American surgeons, and she decided to study nursing. She became Korea’s first nurse, along with Kim after graduating from the Pogunyogwan Training School for Nurses, which is now the division of nursing science at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. “The two women’s achievements are monumental,” said Kim Ok-soo, director of the Korean Nurses Association. “At the time, almost all Korean women lacked access to education and were therefore illiterate. They were not allowed to make their own life decisions. But Lee and Kim went against the social norms in spite of their class status and disabilities. They were two of the very first Korean women who voluntarily chose to have a specialized career that required very specific skills and training.”In 1952, Korea welcomed its first woman lawyer, Lee Tai-young (1914-1998). Throughout her life, she fought against domestic violence against women, and called for the abolishment of Korea’s now-defunct, male-centric family registration system, which did not allow women to register their children under their own family name. This meant the children’s names could not be changed even if their mother was remarried after being divorced or widowed, and therefore weren’t allowed to be added as dependents to their stepfather’s insurance plan and other social benefits. The old system was abolished in 2005, more than 50 years after Lee spoke out against it for the first time in 1953. Four years after Lee passed her bar exam, Korea’s first fashion designer, Nora Noh, held the country’s first fashion show in Seoul in 1956. Noh, whose initial first name was Myung-ja, changed her name to Nora at age 19, after ending a marriage of convenience that helped her avoid becoming a “comfort women” to Japanese soldiers. Her inspiration was the protagonist of Henrik Ibsen’s 1879 play “A Doll’s House,” named Nora, who leaves her children and husband to discover herself. Since her launch of Korea’s first ready-to-wear clothing line in 1963, countless high-profile women have worn Noh’s design known for its simple lines and elegance, including Yuk Young-soo, the former first lady and mother of current Korean president Park Geun-hye. One of Noh’s many achievements in her remarkable career that lasted more than three decades since the 1950s was the introduction of miniskirts in the 1960s which became a national sensation. When a female congresswoman asked her, “Shouldn’t women whose legs aren’t pretty avoid wearing miniskirts?” Noh famously replied: “Should women hide their faces with a veil if their faces aren’t pretty?”Yet Noh, lawyer Lee and nurses Lee and Kim were exceptions in their times, and still are today. According to an annual Gender Gap report released last year by the World Economic Forum, Korea ranked 117th out of 142 countries, scoring worst of all in terms of women’s participation in the nation’s political sector. The number of women in the National Assembly, which stood at 47, accounted for just 15.7 percent of all lawmakers 2012.Lee from the National Women’s History Exhibition Hall said leadership education for women could help combating Korea’s still-existing gender inequality, which is most prevalent in the nation’s labor market and in politics above all else. “I think leadership hasn’t been emphasized as a core value in schools, especially among young school girls in Korea,” she said. “But it’s one of the most important skills once you are out of school and participate in the workforce. More young women should be trained as future leaders. And once more women are in managerial and administrative positions, more changes are likely to be made.” By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","mother of current korean president ,korean nurse in history ,rapid economic development korean parents ,first korean nurse in history ,housewife became the first korean","['Chinese', 'Korea', 'japanese', 'China', 'korean', 'Manchuria', 'chinese', 'korean', 'Japanese', 'Korea', 'Joo Jae - seon', 'Korea Women ’s Development Institute', 'korean', 'Kim Martha', 'Lee Grace', 'Korean Nurses', 'korean', 'South Korea', 'korean', 'Joo', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Lee Sung - sook', 'the National Women ’s History Exhibition Hall', 'Lee', 'Korea', 'Kim Martha', 'korean', 'Lee', 'american', 'Korea', 'Lee Grace', 'Lee', 'american', 'Korea', 'Kim', 'Ewha Womans University', 'Seoul', 'Kim Ok - soo', 'the Korean Nurses Association', 'korean', 'Lee', 'Kim', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Lee Tai - young', 'Korea ’s', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Korea ’s', 'Nora Noh', 'Seoul', 'Nora', 'japanese', 'Henrik Ibsen ’s 1879', 'Nora', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Noh', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Kim', 'Gender', 'the World Economic Forum', 'Korea', 'the National Assembly', 'the National Women ’s History Exhibition Hall', 'Korea ’s', 'Korea', 'Claire Lee']",10,"[ 1.          0.         11.         ... -0.56265473  0.6275596

He turned himself in a week later, admitting all charges. The case went cold, however, after the victim refused to testify to the police.While the current law bans anyone of a sexual crime against a minor from resuming, or commencing, a teaching career, one has to have been formally fired for such accusation or sentenced by court for this clause to take effect. But earlier this month, the SMOE announced it would immediately step in to remove accused sex offenders from teaching posts. It has requested its disciplinary committee to fire Kim. When fired, he will no longer be eligible to teach at any school.The revamped antisex-crime measures came after a recent large-scale sexual harassment scandal at a high school in Seodaemun district, in which five teachers were accused of sexually harassing over 100 female victims for over a year.Amid public furor that resonated across the country, Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn held an emergency meeting and vowed to immediately remove any teacher accused of sexual abuse from his or her post. Anyone who knowingly conceals a sex crime at a school can also face expulsion.Sex crimes in schools are often hushed up as the current manual on sex crimes says that such cases should be investigated by a school committee, composed of teachers at the said school. This has made the committee susceptible to pressure from school authorities wishing to sweep the case under the rug.The SMOE said it would push to mandate outside authorities to participate in the committee.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","expulsion sex crimes in schools ,disciplinary committee to fire kim ,accused sex offenders from teaching ,permanently ban male teacher who ,on sex offenders the teacher","['Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'SMOE', 'SMOE', 'Kim', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'SMOE']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.11164682 -0.15726213

Upbraiding Pyongyang for rejecting Seoul’s repeated overtures for dialogue on its denuclearization and carrying out provocative acts including the recent land mine blasts in the Demilitarized Zone, the minister warned that the communist regime would “pay the price” for the provocations.Touching on the South Korea-U.S. summit slated for October, Yun said that Presidents Park and Barack Obama would present their shared recognition of North Korean issues including the evolving nuclear problem. Addressing the persistent military threats from the North, which have further escalated ahead of the South Korea-U.S. joint military drills, the summit will also reaffirm the “firm and unwavering U.S. commitment” to the defense of South Korea, and affirm the shared vision of peninsular reunification, Yun said.Commenting on the maritime disputes in the South China Sea that have been escalating with China constructing artificial islands equipped with military facilities such as an airstrip, Yun reiterated Seoul’s position that differences should be resolved peacefully in accordance with internationally established norms of conduct.“The South China Sea is one of the world’s major sea lines of communication. Therefore, maintaining the peace and stability of the South China Sea, including the freedom of navigation and overflights, is clearly in the interest of all the countries in the region,” he said.The following are the excerpts of the interview with Minister Yun.Korea Herald: The thorniest issue between Seoul and Tokyo for now are the Korean victims who were forced into sexual servitude by Japan during World War II. President Park Geun-hye has mentioned the bilateral negotiations over the issue are at the “final stage.”Minister Yun: This year alone, eight Korean victims have passed away. Given their old age, the resolution of the matter is urgent. Recognizing the urgency, we have made various efforts to address it. We have so far held eight rounds of intense director general-level talks with Japan since April last year, and our assessment is that there has been some meaningful progress.I cannot elaborate in detail about the content of the ongoing consultations at this point. But from a broad perspective, we can say that clearly, there has been considerable progress compared to the initial phase of the talks.Prime Minister Abe said in his speech to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II that Japan wishes to be a country embracing the women whose dignity and honor were hurt during the war. In this respect, we hope that Japan shows sincerity in resolving the matter of comfort women as well.KH: Amid reports about the prospect of a China-Japan summit, analysts point to the need for a Korea-Japan summit. When do you think the summit can be held and under what conditions?Yun: Basically, we are open to holding the Korea-Japan summit. Although there remain a number of tough issues, continued bilateral efforts to resolve them wisely and with patience would contribute to improving the relations, thereby creating an environment where the summit talks can actually take place.Also, as the chair of the trilateral cooperation mechanism of South Korea, Japan and China, Seoul has been continuing diplomatic efforts to hold the trilateral summit at the earliest possible date in the latter half of this year. When the three leaders meet, there would naturally be a bilateral contact. It may be too early to talk about when the trilateral summit will be held, but we hope the meeting to take place within this year at a not too late time.KH: You have stressed the need for Seoul and Tokyo to work together to create a virtuous cycle for the bilateral relations. What do you think each side should do to entrench such cycle?Yun: We have been making diverse efforts with determination to make this year -- the 50th anniversary of the normalization of bilateral ties -- a pivotal moment for improvement in relations. I believe that such an atmosphere is being created to a certain extent.The leaders of both countries each attended events on June 22 to mark the 50th anniversary and expressed their intentions to improve the relations. A total of seven foreign ministerial talks took place including my first visit to Japan in June since I assumed post. The two sides have also settled the issue of Japan’s bid to secure world heritage status for its Meiji-era industrialization facilities through dialogue.While there are some aspects of the statement delivered by Prime Minister Abe on Friday that fell short of our expectations, we take note of the fact that he clarified how the preceding administrations’ historical recognition of remorse and apology for the colonial rule and aggression will remain unshakable. We plan on watching with keen interest how Japan will execute such position into concrete actions.Although there are still quite a number of outstanding issues, I believe that should the Japanese government step forward with more enthusiasm to resolve them, the bilateral relations can evolve into a virtuous cycle.Seoul has been principled in addressing the issue of how history is viewed, even as we intend to actively push ahead with bilateral cooperation that serves our mutual interests, such as in the security, economic, social and cultural realms. KH: The maritime disputes in the South China Sea have been escalating with China constructing artificial islands equipped with military facilities there. Calls have been growing for Seoul to play a role with regard to the South China Sea disputes. Yun: The South China Sea is one of the world’s major sea lines of communication. Therefore, maintaining the peace and stability of the South China Sea, including the freedom of navigation and overflights, is clearly in the interest of all the countries in the region. In this context, my government has been closely following developments in the South China Sea with concern. My government is of the view that differences should be resolved peacefully in accordance with internationally established norms of conduct and this position was reiterated at the recent ARF and EAS Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in Malaysia. In this regard, we believe that the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of the Parties in the South China Sea, adopted by China and ASEAN for the maintenance of peace and stability in the South China Sea, should be implemented effectively and in its entirety, and hope that the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea will be concluded at the earliest possible time. My government takes positive note of the recent dialogues and consultations between ASEAN and China to this end, and looks forward to substantive progress being made toward the early conclusion of the COC. KH: You have mentioned that there would be a “signification agreement” during the South Korea-U.S. summit slated for October with regard to North Korea. Can you elaborate?Yun: As this year marks the 70th anniversary of Korea’s liberation from Japan’s colonial rule and 70 years of division, we have made multifaceted efforts to achieve substantive progress on North Korea’s denuclearization. But Pyongyang has not only rejected our overtures for dialogue, but also held fast to its “Byungjin” policy line while continuously advancing its nuclear capabilities. The North has rejected all talks related to its nuclear program with all five parties of the six-party talks.(With North Korea’s continued threats and provocation) I anticipate that the leaders of South Korea and the U.S. will share their evaluations of the overall security situations on the peninsula including North Korea’s nuclear issue and hold in-depth discussions on how to manage and tackle the current situation and use the occasion to declare their shared perspectives.I believe the leaders will share their overall view of the region’s situation in its entirety and offer their common understanding on how to resolve the problems of North Korea and its nuclear weapons development.KH: The issue of the U.S.’ potential deployment of THAAD to Korea is expected to be a tough diplomatic issue. What do you think will be a wise way to address it?Yun: I understand that internal discussions within the U.S. government are still ongoing and Washington has yet to make any request to Seoul for official consultations. Thus, I think it is inappropriate for me to make a comment based on a hypothetical situation.This issue should be approached from the perspective that the root cause of the problem is North Korea’s evolving nuclear and missile threats. In light of this, my government has maintained the consistent position that it will make prudent, cool-headed judgment based upon our comprehensive consideration of national interests including security factors.

189,189,[REPORTER'S COLUMN] More soul-searching needed in wake of DMZ mine blasts,"South Korea would be acting the way North Korea would have intended by directly taking staunch retaliation against last week’s land mine incident, Staff Sgt.

Kim Jeong-won, one of the two bedridden frontline soldiers injured in the blast, said in a media interview earlier this week.An army soldier engages in a mission to detect minds near the inter-Korean border on Wednesday. (Yonhap)Indeed, what Seoul’s defense authorities have shown to the public in the wake of the Aug. 4 incident is a flurry of emotion-laden pledges to “retaliate” and strengthen border defense, which includes resuming loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts and installing camera-equipped drones.Defense Minister Han Min-koo ordered the military to respond “bravely and unsparingly” if provoked, with his ministry upbraiding the North for violating the Armistice Agreement and vowing to make it “pay dearly” for the blast.But what seems to be missing in Seoul’s reaction is deep soul-searching regarding the seemingly porous frontline defense that again allowed the unpredictable state to catch Seoul’s defense establishment off guard and launch what could have been a deadly attack.This discussion, of course, is by far subsequent to nationwide and international condemnation and warning against North Korea, which once again resorted to provocation in violation of the cease-fire treaty, a grave challenge against the stability of the Korean Peninsula. However, repeated vows of retaliation seem to be routine practice for the South Korean military, which has come under fire for having failed to fend off North Korea’s apparently periodic provocations, including the two deadly attacks in 2010 that killed 48 South Korean troops and two civilians.Seoul’s harsher rhetoric against Pyongyang could even be seen by critics as a move to divert public attention from its sore spots and circumvent the emerging public criticism that “the better-equipped South once again was dealt a blow by the ill-equipped North.”What’s fortunate is, of course, that no fatalities occurred, thanks to the South Korean troop who took proper emergency response steps, although the two soldiers suffered indelible physical and mental scars.Rather than focusing on how to outdo the North in the game of provocation, the South Korean military needs to ask itself fundamental questions: Why has the defense been porous? How can it prevent a recurrence? Has it ever been complacent? Are there other possible ways of future North Korean provocations?Long embroiled in seemingly ceaseless disputes over defense industry corruption, inter-service rivalries and animosities “among friendly forces,” which stem from abuses in the barracks, the military should really think about how it can reinforce itself -- and do so strongly enough to deter the evolving North Korean provocations. As the Seoul government dealt with the land mine incident, it has also revealed what appears to be a lack of inter-agency coordination. The land mine explosions took place last Tuesday. A day later, Seoul’s Unification Ministry proposed working-level government talks with the North to discuss a range of pending issues. All the while, the investigation was ongoing to determine whether the North was to blame for the incident.Seoul officials said that the dialogue proposal was made as nothing had been determined of the explosion at the time. But critics argue that it illustrates a lack of coordination between the ministries of defense and unification, though Seoul may want to say it was a case of a two-track approach employing dialogue and a stern response to the North’s provocations and nuclear development.The most crucial virtues for a country’s external policy, particularly when dealing with an unpredictable partner, should be caution and prudence, as international relations pundits routinely say. These virtues should not be missing in the implementation of Seoul’s policy toward Pyongyang.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","killed 48 south korean troops ,explosions took place last tuesday ,this week an army soldier ,korean border on wednesday yonhap ,last week land mine incident","['South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Sgt', 'Kim Jeong - won', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'Han Min - koo', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'south korean', 'North Korea ’s', 'south korean', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'south korean', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'Seoul ’s Unification Ministry', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'North ’s', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Song Sang - ho']",6,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.35227299  0.55880523

NHK, Japan’s national broadcasting organization, reported Monday that Abe plans to include such expressions as “apology” and “aggression” in the draft statement, upholding the position of previous governments on Japan’s conduct during the war.The report contradicted earlier coverage by Japanese national newspaper Asahi Shimbun that said the draft of Abe’s statement does not include the word “apology” to Asian countries, which was included in two past landmark statements, according to the draft that he showed the executives of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and junior coalition partner Komeito.Abe, currently discussing the draft, is set to release it for endorsement by the cabinet on Friday.Abe’s speech is to be closely watched by South Korea, China and other neighboring and involved countries to see whether the ultra-right premier will acknowledge his predecessors’ statements on Japan’s wartime aggression.Abe’s speech is expected to set the tone of bilateral ties with Korea as well, as the two countries have been cautiously moving to mend ties frayed by historical disputes.“We hope that Japan will show a mature attitude to start anew its relations with neighboring countries” including South Korea, Park said.Park also pressed Japan to address the issue of the elderly Korean women who were forced to serve as sex slaves for Japan’s World War II soldiers ― one of the knottiest issues.“We may lose an opportunity forever to resolve the issue unless we address it now,” Park said, noting that time is running out as the number of victims still alive is dwindling.In 2007, more than 120 South Korean victims were alive, but the number has dropped to 47, with their average age standing at nearly 90.By Song Sang-ho and news reports (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","monday urged japanese prime minister ,history in his upcoming speech ,cabinet on friday abe speech ,governments apologies for japan wartime ,hye on monday urged japanese","['Park Geun - hye', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'japanese', 'Abe', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'Murayama Statement', 'Korea', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Abe ’s', 'Japan', 'Abe', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'Asahi Shimbun', 'Abe ’s', 'asian', 'Liberal Democratic Party', 'Komeito', 'Abe', 'Abe ’s', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Japan', 'Abe ’s', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Park', 'Japan', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Park', 'south korean', 'Song Sang - ho']",17,"[ 3.         10.          1.         ... -0.2666952   0.47482261

One of the teachers, a man in his 50s, approaches a female teacher in her 30s and invites her to dance the blues with him. She rejects, but the man does not take no for an answer and the playful approach turns into an ugly scuffle involving unwanted physical contact, buttons torn apart and the victim striking the attacker with a microphone. All of thishappened with around 10 of their colleagues watching, including the school principal.“I was so shocked when I finally hit (the attacker) with the mic and the principal grabbed me (from hitting him further),” the victim recently told local media, adding that the principal did nothing to prevent the harassment from happening in the first place. Members of a parents’ group hold a rally protesting the sexual harassment cases of a high school in Seoul in front of the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education in downtown Seoul last Thursday. YonhapThe principal of the school ― located in Seodaemun-gu, central Seoul ― attempted to hush up the incident, to which the teachers reluctantly agreed, according to an anonymous source claiming to have a personal connection to the principal. When the case finally came to light in May after another teacher reported it to the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education, it was found to be only one of hundreds of other sexual harassment cases alleged to have occurred at the school. Five male teachers ― including the principal ― were accused of being involved in verbal and physical harassment against some eight teachers and more than 100 students. After a two-month investigation, the SMOE filed charges against the teachers to the local police, who began investigating the case last week. The case also shed light on unchecked sex crimes at schools and the lack of preventive and reprimand measures.While the karaoke incident took place more than a year ago in February 2014, the offender got away with a slap on the wrist, by being put on sick leave for about a year before he was transferred to another school. As public outcry grew, the Prime Minister’s Office, the Education Ministry and the SMOE last week vowed a “zero tolerance” policy on sexual predators in schools, including a one-strike rule that would ban teachers convicted of a sex crime from teaching again.The revision will also include immediately removing a teacher accused of sexual abuse from his or her post, and mandating the school committee reach a decision on the punishment within 30 days, shortened from the current regulation of 60 days.The measures, however, invited more criticism for having come too late, while exposing how weak the anti-sex crime measures in school had been.Loopholes in the current law had been making it particularly hard to protect teachers from abuse. Relevant laws including the Act on the Prevention of and Countermeasures against Violence in Schools stipulate that a teacher who committed a sex crime against a minor can be fired immediately, but there is no such clause covering sex crimes against adults. Even in the case of a sex crime against a minor, the teacher can still retain his or her license unless he or she is sentenced with a fine of 1 million won or more.In addition, the law mandates the offender should be removed from the school only after the teacher is charged, meaning the alleged victim and the attacker could remain at the same school for several months.Punishment against those who committed sex crimes have also been criticized as being lenient. According to Education Ministry data revealed by Rep. Han Sun-kyo of the Saenuri Party, 231 teachers have received disciplinary actions from January 2011 to June this year. But more than half, or 123, are still teaching at schools.In January, an Incheon court sentenced an English teacher to a 10 million won ($8,600) fine for touching his 16-year-old student’s thigh because she was “not concentrating in class.” The court said it handed down a lighter punishment because the accused had no criminal record. “Repeat crimes are more common among sex criminals than others. This begs the question of whether it is okay to let sex offenders return to their teaching posts,” said Rep. Han.After the nationwide furor incited by the Seodaemun-gu school incident, the authorities vowed to change the law to allow immediate removal of all sex offenders and to ban anyone with a history of sex crime from becoming a teacher. The Education Ministry said it would implement a system where victims can directly report the sex crimes to the authorities.But teachers remain skeptical about whether the new measures will encourage victims to come forward.Some also questioned the legal jurisdiction of the new measures to be enforced by the administrative sector, as it could run counter to the presumption of innocence until found guilty by the judiciary.A 25-year-old teacher, who wished to remain anonymous, said she and her colleagues often felt “discomfort” at the actions of other teachers but have been reluctant to point them out.“If the accused can return to school at any time, who would want to alert the authorities?” she said. She added that even if the direct reporting system was implemented, the victims would be hard-pressed to place their faith on the anonymity that the system claims to provide.“A school is a small place. Everyone pretty much knows what went on between people, and it’s only a matter of time before word gets out that somebody blew the whistle,” she said.An official from the Korean Women’s Development Institute pointed out that while many of the sex crime cases in schools go through the school disciplinary committee, the school’s priority is often to downplay the case to protect its reputation.Teachers say the scariest element about school sex crimes is that repetition and tolerance may lead to misperception about what is right and wrong.The victimized teacher at the Seodaemun-gu school told local media that sexual harassment had become somewhat of a “culture” at the school. “At first, students were so shocked to hear about the (verbal harassment), but soon they became accustomed to it. Their perception of what was right and wrong was clouded, as (sex abuse) became the norm. I don’t know how we can fix that,” she said.

Colonial India’s last viceroy, Lord Louis Mountbatten of Britain, chose the second anniversary of Japan’s surrender in World War II in 1947 as the date to transfer power to the new Republic of India, ending 90 years of dominion. Unlike Japan, which forsook its 36-year occupation of Korea following a military defeat, Britain relinquished its colonial grip voluntarily as escalating anti-British uprisings threatened the viability of its imposed rule. Like Korea that was divided into the communist North and democratic South, India was partitioned into Muslim-dominated Pakistan and Hindu-dominated India in 1947, with nearly 1 million killed in the process.India’s Independence Day is celebrated relatively simply with a guard of honor for the prime minister, who delivers a speech on the ramparts of the Red Fort in Delhi ― a symbolic site of the Moghul Empire and the place where the Indian national flag was raised immediately after independence was gained. The speech is an address to the people and an agenda for the government for the year ahead.  Indian Ambassador Vikram Doraiswami Joel Lee / The Korea Herald“In last year’s address as a newly appointed prime minister, Narendra Modi set forth his vision of how he wants to transform the country,” Indian Ambassador Vikram Doraiswami told The Korea Herald on Wednesday at the embassy. “It included a number of special focus areas ― the ‘Clean India’ public health campaign, the ‘Make in India’ manufacturing campaign with foreign investment, the ‘Digital India’ campaign for the information technology sector, education and safety for the less privileged and women, job creation for youths, peaceful relations with neighbors, tourism and global economic partnerships ― all of which are highly relevant to the India-Korea relationship.”The newly appointed ambassador stressed that Modi has regarded Korea as a key partner for development “much more than Korea has given itself credit for.” When asked some seven years ago, when he was the chief minister of the Gujarat state in northwestern India, which country he viewed as a role model for India, Modi pointed to Korea, the ambassador noted. “Our prime minister has always believed that our partnership had not been tapped even to a partial degree given our potential,” Doraiswami said. “Modi is keen to engage Korea, which has begun to look beyond its immediate alliances with the U.S., China and Japan. If Korea looks further afield, logically, India would be one of the nearest strategic countries.”Doraiswami pointed to Modi’s “Act East” foreign policy, which aims for deeper integration with Asian countries to the east, inheriting the “Look East” policy initiative announced 20 years ago. To this end, Modi visited Korea in mid-May after China and Mongolia. “India and Korea have shared stakes in establishing a peaceful, stable and rule-based order in Asia and beyond, to allow safe and free flows of commerce in the maritime and aviation domains,” he argued. Regarding the legacy of the British Raj, Doraiswami said that although Indians’ view of the past was not always positive, they currently do not blame the British government or people through a prism of gloom, instead cherishing the partnership through the Commonwealth and international community based on the shared values of democracy, free market and rule-based world order. The Indian envoy emphasized that comparing the India-Britain relations and India-Pakistan relations to Korea-Japan relations and South Korea-North Korea relations should be done with caution and consideration of the different histories and circumstances. “Following Mahatma Gandhi’s message, we wanted the British to leave as friends,” he noted. “They left amicably, and we did not dwell on the past. We wanted to deal with Britain with a measure of our own confidence that we did not need history to tell us who we were.”The early development of the modern Commonwealth in the 1950s and ‘60s granted countries formerly under Britain’s tutelage equal footing and voices in an evenhanded power-sharing mechanism. This created a sense that the once-colonized and the colonizer had now become partners in liberating countries in Asia and Africa from their colonial shackles, according to the envoy. “We have excellent relations with Britain through diplomacy, commerce, culture and sports,” he underscored. “The U.K. government provided valuable guidance and assistance in setting up our democratic institutions and norms. India did not seek colonial reparations.”On the India-Pakistan relations, Doraiswami emphasized that “there is no desire to reverse history” of the partition, which took high human tolls on both sides. Unlike North and South Korea, which seek to reunite on their own terms, only marginal extremist groups in India and Pakistan endorse the reunification idea, he said. At the same time, the ambassador added, India is committed to a peaceful, stable and economically integrated regional order through the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation established in 1985, which includes India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives and Afghanistan. “Full utilization of the SAARC will increase trade between India and Pakistan substantially ― currently between $2.5 billion and $3 billion a year ― and form constituencies on both sides invested in peace and prosperity,” Doraiswami said. “Creating better trade avenues and access to each other’s markets and peoples is the best way of forging trust, which is the best way of resolving problems. This is similar to the Korean government’s efforts to enhance trust with North Korea.”By Joel Lee (joellee@heraldcorp.com)","second anniversary of japan surrender ,korea following military defeat britain ,15 colonial india last viceroy ,britain chose the second anniversary ,of korea following military defeat","['India', 'Korea', 'Colonial India ’s', 'Louis Mountbatten', 'Britain', 'Japan', 'Republic of India', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Britain', 'british', 'Korea', 'India', 'Muslim', 'Pakistan', 'Hindu', 'India', 'India', 'the Red Fort', 'Delhi', 'indian', 'indian', 'Vikram Doraiswami', 'Lee', 'Narendra Modi', 'indian', 'Vikram Doraiswami', 'the Korea Herald', 'India', 'India', 'Modi', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Gujarat', 'India', 'India', 'Modi', 'Korea', 'Doraiswami', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'India', 'asian', 'Modi', 'Korea', 'China', 'Mongolia', 'India', 'Korea', 'British', 'Doraiswami', 'Indians', 'british', 'Commonwealth', 'indian', 'India', 'Britain', 'India', 'Pakistan', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Mahatma Gandhi ’s', 'British', 'Britain', 'Commonwealth', 'Britain', 'Britain', 'U.K.', 'India', 'India', 'Pakistan', 'Doraiswami', 'North and South Korea', 'India', 'Pakistan', 'India', 'the south Asian Association for Regional Cooperation', 'India', 'Pakistan', 'Sri Lanka', 'Bangladesh', 'Nepal', 'Bhutan', 'Maldives', 'Afghanistan', 'India', 'Pakistan', 'Doraiswami', 'korean', 'North Korea', 'Joel Lee']",10,"[ 1.          4.          1.         ... -0.63073993  0.5775938

Eric Badger, a Pentagon spokesperson, said in response to a Yonhap News Agency question why the number spiked.Badger also noted that while the Pentagon has responsibility for the primary labs affected, the Centers for Disease Control tracks secondary labs.

But it was also cited as a major factor causing human atrocities, including massacres and bullying. What do we do when someone we love, or someone who belongs to our family or community, causes harm to the lives of strangers? Such questions entered my mind as the congresswomen of the ruling Saenuri Party have been collectively silent over the rape allegations against their fellow party lawmaker Sim Hag-bong this week.Further, it led to questions over whether it was unfair to demand politicians to fight against this particular human nature in such a case of an alleged crime, leastwise an ethical lapse.Rep. Kim Eul-dong (above) is one of the ruling Saenuri Pary`s congresswomen who have been collectively silent over the rape allegations against their fellow party lawmaker Sim Hag-bong. (Yonhap)Sim is facing sex crime allegations made by a female insurance planner in her 40s, who first claimed that the lawmaker raped her in a hotel room in Daegu. While Sim admitted to having had intercourse during business hours, he claimed it was consensual. The alleged victim later recanted her testimony saying that she had “not resisted as forcefully as she could have,” prompting speculation of an attempt on Sim’s part to cover up the case. As public outcry grew against the police for dropping the case, the prosecution announced Wednesday it would reinvestigate the claims.The female politicians of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy have been taking to the podium, releasing statements calling for Sim’s resignation from his lawmaker’s seat.While even some Saenuri Party members have voiced no tolerance toward the allegation, absent from the whole scene were the female members of party, who were previously extremely vocal against sex crime allegations among politicians of other parties.One of the silent Saenuri congresswomen is the current Gender Equality Minister Kim Hee-jung.It is not the first time they remained silent over sex crime allegations against their allied male politicians. The women lawmakers made no public statements when Park Hee-tae, a former National Assembly speaker, faced sexual assault allegations made by a 23-year-old female caddie working at a golf club last year.Some may say staying silent is not an act of unfairness. But as Desmond Tutu famously pointed out, when one is neutral in situations of injustice, he or she has chosen the side of the oppressor. As human nature, we want to fit in with the tribe we belong to. Yet, lawmakers are asked to make themselves an exception, as their duty is to be involved with the lives of others -- strangers who do not belong to their family or their community. Their job is to work beyond their self-interests. In this case, the female members of the conservative party can be seen as particularly cowardly for keeping mum on issues that otherwise would have taken center stage in their privileged platform of gender equality and female-related policies.It’s impossible for them to not realize the seriousness of the Sim Hag-bong’s case and the allegations made against him, although everyone is innocent until proven guilty.To have the intellect to realize what’s going on but lack the ethics to care and speak out on the concerns is an act of injustice on the lawmakers’ part. Their job is not to care for their fellow lawmakers, but to serve the public -- by recognizing mistakes of our times and making efforts so they aren’t repeated. By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","sex crime allegations among politicians ,major factor causing human atrocities ,male politicians the women lawmakers ,rape allegations against their fellow ,causing human atrocities including massacres","['Saenuri Party', 'Sim hag - bong', 'Kim Eul - dong', 'Saenuri Pary`s', 'Sim hag - bong', 'yonhap)sim', 'Daegu', 'Sim', 'Sim ’s', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Sim ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri', 'Gender', 'Kim Hee - jung', 'Park Hee - tae', 'National Assembly', 'Desmond Tutu', 'Sim hag - bong', 'Claire Lee']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68228573  0.15795681

It was the first investigation by the joint working group at the base since the Pentagon announced in May that live samples of the lethal bacterium were sent from a U.S. military laboratory to laboratories in nine U.S. states and the American military base in South Korea. A U.S. probe confirmed later that 86 American and foreign labs had received the anthrax spores, which were not completely inactive. ""This joint working group will continue to ensure reliability and transparency of the ROK-U.S. capabilities to defend the Republic of Korea,"" USFK Maj. Gen. Robert Hedelund, who heads the U.S. side of the joint team, said of the base inspection. He vowed the joint working group's continued investigative efforts, saying, ""I am confident that this JWG will build on the progress we have made as an alliance since the date of the incident.""The sample was brought in as part of the USFK's regular training exercises against biochemical weapons, called JUPITR, amid growing threats from North Korea's biochemical weapons.The allies will work together to review the biological defense programs ""to ensure these programs continue in a safe and effective manner,"" the USFK said in a statement.The focus of Thursday's inspection was on the procedures for the sample's shipment and its disposal, as well as the Osan lab's anti-biochemical weapons tests, according to a Defense Ministry official.The joint team also reportedly collected samples from the lab's facilities to see if there's any residue of the live anthrax spores, he added.

Individual schools should have the final say-so when it comes to deciding education-related changes,” said the 71-year-old educator, who spent over 40 years as a teacher and education reformer in the provincial town of Geochang, South Gyeongsang Province.For decades, Geochang High School has gained nationwide fame under Chun’s auspices for its unorthodox methods that encompasses a strong character-building process, while enjoying its share of success in being among the nation’s top high schools in college admission process as well.In the 1990s, the tiny school in rural Korea was put on the map after then-President Kim Young-sam praised Chun for the success of his school.  Chun Sung-eun (Yoon Min-sik/The Korea Herald)Chun has been one of most outspoken opponents of South Korea’s top-down education system. In Korea, schools in 17 provinces and cities across the country are under the supervision of their education offices, which are in turn are supervised by the Education Ministry. The curricular revision, textbook authorization and pursuit of major education policies are decided by the authorities and relayed back to schools in a top-down manner.The hierarchy, which the system is based on, hinders the education reform process, he argued. Added to that, Korean parents’ education fever is legendary. On the coattails of the government rolling out its plans for character building education, private institutes for character building have popped up, scurrying to catch the attention of the zealous parents.Chun said this was the side effect of a defective education system, which has all of the students racing toward a single goal: getting accepted at a prestigious university. Instead of evaluating each student’s talents and needs, the education system lines them up in an order based on their test grades.“Our education has pushed children into a pit of constantly escalating competition. Parents had no choice as their children’s success is only based on school grades,” he said. “This is a sin committed by our education on the people of Korea.”Tackling relatively minor issues like “character education” will do little to change this culture of competition, he said. “Since Korea’s liberation in 1945, there has never been a real education policy on the Korean peninsula,” he said, adding that the only way is to completely change how we approach education. According to Chun, the relationship between the school and the ministry should be on equal footings in which the authorities can provide support for each individual school instead of dictating how they should be operated. “The discord between education policymakers and those in the field is due to the ministry’s excessive control,” he said. “Schools and teachers should have the liberty to design their own plans on how to teach their subjects.”Korea’s college evaluation, for example, has come under criticism for making higher education institutes into de facto cram schools for seeking jobs. Major criteria in the reform involves the employment rate of schools’ graduates, which results in the institutes shutting down departments that have low employment rates, like those in humanities.Chun said evaluation should not be conducted by authorities, who have the power to control schools’ budgets. Instead independent assessment bodies should evaluate the teachers and schools. Chun called it the “triangle model” of education ― independent evaluation, the ministry’s support and each school dictating how to operate itself.The model was devised when the former principal was working as the inaugural head of the Presidential Committee on Education Innovation, formed in 2003 by then-President Roh Moo-hyun. The “admission officer program,” which has universities evaluate students on not just grades, but various other qualities, was a brainchild of the committee.The point of the program was to ensure that admission offices would get to assess what each student is good at, rather than looking at his or her test scores. An ideal way is to get students to create a portfolio in the admission process, which would contain one’s curricular and extracurricular activities, Chun said.Chun said the school system should be more about just going to a top-tier school in the next phase. Elementary level education should be about letting children find out what they are good at; secondary education should help students judge which policies are the most beneficial to themselves.Over the past few years, there has been a debate in Korea about whether teachers should remain politically neutral. “A democratic society allows all members to state what they believe in. As long as secondary education helps students have critical views of policies, teachers should be able to make political statements,” he said.Higher education, finally, should be about maximizing the students’ talents and potential, he concluded.Basically education has to be about preparing students for their future, which includes helping them to choose their prospective careers, he said. As principal of Geochang High School, Chun and his colleagues introduced the so-called “10 commandments of choosing a job,” which went viral across the country soon after.Among the ideas promoted are urging students to choose the job they are needed in, instead of one that they desire to work in. It also encourages students to seek new frontiers and not to let low wage, lack of promotion or social status discourage them from searching for their goal.But the efforts by his school was not enough, Chun said. “All I could do was arm my students mentally,” he said.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","education reform is impossible without ,presidential committee on education innovation ,criticism for making higher education ,schools for seeking jobs major ,parents education fever is legendary","['the Education Ministry', 'Chun Sung - eun', 'Geochang High School', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'the Education Ministry', 'Geochang', 'Geochang High School', 'Chun', 'Korea', 'Kim Young - sam', 'Chun', 'Chun Sung - eun', 'Yoon Min - sik', 'the Korea herald)chun', 'South Korea ’s', 'Korea', 'the Education Ministry', 'korean', 'Chun', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Chun', 'Chun', 'Chun', 'the Presidential Committee on Education Innovation', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Chun', 'Chun', 'Korea', 'Geochang High School', 'Chun', 'Chun']",11,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.20619057  0.42350155

All the pills illegally being sold online and off-line without a prescription as of May were counterfeit and not confirmed to be safe, according to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety.(Yonhap)According to a poll of 1,500 men who have taken medication to treat their erectile dysfunction, 1,015 people, or 67.7 percent of the surveyed, said they had obtained the pills illegally without a prescription. Of the 1,015 people who illegally purchased the pills, 67.6 percent said that they could “easily” access the drugs. Nearly 20 percent said they were reluctant to go to hospitals to obtain a prescription to treat impotence. In Korea, medications to treat erectile dysfunction, including Viagra and Cialis, can only be purchased with a valid prescription from a doctor due to safety issues. Led by the Korea Institute of Drug Safety & Risk Management, the survey is based on telephone interviews conducted from May to July in 2013 with 1,500 adults throughout the nation.The younger generation was more likely to seek fake erectile dysfunction pills, according to the poll.Those in their 20s and 30s respectively had experience with fake Viagra pills three and two times more than men in their 60s, the study showed without revealing exact numbers.Asked how the men accessed the pills, eight in 10 people said they obtained the drugs through a friend. About 8 percent of the respondents said they bought them online and 7.4 percent from sex shops. The survey also showed that six of 10 men suffering from side effects of the impotence pills were found to have taken counterfeit drugs, raising concerns over the safety of cheap fake medication for impotence. The fake drugs were found to contain excessive doses of sildenafil or tadalafil, which can heighten risks for heart attack and myocardial infarction.  Despite safety concerns, Korea has seen a growing amount of counterfeit drugs for impotence smuggled in from China. The National Tax Service detected 1,443 cases of smuggled impotence medicine worth 584 billion won ($500 million) in total from 2010 to 2014, hitting an all-time high last year with 668 cases.The study was published in the latest journal for Korean College of Clinical Pharmacy.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","sunday all the pills illegally ,the pills illegally without prescription ,illegally purchased the pills 67 ,all the pills illegally ,with fake viagra pills three","['South Korea', 'the Ministry of Food and Drug safety.(yonhap)accorde', 'Korea', 'Cialis', 'the Korea Institute of Drug Safety & Risk Management', 'Korea', 'China', 'the National Tax Service', 'Korean College of Clinical Pharmacy', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",1,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.84383768  0.38024843

If we find that the school attempted to conceal or downplay the incidents, it will be held responsible,” said Kim Hyeong-nam, a member of the SMOE audit team.The SMOE, which pledged severe punishment for those confirmed of their crimes, also came under fire for having mismanaged the situation until the case was reported to the police and eventually the prosecution by one of the victim’s parents.According to SMOE, the string of sexual violence cases started in February 2014. Some 130 students and eight teachers have so far testified to being sexual harassed.One of the accused, a 50-something teacher, for instance, allegedly made sexual advances on a female teacher in her 30s during the faculty’s dinner outing despite her vehement protests, ripping off her clothes in the process. The victim has claimed that her request for a reprimand against the teacher was repeatedly ignored.The supposed offender was placed on sick leave for about a year and transferred to another school in March, where he is still teaching. The decision to transfer a teacher to another school can only be finalized by the SMOE in case of high schools. The principal told local media that he phoned the city education office before transferring the teacher in question, fueling suspicion that the situation was overlooked by the authorities.“We are currently trying to figure out when exactly the SMOE found out about (the sexual harassment cases),” Kim said.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","sexually harassing their female colleagues ,hundred victims the school principal ,male teachers at seoul ,sexual advances on female teacher ,investigation on five teachers at","['Seoul', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education', 'Seoul', 'Kim Hyeong - nam', 'smoe', 'SMOE', 'SMOE', 'SMOE', 'SMOE', 'Kim', 'Yoon Min - sik']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23199959 -0.0431759

""When Prime Minister Abe came here in April, we had expected him to make remarks on historical issues, but we generally feel that (what he said) was a little insufficient,"" a senior South Korean official said on condition of anonymity.

The victims have demanded $20 million in punitive damages each, for the wartime atrocities committed by Japan and its firms, and also for their continued denial of forcing South Korean women into sexual enslavement.“The Japanese government is practically insulting those victims by calling them voluntary prostitutes,” said Kim Hyung-jin, a lawyer for the victims, at a news conference held in Washington. “It is like calling the prisoners in Auschwitz as ‘voluntary workers,’” he said.The victims are among a dozen Korean victims who had announced in June that they would take Japan to court in the U.S. if Tokyo did not make a sincere apology by the end of that month.U.S. lawmaker Mike Honda (left), a longtime supporter of the victims of Japan’s wartime sexual enslavement, and Lee Yong-su, one of the Korean victims, hug at a ceremony to mark the eighth anniversary of the passage of a U.S. congressional resolution on former sex slaves, in the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington on Tuesday. (Yonhap)They planned to take legal action in the U.S. because their previous attempts to make Japan apologize failed in South Korea and Japan. Victims have won similar cases in Seoul, but South Korean courts have no execution power to force Japan to deliver an apology or provide compensation. Also, they can hardly win the case in Tokyo, the lawyer told a local newspaper. Though the U.S. court has no jurisdiction over crimes committed by Japan, the suit in itself has significance as they were illegal acts against humanity that goes beyond jurisdiction or statute of limitation, the lawyer had explained.The legal case was filed at a court in California on the same day U.S. lawmakers marked the eighth anniversary of a landmark 2007 House of Representatives resolution urging Japan to acknowledge and take responsibility for its atrocities committed during the World War II.On the 8th anniversary of the landmark resolution, Rep, Mike Honda urged Japan to learn from Germany by institutionalizing a legal tool that makes it a crime to deny wartime historical facts.“We know that German Chancellor Merkel has told Abe when he visited Germany, ‘You know, we faced our past and we made our apologies. In fact, I think we even have a law in Germany that if you say that the death camps did not exist, you will be fined for a violation of a law there,’” he said during an event held to mark the resolutions anniversary.During a weeklong visit to the U.S. in April, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe failed to apologize to victims of Japan’s wartime atrocities.The Japanese leader is expected to issue another statement next month to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.“Prime Minister Abe has the historic opportunity to take leadership and doing something and saying, ‘You are right. We were wrong. We apologize. We will pass a law that says our textbooks will teach our youngsters what happened in the past so it won’t happen in the future,’” said Honda.U.S. House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi also said Abe should make a clearer statement on the country’s sexual slavery of women during the war. In a meeting with South Korean lawmakers, Pelosi said she regrets that Abe has not made a clear statement on the issue, according to Rep. Na Kyung-won, chairwoman of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee.

Though Japan later said it still stands by the apology, the move was seen as an attempt to undermine the apology's credibility. His government also came under strong criticism last year after pressuring an American publisher to revise a description of the sexual slavery issue in a school history textbook in an apparent attempt to water down the atrocity.""Prime Minister Abe has been hearing from scholars, saying, 'It did happen, prime minister. Don't change the history books of other countries,'"" Honda said. ""Prime Minister Abe has to learn that to be a good leader in a democratic country, you have to accept historical responsibility. You have to do the hard things.""The congressmen also stressed that time is running short for the surviving victims.""We only have 49 halmonies (grandmothers) that are at the House of Sharing in Korea and there are others in other countries that are waiting for an apology from the government of Japan.

Starting from Monday, the National Assembly’s Intelligence Committee will begin a session to hear from the National Intelligence Service’s top officials, including its chief Lee Byung-ho, about the result of the agency’s internal investigation. The NIS has been recovering the deleted data of its official who committed suicide earlier this month over the burgeoning scandal. The main political parties are expected to lock horns over the sufficiency of the spy agency’s internal probe to dispel the widespread public suspicion over the NIS’ civilian surveillance. The ruling Saenuri Party has been urging the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy to accept the results and accused it of politicizing the sensitive matter involving national security. The NPAD, for its part, is expected to launch a full-fledged blame game by criticizing the ruling bloc for protecting the spy agency citing widespread public distrust and a number of lingering suspicions of an alleged cover-up by the NIS, particularly over the death of its agent. The agent was found dead in his car in an apparent suicide after having deleted relevant records on his computer. Lawmakers of the ruling Saenuri Party and the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy. (Yonhap)“I understand the NIS has recovered 100 percent of the delated files and are analyzing what it has retrieved,” said Rep. Moon Jeong-lim, floor speaker of Saenuri Party. “The NIS should come forward and tell the people exactly what happened without an ounce of doubt. I am confident they will,” said Moon. “Besides, given the threat from North Korea’s cyberattack, we need to stop compromising our cyberwarfare capability and discouraging those dedicated to enhancing the capability. NPAD should refrain from seeking political gains (over the hacking scandal),” added Moon.NPAD, however, demanded the agency go extra miles to prove that it had not engaged in any irregularities. The opposition urged the spy agency to submit some 30 documents, including all log files of the Remote Control System, a software that can tap into mobile phone. The opposition asserted that the files would be the best way for the NIS to clear wiretapping charges as they recorded data about how the hacking device was being used. NIS has refused to disclose the files, citing it might contain sensitive national security information.“We expect sincere cooperation from the NIS during a parliamentary session to hear from the officials,” said Rep. Kang Hee-yong, NPAD vice spokesman in a statement. “We will treat the session as a de facto parliamentary hearing. We are committed to getting to the bottom of the scandal,” said Kang. “If the NIS refuses to change its attitude toward the scandal, it will face a full-fledged national inspection and special prosecution. We urged NIS and Saenuri Party to help us reveal any wrongdoings and bring the nation back on track,” said Kang. The hacking allegations are expected to be discussed at three other parliamentary committees opening this month including the communications committee, defense committee and security committee.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","the hacking scandal added moon ,computer files starting from monday ,hacking program to wiretap civilians ,nation spy agency purchased hacking ,month over the burgeoning scandal","['the National Assembly ’s Intelligence Committee', 'the National Intelligence Service ’s', 'Lee Byung - ho', 'NIS', 'NIS', 'Saenuri Party', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'NIS', 'Saenuri Party', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Yonhap)“I', 'NIS', 'Moon Jeong - lim', 'Saenuri Party', 'NIS', 'Moon', 'North Korea ’s', 'Moon', 'the Remote Control System', 'NIS', 'NIS', 'NIS', 'Kang Hee - yong', 'NPAD', 'Kang', 'NIS', 'NIS', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kang', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27317572  0.39254063

As the secretary said, it was a serious mistake. It should never have happened. It's an inexcusable mistake. We're taking the actions to correct it,"" Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Frank Kendall told reporters.  Kendall made the remark during a briefing on the outcome of an investigation into the erroneous shipments of live anthrax samples to 86 laboratories in 20 states, Washington, D.C., and seven foreign countries, including South Korea's Osan Air Base in Pyeongtaek, south of Seoul.  ""It was an unintended delivery. It was anthrax that was believed to be inactivated and not live and not able to be grown went to an air force base in Korea to a laboratory on that base for testing there. I don't think it ever would have gone anywhere else,"" Kendall said.  The official stressed that the U.S. had intended to deliver inactivated anthrax spores as part of efforts to make sure that the country is ""in a position to protect people in the case of an anthrax attack in Korea or anywhere else if we ship it.""  Kendall said the U.S. has no intent to resume anthrax shipments, but even if it does, it would consult Korea.  ""I can't speculate about what may happen in the future. Anything that we did do, I can assure you, though would be done in consultation with the Korean government, and there is a task force now working with the Korean government to investigate the specific events that happened at Osan,"" he said.  When the case surfaced in late May, U.S. Forces Korea said the sample delivered to Osan was destroyed after it was suspected of being live, but 22 civilian and military personnel ""may have been exposed"" and were given emergency treatment, though none of them showed any signs of exposure.  It said the sample was brought in for a training exercise aimed at testing field equipment and new systems designed to identify toxins and pathogens. North Korea is believed to be capable of cultivating various types of biological agents, such as anthrax, and producing them into biological weapons.  On Thursday, the U.S. Department of Defense unveiled a report after a 30-day investigation into the case.  It blamed ""inherent deficiencies"" in protocols for killing anthrax spores, claiming that ""a single root cause"" for the accident could not be identified and that the Department of Defense personnel correctly followed their own protocols -- albeit lacking -- to make anthrax samples inactive before shipments.  ""A key finding by the committee is that there is insufficient technical information in the broader scientific community to guide the development of thoroughly effective protocols for inactivation of spores and viability testing of (Bacillus anthracis),"" the report said.  ""This has contributed to the creation of protocols that do not completely or permanently sterilize BA with gamma irradiation. The absence of this critical information is a scientific communitywide problem and needs to be addressed with irradiation standards and viability testing procedures,"" it said.  The report said that the investigative committee found ""inherent deficiencies"" in protocols for the production of inactive spores that could lead to non-sterile products for three phases -- radiation dosing, viability testing and contamination prevention.   The report said that the anthrax samples contained low numbers of live spores and ""did not pose a risk to the general public.""Nonetheless, the shipment of live samples is a ""serious breach of regulations,"" the report said.  Thursday's report only made a series of usual recommendations, such as enhancing quality control programs at Department of Defense laboratories, making labs follow a common procedure for irradiation and viability testing, and establishing quality control procedures for inactivation and viability testing of anthrax spores.  U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter apologized for the incident and promised to take proper actions to prevent a recurrence when he met with South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-koo on the sidelines of an annual security forum in Singapore.   South Korea and the U.S. have also formed a joint working group to investigate the incident.   The case has also given rise to calls for revising the Status of Forces Agreement, which stipulates the legal rights and obligations of some 28,500 American troops stationed in South Korea, in a way that requires the U.S. military to notify the host nation in advance before bringing in such hazardous materials.  Anthrax is a lethal disease caused by Bacillus anthracis, but the term is commonly used to refer to the causative agent itself.In 2001, anthrax-laced letters were mailed to U.S. news media and Senate offices and killed five people.  Following the Thursday report, USFK vowed efforts to ensure its biological defense programs with South Korea be continued in a safe and effective manner.   ""Alliance biological defense programs are designed to enhance Alliance readiness and defensive capabilities in the face of a very real and significant biological threat,"" USFK commander Gen. Curtis M. Scaparrotti was quoted as saying in a separate USFK press release in Seoul.   Under the program, the allies conduct annual exercises to enhance combat readiness against North Korea's biochemical weapons.  ""The establishment of the ROK-U.S. Alliance's Biological Defense Cooperation Joint Working Group will ensure continued cooperation on biological defense programs,"" Scaparrotti said.

217,217,Military service conundrum for overseas Korean athletes,"A recent legal battle over the military duties of golfer Bae Sang-moon here brought back to surface years-old debate about how much consideration should be given to South Korean athletes playing overseas postponing the mandatary services for the sake of their careers.Early Wednesday, the Daegu District Court backed the Military Manpower Administration, the local conscription agency, on its decision not to extend an o...","A recent legal battle over the military duties of golfer Bae Sang-moon here brought back to surface years-old debate about how much consideration should be given to South Korean athletes playing overseas postponing the mandatary services for the sake of their careers.Early Wednesday, the Daegu District Court backed the Military Manpower Administration, the local conscription agency, on its decision not to extend an overseas travel permit for Bae, currently staying in Canada to participate in the PGA Tour Canada. The MMA had filed charges against Bae for violating the Military Service Act, which stipulates that any person subject to military conscription and whose travel permit has expired must return to Korea. The public’s interest erupted at the news, and the 29-year-old golfer became one of the most frequently searched keywords on Naver and Daum, Korea’s biggest search engines. Within hours, Bae ― once hell-bent on postponing the enlistment ― threw in the towel.“I respect the decision of the court, and will honor it humbly. I feel that returning home and fulfilling my military duties as soon as I can will help me mature further as a golfer,” said Bae, who has two PGA wins under his belt. He reiterated that he never intended to dodge his services and wanted only to improve his career. Bae Sang-moon (Yonhap)The golfer’s case showed that military services remain a thorny issue for Korean athletes playing overseas. Since the 1950-53 Korean War ceased in an armistice, the two Koreas remain technically at war. As such, all able-bodied Korean men are required by law to serve in the military for at least 21 months between ages 18 and 35. The service period varies according to branches: 21 months for the Army and the Marine Corp., 23 for the Navy and 24 for the Air Force.Spending two years in the barracks is taxing for anyone not looking to pursue a career in the military, but it presents a bigger challenge for athletes as it coincides with the prime of their careers.As an option for athletes to continue their playing careers, Korean law allows them to join Korea Armed Forces Athletic Corps. The KAFAC teams ― covering most major sports including soccer, baseball and basketball ― compete in division 2 leagues or with college leagues. This allows players to hone their athletic skills during their service, although the limited roster means only a handful of players are able to benefit from the system.But for players competing overseas, a two-year absence from their respective leagues posts hurdles in their careers.Choo Shin-soo, an outfielder for the Texas Rangers, is one Korean athlete who recently wrestled with his military duties. In 2010, the then 28-year-old baseball player was running out of options as the military duty loomed over him.The two-year absence would have severely affected his career, as he was on the verge of blossoming into a star. His then-team, the Cleveland Indians, was also concerned. Choo confirmed in a TV interview the rumors that the Indians suggested Choo apply for U.S. citizenship.  Choo Shin-soo (AP-Yonhap)Fortunately for Choo, his concern was taken care of when the Korean national team won the gold at the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games later that year. Korea’s conscription law states that those who have contributed significantly to the nation through athletic or artistic skills are exempt from military duties, although they must go through four weeks of combat training. The law was implemented in 1981 and revised in 1984 and 1990. It applies to athletes who win a medal in an Olympics event or those receiving the top ranking at an international sporting competition where 15 or more countries are participating.The law was later revised again in the 2000s. When the Korean men’s soccer team made the improbable trip to the semifinals of the 2002 FIFA World Cup, the government decided to revise the conscription law to exempt anyone who has advanced to the knock-out stages of the World Cup from military duty. Another clause was added to the conscription law to give the same benefit to the men’s baseball team in the 2006 World Baseball Classic, which also reached the semifinals.Players like soccer player Park Ji-sung ― a key player in Korea’s 2002 World Cup run at the age of 21 ― were left free to roam the international stage without worrying about military duties.But talks of favoritism forced the authorities to remove both clauses in 2007. Since 2008, the conscription law only exempts athletes who win a medal at an Olympics event or finish first in competition at the Asian Games.Regardless of the exemption, conscription of players advancing overseas has always been a source of heated debate, with things not ending in such an amicable fashion for some. While the fans’ support for Korea’s treasured players advancing overseas and broadening their career and Korea’s sports recognition is high, the public’s susceptibility to condemn any inkling of an attempt to dodge the demanding military service is equally prevalent, making the matter difficult to solve.In 2001, Korean-born baseball player Baek Cha-seung in the U.S. was accused of attempting to dodge military duties when he refused to return to Korea after his travel permit expired. He was moving back and forth between the major and minor leagues at the time. Four years later, he renounced his Korean citizenship and became a U.S. citizen.Baek recently claimed that he never intended to dodge military service and had only acquired U.S. citizenship to continue playing baseball, but it was well after he was labeled a “draft dodger” by the public.Similar criticism befell once-prominent prospect Park Chu-young in 2012. The then 27-year-old forward for Arsenal in the English Premier League had obtained a 10-year residency in Monaco ― where he played for two years ― which allowed him to delay his service until he turned 37.  Park Chu-young(Yonhap)Park eventually was exempt from military service after the Korean team grabbed a bronze medal at the 2012 London Olympics. But the public was not pleased by the fact that a player once hailed as Korean soccer’s golden boy used a loophole in the law to avoid military duties, and the subsequent furor pressured the MMA to revise the law.“According to the regulation at the time, people could acquire travel permits a year after they got the green card. But now it takes three years to get the permit,” said an MMA official.The revision had directly influenced Bae, who got the U.S. green card in 2013. He was previously permitted to stay abroad on a clause that allows students of tertiary education institutes to postpone their services until the age of 29.Although Bae said he will join the military, the MMA has already filed charges against him for his refusal to return to Korea in December 2014. Local police will investigate him within 30 days of his return.While Bae’s case is nearing the end, the military issue continues to provide hurdles for other Koreans pursuing athletic careers outside of Korea.Several English clubs, including Liverpool, are rumored to be eyeing Son Heung-min, the Bayer Leverkusen attacker and one of the country’s brightest young star soccer players. But supporters of Liverpool have expressed concerns about acquiring a player who might miss two years in his prime due to conscription.“If Son is required to enlist in 2020, this would mean that Liverpool would potentially only have access to his talents for four seasons ― the risks beyond this would be that any resale value of an inactive Son would plummet,” wrote Jack Lusby, a writer for “This is Anfield,” an independent Liverpool Football Club supporters’ website.

In recent years, the crimes of distributing sexually explicit videos along with the victims’ personal information online have been rising in South Korea. In some cases, victims’ jobs, college, major and even names are revealed, leaving an indelible stain on them. However, it is still not easy to catch the criminals with current investigation techniques. Even if they are caught, the punishment is mild compared to victims’ suffering. The program is also set to cover upgrading hidden camera crimes. Criminals increasingly distribute videos, secretly taken, on porn sites rather than simply collecting them. This becomes a serious social issue as most victims are not aware that their videos are distributed online. Even if they find out them, it is still almost impossible to completely delete the video online. There is even a category named “Stealing a Peek” on porn sites where such videos are featured.“PD Notebook” is set to tell what motivates people to commit such crimes and how to prevent them in the upcoming episode, which airs on Tuesday at 11:15 p.m.The program is noteworthy for its role in stimulating the U.S. beef protest and raising questions over scientist Hwang Woo-suk’s subsequently discredited stem cell cloning.By Shin Ji-hye (shinjh@heraldcorp.com)","new light on revenge porn ,crimes criminals increasingly distribute videos ,criminals increasingly distribute videos secretly ,revenge porn sexually explicit video ,stealing peek on porn sites","['MBC)MBC ’s', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Hwang Woo - suk ’s', 'Shin Ji - hye']",1,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.5393815  -0.08118626

South Korea has kept a small police detachment on the islets since 1954.  ""The territorial issue over our sovereign territory of the Northern Territories and Takeshima still remains unresolved,"" the paper said, using the Japanese names for the Kuril Islands and Dokdo.  It is the 11th straight year the annual paper has included such claims together with maps marking Dokdo as Japanese territory.  Shortly after the report's release, South Korea's defense ministry called in Army Col. Nobuhisa Goto, a defense attache at the Japanese Embassy in Seoul, to lodge a protest with the Japanese government.  ""The Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of Korea strongly remonstrates about the 2015 defense white paper which projected our own territory of Dokdo as Japan's territory and marked it as part of Japan's domain on the related map while also drawing an unagreed-upon line for the Exclusive Economic Zone there,"" the ministry said in a statement.  It ""resolutely urges prompt action to correct them and measures not to repeat such unjust behavior,"" it added.  The Foreign Ministry also issued a statement denouncing the latest report as a ""provocation"" in the year the two countries mark the 50th anniversary of the normalization of bilateral ties.  The renewed claim amounts to ""an act denying the history of invasion of the Korean Peninsula of Japan's past imperialism"" and Tokyo's own admission that it has an incorrect perception of history, the statement said.  ""Our government will respond firmly to any provocation by Japan with regard to Dokdo, which is clearly our sovereign territory historically, geographically and under international law,"" it said.  The ministry delivered its own protest to Kenji Kanasugi, a minister at the Japanese Embassy, after calling him in to meet with Lee Sang-deok, director-general of the Northeast Asian affairs bureau.  During the meeting, Lee demanded the Japanese government delete the references to Dokdo from the white paper and prevent similar actions in the future, according to a ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity.  ""(He) pointed out that continuing such actions is of no help to South Korea-Japan relations at an important time when we are working to improve bilateral ties and called for Japan's prudent response,"" the official said.  Tensions between the two countries have eased somewhat in recent weeks, spurring speculation of a trilateral summit with China in the coming months.  Last month, Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se visited Tokyo to mark the 50-year anniversary and hold talks with his Japanese counterpart, Fumio Kishida. It was the first visit to Japan by Seoul's top diplomat in more than four years.  Earlier this month, Japan listed a package of early industrial sites as UNESCO world heritage after accepting South Korea's demand that it acknowledge its use of Korean slave labor at some of them.

The two cultural artifacts were passed through Korean customs as they were mistakenly appraised as copied antiques.As South Korean cultural artifacts were looted by Japan during its 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula, Seoul has been making efforts to reclaim them.But South Korea's decision to return one of the statues to Japan came as Seoul's prosecutors concluded that there is no proof that the statue was illegally moved to the neighboring country and no one in South Korea has claimed ownership of it.A diplomatic source said that the South Korean government delivered the statue to Japanese officials earlier in the day. It will be transported via airplane later Friday, according to the source.Experts said the statue, which was crafted in the 8th century during the Unified Silla period, was presumed to have been moved to Japan through either cultural exchanges or looting during the Japanese invasion of Korea, known as the Imjin War (1592-1598).Japan is also demanding Seoul return the other Buddhist statue, which was presumed to have been made in the 14th century during the Koryo Dynasty (918-1392) and was designated by Japan as an intangible cultural asset.The decision to return it has been delayed due to the need for further investigation. The South Korean Buddhists' society has been seeking to reclaim the artifact, saying that it might have been stolen from a temple located in Seosan, some 151 kilometers south of Seoul.

(Yonhap)The weir was constructed in 1988 to control the water level, control water flow and prevent floods. It also aimed at playing a security role in preventing underwater infiltration by North Korean spies. Since last month, algal bloom spread has been detected in the Hangang River, with the Seoul Metropolitan Government issuing an algal bloom warning on June 30 in the downstream section. The government expanded the alert later to nearly all sections of the river in the capital. It was the first such warning in 15 years.The green tide poses harmful ecological impacts as it hinders the water flow and causes odors. It also contains toxic substances such as microcystin-LR, which can cause respiratory problems or even paralysis in humans. While the continuous drought and high temperatures are generally suspected as the main causes, some experts argue that Singok weir is actually a major culprit behind the green tide, citing the unusual starting point of the algae. “If there’s enough water flow, the problematic phenomenon does not occur. The algal bloom usually starts from the Paldang Dam in Gyeonggi Province and spreads to the Hangang River. This time, however, the green tide started from downstream where the weir is located,” said KFEM director Lee Sae-gul. According to the city government, the green tide was first concentrated in the 5-kilometer-long section around the Singok weir, spanning from Haengju Bridge to Banghwa Bridge this year.While the long-awaited rain showers last weekend mitigated the algal bloom, the city government has not lifted the warning alert yet, saying that the green tide level is likely to go up again. A day after the rain, the level started to rebound, the city said. “Once the green tide settles in a certain spot, it makes its periodical appearance,” said Kim Jung-wook, the president of the Korean Society of Limnology, warning that the algal bloom around Singok weir will occur annually.  Since 1998, experts have warned that the weir could seriously slow down the water flow, worsening the ecological system. They argued that the deaths of numerous fish near the weir late last month was caused by the green tide as well. Over 600 kilograms of dead fish were found June 27, three days before the algal bloom warning was issued. “The small dam slows down the water flow speed by two times, making it easier for the green tide to grow as the water pollutants remain stagnant,” Lee added. Fishermen in the neighboring area, however, refute such a scenario, arguing that the fish deaths were not caused by the algal bloom, but wastewater. “If the green tide was the real cause, then all the fish in the Hangang River would have had to die. The fish died only on June 27. I believe the illegal effluent, which massively flew toward the Singok weir region by those who attempted to throw away the wastewater on a rainy day, affected it,” said Park Chan-soo, the representative of a fisherman group in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province.  About 40 fishermen who work near Singok weir claimed that the water level will go down if the weir is removed and that would pose difficulties to their means of living. “The weir supplies crucial water for farmers in our province. Plus, if the water level is not controlled, there will be highs and lows in the river. All fishermen will flock to the high water level areas, letting all fish get caught in a few years,” he added. Some experts also sided with the fishermen. “The small dam safely prevents the mud from coming up the river. If there’s no weir, the mud can affect the river because of the tidal current,” said civil engineering professor Jang Suk-hwan at Daejin University. The Ministry of Environment also remains cautious of linking the weir to the problematic green tide. “It’s very difficult to say that the small dam contributed to the ecological problem. Drought is more likely to have affected the phenomenon. Since last summer, the discharged water from Paldang Dam nearly halved because of the drought, having the Hangang River stay stagnant,” said a ministry official in a press conference Thursday. While the controversy goes on, a half-year study conducted by Seoul Metropolitan Government in 2013 has shown that it would be economically beneficial to tear down the small dam. The study showed that pulling it down would boost biodiversity and river quality as it would drop the biochemical oxygen demand and chlorophyll-A by up to 4 percent and 19 percent, respectively. The removal project was anticipated to cost about 17 billion won ($15 million). The city, however, decided in April to conduct the study again as some questioned the result, claiming that it was exaggerated.Even if the second study finds similar results, the city does not have the discretion to tear down the concrete construction, as the small dam is owned by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. “(We) know that the city doesn’t have any authority to unilaterally get rid of the weir. The study just aims at gathering the basic information as part its efforts to come up with solutions,” city officials said.Despite the growing concerns over the weir, the Land Ministry has been reluctant to remove the small dam, citing its benefits. The ministry said that pulling down the weir would not ensure high enough water level, but only break the ecological system that has long been settled around the weir. A decade after the weir was built, a 7.5-square-kilometer-large wetland was created around Singok weir. Being a habitat for various plants and animals, it was designated as a “protection region” by the government. As long as the small dam remains, ensuring good river water quality is the best solution, experts said. “The climate issue is a constant variable. The temperature will continue to go up while the drought will be more serious. If we cannot improve the climate conditions, the best solution for now is to strengthen the river water quality management,” said researcher Kim Young-ran at public think-tank Seoul Institute. “The green tide will likely become a daily life issue for us.”By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","environmental movement in seoul man ,green tide poses harmful ecological ,algae phenomenon reignited the extensive ,for environmental movement in seoul ,illegal effluent which massively flew","['Seoul', 'Singok', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'the Korean Federation for Environmental Movement', 'Seoul', 'shingok', 'Goyang', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'north korean', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Singok', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Lee Sae - gul', 'Singok', 'Kim Jung - wook', 'the Korean Society of Limnology', 'Singok', 'Lee', 'Singok', 'Park Chan - soo', 'Goyang', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Singok', 'Jang Suk - hwan', 'Daejin University', 'the Ministry of Environment', 'drought', 'Paldang', 'Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'the Ministry of Land , Infrastructure and Transport', 'the Land Ministry', 'Kim Young - run', 'Seoul Institute', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54128373  0.52254069

The NHRC said that barring the stepparent, who takes care of the child and oversees his education, from joining a school committee falls under “irrational discrimination,” stipulated by clause 2 of the National Human Rights Commission Act. It added that allowing one to exercise his or her rights as a parent at a school should be based on one’s actual relationship with the child, not on legal status.“The rights exercised as a school committee member does not involve legal complications such as the child‘s legal proxy.

Police arrested an official, identified only by his surname Kang, at his residence after obtaining an arrest warrant for 10 key members of the group. Police officers carry a box containing account books, computer hard disks and other materials that they seized at the head office of Corea Alliance in Seoul, Wednesday. (Yonhap)It is currently tracking down seven others in Korea and two overseas for their arrest. Police accused Corea Alliance of being sympathizers of the communist regime, therefore violating the 1948 National Security Law. South Korea has put in place the controversial National Security Law that prohibits anti-state activities, such as those supporting North Korea. Those found to be breaching the law can face life imprisonment. Police also took issue with the leftists distributing “pro-North” leaflets and having a meeting in Germany with key officials from the reclusive regime. Corea Alliance was founded in November 2011, led by “patriotic” organizations and individuals “seeking a democracy and reunification for two Koreas.” In recent months, the group has focused on condemning the conservative President Park Geun-hye administration and the U.S. troops stationed in Korea. Six left-leaning organizations campaigning for gender equality, democracy and anti-capitalism are a part of Corea Alliance. The pro-North group has been searched a few times in the past on charges of violating the National Security Law, most recently in December last year. The raid came a day after Corea Alliance announced that it would file for a compensation suit against the government, denouncing the police for “intervening in the organization’s peaceful assemblies and demonstrations” in a violent and illegal manner. In Korea, several organizations have been labeled as illegal by the Supreme Court for allegedly advocating North Korea, which the progressive bloc has viewed as an attempt to silence criticism of the government. The Supreme Court outlawed a Pan-Korean Alliance for Reunification, an association of civic groups known as BumMinRyun, in 1997 for its outright support for North Korea and protest against the presence of the U.S. military here. The South Korean Federation of University Students Councils, a leftist student group called Hanchongryun here, was also criminalized the same year for the same reason. The National Security Law, which dates back to 1948, has stirred controversy in the divided nation, with left-leaning activists calling it a gimmick to stifle freedom of expression and oppress left-wing activists. South Korea remains technically at war with North Korea as the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.

Doctor Hwang Woo-suk oversees a cloning procedure on a dog in November, 2014 at Sooam Biotech Research Foundation in Seoul. Park Hyun-koo/The Korea HeraldAccording to reports, Hwang filed a criminal complaint accusing prominent researchers including Park Se-pil of Jeju National University, accusing them of embezzlement and attempted blackmail in June.Other researchers involved in the case are Chung Hyung-min of Konkuk University and Kim Eun-young of Mirae Cell Bio.In 2012 Hwang began working with Russian researchers to clone mammoths from cells recovered in Sahka Republic in eastern Russia. The plan is to extract the nucleus -– the part that contains genetic materials –- from replicated mammoth cells. The mammoth nucleus would then be inserted into eggs from elephants –- the mammoth’s closest living relatives –- from which all genetic materials have been removed. For the cloning process to begin, however, the mammoth cells retrieved from preserved carcass found in Russia first need to be replicated in the lab. Although Hwang had attempted to cultivate mammoth cells in collaboration with Russian researchers for some time, they had failed to produce results.Following years of failure, Hwang recruited the help of Park earlier this year, and his team was able to induce cell differentiation from the samples Hwang provided. While Park’s work opened up the way for mammoth cloning, Hwang claims that Park’s results are part of his own research and that he has sole rights over all related experimental methods. Hwang bases his claims on the fact that he provided the mammoth cells Park worked with.Park, however, argues that Hwang provided the cells without any conditions, and as his team’s cell cultivation method was critical in achieving the results, the research should be considered a collaborative effort.After failing to settle the dispute, Hwang filed a legal complaint accusing Park and his colleagues.The prosecution has so far finished questioning Hwang. Kim and Chung have also been questioned, and the prosecution plans to interview Park in the near future. Hwang was once a leading researcher who rose to fame in animal cloning. However, in attempting to apply his animal cloning techniques to human embryos, Hwang used doctored results that eventually led to his downfall. In the paper published in 2005, Hwang claimed that he had cloned a number of human embryos, but it was later found that his results were fabricated.By Choi He-suk (cheesuk@heraldcorp.com)","russian researchers to clone mammoths ,disgraced south korean researcher hwang ,criminal complaint accusing prominent researchers ,disgraced south korean researcher ,researchers to clone mammoths from","['south korean', 'Hwang Woo - suk', 'Hwang Woo - suk', 'Sooam Biotech Research Foundation', 'Seoul', 'Park Hyun - koo', 'Hwang', 'Park Se - pil', 'Jeju National University', 'Chung Hyung - min', 'Konkuk University', 'Kim Eun - young', 'Mirae Cell Bio', 'russian', 'Sahka Republic', 'Russia', 'Russia', 'Hwang', 'russian', 'Hwang', 'Park', 'Hwang', 'Park ’s', 'Hwang', 'Park', 'Hwang', 'Park', 'Hwang', 'Kim', 'Chung', 'Hwang', 'Hwang', 'Hwang', 'Choi He - suk']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53516549  0.27190673

The mine is known to have been operated by the Japanese industrial giant Mitsubishi.Kim said he found the document at an undisclosed Japanese museum Saturday.The three-page document calls for the construction of a 210-centimeter-high and 255-meter-long barbed wire fence on the wall surrounding the dormitory of Korean workers at the coal mine to prevent them from climbing over it.""This can be seen as clear proof that Koreans suffered from forced labor while practically being in a state of detention,"" said the expert who leads a research institute on Korean-Japanese culture.The document also stated that the barbed wire construction was scheduled to begin on March 1, 1944, for completion on March 31, the same year.The find came as Japan seeks to water down its statement about what happened at the Meiji-era industrial sites, which were inscribed on UNESCO's World Heritage list last Sunday.After Tokyo accepted Seoul's demand to acknowledge that Koreans were forced to work at seven of the sites during World War II, Japanese Ambassador to UNESCO Kuni Sato admitted in an English statement during the annual session of the World Heritage Committee that there was ""a large number of Koreans and others who were brought against their will and forced to work under harsh conditions in the 1940s at some of the sites.""

""The Committee does not consider that government-to-government payments would suffice as appropriate relief to the victims.""Despite the ILO's clear view, the Japanese government is stepping up diplomatic efforts to publicize its claim through its diplomatic missions abroad, according to Japanese media.   Speaking to a local broadcaster, a foreign ministry official argued that the government wants to curb the spread of what Tokyo claims to be a ""misunderstanding"" over the issue.    During a parliamentary meeting, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe defended his foreign minister, Fumio Kishida, who claimed earlier this week that the phrase ""forced to work"" is different from the term ""forced labor.""   The expression ""forced to work"" was inserted to convey that some of the laborers were conscripted against their will, Abe said.   ""The South Korean government never said that Foreign Minister Kishida's words during the press conference were wrong,"" he said at the meeting.   South Korea has dismissed the controversy surrounding the wording, stressing that the English version of the Japanese statement is official.   Japan's campaign heralds a new round in the diplomatic row with South Korea on the global stage.

Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters in Tokyo that the acknowledgement of ""forced to work"" does not mean that the labor was forced.Asked about the remarks by Kishida, China's foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular press briefing, ""As we all know, the forced recruitment and enslavement of laborers were heinous crimes committed by the Japanese military during its aggression and colonial rule.""

Tens of thousands of Korean people and Chinese prisoners of war were brought to the Japanese industrial sites at that time.

They invested a combined 190 billion won in the joint tour program.""We urge the two Koreas to stop political confrontation and hold honest talks,"" the Mt. Kumgang Enterpriser Association said in a statement.""The government should resume the joint tour program and lift its sanctions against North Korea,"" it added. The sanctions were imposed after the North's torpedoing of a South Korean warship and its shelling of a border island in 2010.The Mount Kumgang tour project, a symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation, had attracted some 2 million South Korean visitors until it was put on hold, according to the group.Pyongyang has called for the resumption of the tour program, which served as one of the few legitimate revenue sources for the cash-strapped country.The Seoul government has said that the North should take measures to guarantee the safety of South Koreans and ensure that similar incidents do not recur.The issue of resuming the Mount Kumgang tour program is linked to whether cash earnings from the tour project are subject to United Nations sanctions on North Korea.Following the North's third nuclear test in 2013, the U.N.Security Council imposed sanctions on North Korea that bans the transfer of bulk cash to the North on concerns that such money could be used to develop its nuclear and missile programs.

Twenty-three Japanese wartime industrial facilities were listed as UNESCO World Heritage sites Sunday, following a compromise that Tokyo stipulates that it forced Koreans to work at some of them and plans to honor them in the final document. In a footnote enshrined on the text, Japan said it was “prepared to take measures that allow an understanding that there were a large number of Koreans and others who were brought against their will and forced to work under harsh conditions in the 1940s at some of the sites.” It also vowed to “incorporate appropriate measures into the interpretive strategy to remember the victims,” such as establishing an information center. Seoul officials touted the outcome as it marked the former occupier’s first-ever official acknowledgement of forced labor at the sites. Yet Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida instantly downplayed the language after the decision was made at a World Heritage Committee conference in Bonn, Germany, saying that it did not mean “forced labor.” A tentative Japanese version of the document distributed by the Shinzo Abe administration to local media simply stated that the victims “got to work” at the sites, apparently undermining the coercive nature of their recruitment.  South Korea`s Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se (left) poses with his Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida before their meeting in Tokyo on June 21. (AP-Yonhap)Some degree of strategic ambiguity or discrepancies in interpretation may be inevitable given the sensitivity of the matter and public sentiment at home, especially so because Tokyo has long insisted that the issue was already resolved through a 1965 agreement that normalized the bilateral ties.Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga also reaffirmed Kishida’s remarks on Monday, adding that they confirmed during the negotiations with Seoul that Japan’s statement will not be “used” in the context of the 50-year-old pact. “Our position has not changed at all,” he said at a news briefing.Seoul officials dismissed the minister’s claim, stressing such expressions carried in the decision as “against their will” and “forced to work” indisputably indicate the forcefulness. “The official text, written in English, is the original ― there’s no room for misinterpretation,” presidential foreign affairs and security secretary Ju Chul-ki told reporters. A senior Foreign Ministry official reiterated the stance, adding: “The most crucial point is how to comprehend Japan’s statement on the outcome in light of international norms and customs, rather than commenting on every news conference that takes place in Japan.” Despite the budding war of words, the two countries will likely refrain from further escalations as they are seeking to mend ties severely stifled by historical and territorial spats and arrange a long-delayed summit between President Park Geun-hye and Abe later this year. Officials here said they would closely watch how Tokyo follows through on its pledges, including the information disclosure, and thus demonstrate its sincerity. Under the plan, Tokyo is supposed to devise a follow-up mechanism and report development to the World Heritage Center by the end of 2017, which is expected to be reviewed by the World Heritage Committee at a meeting the following year. The measures should be in line with the committee’s request for an “interpretive strategy” that will enable an understanding of the “full history” of each site. It also recommended Japan seek advice from the UNESCO advisory panel International Council on Monuments and Sites. “The decision was made and will be carried out with certain formalities,” the ministry official added. “After all, it’s something that the Japanese government publicly declared in the international community, and its implementation will be monitored through the U.N. mechanism.”By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","meeting in tokyo on june ,twenty three japanese wartime industrial ,sunday following compromise that tokyo ,brewing again as japan attempts ,delayed summit between president park","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'UNESCO World Heritage', 'Japan', 'korean', 'japanese', 'UNESCO World Heritage', 'Tokyo', 'Koreans', 'Japan', 'Koreans', 'Seoul', 'japanese', 'Fumio Kishida', 'World Heritage Committee', 'Bonn', 'Germany', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Yun Byung - se', 'japanese', 'Fumio Kishida', 'Tokyo', 'AP', 'Tokyo', 'Cabinet', 'Yoshihide Suga', 'Kishida ’s', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Ju Chul - ki', 'Foreign Ministry', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Abe', 'Tokyo', 'Tokyo', 'the World Heritage Center', 'the World Heritage Committee', 'Japan', 'UNESCO', 'International Council on Monuments and Sites', 'japanese', 'U.N.', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",18,"[ 1.          7.          1.         ... -0.41689929  0.36755595

The decision made at a World Heritage Committee conference in Bonn, Germany, marked a breakthrough between South Korea and Japan following grueling two-month negotiations over how to address the appalling chapter of the archipelago country’s history that eclipsed its stellar postwar industrial transformation. After Tokyo initiated the campaign in January 2014, Seoul staged a strong protest, claiming that in seven of the proposed 23 sites, hundreds of thousands of Koreans were forced into slave labor under Japanese colonial rule.In a footnote enshrined on the final document, Japan said it was prepared to take measures to promote understanding that there were “a large number of Koreans and others who were brought against their will and forced to work under harsh conditions in the 1940s at some of the sites.”It also pledged to “incorporate appropriate measures into the interpretive strategy to remember the victims” such as setting up an information center. The statement was “taken note of” by the committee as it will promote the understanding of the “full history of each site.” Tokyo is mandated to formulate a follow-up mechanism and report progress to the World Heritage Center by the end of 2017, which is expected to be reviewed by the committee at its meeting the following year.  Hashima undersea coal mine off Nagasaki, known as “Battleship Island,” one of the 23 properties of “Japan’s Meiji Industrial Revolution” which were newly listed as World Heritage sites on Sunday. (Yonhap)Seoul welcomed the outcome, saying it “sufficiently reflects our rightful concerns.” “Japan’s statement has significance in that it virtually represents its first formal mentioning before the international community that Koreans provided labor against their will during Japanese colonial rule,” Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said after the decision.“I believe we have achieved two feats this time: We had managed to carry through our principle and position that historical facts ought to be reflected as they are, while avoiding an extreme confrontation with Japan and resolving the problem through dialogue, which could contribute to a stable development of the bilateral relationship.” In May, Japan secured the endorsement of the International Council on Monuments and Sites, a UNESCO advisory panel better known as ICOMOS, for the registration of 23 sites of Japan’s Meiji Industrial Revolution, built in the late 19th to early 20th centuries. They represent the “first successful transfer of industrialization from the West to a non-Western nation,” based on iron and steel, shipbuilding and coal mining particularly to meet defense needs, the panel wrote in its recommendation. Yet it also requested an “interpretive strategy” for the nominated properties to enable an understanding of the full history of each one. Among them are the Hashima undersea coal mine off Nagasaki, known as “Battleship Island.” The workers, mostly conscripted from Korea and China, had to work more than 12 hours a day, isolated from the outside world and facing frequent tunnel collapses, gas explosions, falling rocks and other harsh work conditions. Koreans were also mobilized to build warships, torpedoes and other military supplies in the Nagasaki shipyard run by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Many of them died, either in the U.S.’ atomic bombing in 1945 or while carrying out reconstruction work afterward. Tokyo, which refused to budge during initial negotiations, has apparently decided to opt for a compromise in the face of mounting pressure not only from Seoul but also council chair Berlin and other member states and souring international sentiment.“Japan’s statement is virtually unprecedented at an intergovernmental organization,” a senior Foreign Ministry official told reporters on customary condition of anonymity. “As a result of our omnidirectional diplomatic efforts, the international community including the council member countries now have a better understanding of the issue.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","2014 seoul staged strong protest ,japan following grueling two month ,sites on sunday yonhap seoul ,sunday with tokyo conceding forced ,industrial transformation after tokyo initiated","['Japan', 'World Heritage', 'Tokyo', 'Koreans', 'World Heritage Committee', 'Bonn', 'Germany', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Koreans', 'japanese', 'Japan', 'Koreans', 'Tokyo', 'the World Heritage Center', 'Hashima', 'Nagasaki', 'Japan ’s', 'World Heritage', 'Japan', 'Koreans', 'japanese', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'the International Council on Monuments and Sites', 'UNESCO', 'ICOMOS', 'Japan', 'Hashima', 'Nagasaki', 'Korea', 'China', 'Koreans', 'Nagasaki', 'Mitsubishi Heavy Industries', 'U.S.', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Berlin', 'Foreign Ministry', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",3,"[ 1.          7.          0.         ... -0.74605656  0.58256465

Choi Doo-yeong, the president of the Local Government Officials’ Development Institute, was found dead on the ground outside a hotel. He seemed to have fallen from his fourth-floor hotel room, but the reason for it had not been confirmed, the Ministry of Government Administration and Home Affairs said.  Choi Doo-yeong (Yonhap)Choi left for China on Thursday to handle the aftermath of the bus crash that killed 10 Korean nationals and injured 16, with eight in critical condition. Of the victims, nine were Korean public servants who were taking part in the LGODI’s training program. More than 140 Korean civil servants were visiting Jian as part of a five-day work training program hosted by the institution. The 55-year-old was reportedly under pressure over the tragic deaths, sources said, adding that he had struggled with mediating between the bereaved families who wished to bring the bodies of their loved ones home and the Chinese government, which advised cremation in line with Chinese custom. While no suicide note was discovered, the Chinese police found a paper on which Choi attempted to write something in his hotel room, a government official said. No specific message had been written, the official added. The Chinese authorities said no signs of murder had been found, with the investigation into the death still underway. Choi was appointed the LDODI president in January after working in the senior position in the Gangwon provincial government and in the Government Administration Ministry for over 30 years. The LDODI, founded in 1965, has served as a top education system for raising top public servants in municipalities. The institute is an affiliated organization under the Government Administration Ministry. Of the wounded, those in critical condition will stay in China until they fully recover, the ministry said. Other public servants who participated in the field trip safely returned to Seoul on Saturday.The exact cause of the accident is still under investigation but it is suspected that the driver was speeding before the bus ran over the side of the bridge, the authorities said. The bodies of the victims will return home as early as Monday, they said. Choi’s body will arrive separately later this week, they added. By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","bus crash that killed 10 ,crash that killed 10 korean ,crash that killed 10 koreans ,killed 10 koreans the government ,official was found dead sunday","['south korean', 'chinese', 'Jian', 'Koreans', 'Choi Doo - yeong', 'the Local Government', '’ Development Institute', 'the Ministry of Government Administration', 'Home Affairs', 'Choi Doo - yeong', 'China', 'korean', 'korean', 'korean', 'Jian', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'Choi', 'chinese', 'Choi', 'LDODI', 'Gangwon', 'the Government Administration Ministry', 'LDODI', 'the Government Administration Ministry', 'China', 'Seoul', 'Choi ’s', 'Lee Hyun -']",13,"[ 0.          0.          3.         ... -0.24712934  0.78231382

She said the two boys accused of abuse played “arrest games” with the victim, in which he was forced to play the role of a criminal being arrested by police. Bruises on the boy’s thigh and bloodied penis were shown in the attached photos.“The officials from the SMOE visited the school Wednesday and collected testimonies from both sides. But we still were unable to meet the victim, as his parents are saying he is too fragile physically and mentally to meet outsiders,” said an SMOE official in the department of student affairs. The boy has been unable to attend school, located in Seocho-gu, southern Seoul, since June 15. Officials have met with one of the alleged attackers, all of whom have denied the accusations. The school committee concluded that there was bullying, but said there is no evidence to support the claim of sexual abuse.

The actual number of public executions is presumed to be higher.  The report said that since the number of such victims peaked at 161 in 2008, it has been largely on the decline with 82 in 2013 and five in 2014. Despite the slowdown, the figures represent a severe violation of human rights in the North, it added.  ""The North claimed that it has handed down capital punishment in very limited cases, but it has carried out executions in cases of a wide range of crimes,"" the report said.  It said that it is ""noticeable"" that in recent years, the North has killed those who were caught after watching and distributing DVDs of South Korean dramas or films that had been smuggled in from the outside. Execution for drug smugglers has also increased, the report added.  North Korea has long been regarded as one of the worst human rights violators. Pyongyang has bristled at such criticism, calling it a U.S.-led attempt to topple its regime.  In late 2013, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ordered the execution of his once-powerful uncle, Jang Song-thaek. The North's former defense chief Hyun Yong-chol is believed to have been executed in April for his disloyalty toward Kim.  North Korea's rights situation was in spotlight as the U.N. Commission of Inquiry last year unveiled a report that accused Pyongyang of ""systematic, widespread and grave violations of human rights.""  In a related move, the U.N. General Assembly adopted a landmark resolution in December that calls for the U.N. Security Council to refer the North's rights situation to the International Criminal Court.  North Korea has sharpened its flak against South Korea as the U.N. has recently set up its field office tasked with monitoring the North's human rights records in Seoul. Pyongyang vowed retaliation against South Korea over the opening of the U.N. office.  The report showed that it is easy to find grave violations of human rights such as violence and torture at detention centers in the North.  North Korea has denied the existence of political prison camps, claiming that the country only maintains labor camps as correctional facilities for criminals.  The North is presumed to operate five prison camps nationwide, which are holding in captivity some 80,000 to 120,000 political prisoners, the report showed.

It would also mark the first time for a sexual slavery victim, known euphemistically as ""comfort women,"" to hold a rally front of Japan's embassy in Washington.  ""Even if Abe didn't do it and the emperor did it, he should ask for forgiveness for what his ancestors did because it is him that is now holding power,"" Kim told reporters at a news conference, urging the Japanese leader to offer a legal apology and compensation and restore the honor of victims.  Kim also took a swipe at the U.S. president.  ""Let me talk about the U.S. president. If he's president of this big country, he should guide a friend onto the right path,"" she said, criticizing Obama for embracing Abe's nationalist agenda, such as the new bilateral defense guidelines calling for Japan's military to take on greater roles.  Kim, who was born in 1926, was forced into sexual slavery at age 14 and had to provide sex for Japanese troops in China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. It was when Korea was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945.  Kim said she was told she was going to a military uniform factory, but ended up at a Japanese military-run brothel. In an attempt to cover up the sexual slavery at the end of the war, Japanese authorities also had victims work as nurses, Kim said.  Kim said she even had to donate blood for Japanese troops.  ""Those who even stole my blood are now denying this,"" she said.   Kim said she thinks Korea has not been liberated from colonial rule yet as the sexual slavery issue has not been resolved.  Before Washington, Kim attended a United Church of Christ workshop in Cleveland and spoke about the hardships she went through.  While in Washington, Kim also plans to attend a George Washington University seminar on the issue and hold a meeting with State Department officials, including Cathy Russell, the U.S. ambassador-at-large for global women's issues.  Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mainly from Korea, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. But Japan has long attempted to water down the atrocity.  The sexual slavery issue has been the biggest thorn in frayed relations between Japan and South Korea, with Seoul demanding Tokyo take steps to address the grievances of elderly Korean victims of the atrocity and Japan refusing to do so.

Earlier this year, Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea visited Ehwa Womans University ― the first major institute to raise the tuition to the government-permitted limit of 2.4 percent ― after which the school abruptly said it would freeze the fees. According to the Korea Council of University Education, 174 of Korea’s 176 universities either froze or reduced their tuition fees for the first semester of 2015.“The burden of tuition fees in Korea is still high for most people. As a minister, I feel hard-pressed to suggest we remove that curb (on tuition hike),” Hwang said during a seminar with heads of the country’s leading universities last Thursday. Hwang said Korean universities still relies heavily on tuition for their finances, with fees accounting for 62.6 percent of their budgets on average.Instead of relying on tuition, Hwang said each university should look to make profits off their school funds, such as by starting their own businesses. A total of 156 private universities in Korea received 379.1 billion won ($336.7 million) in donations in 2013, according to this year’s report by the Korea Higher Education Research Institute. This marked a 30 percent decrease from 2009, when they received 541.8 billion won.In April, the government declared that the half-price tuition policy has been completed, with government and university scholarships covering roughly half the financial burdens. The announcement, however, faced criticism from students and experts who pointed out that the actual tuition remains unchanged and that only a limited number of students benefit from the policy.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","universities to allow tuition hikes ,that curb on tuition hike ,thursday hwang said korean universities ,curbs tuition fees for universities ,curb on tuition hike","['South Korea ’s', 'Education Ministry', 'Park Geun - hye ’s', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'Ehwa Womans University', 'the Korea Council of University Education', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Hwang', 'Hwang', 'korean', 'Hwang', 'Korea', 'the Korea Higher Education Research Institute', 'Yoon Min - sik']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.20181943  0.62872046

High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein met with Kim Bok-dong, Gil Won-ok and Lee Yong-soo, who were forced by Japan into sex slavery in frontline brothels during World War II, during his visit a day earlier to a museum on women’s wartime human rights in Seoul. The meeting was part of his three-day trip chiefly aimed at overseeing the launch of a U.N. field office here to monitor and study North Korea’s human rights situation. Addressing their stories, he appeared deeply moved by what he called the “power of human contact” and how “gentle, strong and determined” the women were. “I find it terribly sad that, despite some significant steps taken by Japan over the years, the victims of this terrible crime do not feel their suffering has been adequately and universally recognized. In the final analysis, it is only the victims who can decide whether enough has been done,” Zeid said at a news conference. “I think there is something that can be done beyond what’s already been done. … I feel the personal contact with these victims of past abuse can take discussions a long way toward a resolution.” His remarks came as pressure is building between Seoul and Tokyo to formulate a lasting, acceptable agreement to sate the aging victims’ demands for a genuine official apology and compensation. Earlier in the day, the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan said that another former comfort women has died, bringing the figure of surviving South Korean victims to 49. Kim Youn-hee died of natural causes at a Seoul hospital on Wednesday, it said. She was 83.Kim, who was born in 1932, was forced to work in a factory in Japan at age 12 and then transferred to a military brothel. She came back home after Korea was freed from the 1910-45 colonial rule but lived the rest of her life at a mental institution. Her death followed two other victims dying last week, further slimming the list of surviving victims. Initially, 238 women were on the list of government-registered former sex slaves.Historians say more than 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were coerced into sexual slavery at frontline Japanese military brothels during the colonial era. South Korea has urged Japan to resolve the grievances of the victims, saying the issue is becoming increasingly urgent as most victims are well over 80 years old and may die before they receive compensation or an apology from Japan. Japan has snubbed Seoul’s demand for official talks on compensating the aging Korean women, claiming all issues regarding its colonial rule were settled in a 1965 package compensation deal under which the two countries normalized their relations.The two sides have held eight rounds of director-general-level talks since April 2014 over the issue of the victims, which Seoul believes is a wartime human rights issue that goes beyond the bilateral relationship.Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said in an interview with Yonhap on Thursday that South Korea is poised to speed up efforts for a new chapter in its often-troubled ties with Japan after a years-long “slow and steady” approach.Both sides, he pointed out, have a strong political determination to move toward the future, while dealing wisely with conflicts over their shared history.But the issue of Japan’s sexual enslavement of Korean women during World War II is more complicated, he said.Yun said it’s important to “heal the wounds of the victims’ minds” and the Japanese government is well aware of what it should do.He compared it to a prescription for a patient, saying that the components of medicine are crucial.South Korea and Japan are hoping to resolve the dispute over the “comfort women” within this symbolic year, he added.“Details are quite important in the matter and very serious efforts are required (to resolve it),” he said.He was, however, optimistic of a “win-win deal” on Tokyo’s push for the listing of early industrial sites, some associated with its wartime brutality, as UNESCO World Heritage sites. Tens of thousands of Koreans were forcibly conscripted to work at several candidate facilities in the 1940s. The World Heritage Committee plans to decide whether to approve Japan‘s bid early next month.South Korea wants Japan to include a clear explanation of the bitter historical background in relevant UNESCO records.“We expect an outcome that fully reflects South Korea’s fair concern,” Yun said, adding that he reached a consensus with his Japanese counterpart, Fumio Kishida, on the matter in their Tokyo talks earlier this week.Another key litmus test is what Abe will say about history in his August speech to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.“There seems to be a consensus that the format and contents of Prime Minister Abe’s address should meet the expectations of neighboring countries and the international community,” Yun said.He reaffirmed a push for the resumption of trilateral summit talks also involving China within this year.Yun was cautious, however, about a separate one-on-one meeting between Park and Abe, saying the appropriate conditions should be created first. “There is still a way to go,” he said.By Shin Hyon-hee and news reports (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","women taking swipe at japan ,frontline japanese military brothels during ,sexual enslavement of korean women ,military sexual slavery by japan ,at seoul hospital on wednesday","['U.N.', 'Japan', 'Al Hussein', 'Kim Bok - dong', 'Gil Won - ok', 'Lee Yong - soo', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'U.N.', 'North Korea ’s', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'the Korean Council', 'the Women draft for Military Sexual Slavery', 'Japan', 'south korean', 'Kim Youn - hee', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Koreans', 'japanese', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Yonhap', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'korean', 'yun', 'japanese', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'UNESCO World Heritage', 'Koreans', 'the World Heritage Committee', 'japan‘s', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'UNESCO', 'South Korea ’s', 'Yun', 'japanese', 'Fumio Kishida', 'Tokyo', 'Abe', 'Yun', 'China', 'Yun', 'Park', 'Abe', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",18,"[ 4.         12.          2.         ... -0.22080746  0.3538931

But Tokyo has argued that all colonial-era issues were settled in a 1965 pact that normalized the bilateral relations.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","japan wartime sexual slavery wednesday ,wartime sexual slavery wednesday ,three korean victims in seoul ,of japan wartime sexual slavery ,wartime sexual slavery wednesday as","['U.N.', 'Japan', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'U.N.', 'Al Hussein', 'Kim Bok - dong', 'Gil Won - ok', 'Lee Yong - soo', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'U.N.', 'Al Hussein', 'Kim Bok - dong', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'U.N.', 'North Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'the Washington Post', 'Tokyo', 'Tokyo', 'Song Sang - ho']",12,"[ 0.          3.          2.         ... -0.26920441  0.5572688

The “comfort women” said they plan to file a lawsuit claiming $20 million to the San Francisco court against Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Emperor Akihito, Japanese media who called them “prostitutes” and Japanese companies accused of war crimes.“The Japanese government continues to reduce or distort facts about comfort women. We wish to file a lawsuit to find a solid solution to this issue,” said Kim Hyung-jin, the legal representative of the comfort women at a news conference held at the House of Sharing ― a shelter in Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province for the surviving former sex slaves. The media meeting was held a day after leaders of the two countries urged to move forward in marking the 50th anniversary of the normalization of bilateral ties. “The Japanese government keeps derogating the victimized women, who are still suffering from the pain inflicted 70 years ago, so we have no choice but to hold (the Japan) accountable.” Activists and victims of Japan’s sex slavery during World War II hold a rally calling for Tokyo’s apology for its past atrocities in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul on Tuesday. (Yonhap)But the former comfort women will drop their actions if Japan decides to apologize by July, Kim said. He urged Japan to hurry with the apology as few of them remain. The Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan and other surviving victims also held a rally in front of the Japanese Embassy in central Seoul, calling on the Abe administration to apologize for its past atrocities and make due compensation. They also urged the Korean government that there can be no mutual cooperation between the two countries unless the issues of the past are resolved.The Japanese imperial military is estimated to have forced as many as 200,000 women from all over Asia into sex slavery for its soldiers during the World War II. As of now, 238 Korean victims are registered by the government, 50 of whom are still alive.The Abe administration was recently criticized for portraying them as victims of “human trafficking,” which was deemed in Korea as an attempt to undercut Tokyo’s direct involvement. “What we are demanding is for the Japanese emperor to kneel before us and apologize, before the last of us are dead,” said former comfort woman Lee Ok-sun. She also urged the government to aid their effort in getting the decades-overdue apology.Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, who returned from Japan on Monday after a two-day visit, said any solution for the sex slave issue should meet the expectations of the victims and the international community. His visit was to mend the thorny relationship between the two countries that recently soured further amid historical and territorial disputes.“The important thing is to restore the honor of the 50 comfort women before they pass away and for the two countries to make this (resolving comfort women issue) an opportunity to develop their relationship,” he said.

Since taking office in 2013, Park has shunned a summit with Abe, calling on Japan to face up to its wartime history.But in what could be seen as a conciliatory mood, Park voiced hopes Monday that this year will be the first year of opening up a new future together while Abe said that he hopes the two neighboring countries will work hand in hand to chart a new era of relations.Japanese experts said that they appreciated the two leaders for making efforts to improve the strained ties but stressed that more efforts should be made to resolve the core issue of sex slavery.""It is regrettable that (Japan) fell short of expressing (more determination) to resolve the sex slave issue,"" said Haruki Wada, an emeritus professor of Tokyo University.""But South Korea and Japan have agreed to work together over the issue. ... It is good for the two countries to get to this point.

But it still remains to be seen whether this mood can pave the way for a summit between the two leaders,"" Asaba said.The professor said that Japan takes heavy responsibility for the sex slave issue, but Seoul should also make efforts to help Japanese people dispel doubts about whether the issue can be clearly resolved.Kimiya Tadashi, a professor at Tokyo University, said that the two sides should make strenuous efforts to resolve the sex slave matter as it is hard to yield satisfactory results if the two don't make concessions.Seoul has demanded that Tokyo show sincerity by resolving the sex slave issue in a way that is acceptable to the living victims.But Japan has long dismissed South Korea's demands, saying that all grievances related to its 1910-1945 colonial rule were settled through a 1965 treaty that normalized bilateral ties.

The official did not elaborate on the steps and asked not to be identified.In Tokyo, South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se also read the message from Park at a reception hosted by the South Korean Embassy, which was attended by more than 1,000 dignitaries, including Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.Abe, for his part, stressed the importance of partnerships between the regional powers.""Let us join hands and create a new era of bilateral ties by looking ahead to the next 50 years,"" Abe said at the reception, adding that he would like to make joint efforts with Park to create a new era.He also said bilateral cooperation is very important to peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region. South Korea and Japan are two key allies of the United States.Abe's special envoy, Fukushiro Nukaga, also read Abe's message at the reception in Seoul.Earlier in the day, Yun paid a courtesy call on Abe and delivered Park's verbal message.She said 2015 can be the starting year for new Seoul-Tokyo relations.Abe told Yun that it is important to be able to ""talk frankly with each other"" to resolve problems.In a meeting with Nukaga, Park expressed hope that Japan will uphold the position held by its previous governments on their history.Park said Seoul and Tokyo should heal the wounds of the past and create a new momentum for their relations, in an apparent reference to the sex slaves and other historical disputes stemming from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula.Park urged Abe to uphold the position on the recognition of history by the previous Japanese administrations in his speech set for Aug. 15 to ensure that the sides can move toward reconciliation and cooperation.That day marks the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II and the 70th anniversary of Korea's independence from Japan's colonial rule.Nukaga told Park that Abe has vowed to stand by Japan's two previous statements of apology -- the 1995 Murayama and the 1993 Kono statements that have served as the basis for Japan's relations with South Korea. In 1993, then Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono issued a landmark statement recognizing the military's involvement in establishing and operating ""comfort stations.""Two years later, Japan's then Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama acknowledged and apologized for the suffering his country inflicted on neighboring nations, including Korea, through its aggressions in the early part of the 20th century.Nukaga also said that Abe has said his heart aches when he thinks of the painful experiences of the former sex slaves.Abe's Cabinet angered South Korea last year with its attempt to ""review"" the Kono Statement, a move that was widely seen by South Korea as an attempt to undermine the apology's credibility.Later Monday, South Korean Foreign Minister Yun said that any resolution to end the wartime sex slavery issue should be based on the desires of the victims more than anything else.""If we come up with a firm solution to the issue, there's no reason it will come up again later,"" Yun told Japanese public broadcaster NHK in an interview. ""It's important to restore the dignity of some 50 surviving victims and by doing so the two countries may open another chapter in their relations.""

Each school is subject to a state evaluation every five years to prevent abnormal operations, such as only focusing on the main subjects for the annual college entrance exam.Of the 11 schools assessed by the SMOE this year, four fell short of the minimum passing score of 60. They were Kyungmoon High School, Mirim Girls’ High School, Sehwa Girls’ High School and Janghoon High School. The categories for the evaluation included long-term development plans for the school, the student admission process, the curriculum, competence of faculty members, school finances and facilities. An evaluation committee consisting of university professors, education workers and parents had been working on the assessment from May 29 to last Monday based on data submitted by each school and site inspection. Then SMOE will hold hearings for the schools on July 6-7, during which they may challenge the results. Each school will then get a chance to acquire a two-year extension after submitting a plan for improvement.For schools that fail to earn an extension, the SMOE will request the Education Ministry to cancel their designation as autonomous private high schools, turning them into regular schools. Last year, the SMOE decided to cancel the designation of six autonomous schools, but the ministry nullified the SMOE’s decision after wide-scale protests from parents.

The Korea Queer Culture Festival’s street parade ― slated for June 28 ― was nearly canceled by Seoul police, but is back on track after a court ruled the ban unjust. “I was shocked to hear that the parade was blocked by the state forces. It saddened me,” said Ishikawa in an interview with The Korea Herald earlier this month. “Then it hit me; there isn’t an openly LGBT lawmaker in Korea yet.” Taiga IshikawaIshikawa was elected a member of the Toshima Assembly, a special ward in Tokyo, in 2011 as the first openly gay candidate.He said having a sexual minority in politics is important because it allows the LGBT community to have a greater voice.While Japan now has three sexual minorities as elected politicians in the country, the conservative administration of Shinzo Abe still does not make the job easy for them, he said.“Policymaking in Japan as a whole is conducted as if sexual minorities do not exist. I wish to be an advocate of LGBTs, as I am one myself,” he said. “In that sense, I hope there was an LGBT politician in Korea as well.”Korea, dominated by traditional Confucian values and a powerful Christian community, seemed to come close in 2008, when lesbian politician Choi Hyun-sook ran for a parliamentary seat. Her attempt, while praised by local activists, came to no avail as she went home defeated with only 1.6 percent of the vote. Ishikawa said he understood how it feels to be alone and cut off from those once regarded as friends because of one’s sexual orientation.“I realized that I was gay in the fifth grade. Many LGBT people realize their sexual orientation in the early stages of their life, whether it be in kindergarten or in middle school,” he said. “It is important to tell them that they’re not weird and that they are not alone.”He said the LGBT parade is important because it is a way of telling these people that they are not alone or isolated, which was how he often felt up to his 20s.“I could not obtain proper information about LGBT at home or school, anywhere. Until I ran into other LGBT people, I was left in utter isolation,” Ishikawa said. “People start to drift apart, while less people understand how I feel.“Statistics show that gay (and) bisexual teens in Japan are six times more likely to commit suicide than those who are heterosexuals. It is important to deliver the accurate information to teenagers.”According to Ishikawa, 62 percent of gay and bisexual teenage boys in Japan have felt the urge to commit suicide, with 14 percent actually having attempted it. Of the entire LGBT teen population, 70 percent were bullied at schools. “The important message is to show that it is not the LGBT people that are evil, but the society that persecutes them,” said Ishikawa.In 1999, when Ishikawa started to interact with other LGBT community members, he realized he wasn’t alone. That gave him the courage to start working as an activist for LGBT rights, he said. He also published the memoir “Where is My Boyfriend?” about his experience growing up as a young gay man in modern-day Japan. Despite the obstacles faced by sexual minorities, Ishikawa said Japan has made considerable progress in the past 10 years, a claim perhaps best backed by his election.He said an increasing number of sexual minorities are revealing their names and faces when appearing in public, such as in media interviews.“When you look at countries that allow gay marriage, (the concept) is widely understood by the ordinary public,” he said. “The trend has been about activists coming out of the closet, but anyone should be able to do so. The hurdle to coming out should be lower.”As a gay member of parliament, Ishikawa said his proudest accomplishment is making Toshima more “LGBT-friendly.” He recently pushed to add a section on LGBT people to the suicide prevention manual of Toshima’s civil servants. Lack of recognition is considered one of the main difficulties faced by sexual minorities, he said. Korea has been no exception. Earlier this year, the Education Ministry was criticized by activists within and outside the country for not adding a section about LGBT in the national sex education guidelines for schools.“The thing that hurt me the most was not being able to convey a feeling to other people that I am attracted to men. Everyone else just assumed I was heterosexual,” he said. “Building a relationship in that situation made me feel as if I did not exist. That I was not being accepted for who I was.”By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","lgbt politician in korea ,annual queer festival the korea ,an lgbt politician in korea ,japan first openly gay politician ,the lgbt parade is important","['Korea', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Taiga Ishikawa', 'Korea', 'LGBT', 'the Korea Queer Culture Festival ’s', 'Seoul', 'Ishikawa', 'the Korea Herald', 'lgbt', 'Korea', 'the Toshima Assembly', 'Tokyo', 'LGBT', 'Japan', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Japan', 'lgbt', 'Korea', 'confucian', 'christian', 'Choi Hyun - sook', 'Ishikawa', 'LGBT', 'LGBT', 'LGBT', 'LGBT', 'Ishikawa', 'Japan', 'Ishikawa', 'Japan', 'lgbt', 'lgbt', 'Ishikawa', 'Ishikawa', 'LGBT', 'LGBT', 'Japan', 'Ishikawa', 'Japan', 'Ishikawa', 'lgbt', 'lgbt', 'Toshima ’s', 'Korea', 'the Education Ministry', 'LGBT', 'Yoon Min - sik']",2,"[ 0.          8.          0.         ... -0.55306184  0.37338999

""South Korea's diplomatic missions abroad have been ordered to provide correct, timely information about MERS to foreign media outlets and investors,"" he said.""Real time and accurate information is also being provided directly by the government. Such data is being provided in several foreign languages for easier access."" Store owners claimed that compared to May, sales have dropped as much as 50 percent, making it hard for many to pay rent and wages.

Yoo will seek compensation worth $20 million in the case that marks the second sex-slavery trial in the U.S. since 2000, when the victims lost.“We will press charges against about 1,000 Japanese individuals and entities, including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Japanese wartime conglomerates, for committing crimes against humanity and defaming victims of sexual enslavement (by the imperial Japanese Army),” Kim told The Korea Herald. Kim also said Yoo decided to take the case to the U.S. because former sex slaves have made no progress in their two-year court battle in Seoul. In 2013, 12 sex-slavery victims filed a lawsuit against the Japanese government and sought financial compensation for forcing them to work in military brothels. But the Japanese government has dismissed the charge and refused to appear at the court. Tokyo has rejected the court’s request to submit documents related to the case, claiming they are beyond the Seoul court’s jurisdiction. Kim added that a legal battle on U.S. soil would encourage Japan to change its attitude toward the victims, saying Tokyo is sensitive toward international opinions, particularly those of the U.S. In the meantime, Seoul has continued its effort to resolve the wartime sex slavery issue with Tokyo. It is widely expected that Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se will discuss the matter with his Japanese counterpart during his visit to Tokyo from Sunday to Monday.“We sincerely hope that Seoul and Tokyo will hammer out the agreement and resolve the (sex slavery) issue as soon as possible,” said Kim. “Until then, we will bring the case to the court all over the world, no matter how long it will take.”By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","will sue japanese prime minister ,wartime sex slavery on friday ,korean sex slaves prostitutes ,sex slavery victims filed lawsuit ,second sex slavery trial in","['south korean', 'U.S.', 'japanese', 'Tokyo', 'Yoo Hee - nam', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'japanese', 'japanese', 'Kim Hyung - jin', 'Yoo', 'the Shankei Shimbun', 'japanese', 'korean', 'U.S.', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'japanese', 'japanese Army', 'Kim', 'the Korea Herald', 'Kim', 'Yoo', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'japanese', 'japanese', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Yun Byung - se', 'japanese', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Kim', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",2,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -0.26645595  0.30712822

South Korea's Prime Minister's Office, however, said 1,516 Koreans were forced to carry out dangerous tasks in poor working conditions at these facilities run by four Japanese companies: Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi Mining, Mitsui Mining and Nippon Steel.The office came to that number after analyzing damage reports submitted by former forced laborers between 2005 and 2008.But because the time window is so short, the actual number could be significantly higher, the office said, adding that's why its number may differ from figures suggested by academics and civic organizations in Japan.""The number could increase exponentially if we allow more people to submit damage reports,"" an official at the Prime Minister's Office said on condition of anonymity.

As of Tuesday, more than 5,000 individuals in the country are being monitored at home for possible infection. The exact number and nationality of those concerned has not been fully confirmed because the information of their home countries was not collected in the initial stages of the screening, according to the ministry. “Once the MERS response team sends the list of those that they assume could be foreigners, we first identify based on names whether they are Korean nationals or not, and then proceed with the personal identification. So far, it may be uncertain, but there are believed to be around 20 to 30 expats under quarantine monitoring,” a Health Ministry official who is in charge of foreign affairs told The Korea Herald. “The nationality identification is underway, but even if everything is confirmed, their nationalities will be kept confidential because of diplomatic issues,” she said, adding that some countries ask that the information not be released. She stressed that the foreigners were being monitored by local health offices just like other Koreans. Once the home monitoring is ordered, residents are required to stay at home for two weeks and receive a check-in call from the health authorities each day.Health authorities said all those placed in quarantine, regardless of their nationality, are banned from traveling abroad by the Justice Ministry. The authorities need only the name, date of birth and address of those quarantined to ban the travel.Monday, concerns were raised after two Japanese citizens, who were supposed to be in quarantine, were confirmed to have returned to their country earlier in the day. The ministry said they left the country before the home isolation measure was imposed. Both once visited Samsung Medical Center where over 70 cases of infection were reported, the ministry said. While the two Japanese citizens tested negative in a preliminary MERS test, they remain under Japanese government monitoring, Japanese news outlets reported. Last week, one Chinese person was found to have caught the virus while working at a medical facility in Dongtan, Gyeonggi Province. As part of the efforts to contain the virus spreading to other countries, the Justice Ministry said it would allow the stay extension of those infected or under monitoring. The ministry also urged foreign nationals in Korea to actively report any potential MERS symptoms, along with any possible contact with a patient. It said foreign residents can also receive emergency government subsidies allocated for MERS patients and those quarantined for possible infection, if they comply with the government instructions. The emergency subsidy ranges from 409,000 won ($366) to 1.41 million won for one-person to six-person households. The MERS hotline ― 109 ― started to provide services in 19 different languages on Monday, including English, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, French and Vietnamese.Of more than 2,300 individuals in quarantine in the capital, no foreign nationals have been reported so far, Seoul City officials said.

One of the key pending issues is a demand by former Korean sex slaves for an apology and compensation from Japan.   Japan has so far refused to comply with the demand, insisting that the so-called ""comfort women"" were recruited by civilian profiteers and its wartime military-led government was not directly involved.   ""There has been considerable progress on the issue of the comfort women, and we are in the final stage of our negotiations,""Park said in an interview posted on the website of the Washington Post.   Still, she declined to elaborate on the progress, citing behind-the-scenes discussions.   Park has repeatedly pressed Japan to restore the honor of the former sex slaves while they are still alive.   The issue has gained urgency as the number of living victims has shrunk. Two former sex slaves died on Thursday, reducing to only 50 the number of surviving victims.   Park also told the newspaper that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's reign of terror is ""sowing and amplifying the seeds of instability for the regime,"" referring to the executions of some 90 officials in recent years.   In May, South Korea's spy agency said the North executed its defense chief, Hyon Yong-chol, in late April with an anti-aircraft gun for showing disloyalty to Kim.   She also called for pressure on North Korea to bring Pyongyang back to the negotiating table it walked away from in 2008. The six-party nuclear talks were designed to end North Korea's nuclear program in return for aid and diplomatic concessions. The talks involve the two Koreas, the U.S., China, Russia and Japan.   Asked whether she feels squeezed between the U.S. and China over the possible deployment of a U.S. missile-defense battery in South Korea, Park said that when it comes to security, it shouldn't be about yes or no, depending on the position of certain countries.   ""The first priority should be how can we best safeguard the Korean people,"" Park said.   South Korea is struggling to walk a diplomatic tightrope between the U.S., Seoul's key ally, and China, Seoul's largest trading partner, over the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense(THAAD) battery that is designed to shoot down ballistic missiles in their terminal stage.   Washington hopes to deploy THAAD in South Korea to counter ballistic missile threats posed by North Korea, saying it is a purely defensive system.   Still, China has repeatedly expressed its opposition to the possible deployment of a THAAD battery in South Korea, suspecting it is part of U.S. attempts to contain a rising China. (Yonhap)","korean sex slaves for japan ,former south korean sex slaves ,former korean sex slaves ,former korean sex slaves for ,by former korean sex slaves","['Park Geun', 'Japan', 'south korean', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'the Washington Post', 'Park', 'Japan', 'Park', 'north korean', ""Kim Jong - un 's"", ""South Korea 's"", 'North', 'Hyon Yong - chol', 'Kim', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', ""North Korea 's"", 'Koreas', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Russia', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'China', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Park', 'korean', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'China', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'China']",2,"[ 5.          7.          2.         ... -0.81234181  0.16316053

Critics argue that the government’s lack of efforts to address expats’ concerns contradicts the government’s mantra of becoming a global, foreigner-friendly Korea, and its diplomatic efforts to promote trust in East Asia on nontraditional security challenges including transnational diseases.“The (Korean) government hasn’t done anything to help foreigners. I haven’t seen any official English-language material (about MERS),” said Christopher Cashel Cordo from the U.S., an English teacher in Seoul, stressing the only official message he got from Korean authorities was in Korean. “I think the government, in general, needs a task force or single public figure to offer frequent updates and information about the spread of the virus for the foreign population here,” he added, noting he had “no faith” in the Park Geun-hye administration with respect to his well-being.Quarantine officials sterlize a subway station in Wangsimni, Seoul, Thursday. (Yoon Byung-chan/The Korea Herald)As of April, there were over 1.4 million foreign residents registered in Korea.MERS-related information on the English website of Seoul’s Health Ministry was left largely neglected, while the Korean version of the website was updated minutes after the ministry’s daily briefing at 11 a.m.Since the first MERS case was confirmed on May 20, the ministry has not posted any information about the virus in English or any other language until May 27. Only on May 28, it posted a press release about the first confirmed patient and their containment efforts. Since then, there have been no updates until June 10.The Korean “Hotline” for consultations on MERS was established on Monday. The idea to provide the service in English did not come until recently, with the service starting at 9 a.m. this Friday, coinciding with a timeframe pinpointed by the government officials as a turning point for MERS to start subsiding.The Korea Herald tried to contact the ministry for comments, but no official was available. The Korean government’s lack of attention to MERS fears among foreigners has also been a source of frustration for many foreign diplomatic missions.They received an official government briefing about MERS at Seoul’s Foreign Ministry on Monday ― nearly 20 days after the first MERS case was confirmed.“The threat of the virus was underestimated by the hospital in the initial stages. The Korean government had to get involved more actively as a result,” George Khabelashvili, minister counsellor of the Georgian Embassy, told The Korea Herald.“Foreign service workers need to have full access to a wide range of information at any given moment because we need to inform our own citizens about ongoing situations in the country they are serving in.”Conflicting information from different South Korean public entities has further confused foreign embassy staff here, Ignacio Lacunza, deputy head of mission at the Argentine Embassy in Seoul pointed out.Fears about MERS were tangible among migrant workers, who have to work long hours without sufficient access to information.“The workers go to work early in the morning and come back home at midnight. They have no time to access information through media though they are fluent in English,” said Shekh Al Mamun from Bangladesh, senior vice president of Migrants’ Trade Union.“The Labor Ministry has a list of names and addresses of foreign residents. So why doesn’t it ask the migrants’ trade unions or factories to inform the foreigners? … It seems like the government does not care about us and has no plans to alleviate fears among foreigners.”The Korean government’s failure to address foreign nationals’ concerns has called into question Seoul’s move to improve its international status and promote regional cooperation on non-political issues including transnational diseases and disaster relief.“Control of diseases such as MERS is the representative topic in the realm of nontraditional security cooperation. Seoul has called for cooperation in that area,” said Kim Tae-hyun, an international politics professor at Chung-Ang University.“But the lack of attention (to foreign residents) seems to indicate that the Korean government is retrogressing from the global trend of close cooperation on handling transnational diseases.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)Yoon Min-sik, Ock Hyun-ju, Joel Lee and Paul Kerry contributed to this article. ―ED.","frustration for many foreign diplomatic ,fears among foreigners the korean ,korean government is facing criticism ,korean government failure to address ,the virus expats have complained","['south korean', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Christopher Cashel Cordo', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'Korean', 'Wangsimni', 'Seoul', 'Yoon Byung - chan', 'the Korea Herald)As', 'Korea', 'Seoul ’s Health Ministry', 'korean', 'Korean', 'Korea Herald', 'korean', 'Seoul ’s Foreign Ministry', 'korean', 'George Khabelashvili', 'the Georgian Embassy', 'the Korea Herald', 'south korean', 'Ignacio Lacunza', 'Seoul', 'Shekh Al Mamun', 'Bangladesh', 'Migrants ’ Trade Union', 'Labor Ministry', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Kim Tae - hyun', 'Chung - Ang University', 'korean', 'Song Sang - ho', 'Ock Hyun - ju', 'Joel Lee', 'Paul Kerry']",12,"[ 0.          0.          7.         ... -0.27810735  0.4512482

That’s good news for narrowing the perennial gaps in energy and transport blocking growth in many economies in the region. But, unless accompanied by protective safeguards, these projects risk damaging the environment, climate and communities ― and hindering growth. This must be a top concern for both the established lenders, such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, and the two new development banks: the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank ― planned to be established in Beijing later this year ― and the New Development Bank of BRICS countries. That is because the human and economic cost of disasters from environmental and social neglect is high. Vinod ThomasRecall the 2010 BP-Amoco Gulf of Mexico oil spill in the United States which cost $25 billion in damages and clean up. From Bangladesh and India to China and Korea, there have been costly accidents in recent decades, involving buildings, bridges and boats. In the second half of the 20th century, discharges from factories and mines severely hurt people’s health in Minamata Bay in Japan and the island of Marinduque in the Philippines. New road projects in forest areas of Brazil, Indonesia, Russia and many other countries contributed to massive deforestation, which in turn has a deleterious effect on global warming. The Sardar Sarovar Dam on the Narmada River in India eventually displaced over 200,000 people, while China’s Three Gorges Dam displaced six times as many. The gain from safeguards would be several times higher than their cost, which is usually 3-4 percent of the project cost. For example, the environmental benefit of pollution abatement is three to 10 times the cost, according to some estimates. The benefit of preserving biodiversity may be in avoiding a trigger for an ecosystem collapse.In recognition of these risks, development banks have, for decades, required safeguards in their loans. The scale of the needed response can be huge but necessary: the Ertan 1 hydropower project on China’s Yalong River successfully resettled 46,000 people.Development banks must continue to improve safeguard policies, including support for ensuring the adequacy of countries’ safeguard systems. ADB revised its safeguard policy in 2009 and the World Bank is now doing the same, which could influence others. The original World Bank proposal was widely criticized for weakening the obligation for safeguard compliance. World Bank President Jim Yong Kim has assured that the revision will not mean a “dilution.” Earlier in May, ADB President Takehiko Nakao and Liqun Jin, secretary-general of the Multilateral Interim Secretariat of the AIIB, jointly stressed “the importance of safeguards policies on environmental and social impacts of projects.” The vital question for established banks and newcomers alike as well as the countries is twofold: what is a desirable scope of safeguards, and how to get good compliance. There’s a growing consensus on the question of the “what,” but the “how” remains highly problematic. In particular, growth concerns press for greater flexibility in how safeguards are implemented. By citing a need to alleviate the burden for borrowers and executing agencies, it is tempting for alterations or new proposals to relax requirements for mitigation when approving a project and table them later instead. But rather than diluting safeguard policies this way, development banks should adhere to delivering sound safeguards while seeking greater efficiency and speed by reforming internal procedures. Indeed, sound economics argues for enforceable actions to rectify market failures that cause spillover damages from public and private investment. At the start of projects ― and not just those supported by development banks ― there has to be a binding mitigation plan based on established and clear rules, and compliance with the plan ought to be verified by an independent party and disclosed publicly.Development banks and countries must aim for better environmental and social impacts from safeguards as they expand infrastructure investment. That includes support for commitment, capacity and systems in countries to strengthen these defenses and their efficiency. By Vinod ThomasThe writer is director general of independent evaluation at the Asian Development Bank and former director general and senior vice president of the World Bank’s Independent Evaluation Group and chief economist for Asia. ― Ed.","drive for stronger economic growth ,new development banks the asian ,blocking growth in many economies ,the drive for stronger economic ,drive for stronger economic","['the World Bank', 'Asian Development Bank', 'the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank', 'Beijing', 'the New Development Bank of BRICS', 'Vinod ThomasRecall', 'Mexico', 'the United States', 'Bangladesh', 'India', 'China', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Marinduque', 'Philippines', 'Brazil', 'Indonesia', 'Russia', 'India', 'China', 'China', 'the World Bank', 'World Bank', 'World Bank', 'Jim Yong Kim', 'Takehiko Nakao', 'Liqun Jin', 'the Multilateral Interim Secretariat', 'AIIB', 'Vinod', 'ThomasThe', 'the Asian Development Bank', 'the World Bank ’s Independent Evaluation Group', 'Ed']",1,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.51395971  0.23653653

Quoting unnamed medical experts or health professionals, the messages range from the list of hospitals in question to ways to prevent infection. The overflowing exchange of the often incongruous information appeared to show the level of public distrust against the government, which has been urging people to stay calm. Members of civic groups hold a rally in front of the government complex in downtown Seoul on Thursday, protesting the government’s lax countermeasures against MERS and calling for transparent release of relevant information. (Yonhap)Most recently, a website carrying the names and locations of 14 hospitals that have treated MERS patients was created under the name “MERS proliferation map.” The website, created with data contributed by registered Facebook users, showed the public’s growing hunger for information after two people died of the disease. The scare only intensified after tertiary infections were confirmed earlier this week, despite the health authorities saying it was highly unlikely.Earlier in the week, a message advising people to rub Vaseline inside their nose to prevent MERS went viral via social media and mobile messenger sevices. The myth was quickly debunked by experts, but it was followed ― and preceded ― by a myriad of rumors that spread across the country.On Wednesday, Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education announced Daechi Elementary School became the first Seoul-based school to cancel classes due to MERS. The news, however, had been circulating via social media and media outlets hours before the announcement.Parents in the affluent Gangnam district in southern Seoul have been sharing texts on supposed MERS patients and hospitals that treated them. But they were also accompanied by a series of groundless rumors.Busan police on Thursday took into custody a 34-year-old man on suspicion of spreading a false rumor that a MERS patient was admitted to one of the city’s hospitals. “The (rumors are) not completely groundless, but a lot of them are exaggerated. Understandable though as people are panicking and have no information,” 44-year-old doctor Yoon Choon-shik said. Yoon, whose fifth-grade son is attending an elementary school in Gangnam, said his son’s school was just about the only one in its area still left open amid mounting fear up epidemic. Over three dozen schools and kindergartens in Seoul canceled classes, while most private institutions have followed suit. Schools left open are pelleted with a hailstorm of demands from concerned parents.“The initial government report emphasized how MERS had a low infection rate. Look at what’s happening now,” said a woman surnamed Choi, whose son attends an elementary school in Seoul. “What are we supposed to do if one of the kids in class ends up infected?”Outdoor playgrounds are as empty as the classrooms, as parents are seeking to ensure that their children come into as little contact with others as possible. Some companies are even telling their employees to come in late, so that they can avoid jam-packed subways and buses at rush hour. The Education Ministry recently advised nursing students to refrain from hospital training. Despite the public craving more information, the Ministry of Health and Welfare maintained that it would continue limiting information, including the names of hospitals. The ministry’s secrecy has seen even more criticism since it was revealed that it locked down the public relations department after the first MERS death was reported on Monday. “I think the government is restricting information to prevent panic, but they don’t realize that the control itself has been making the anxiety among people even worse,” Yu said. “The government should open up and offer directions for people to follow. Right now, neither the government nor the people have faith in each other.”By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","thursday protesting the government lax ,thursday protesting the government ,on thursday protesting the government ,the city hospitals the rumors ,protesting the government lax countermeasures","['netizen', 'Seoul', 'Vaseline', 'Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education', 'Daechi Elementary School', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Yoon Choon', 'Yoon', 'Gangnam', 'Seoul', 'Choi', 'Seoul', 'the Education Ministry', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare', 'Yoon Min - sik']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.04883525  0.32113111

Sexual minorities overlooked But a lack of education about sexual minorities and policies to protect them makes it hard for them to seek help from authorities.On the contrary, the Education Ministry recently sparked furor from in and outside of the country by advising schools not to include descriptions about homosexuals in its guidelines on sex education.Human Rights Watch released a statement urging the government to revise the guidelines, saying it was discriminatory against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.“We were alarmed that the government would take such a step, since the new guidelines do not meet South Korea’s international human rights obligations to uphold rights to information, education, and health,” Kyle Knight, an LGBT rights researcher at Human Rights Watch, told The Korea Herald.“It is crucial for students to receive an accurate and rights-based education about a range of aspects of sexuality. ... Obscuring the truth about sexual orientation and gender identity incites stigma and hatred, and instills misinformation,” he said, urging schools to include information about LGBT people in their curriculum.TSRAK’s Juri pointed out that this was not the first time LGBT teens had been neglected by the education system. “In fact, LGBT teens have never received education concerning our sexual orientations. Schools never even mentioned us. And even when they do, it carries negative connotations,” she said. “So the ministry’s guideline doesn’t hurt us that much. It has always been that way.”‘Traditional ethics’ behind anti-gay sentimentLocal experts have also been voicing concerns about the widespread aversion to educating teens about sexual minorities.Human rights lawyer Han Ga-ram pointed to the underlying causes behind the anti-gay sentiment in Korea.“Many have perceived that homosexuals ― not hatred against homosexuals ― are the real problem in Korean society, which has led to a taboo against mentioning sexual minorities in textbooks,” said Han. “But prohibiting descriptions of homosexuality is what has created the problem in the first place.”Last year’s Gallup poll of 123 countries showed that Korea ranked 69th in terms of being “a good place for gay or lesbian people to live.” Only 18 percent of Koreans said it was a friendly environment for homosexuals while 57 percent thought it was hostile to them.Homosexuals are often depicted as comic or eccentric in mainstream media, and extreme conservative groups ― particularly Christian groups ― have accused them of being responsible for spreading sexually-transmitted diseases, shortening life spans and the low birthrate.Illustration by Park Gee-youngMost recently on Monday, five Christian groups launched the “Korean Churches’ Response Team on Homosexuality,” urging the Education Ministry to ban all education about gays and lesbians. Aside from religious groups, Korea’s highly conservative Confucian culture has often had trouble adopting concepts that were against what it dubbed “traditional sex ethics.” This was demonstrated in a recent controversy sparked after the Constitutional Court ruled that the law criminalizing adultery was unconstitutional.While the public sentiment was generally split on whether or not the court had made the right call, a debate ensued over people’s right to make their own decisions and take responsibility for their sexual activities.“As debate about sexual orientation surfaced, anti-gay activities also grew in size and intensity. In the past such comments or actions may have not garnered much attention, but things have changed as people start to discuss sexual rights more openly,” said Han. In recent years, local education offices ― namely Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education ― passed student human rights ordinances that include clauses banning discrimination based on sexual orientation. But in 2014, conservative former education superintendent Moon Yong-rin attempted to water down the clause to “students will not be discriminated against for their personal preference.”The attempt was scrapped after Moon lost his re-election bid, but the popular support it received from conservative and religious groups demonstrated that anti-LGBT sentiment was still rampant in the country.Neglected at school and homeIn 2009, a 15-year-old boy in Busan killed himself after being bullied for being gay. Classmates called him sexually demeaning names, and mental examinations had shown signs of severe depression and anxiety along with suicidal impulses.The law, however, failed to take his side even after death, as the Supreme Court ruled last year that the school was not responsible for his suicide, despite having failed to take any preventive action.Han called it a “classic case” of LGBT students not receiving any protection.“Teen sexual minorities are four to five times more likely to attempt suicide compared to other teenagers. In the Busan case, if the school knew nothing about how to handle violence against LGBT students, they should have sought outside help, such as from education offices or human rights organizations,” he said.For LGBT teens, the hardship often starts at home.“When I broke the news to my parents, their first reaction was denial. Then they tried to ‘fix me.’ Now they ignore me. So when I say I’m going to date my girlfriend, they say ‘what do you even know about dating?’” said Hee-mun, who said she was bisexual. “First time I told them, they suggested that I go to church and talk to the minister. Funny thing was, they’re not even churchgoers themselves.” Juri’s parents reluctantly accepted the fact that their daughter was a lesbian after nearly eight years, but the process was not easy.“We don’t talk about my love life, or about the hardships I face as a sexual minority. They acknowledge my sexual orientation, but it’s not like they root for their daughter,” she said. For teen LGBTs, the prospects of a gloomy future is what is also ailing them. Korea does not allow gay marriage and its social welfare system ―such as subsidies for married couples ― is based on the assumption that a couple is a man and a woman.Furthermore, lack of openly-gay celebrities or public figures mean gay students hardly have anyone to truly identify with.“I can’t really find my true role model anywhere. Everywhere I look, it’s the life of a heterosexual,” said Juri. “Sometimes, I’m at a loss as to how I should lead my life. Then I wonder; why should I have to worry about all this stuff? If I were a heterosexual, I wouldn’t have to think about this at all.”Activists say the process of abolishing the prejudice against sexual minorities should start in the classroom. The student human rights ordinance clause against LGBT discrimination is a start, but it is hardly sufficient, said Han.“Over 80 percent of (LGBT) students in our surveys say that one of their teachers has made anti-gay remarks. This implies that school is not a safe place for those students,” he said. “Authorities should develop policies to protect sexual minorities. They would include teaching teachers to protect LGBT students’ human rights, what to do in case of discrimination and violence against them. Most importantly, they should include context about sexual minorities in the curriculum and discuss the LGBT as a human rights issue.”By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","students call gay peers infected ,bullied for being gay classmates ,violence against lgbt students ,gay classmates called him sexually ,teachers has made anti gay","['South Korea ’s', 'LGBT', 'the Teen Sexuality Rights Association', 'the Teen Sexuality Rights Association', 'Korea', 'South Korea', 'Juri', 'the Education Ministry', 'South Korea ’s', 'Kyle Knight', 'LGBT', 'Human Rights Watch', 'the Korea Herald', 'LGBT', 'TSRAK', 'Juri', 'LGBT', 'LGBT', 'Han Ga - ram', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Han', 'Gallup', 'Korea', 'Koreans', 'christian', 'Park Gee - youngMost', 'christian', 'the Education Ministry', 'Korea ’s', 'confucian', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Han', 'Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education', 'Moon Yong - rin', 'Moon', 'anti - lgbt', 'Busan', 'Classmates', 'the Supreme Court', 'Han', 'LGBT', 'Busan', 'LGBT', 'lgbt', 'Juri', 'Korea', 'Juri', 'LGBT', 'Han', 'LGBT', 'LGBT', 'LGBT', 'Yoon Min - sik']",1,"[ 1.          0.          1.         ... -0.10179209  0.14227496

The decision was reached upon the notion that the flexible employment system could lessen labor costs ahead of increasing the retirement age to 60 next year, as well as help create more jobs for young job seekers. Currently, companies are required to win consent from the labor union to introduce the pay peak system. ""The party shares the Labor Ministry's principle to adopt the pay peak system to resolve the youth employment shortage,"" Rep. Kwon Seong-dong of Saenuri Party told reporters after the meeting.Still companies are required to slash wages by levels similar to those by firms that have already introduced the rule through consultation with the labor union, the lawmaker noted. The government move to draw up relaxed labor guidelines came in line with the revision in 2013 of the aged employment promotion law, which officially lengthened the official retirement age to 60. During the government-party meeting, Labor Minister Lee Ki-kweon also called for parliamentary cooperation in legislation regarding the labor issues of how to define regular pay, as well as reducing work hours. Lee called for legislative efforts for these issues during the upcoming National Assembly session as early as June. The new guidelines are expected to face resistance from the labor sector, which has claimed that the introduction of the pay peak system will only eat into workers' wages as few employees stay on until 60.

The employees at the handbag manufacturing company lamented that the company gave them a warning and slashed their wages when they went to the toilet “too often.” They were only allowed to use the restrooms from 9:30-10:30 a.m. and from 2-3 p.m., with only three keys to the toilet available per production line. Each line has about 100 workers.  It is only one of the human rights abuse cases that have been raised in Korean-owned companies across Vietnam, a recent report by Korean Trans National Corporation Watch, a network of human rights advocacy groups, revealed. According to the 64-page report based on interviews with laborers, companies and civic organizations, local workers have suffered from unreasonably low pay, long working hours and constant insults from employers. Last year, Korean companies paid Vietnamese workers $90 to $135 a month, but the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor views this as being far lower than the basic cost of living, considering the soaring inflation in the country. Kim Jong-chul, a lawyer for Advocate for Public Interest Law, told the Korea Herald that the Vietnamese government shared responsibility for the situation, as it is accused of keeping the country’s minimum wage low to attract more foreign direct investment. In 2011, some 2,000 Vietnamese workers for a Hanoi-based Korean company went on a strike, demanding bonus payments and pay raise for overtime. Consumer prices in the first half of the year increased by 13.29 percent, but wages at the company did not rise in line with this, standing at $75 a month. The report also shed light on verbal and physical abuse in workplaces, noting that Vietnamese workers could not make a complaint about unfair treatment in fear of dismissal. An unidentified Korean-run company in Vietnam, where the majority of workers were women aged 18 to 25, were accused of forcing female workers to sign contracts that banned them from getting pregnant at least for three years after they were hired. They also had to consult with the company about their pregnancy plans.According to VGCL, 4 in 10 strikes that occurred in Vietnam between 2009 and 2014 were staged by workers at Korean-owned companies.   About 3,000 Korean companies, of which 66 percent are manufacturers, have entered the Vietnamese market since the early 1990s, investing more than $29 billion there. South Korea is the third-biggest investor in Vietnam, after Japan and Singapore. “Most of the strikes in Vietnam took place as Korean companies did not abide by labor laws,” said the Kim, who went on a 10-day field trip in Vietnam to look into human rights situation there.Although many of workers in Southeastern Asian countries have waged strikes, calling for a change in their working environments, the Korean companies have ignored their demands in order to keep production costs down, he said. Kim, thus, underscored the importance of the role of the Korean Embassy in Vietnam in tackling the human rights violations there. “The Korean Embassy in Vietnam is currently playing a role only in promoting Korean business in Vietnam, but it should expand its role to monitoring Korean companies and preventing them from violating local workers’ human rights,” Kim concluded.

Some say the welfare system should cater to those in need, while others say it should extend to all citizens.Bjorn Haugstad, the deputy minister of education and research in Norway, said that paying for education should remain a duty of the government rather than the parents.“We have always emphasized free education. Providing for education is more about public and government’s responsibility than parents. Parents contribute through paying taxes,” he said.  Bjorn Haugstad.Norway has one of the most expansive systems of public coverage of education expenses in the world, which includes tertiary education fees. Each Norwegian student is entitled to take a loan for education, 40 percent of which is converted into a scholarship upon passing the exams, he said. “Since World War II, the role of the state education loan fund has only increased, into a model that is about a universal coverage,” Haugstad said.The Norwegian official’s message has a special implication in a country where parents shoulder much of the financial burden of student’s learning. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, 37.2 percent of the funding for education institutes come from the private sector, compared to the OECD average of 16.1 percent.Another major issue that has been ailing Koreans is the criticism that the high pressure of academic accomplishments is hindering students from enjoying life. Last month’s World Education Forum 2015, which attributed the country’s improbable economic success to its education prowess, sparked concerns from education experts that the government is overlooking the fact that the excessive workload has deprived school life of joy. “In Norway, we are concerned always about work-life balance. And I think perhaps Korea will also need to (have) a discussion on balancing hard work and life. Working hard is work, but too much would mean no life,” Haugstad pointed out. Finding the proper work-life balance remains a job for Koreans, he added, as they are the ones who know best about their economy and society.Haugstad, 46, is a member of the Norwegian Conservative Party and was the research director at the University of Oslo from 2009 to 2013.

(Yonhap)After the Seoul Administrative Court ruled in favor of the government in June 2014, the KTU sought a comeback by attacking the clause itself. The attempt, however, was to no avail as the court shot down its challenge.“A teachers’ union exercises great influence on the working conditions of education workers. Excluding those who are not directly related to such working conditions cannot be seen as an excessive restriction (on the union),” the court said in its ruling. Furthermore, there aren’t any plausible benefits that can be gained from allowing dismissed teachers to become members.”While the KTU has already appealed the administrative court’s ruling ― and is likely to take the case to the Supreme Court if the high court also strikes it down ― Thursday’s ruling has virtually settled the case, as the contentious clause was the basis on which the government stripped the group of its legal status. Had the clause been ruled unconstitutional, the grounds upon which the administrative court made its ruling would have been removed. The ruling would likely have been overturned on appeal. If the decision is finalized, the KTU will lose its legal status for the first time since gaining formal status in 1999, 10 years after its foundation. It will subsequently lose all government subsidies while also being relinquished of the right to engage in collective bargaining with the government. All full-time union members of the KTU will also have to return to their teaching posts.The KTU denounced the decision, saying the Constitutional Court has “turned its back on time” by denying the rights of dismissed teachers to join a union. “The court has been accused of causing a regression of democracy. It is regretful that today’s ruling has done nothing to disprove that opinion,” said KTU leader Byeon Seong-ho. “Outlawing a trade union of 60,000 members just because it has nine dismissed workers is unheard of. Nevertheless, we will keep working to acquire our legal status as soon as possible.”The group will release a statement about its specific future plans including legal actions on Monday.The conservative Park Geun-hye government has rarely seen eye-to-eye with the left-leaning KTU, one of the most outspoken opponents of its education policies. The rift between the Education Ministry and the KTU was well demonstrated during last week’s World Education Forum 2015 in Incheon, when the group was not invited to participate despite being one of two biggest teachers unions in the country. The KTU responded by holding a press conference outside the venue, criticizing the ministry for “being hell-bent on self-praise while turning away from the actual education issues.”The teachers’ group has urged the judicial authorities as well as the government to “respect the international standards” that they said were to allow dismissed workers from joining trade unions. “There is no democratic nation that forbids dismissed workers from becoming members of a trade union. As a member of the International Labor Organization, Korea should abide by the agreement on the freedom of association and the protection of the right to collective organization,” the group said in a press conference Wednesday.Attempts to outlaw the KTU have sparked negative reactions from outside the country as well. International Trade Union Confederation and Education International on Thursday requested a permanent injunction of the Labor Ministry’s decision to delegalize the KTU. They said each trade union had a “long-recognized right to decide who may be members and eligible for leadership,” and that each union’s membership rules could reflect those decisions. “The ILO has clearly stated that the prohibition on dismissed and unemployed workers as members or leaders is a violation of the principles of freedom of association, not merely in the abstract but specifically with regard to Korea. We therefore urge the court to permanently enjoin the Ministry of Employment and Labor as its decision is contrary to international standards,” it said. During the WEF 2015, Education International chief Susan Hopgood urged the government to revise its law to allow dismissed teachers to join unions. “We think that government should recognize the KTU, stop its action to delegalize the organization and should respect the rights of teaching unions,” she said.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","labor law banning dismissed education ,law banning dismissed education workers ,conference wednesday attempts to outlaw ,ruled that labor law banning ,labor law banning dismissed","['the Constitutional Court', 'the Korea Teachers and Education Workers Union', 'the Labor Ministry', 'south korean', 'the Constitutional Court ’s', 'Seoul', 'the Seoul Administrative Court', 'KTU', 'KTU', 'the Supreme Court', 'KTU', 'KTU', 'KTU', 'the Constitutional Court', 'KTU', 'Byeon Seong - ho', 'Park Geun', 'KTU', 'the Education Ministry', 'KTU', 'World Education Forum', 'Incheon', 'KTU', 'the International Labor Organization', 'Korea', 'KTU', 'International Trade Union Confederation and Education International', 'the Labor Ministry ’s', 'KTU', 'Korea', 'the Ministry of Employment and Labor', 'Education International', 'Susan Hopgood', 'KTU', 'Yoon Min - sik']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23803289  0.260492

Lee Hyo-sun, 91, died at a hospital in Changwon, South Gyeongsang Province. She was one of the 238 women who had registered with the government, claiming to have been forced by Japan to serve at frontline brothels during World War II. Her death underscores the urgency of the wartime human rights issue surrounding the victims, euphemistically called “comfort women.” Victims have called on Tokyo to offer them sincere apologies and recognize its legal responsibility for the sexual slavery. Seoul has repeatedly urged Tokyo to address the issue as it would remain unresolved forever should all the victims, who are mostly in their late 80s, pass away.But Tokyo has rejected the demands, arguing all colonial-era issues have been settled under a 1965 pact between the countries that normalized the bilateral relationship. It also claims there is no clear evidence that Japan as a state forcibly mobilized sex slaves during the war.Despite the growing displeasure in Korea over Tokyo’s lack of atonement, a senior U.S. official said Washington was “gratified” by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s congressional speech last month in which he said he would remain true to his predecessors’ apologies for Japan’s wartime atrocities.“We were gratified to hear him say clearly that he stands by the statements made by the previous Japanese administrations,” U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific Affairs Daniel Russel said during his speech at the Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry in the U.S. on Wednesday.Contrary to the U.S.’ positive assessment of Abe’s congressional speech, criticism still continues in Korea over his refusal to include any expressions of repentance in the high-profile speech, such as “heartfelt apology,” an expression his predecessors used in their addresses.Abe is set to make another speech in August to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II. Observers do not expect him to make any explicit apology for the comfort women issue, although he might use expressions in the speech alluding to Japan’s infliction of “pain” or “suffering” on Asians.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","japan wartime sexual slavery died ,war ii her death underscores ,wartime sexual slavery died of ,world war ii her death ,state forcibly mobilized sex slaves","['Japan', 'Lee Hyo - sun', 'Changwon', 'South Gyeongsang Province', 'Japan', 'victim', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Tokyo', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'Shinzo Abe ’s', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'U.S.', 'State', 'Pacific Affairs', 'Daniel Russel', 'the Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Abe ’s', 'Korea', 'Abe', 'Japan', 'Asians', 'Song Sang - ho']",2,"[ 0.          5.          0.         ... -0.78171718 -0.13937967

313,313,Seoul to chronicle sex slavery on liberation anniversary,"South Korea will chronicle the sufferings of the women forced into sex slavery during Japanese colonial rule, while also seeking to hold sports events with North Korea and reopen the headquarters of its provisional governments in China, to mark the 70th anniversary of liberation this year.

The government will also build a hall of fame in downtown Seoul to honor some 20,000 independent fighters, while compiling a biographic dictionary to list their activities and boost related education. A public-private steering committee on Thursday unveiled 50 historical, political and socio-cultural programs to take place in the run up to the Aug. 15 anniversary, after months-long review of some 560 proposals made by the central and local governments, academia and ordinary citizens. The 11.2 billion won ($10.1 million) project is aimed at nurturing national unity and public awareness of history, promoting peace and hopes for a reunification with the North, drumming up youth participation and presenting the country’s vision for a unified future Korea, according to the Office for Government Policy Coordination, the prime minister’s secretariat.“Through the various programs, we hope to foster the chance to cultivate national integration and reconciliation and accelerate discussions on unification,” said Chung Chong-wook, vice chairman of the presidential committee on unification preparation who presided over the meeting. “The people are the owners of the project. … We should formulate concrete measures and promote the programs to encourage public participation.” To raise historical awareness, Seoul plans to reintroduce the buildings of the exile governments in Shanghai and Chongqing in September and November, respectively, which were set up in the wake of the March 1, 1919, Declaration of Independence. The Seodaemun Independence Park, which was reconstructed from a prison where Japanese authorities tortured and executed Korean independence warriors and their followers during colonial rule from 1910-45, honors about 2,800 Koreans who devoted their lives to the crusade. The hall of fame will be modernized, expanded sharply and used as an educational venue, the OPC said. The biographic dictionary is designed to detail the struggle of about 16,000 fighters over the next five years. With time running out for the aging sex slavery victims, the government will write a white paper to compile the Japanese military’s atrocities and the women’s testimonies, which it will then look to list as a UNESCO world heritage record. “This will help to systematically preserve and manage the history of the so-called comfort women at home and abroad, form a consensus in terms of women’s rights and foster the mood for international solidarity,” the OPC said in a statement. On the unification front, South Korea is considering holding soccer friendlies in Seoul and Pyongyang as it did to celebrate the 60th anniversary. Wrestling and Taekwondo are among other items being considered for inter-Korean sports exchanges. It also plans to launch a special express train this summer linking Asia and Europe, called “Eurasia Express.” Some 250 people from the political, economic, academic and cultural circles and ordinary citizens will gather in Seoul on July 14 before flying to Vladivostok and Beijing for a 20-day journey. Other programs include a joint display of historical records with China, photo exhibitions, a museum on economic development history, music concerts and a science conference.

Concerns persist over Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s drive for a “normal state” and ongoing attempts to undercut the country’s imperial past and previous apologies for wartime atrocities such as its sexual enslavement of Korean women on frontline brothels.This has created tension as South Korea has singled out Tokyo’s atonement for the sex slavery as the prerequisite for reconciliation while the U.S. welcomes Japan’s greater military role in the face of economic woes and budget constraints and calls for greater trilateral security cooperation to better counter North Korean threats. Given many factors having shaped the Korea-Japan relationship, outsiders inevitably have a “limited role” to play in helping to tackle bilateral flashpoints, the retired envoy said, stressing that such complicated issues as history should be handled with “great care.”  Former U.S. Ambassador to Korea Kathleen Stephens. (Shin Hyon-hee/The Korea Herald)“I don’t think that this is a zero-sum game. It seemed to me that the U.S. being strongly engaged and the good communication between the leaders of Japan and the U.S. is a good thing for Korea,” Stephens said in an interview with The Korea Herald on Tuesday in Seoul. “If I were a Korean, I would approach the issue with confidence. If I may, it’s kind of an old thing to say, ‘Wow, the U.S. and Japan are closer, and maybe that means there is going to be some cost somehow to the Korea-U.S. relationship.’ I don’t think it’s ever been true.”During her ambassadorial stint here from 2008 to 11, Stephens turned into an icon of public diplomacy. She blogged about the host country in Korean language, dipped into traditional food and biked all over the lower part of the peninsula. In one summer, she even flew to Jejudo Island to pick abalones and octopuses alongside female divers there. Her affability, professionalism and command of the local language made many Koreans feel more comfortable with her superpower homeland. The knife attack on the incumbent Mark Lippert in March, which she heard about on the radio back in the U.S., came as a shock to her. Yet she soon became “impressed” by his poised management of the incident and swift comeback to the public, as well as the outpouring of support from Koreans, she said. “If you are in diplomacy, if you are in public life of any kind, wherever you are, there are always certain risks involved. … And you try to understand those risks and to mitigate but you can never prevent them entirely,” Stephens said. “I don’t think he’s been dissuaded or discouraged in his commitment and enthusiasm.” Listening to questions with curiosity and care, Stephens appeared fresh and full of vigor. As it was her first trip here in 18 months, she said she was viewing the country with “new eyes” and was excited to go biking again in the countryside, have her favorite food and reunite with Koreans and her two dogs left here, named Yeoyoo (composure) and Mooshim (detachment). To her, public diplomacy is just “one additive” to diplomacy. “From my first diplomatic assignment in 1978, I always felt that to be an effective diplomat, by that I define as someone who is able to perceive and understand to some extent views of the host country and communicate the views of your own country and build, not always agreement, but some kind of deeper appreciation and understanding of each other’s concerns and positions,” Stephens said. “To do that, you couldn’t always talk to the people in the government, and you couldn’t only talk to the people who agree with you. You always have to widen the circle.” The former envoy was visiting Korea to take part in a forum on Jejudo Island and give a lecture at a university in Seoul. After 35 years of diplomatic service, she retired following a brief term as interim ambassador to India concluding last December. She plans to study Asia more as a fellow at Stanford University’s Asia-Pacific Research Center soon. “It’s very clear that how Asia relates within itself and to the outside world is really going to shape the century, whether on a political level or in terms of the regional, trade and security architecture,” Stephens added. “It’s still a new story and developing thing. It’s very interesting.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","sexual enslavement of korean women ,korean women on frontline brothels ,the strained ties between seoul ,enslavement of korean women ,enslavement of korean women on","['Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Korea Kathleen Stephens', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe ’s', 'korean', 'South Korea', 'Tokyo', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'north korean', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'Korea Kathleen Stephens', 'Shin Hyon - hee', 'Herald)“I', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'Stephens', 'the Korea Herald', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'Stephens', 'korean', 'Jejudo Island', 'Koreans', 'Mark Lippert', 'U.S.', 'Koreans', 'Stephens', 'Stephens', 'Koreans', 'Yeoyoo', 'Mooshim', 'Stephens', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'India', 'Stanford University ’s Asia - Pacific Research Center', 'stephen', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",2,"[ 2.          4.          3.         ... -0.48383349  0.27520722

In a word, hundreds around the world are in agreement.""  The statement, issued in the form of an ""open letter in support of historians in Japan,"" came a week after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe failed to offer a clear apology for the sexual slavery or other wartime atrocities when he delivered an unprecedented address at the U.S. Congress.  It showed how much international historians are concerned about Japan's attempt to whitewash history.  The massive addition is expected to put pressure on Abe to address the sexual slavery and other historical issues in a statement he's preparing to issue in August to mark the anniversary of the end of World War II.  Universities that the newly added scholars belong to include Harvard, Columbia, Yale, Princeton, University of Chicago, Stanford, Berkeley, Leiden, Free University, Berlin, Oxford and Oslo, as well as Waseda, Sofia, Nichibunken, Meiji Gakuin, Otsuma and Toyo in Japan.  Big name scholars include Ian Buruma, a renowned scholar on Japan; Franz Waldenberger of the German Institute for Japanese Studies; Sebastian Lechevalier of the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences in Paris; Naoki Sakai of Cornell University and Steven Vogel and Irwin Scheiner of U.C. Berkeley.  Also included were Mike Molasky of the University of Minnesota; Harumi Befu of Stanford University; Ian Neary of Oxford University; Glenda Roberts of Waseda University and Koichi Nakano of Sofia University, according to Dudden.  ""Our responsibility rests on fostering open discussions about Japan and in leaving an honest record of its past for current and future generations. We work together with our colleagues in Japan to do this,"" Dudden said.  She also said she is concerned about ""a new and counterproductive atmosphere within Japan"" that would seek to limit open discussion of certain parts of history and events.  ""The evidence underlying the history of the so-called 'comfort women' makes abundantly clear that large numbers of women were held against their will and subjected to horrific brutality in a state-sponsored system organized by the Japanese military,"" Dudden said.  ""All involved in signing this 'Open Letter' are committed to understanding this history -- and all histories -- as a means to better understand the human condition,"" she said. ""It may sound naive, but I believe that this is what fundamentally holds such a diverse group of people together in this effort.""

324,324,[Herald Interview] ‘U.S. may not need Japan’s consent to deploy forces to Korea’,"The U.S. may not need Japan’s consent to deploy its forces from Japan to the Korean Peninsula in case of a contingency, a Japanese scholar said, noting that Washington has never sought Tokyo’s agreement for a troop dispatch overseas.The issue emerged as another source of diplomatic friction after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said last July that Washington is required to secure “Tokyo’s understanding” shoul...","The U.S. may not need Japan’s consent to deploy its forces from Japan to the Korean Peninsula in case of a contingency, a Japanese scholar said, noting that Washington has never sought Tokyo’s agreement for a troop dispatch overseas.The issue emerged as another source of diplomatic friction after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said last July that Washington is required to secure “Tokyo’s understanding” should it want to send its marines to handle a peninsular crisis.Speculation has since been spreading that the deteriorating relations between Seoul and Tokyo could impede the rapid deployment of U.S. troops from Japan to Korea if any armed conflict breaks out here.  Yuichi Hosoya“In reality, it is extremely difficult (for Japan to oppose the U.S. deployment of its forces to Korea) because the U.S. forces usually do not inform us (Japan) of their deployment to any place like the Iraq War and the Vietnam War,” Yuichi Hosoya, international politics professor at Japan’s Keio University, told The Korea Herald.“After 1960, the U.S. government never ever asked the Japanese government’s consent to agree to the U.S. military operations in areas (abroad). In reality, I don’t think what Prime Minister Abe said was right.”But under the bilateral security treaty, which was revised in 1960 to replace the first 1952 version, there is a clause that mandates the U.S. to secure Japan’s consent when its forces operate in areas surrounding Japan, Hosoya said. “So, in theory, Prime Minister Abe was right by saying that Japan can deny it (the U.S.’ decision to send its forces in Japan to Korea,” he said.Hosoya, who has served as a member of a security advisory group for Prime Minister Abe, was in Seoul last week to attend an academic forum arranged by the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.Commenting on Tokyo’s reinterpretation last year of its war-renouncing Constitution to allow for its limited exercise of “collective self-defense,” Hosoya said the change would help South Korea’s security rather than posing any security challenge.Collective self-defense refers to the use of force to support an ally under attack.“The threat and uncertainty of North Korea is bigger than before, and that is why the U.S. has repeatedly asked the Japanese government to revise the constitutional interpretation,” he said, claiming the “biggest aim” of the reinterpretation is to help South Korea.Under the previous interpretation of the constitution, Japan’s Self-Defense Forces were unable to support U.S. forces operating on a combat mission as Japan could be regarded as exercising collective self-defense, which has been banned under Article 9 of the constitution.“If we cannot exercise collective self-defense, it means the U.S. military should bring oil, water and some of the equipment from the U.S. mainland. It would take time and will be quite costly and it will undoubtedly become a barrier,” he said.“It means there will be more damage to South Korea. If Korea doesn’t like to see the constitutional reinterpretation, we can be happy because we don’t have to provide any logistical support to U.S. forces.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","japan to oppose the deployment ,friction after japanese prime minister ,washington has never sought tokyo ,troops from japan to korea ,the deteriorating relations between seoul","['U.S.', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'Washington', 'Tokyo', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Washington', 'Tokyo ’s', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Yuichi Hosoya“In', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Yuichi Hosoya', 'Japan ’s Keio University', 'the Korea Herald', 'U.S.', 'japanese', 'U.S.', 'Abe', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Hosoya', 'Abe', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Hosoya', 'Abe', 'Seoul', 'the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies', 'Tokyo', 'Hosoya', 'South Korea ’s', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'japanese', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Self - Defense Forces', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'song Sang - ho']",8,"[ 2.         11.          0.         ... -0.40162602  0.32916847

But we argue that it is also necessary,"" the two authors said in a joint article. ""It would unshackle the potential for closer South Korea-Japan relations. It would surmount the historical and territorial issues that have constrained relations between the two countries.""  Snyder said the U.S. can help create an enabling environment for the two countries to reconcile with each other.  ""We've already seen the U.S. involved behind the scenes in establishing a pattern of adherence to past statements,"" he said, referring to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's pledge to honor the country's past statements of apology, including the 1993 Kono Statement.  Chances of a ""grand bargain"" materializing appear low, however.  Despite mounting pressure on Abe to use his U.S. visit last month to address historical issues, the nationalist leader has consistently refused to offer a clear apology for the sexual slavery issue, let alone compensate victims.   Japan has also been reinforcing its claims to Dokdo in school textbooks.

Dogs were the second-most killed animals followed by wild animals, with 12 percent and 7 percent, respectively. In terms of districts, Gangnam-gu in southern Seoul recorded the most roadkill accidents with an average of 15 cases a day. Guro-gu and Geumcheon-gu in the southwestern region had 12 daily cases on average. Eunpyeong-gu in northwestern Seoul, on the other hand, recorded almost none, with just 0.2 daily cases. The lawmaker urged the Seoul Metropolitan Government to take preventive measures to save animals.“Mayor Park Won-soon put the animal-saving agenda on his list of top 10 welfare polices as part of his reelection pledges last year but (the mayor) has remained silent on the roadkill issue,” Lee said. As part of efforts to curb roadkill accidents, the Environment Ministry and some municipalities have pushed since 2007 to install ecological corridors or preventive fences near roads to lead the animals to safer paths.Once roadkill cases are reported to the public call center ― by dialing 120 ― animal corpses are recovered by the city, officials said.

South Korea remains technically at war with North Korea.Criminalizing those who object to military duty, however, constitutes a violation of human rights, Amnesty International said in its latest report ""Sentenced to Life,"" released at a press conference in Seoul. South Korea currently imprisons more than 600 conscientious objectors, or more than the rest of the world put together, according to the report.Most of them are Jehovah's Witnesses, a Christian group that opposes war, and in their early 20s.Apart from South Korea, only four United Nations member states -- Eritrea, Singapore, Turkey and Turkmenistan -- are believed to have held conscientious objectors in prison as of 2013.Song In-ho, 25, who declined to serve military duty because of his Christian beliefs, said he knew from an early age he would end up in jail.""I was born a criminal. All my life I felt like I was imprisoned because I knew I would be sent to jail,"" Song, who now works for a cleaning company, was quoted as saying in the report.""I was a future criminal.""Not only is rejecting military service shameful, it also spells the end of a prestigious career, Song said.South Korea had at one point considered introducing alternative service for conscientious objectors as demanded by Amnesty International.In 2007, the Ministry of National Defense made the pledge to do so in two years, but the plan fizzled after the Lee Myung-bak administration took power in 2008.South Korea fears conscientious objection may jeopardize national security and undermine social cohesion.A court ruling Tuesday challenged the view.In the first ruling of its kind in eight years, the Gwangju District Court in South Jeolla Province acquitted three Jehovah's Witnesses of violating the Military Service Law.""We need to harmonize the rights to conscience as stated in the constitution and the duty to serve in the military,"" Judge Choi Chang-seok said. The Supreme Court is expected to throw out the acquittal, as it did in 2004 and 2007.The Constitutional Court also ruled in 2004 and 2011 that punishing conscientious objectors is constitutional.

The unicameral parliament also passed a separate resolution, opposing Japan's move to obtain UNESCO world heritage site status for several industrial facilities where many Koreans were coerced into slave labor during the 1910-45 colonial era.These resolutions came on the heels of a similar National Assembly resolution denouncing Japan's history distortion adopted right after Abe's Congress speech on April 29.

The latest figure is 900 more than what Seoul's Military Cyber Command reported to the National Assembly in October.""North Korea appears to have been concentrating on boosting its ability to launch online warfare as one of the core asymmetric capabilities, along with nuclear and missile programs,"" the officer said.The North is believed to be linked to a series of leaks of data on South Korea's nuclear power plants in December. The U.S. has also accused Pyongyang of being behind the hacking of Sony Pictures in November over its comedy film ""The Interview,"" which depicts a plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.In the wake of growing security threats online, South Korea has decided to drop its long-held defensive tactics in cyber warfare and instead initiate proactive operations. To better guard against enemies' online infiltrations, it is pushing to establish a new team in charge of cyber operations under the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) while increasing its personnel from the current 600 to 1,000.Meanwhile, the communist North is believed to have dispatched an increased number of anti-aircraft guns and established wind vanes along the western and central border regions in a move to counter propaganda leaflets floated by South Korean civic groups.The North has long bashed the South for not preventing its civic activists from sending anti-Pyongyang leaflets that criticize the North Korean regime across the border, and vowed harsh retaliation against such moves. Despite Pyongyang's repeated calls, the Seoul government has maintained it cannot stop the cross-border campaigns, citing the groups' freedom of speech. ""North Korea has continued to stage drills against the balloons by mobilizing anti-aircraft, anti-tank guns and artillery troops, according to our analysis,"" the Seoul officer said, noting that the South Korean military has been closely watching their movements.In October, the two Koreas exchanged machine gun fire across the tense border, after the North apparently tried to shoot down balloons carrying propaganda leaflets flown from the South.

South Korea's ODA contribution reached US$1.85 billion last year, after recording the sharpest growth rate in ODA spending over the five years among the member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. But the foreign ministry in charge of ODA failed to strategize on the fund, which was, as a result, inefficiently distributed to many international organizations in small sums, the BAI said in a statement. ""Despite the growing size of the fund for multilateral development cooperation, the concerned ministry let the fund managed by several divisions in charge of international organizations, without rules or guidelines on a strategy, plan, internal review process, or result assessment and management of the fund,"" according to the BAI statement.The Foreign Ministry unilaterally promised the World Bank in 2012 to make contributions to the bank's Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund without necessary consultations with the finance ministry, which is in charge of overseeing contributions to global financial organizations, the audit agency said.Despite the finance ministry's resistance, the foreign ministry had to keep its promise and gave $10 million to the World Bank. BAI said the assistance ended without continuation, impairing the effectiveness of South Korea's ODA provision. The Foreign Ministry also failed to follow a proper accounting rule when spending $500,000 for the launch of the South Korea-Mekong cooperation fund in 2013, according to BAI.""The foreign minister is advised to prepare internal guidelines so the alloted fund for international organizations can be provided efficiently,"" the audit agency said.

Yonhap News Agency obtained a copy of the statement.The scholars included Pulitzer Prize winner Herbert Bix of Binghamton University; William Paterson University history professor Theodore F. Cook; Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor John Dower; Harvard University professor Ezra Vogel and University of Chicago professor Bruce Cummings.The statement has been delivered to Abe, according to University of Connecticut professor Alexis Dudden. ""There is no easy path to a 'correct history.' Much of the archives of the Japanese imperial military was destroyed. The actions of local procurers who provided women to the military may never have been recorded,"" the statement said.""But historians have unearthed numerous documents demonstrating the military's involvement in the transfer of women and oversight of brothels. Important evidence also comes from the testimony of victims,"" it said. ""The aggregate record they offer is compelling and supported by official documents.""Though the suffering of victims should not be used for nationalist ends, ""denying or trivializing what happened to them is equally unacceptable,"" it said.Historians estimate more than 200,000 women, mainly from Korea which was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II.But Japan has long attempted to water down the atrocity.The sexual slavery issue has been the biggest thorn in frayed relations between Japan and South Korea, with Seoul demanding Tokyo take steps to address the grievances of the now elderly Korean victims and Japan refusing to do so.""Among the many instances of wartime sexual violence and military prostitution in the 20th century, the 'comfort women' system was distinguished by its large scale and systematic management under the military, and by its exploitation of young, poor, and vulnerable women in areas colonized or occupied by Japan,"" the statement said.It said the historians disagree over the precise number of victims, but ""ultimately, whether the numbers are judged to have been in the tens of thousands or the hundreds of thousands will not alter the fact of the exploitation carried out throughout the Japanese empire and the war zones.""Even though historians dispute how directly the Japanese military was involved and whether women were coerced into sexual slavery, the statement said the ""evidence makes clear that large numbers of women were held against their will and subjected to horrific brutality.""It also said that employing legalistic arguments focused on particular terms or isolated documents to challenge the victims' testimony ""both misses the fundamental issue of their brutalization and ignores the larger context of the inhumane system that exploited them.""""This year presents an opportunity for the government of Japan to show leadership by addressing Japan's history of colonial rule and wartime aggression in both words and action,"" the statement said. Noting that Abe spoke of the universal value of human rights, the importance of human security, and the suffering that Japan caused other countries, the statement said, ""We applaud these sentiments and urge Prime Minister to act boldly on all of them.""We waited to hear what Prime Minister Abe would say during his speeches in the United States last week, and unfortunately his one brief aside comment about this issue further brushed away Japanese state responsibility for this awful history,"" professor Dudden, who led the statement, told Yonhap.""In short, this statement is a direct appeal to the Japanese government to address this history squarely, accept responsibility for it ... and to desist from further distortions and politicization,"" she said.Dudden also said that she was thrilled to see more historians sign the statement than expected.""They are not only in the U.S, but also all over the world including Europe and Australia.

The service, called an “amber alert” in the U.S., will allow users to receive information such as missing children’s photos, names and ages. It will send the alerts 3.5 times per month and release them only with the parent’s consent. Until now, police relied only on its smartphone application to spread information on missing children. The alerts were also shared among local banks, media outlets and hospitals. With the new alert system, the police will access nearly 14 million Facebook users nationwide and the company’s location tracking system to track down missing children. The police also signed an agreement with Korea’s top portal operator Naver to distribute missing children information since late April.

Specific plans on how to revise the existing names will also be discussed on Friday at a meeting of its advisory committee, which includes native English speakers.“It is important for the English name of a government organization to allow foreigners easily understand specifically what the organization does, and what its role is,” a ministry official said.The ministry has been discussing potential new English names with government agencies since March. For example, it has suggested that the Korean National Police Agency should erase “Korean” from its title. Officials explained that most police activities take place in Korea anyway, and when the agency’s name is spelled out in international events, the phrase “Republic of Korea” is automatically attached after the title. But the agency reportedly argued that it needed to retain its current name to differentiate itself from other countries’ police agencies with similar names.Confusing translations of government agencies have long been a source of complaint among foreigners in Korea, as many of them tend to be unclear in terms of describing their actual functions.For instance, the former Lee Myung-bak administration’s Ministry of Knowledge Economy ― now the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy ― caused confusion as its official title depicted an idea far from the organization’s actual role. The ministry oversaw international trade, foreign investment, energy projects and overall Korean industry and was not directly related to the concept of “knowledge economy,” or economy based on value created by knowledge.The Park Geun-hye administration’s agencies are said to have clearer English names than their predecessors. But it, too, has its share of strange-sounding names. The Ministry of Strategy and Finance was another English name criticized by foreigners, who said the word “strategy” was redundant as all ministries’ plans involve some sort of strategy.The Ministry of Patriots and Veteran Affairs is in charge of affairs related to veterans and those acknowledged by the state to have dedicated their lives in meritorious service of Korea. But to describe the latter, the ministry uses the word “patriot,” which simply means anyone who loves and strongly supports their country.A 35-year-old from Britain said this sounded as if the ministry is “a government body that decides who loves the country.”While some names depicted a ministry’s nonexistent roles, others actually reduced the scope of their functions. The Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning covers the general field of science and technology, but its name suggests that it specifically tackles science and information technology. Native English speakers also had a hard time grasping what was meant by “future planning,” as all ministries plan for the future.Some ministries resorted to repeating redundant words such as Ministry of Government Administration and Home Affairs, Ministry of Public Safety and Security and Ministry of Employment and Labor.

It will translate the document into Japanese and distribute 1,000 copies on Aug. 6, 70 years after the U.S. dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima. The Nagasaki attack took place three days later. More than 200,000 Koreans were believed to have been taken to Hiroshima and Nagasaki to work at facilities such as the shipyards where Mitsubishi Heavy Industries manufactured warships, torpedoes and other military and industrial supplies. They were also mobilized for reconstruction work later on and so were further exposed to residual radiation, according to the document.To better promote the pain endured by the forced laborers, the committee in April 2012 agreed with a Tokyo-based civic group specialized in translation to publish 49 related books and papers in Japanese. Civic groups and historians assess that about 100,000 of the 740,000 victims were Korean. Some 50,000 of them died in the aftermath of the two attacks, while about 43,000 survivors returned home. Last week, a group of bombing victims and civic organizations shed light on their sufferings for the first time during a conference at the U.N. to review the Nonproliferation Treaty, which had so far dealt with the issue focusing on Japanese casualties. “The 43,000 returnees passed away amid social indifference, their physical wounds and aftereffects untreated,” Shim Jin-tae, a 72-year-old Korean whose father was drafted to work at a Hiroshima military base, was quoted as saying at the session. “Japan must stop distorting the history of its aggressive war and colonial rule and apologize and offer compensation to them.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","the 1945 bombings of hiroshima ,week group of bombing victims ,an atomic bomb on hiroshima ,investigating forced conscription during japanese ,drafted to work at hiroshima","['Seoul', 'korean', 'Hiroshima', 'Nagasaki', 'Japan', 'Prime Minister ’s Office', 'japanese', 'japanese', 'U.S.', 'Hiroshima', 'Nagasaki', 'Koreans', 'Hiroshima', 'Nagasaki', 'Mitsubishi Heavy Industries', 'Tokyo', 'Japanese', 'korean', 'U.N.', 'japanese', 'Shim Jin - tae', 'Korean', 'Hiroshima', 'Japan', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",12,"[ 0.          2.          2.         ... -0.01177865  0.20582069

The resolution will be put to a final endorsement at the National Assembly’s plenary session Wednesday.“We strongly condemn Japanese attempts to list the wartime facilities as World Heritage by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. We believe it constitutes a diplomatic provocation and poses a grave concern on the peace and stability of North East Asia,” the resolution said. Submitted by Rep. Lee Won-wook of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy and other lawmakers from ruling and opposition parties, the bill also urged the Korean government to ensure Japan stops denying its wrongdoing during its rule of Korea from 1910 to 1945. The resolution comes amid Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe administration’s years-long push to win UNESCO’s approval for wartime facilities on the World Heritage list. Earlier this year, the administration submitted an application to include of the facilities on the UNESCO World Heritage list.The Korean government has criticized the Japanese government’s move, stating the facilities ― dubbed “the modern industrial heritage sites in Kyushu and Yamaguchi” ― include 11 wartime mobilization sites where nearly 60,000 Korean workers were coerced into slave labor during World War II.“I believe Japan’s attempt to list those facilities as UNESCO World Heritage runs counter to the founding spirit of the (UNESCO’s) Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, which is designed to protect heritage with universal values,” said Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se.The International Council on Monuments and Sites, a non-government body, has been reviewing Japan’s submission. It is expected to provide its recommendations in May to the World Heritage Committee, an inter-government body.The 21-member committee is expected to decide whether to list the facilities on the UNESCO World Heritage at a 2015 session to be held between June 28 and July 8. More than two-thirds of members must vote yes for the proposal to be approved.

All but one listed on the memo are close associates of the president.The prime minister has since quit and Park has called for a thorough probe into the scandal.Park also said a recent deal by the rival political parties on pension reform for civil servants fell short of public expectation.The rival parties have agreed to pass a bill on Wednesday that would require civil servants to pay more into and receive less in pension over the next two decades.South Korea's civil service pension has long faced a looming crisis and caused a deficit of 12 trillion won every year until last year.Previous presidents have delayed addressing the issue, despite knowing the current system is unsustainable.

The North could also use the detainees as a negotiating chip should inter-Korean talks reopen.When announcing last month the arrest of the two CNN interviewees -- Kim Kuk-gi and Choe Chun-gil -- North Korea accused them of working as spies for South Korea's main intelligence agency National Intelligence Service (NIS), branding them ""heinous terrorists.""

North Korean minders were present during the interviews, CNN said.CNN also said North Korea is often accused of pushing detainees to make false confessions.Kim was quoted as telling CNN that he was a missionary struggling financially in northern China when the South's spy agency recruited him. They offered to pay for information about the North, such as itineraries of visits by leaders to foreign countries and copies of new North Korean currency to be used in forgery.Kim was also quoted as saying he was paid about $500,000 over roughly nine years.Choe said he was working as a businessman in northern China when he was approached by the South's spy agency to gather information and materials from North Korea.

It was the first time that the issue of Korean A-bomb victims has been raised at a U.N. meeting.Previous conferences have dealt only with the issue of Japanese victims.The Hiroshima bombing on Aug. 6, 1945 left about 440,000 killed and injured, and 70,000 were Koreans.

The four entertainers of the Unhasu orchestra, a top music group where Kim’s wife Ri Sol-ju is known to have previously worked, were killed in the wake of a sex scandal involving them. Kim Yong-chol, former head of the North’s Reconnaissance General Bureau who is believed to be the mastermind behind the communist country’s deadly attack on a South Korean corvette in 2010, was recently demoted to a three-star general again, the lawmakers said, adding that his rank had been changed at least four times over the last three years. “Kim tends to carry through his thinking without accepting any excuses or reasons at all that may block it, and if you raise any other opinion, you will get executed as an example of what happens when you challenge his authority,” Shin told reporters. “He instantly gives you an order, and you will get demoted if you don’t follow.” The 15 deaths are part of the ongoing string of slayings the Kim regime has been engaging in to tighten his grip since the shock execution in December 2013 of his uncle Jang Song-thaek who was once dubbed the country’s second most influential man. The NIS confirmed that an additional 41 officials were killed last year, Shin noted.Despite lingering uncertainties, the agency sees “quite a high possibility” that Kim will travel to Moscow next month for his maiden overseas outing to take part in a ceremony marking the 70th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany, he added. By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","additional 41 officials were killed ,attack on south korean corvette ,don follow the 15 deaths ,of slayings the kim regime ,shock execution in december 2013","['North Korea', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Seoul ’s National Intelligence Service', 'N.K.', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'Lee Cheol - woo', 'Shin Kyoung - min', 'Unhasu', 'Kim', 'Ri Sol - ju', 'Kim Yong - chol', 'the North ’s Reconnaissance General Bureau', 'communist', 'south korean', 'Kim', 'Shin', 'Kim', 'Jang Song - thaek', 'NIS', 'Shin', 'Kim', 'Moscow', 'Nazi Germany', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.19590174  0.52776873

They are the main characters in the stage production “Flower Petals,” recently played at Byeol Orum theater in the Korea National Theater Complex in Seoul. Directed by Lee Kang-seon, the show is scheduled to go on stage in Hanam Cultural Art Center in May, and in Guro Art Valley Theater in August.  A scene from “Flower Petals”Based on the award-winning play “Hotel Splendid” by American playwright and poet Lavonne Mueller, the play deals with untold stories of Korean women who were conscripted to serve the imperial Japanese military as sex slaves and the hell they endured in the jungles of Southeast Asia. More than the cruelties associated with sex slavery, the play is about women struggling with their own inner beings, the transformation of the self while traversing from innocence to the harsh realities of the war. Through a montage of scenes involving these women ranging from a premenstrual girl of 11 years old (Sun-hee) to a mother (Ok-dong), “Flower Petals” attempts and succeeds in showing human conditions under duress, their spiritual space invaded by way of rape 20 times or more, that is, in one day. This sort of abuse of humanity is hard to imagine for an average person in 2015, and even for Ok-dong, who views her own life as unreal. She recalls and hangs on to those intimate moments with her husband back home when he was alive. She tells Sun-hee that someday when the war is over, she will meet a nice man whom she will want to share intimate moments with. Sun-hee does not believe her; she cannot imagine that “that” could be tender and wonderful.  This document was issued by the Army department of personnel affairs in 1938, launching a “recruitment” campaign for comfort stations.While Ok-dong perceives her life of a sexual slave in the barracks as a temporary condition, Keum-soon is frantic to escape from the present. Keum-soon urges everyone to escape together, but they are afraid of what would happen to them if they are caught. Keum-soon eventually escapes alone. There are some who claim that sex slavery did not happen during the war. They say that the women were willing prostitutes who were compensated in exchange for their sexual services, a commercial arrangement rather than a forced conscription. Brothels in military bases are a commonly accepted practice in time of war, they say. The women testify otherwise. Sun-hee tells us that soldiers dragged her to the truck her mother was already on. She held her mother’s warm hand and leaned against her, until they were separated. Keum-soon talks about her grandfather who was slain while trying to protect her from the soldiers who rolled into her village to forcibly round up young girls. Bo-bae, years later, recalls that their bodies were mere military supply items, like guns and swords distributed to the soldiers in battlefields. All in all, Keum-soon, Ok-dong, Sun-hee and Bo-bae represent just four of 200,000 stories that took place over the period of 13 years of offensive campaign the imperial Japanese military waged in Asia. One only needs to study the historical records to see that the Japanese army was the primary organizer of the slavery system.By John Cha John Cha lives and writes in Oakland, California.

It was the first question to Abe during the conference.  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe giving a speech at Harvard University on April 27, 2015. (Yonhap)Abe also said his cabinet upholds the 1993 Kono Statement, in which Japan apologized for the atrocity, and has no intention of revising the statement.  He went on to say that ""women's dignity and basic human rights have often been infringed upon during wars"" throughout the 20th century, a remark that could be seen as meaning that Japan is not the only violator of women's rights.  The words, ""deeply pained,"" are one of the expressions that Abe has used in order not to mention ""apology"" when it comes to the sexual slavery issue. Another expression is that his ""heart aches"" when thinking of the sexual slavery victims.  Abe used that expression Monday during a discussion with Harvard University students.  ""When it comes to the comfort women issue, my heart aches when I think about those people who were victimized by human trafficking and who were subject to immeasurable pain and suffering beyond description,"" Abe said Monday.  The selection of the term ""human trafficking,"" instead of sexual slavery, was also seen as an attempt to evade Japan's responsibility because the term is usually associated in South Korea and some other Asian nations with private prostitution.  Abe's word play dashed hope for him to issue a clear apology when he addresses Congress on Wednesday.  Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mainly from Korea, which was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. But Japan has long attempted to water down the atrocity.  Such efforts have intensified after Abe came to power.  Abe's cabinet, for example, angered South Korea last year with its attempt to ""review"" the Kono Statement of apology. Though Japan later said it still stands by the apology, the move was seen as an attempt to undermine the apology's credibility.   His government also came under strong criticism last year after pressuring an American publisher to revise a description of the sexual slavery issue in a school textbook in an apparent attempt to water down the atrocity.  Wednesday's address would make Abe the first prime minister to address a joint meeting of Congress.  Critics have said Abe is unworthy of the honor because he has attempted to whitewash Japan's militaristic past and wartime atrocities, especially the sexual slavery, refusing to acknowledge the country's responsibility and compensate victims.  In front of Congress, about 200 people from South Korea, the U.S. and China held a rally urging Abe to apologize. Those attending the rally included a surviving sexual slavery victim, Lee Yong-soo, and a South Korean lawmaker, Kim Jong-hoon.  ""Abe keeps lying that they never took (comfort women) by force, but I'm a living witness who was taken to Japan's kamikaze unit in Taiwan at age 15,"" Lee told the rally. ""If he has a little bit of conscience left, Abe should formally apologize and make legal compensation.""  Brian Becker, executive director of ANSWER Coalition, a major anti-war and civil rights group, urged Abe to stop playing ""word games.""  ""We can't forget the past because if we do, it will repeat,"" he said. ""So Prime Minister Abe needs to take full responsibility, not play word games, but actually take full accountability and responsibility for those crimes, to apologize, to compensate victims and to be able to say this will never ever happen again.""  Also Tuesday, Korean-American organizations ran a full-page ad in the Washington Post in the form of an ""open letter"" to the peoples of the U.S. and Japan, urging Abe to learn from Germany and offer a clear apology for wartime crimes.  ""There is no place better than the U.S. Capitol for Abe to accept the Japanese Imperial government's role in crimes against humanity during World War II, and to offer a clear and unequivocal apology to all victims,"" the letter said.  ""We, the people of all colors, sincerely hope that Japan will overcome its shameful past by facing the historical facts, not by hiding or covering them up, and become a true champion in the global community,"" it said.  The newspaper also said in an editorial that Abe should include ""Japan's understanding of and remorse for its wartime offenses"" in his congressional speech on Wednesday and a statement he is preparing to issue in August to mark the 70th anniversary of World War II.

The dispatch is designed to request the members of U.S. Congress, where the premier is scheduled to deliver an address on Wednesday, to urge him to “voice clearly and publicly” and offer a “heartfelt apology” for Tokyo’s colonial rule and aggression. The text was written jointly by the Women’s Forum for Peace and Diplomacy, Korean Women’s Bar Association, Civil Peace Forum and People’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy. It was sent to U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry, Ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert, House Speaker John Boehner and seven other Senate and House leaders. The four organizations criticized Abe’s ongoing attempts to undermine Japan’s responsibility during World War II despite its support for U.N. Security Council resolutions against sexual violence against women during armed conflict. “Abe is showing a revisionist stance and even attempting to rewrite history,” the letter read. “It is sad and painful to see that the old ladies, the victims of wartime slavery, are passing away one by one without their rights restored nor receiving the reparation to which they are entitled.” They also expressed concerns over recent calls by political leaders in Washington on Seoul and Tokyo to forge a future-oriented partnership and pursue pragmatic cooperation rather than “dwell on the past.” Without sincere efforts to redress the atrocities, Abe’s speech will send the wrong message to not only East Asia but also the world and dent U.S. leadership, they said. “If the Japanese government keeps evading truthfully acknowledging and repenting the criminal act of war in the past, it is not only Japan that might fail to exert leadership in promoting peace in the East Asian region, but U.S. leadership may face corresponding challenges,” it added.

But what's important is that they find ways to express it and they find ways to indicate that they understand what the concerns of others are,"" Steinberg told a press conference in Seoul.  Steinberg was in Seoul to attend a two-day forum hosted by the Asan Institute for Policy Studies under the theme of ""Is the U.S. back?""  Abe began his weeklong trip to the U.S. this week. His itinerary includes a speech at a joint session of Congress, the first of its kind for a Japanese prime minister.  During his speech at Harvard University in Boston on Monday, Abe did not provide an apology for Japan's wartime sexual enslavement of Korean and other Asian women. He used the phrase ""human trafficking"" in describing the sex slaves without specifying the perpetrator.  In Japanese, the phrase ""human trafficking"" does not have a meaning of coercion, indicating that Abe is sticking to his previous vague statement on the issue that has frayed Tokyo's relations with Seoul.  Steinberg said Seoul should place more emphasis on whether Abe is willing to come to terms with Japan's wartime wrongdoing rather than every word that Abe used or will use for his congressional speech or a new statement due in August.  ""We should focus less on trying to parse the nuance of language, but (we should) focus more on questions about whether there is a kind of reconciliation in coming to terms with concerns about the past that allow us to move forward,"" Steinberg said.  He said that Washington's role is to ""encourage"" Seoul and Tokyo to deal with the history issue, not to put pressure on both sides to resolve it.  ""We can have a suggestion ... but I think it would be counterproductive for the U.S. to try to (put) pressure on Japan or pressure on South Korea or pressure on any of our friends,"" he added.  Steinberg said Seoul has ""sincere"" concerns about the shared history and a ""genuine"" motive to resolve the issue but also cautioned that anyone should not potentially ""misuse"" the history issue to achieve other objectives.  ""What's important is for each side to really understand challenges that the other faces and try to find ways to meet their own needs,"" he said.

(Yonhap)The selection of the term ""human trafficking,"" instead of sexual slavery, was also seen as an attempt to evade Japan's responsibility because the term is usually associated in South Korea and some other Asian nations with private prostitution.  Monday's remark bodes ill for the prospect of a clear apology from Abe when he addresses the U.S. Congress.  ""Several times in the past, I have had the occasion to mention that I will uphold the Kono Statement. From such a standpoint, Japan has made various efforts from the perspective of offering realistic relief for the comfort women,"" Abe said, referring to a 1993 statement of apology for the crime.  ""In the 20th century, we have seen a history where once conflict arises, women's human rights and honor are deeply wounded. We had such a history. In the 21st century, we should not make this history which is akin to the 20th century,"" he said.  Abe also said Japan will work harder to promote women's rights.  Asked about what Japan can do to reduce tensions in the Asia-Pacific region, Abe only mentioned ""deep remorse"" about World War II and said Japan will make efforts to improve ties with South Korea and China.  Outside the auditorium, dozens of students and other protesters, including one surviving sexual slavery victim, Lee Yong-soo, held a rally, lining a road leading to the auditorium's main entrance and forcing Abe to use a back door to get into the building.  Protesters held such signs as ""Abe, stop denying! Unequivocal apology now!"" ""Heartache is not an apology,"" ""Justice for survivors,"" ""Your denial is killing them twice."" Lee, the victim, was sitting in a wheelchair holding a sign that read, ""I am a survivor of Japanese military sexual slavery.""  ""The prime minister of a country should use the main entrance with his head held high if he didn't do anything wrong,"" Lee said. ""Abe, what are you so afraid of?""  Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mainly from Korea, which was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. But Japan has long attempted to whitewash the atrocity.  The sexual slavery issue has been the biggest thorn in frayed relations between Japan and South Korea, with Seoul demanding Tokyo take steps to address the grievances of elderly Korean victims of the atrocity and Japan refusing to do so.  Abe arrived in Boston on Sunday, kicking off a weeklong visit to the U.S. seen as a celebration of the ever-growing security and economic partnerships between Tokyo and Washington. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry hosted a dinner for Abe on Sunday.  Later Monday, Abe flew to Washington for summit talks with President Barack Obama, set for Tuesday, and an address before a joint session of Congress on Wednesday.   In a surprise appearance, Obama joined Abe in an unannounced visit to the Lincoln Memorial in central Washington. Photos showed the two leaders walking side by side up the stairs to the statue of the former U.S. president and talking to each other   Abe also paid a visit to Arlington National Cemetery and the Holocaust Memorial Museum.  The congressional speech, set for Wednesday, will be the first of its kind for a Japanese prime minister and symbolizes the grand welcome the U.S. is throwing for a leader who has helped address U.S. security and economic needs in a region marked by China's rise  Critics say Abe is unworthy of the privilege because he has attempted to whitewash Japan's militaristic past and wartime atrocities, especially the sexual slavery, refusing to acknowledge the country's responsibility and compensate victims.  In the runup to the visit, pressure mounted on Abe to resolve history tensions, with a bipartisan group of 25 congressmen sending a joint letter urging him to address history issues, as well as mainstream U.S. media, including The New York Times, saying the success of Abe's visit depends on how honestly he confronts Japan's wartime history.  Despite such pressure, however, widespread indications are that Abe is unlikely to offer a sincere apology for the wartime atrocities, including the sexual slavery issue, which would mean that Seoul-Tokyo relations won't get better any time soon.

The laws also don’t recognize any other forms of sexual penetration ― such as forced anal or oral sex, or inserting of a foreign object into the body ― as rape, regardless of the gender of the victim.Scholars and legal experts say the current law fails to protect victims of sexual violence with its limited definition of rape, especially those in the military who are vulnerable to power abuse.“The current law says that penetration of the vagina by the male sex organ is the most serious form of sexual abuse,” said Chang Da-hye, a legal scholar at the Korean Institute of Criminology. “But when you think about it, the physical and emotional damage to a victim who experienced penetration of other body parts can be in fact more serious than those who have been ‘raped’ as defined by the current law.”‘Rape’ and ‘like-rape’In many countries, including the U.S. and France, rape is defined as any act of sexual penetration, whatever its nature, committed against another person. The International Criminal Court defines it as any “penetration, however slight, of any part of the body of the victim or of the perpetrator with a sexual organ, or the anal or genital opening of the victim with any object or any other part of the body.”The World Health Organization defines it as “physically forced or otherwise coerced penetration ― even if slight ― of the vulva or anus, using body parts or an object.”Yet in Korea, the definition of rape is specifically limited to penetration of the female genitals by the male sex organ, and other forms of forced sexual penetration are defined as “like-rape” ― which carry lighter penalties than what the law defines as “rape.”Currently, the Korean law stipulates that the punishment for “rape” is imprisonment for a definite term of at least three years, which is the heaviest among all forms of criminalized sexual activities against able-bodied adults. Those who commit what the law defines as “like rape” as of 2013 ― “inserting one’s genitals into the inner part of another person’s body such as mouth or anus except genitals, or inserting a part of his or her body other than genitals, such as a finger, or any foreign objects into another person’s body” ― are punishable by at least two years in prison. Those who “rape” a person with disabilities are punishable by at least seven years behind bars, while those who commit “like rape” against a person with disabilities only face at least five years imprisonment.“The law should either expand its definition of rape ― by combining the current definitions of ‘rape’ and ‘like-rape’ ― or enforce heavier penalties on those who commit ‘like-rape,’ to an equivalent level of the ones on ‘rape,’” said Chun Jung-ah, an attorney who has represented many victims of sexual violence.“Ultimately, it’s the judge who makes the final decision for every case. But if the law stipulates that the penalties for ‘rape’ are heavier than the ones for ‘like-rape,’ it’s certainly more likely that those with ‘like-rape’ charges will face lighter punishment.”Patriarchy factorUntil 1995, Korea’s rape laws were under the chapter of “chastity crimes” of the criminal code. It was only in 2013 that the definition of “like-rape” was introduced and criminalized. Also until the same year, it did not acknowledge rape by women and therefore it was impossible for male victims to file complaints with the police.“Until 1995, the primary purpose of rape laws was to protect married women’s chastity (and virginity), to minimize their chance of bearing illegitimate children. It’s linked to the patriarchal notion that values pure bloodlines above all else,” said scholar Chang at the Korean Institute of Criminology. “Traditionally, when a woman was raped, it was considered as a damage to her husband or her father, and the reputation of her household, not herself. Such notions made it impossible for lawmakers to think of women as potential rapists in the past. It also made it difficult for them to think that rape can also occur between same-sex individuals.”The law now stipulates that it is to protect an individual’s sexual autonomy, regardless of his or her gender. However, Kim Jong-hye, a visiting researcher at the GongGam Human Rights Law Foundation, said the current rape laws contradict with what it’s supposed to protect, by separating “rape” and “like-rape.”“If its primary purpose is to protect women’s chastity and the so-called ‘pure bloodlines’ of households, the current law makes sense, because a forced penetration of female sex organ by the male sex organ is the only form of abuse that can lead to an unwanted pregnancy,” Kim said. “But if the purpose is to protect one’s sexual autonomy, as it is stated in the law, then how is a penetration of genitals any worse than any other forms of penetration? They are all a serious invasion of one’s sexual autonomy and violation of human rights.”Kim argued that the current law promotes a notion that for women, losing their virginity or chastity is the most serious form of damage, and something that a woman victim should be ashamed of. “It’s like a vicious cycle,” she said. “The laws reflect today’s society, where many female victims of sexual violence are still blamed for being too drunk or being too sexually provocative. And by enforcing heavier penalties for ‘rape’ than ‘like-rape,’ the laws spread the idea that the most serious or cruel form of sexual abuse is done by the male sex organ only.”Military power abuseExperts say the most vulnerable under the current law are in fact male victims of military sexual violence by their male superiors. “Most of sexual violence cases against women involve both ‘rape’ and ‘like-rape.’ It’s rare for rapists to commit ‘like-rape’ only (against women),’” said Bae Bok-ju, an activist supporting women with disabilities who have been sexually abused. “So if convicted, the perpetrator who abused women can be punished for both ‘rape’ and ‘like-rape.’ But male perpetrators who abused men will only be punished on the grounds of ‘like-rape,’ which carry lighter penalties, under the current law.”Korea’s military criminal law also differentiates “rape” and “like-rape,” and stipulates heavier penalties for rape charges -― imprisonment of at least five years ― than for ‘like-rape,’ which is punishable by at least three years in prison. According to the law, all sexual abuse between same-sex soldiers can only be charged with “like-rape.”Last year, a male Army conscript surnamed Yoon died after six male colleagues allegedly hit him in the chest while he was eating, which led him to choke on his food. According to the Military Human Rights Center, Yoon had been constantly sexually assaulted by the bullies, on top of being physically and verbally abused on a daily basis. Also last year, a 26-year-old army sergeant was arrested on charges of sexually abusing his subordinate at least three times in his residence.According to a 2013 study by Gallup Korea, an independent research firm, 37.6 percent of Korean men in their 20s and 30s said they have either witnessed or heard about sexual abuse cases while serving their military duties, while 31.2 percent said they think the issue of military sexual violence as a form of power abuse is serious.Ninety percent of perpetuators of military sex abuse cases among male individuals were the victims’ superiors, according to a 2013 scholarly thesis by Lim Tae-hun, who heads the Military Human Rights Center. Some 470 military sexual abuse cases were reported in 2013, but only 39.5 percent ended with a conviction, according to data released by Lim’s organization. Many cases remain unreported. Education needed Lawyer Chun has witnessed many male victims of sexual violence by men end up dropping charges. She said all male and female victims of sexual violence can experience severe post-traumatic stress regardless of the perpetrator’s gender. “Many male victims I’ve seen, however, suffer from an extreme sense of humiliation, which I think is different from the (reaction) of female victims,” she said. “One of the victims in fact told me, ‘I thought only women become victims of sexual abuse. I feel so humiliated that this actually has happened to me, and I don’t know who to share this with. I can’t even tell my close friends.’ A lot of them withdraw a complaint because they feel humiliated about talking to the police ― or in court ― about their experience. They have a hard time accepting themselves as victims.”Shin Jin-hee, a court-appointed attorney, said the system at the Court for Armed Forces should change as much as the current rape laws. One of the biggest existing problems, she said, is that the court very often does not inform soldier victims of military abuse that they have the right to speak to a lawyer, and are entitled to a court-appointed attorney if they can’t afford to hire one. “The law should be revised, that is for sure,” she said. “But I think what is desperately needed in military as well as the civil Korean society is human rights education, and that you can’t use sexual harassment or abuse as a ‘means of discipline’ or anything else.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","rape last year male army ,months in prison for sexually ,rape last year male ,penalties for rape charges imprisonment ,factoruntil 1995 korea rape laws","['Korea', 'Chang Da - hye', 'the Korean Institute of Criminology', 'U.S.', 'France', 'the International Criminal Court', 'World Health Organization', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Chun Jung - ah', 'Korea', 'Chang', 'the Korean Institute of Criminology', 'Kim Jong - hye', 'the GongGam Human Rights Law Foundation', 'Kim', 'Bae Bok - ju', 'Army', 'Yoon', 'the Military Human Rights Center', 'Yoon', 'Gallup Korea', 'korean', 'Lim Tae - hun', 'the Military Human Rights Center', 'Lim ’s', 'Lawyer Chun', 'Jin - hee', 'the Court for Armed Forces', 'Claire Lee']",1,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.34688577  0.06359616

The church, founded in 1921, served as a New York base for Korean independence fighters at the time.  The document's findings coincided with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's visit to the United States. Abe has snubbed calls for a sincere apology for Japan's wartime atrocities, including its sexual enslavement of Korean and other Asian women for its troops.  Titled ""The Korean Situation,"" the document contains accounts by Christian missionaries of pro-independence protests in Korea since the 1919 nationwide uprising, known as the ""March 1 Independence Movement,"" and Japan's brutal crackdown of protesters   ""Among the tortures and brutalities ... were those dealing with young women and school girls who were stripped and examined, tortured and maltreated,"" the document said. ""No charge is made of rape under these conditions. Inquiry as to the number thus treated brings the reply that no exact statistics are available.""  The document also said that in October and November 1919, a ""fresh outburst of torture was resorted to, with new methods not before used in Korea.""  It also showed how peaceful and persistent Korean demonstrations were.  ""No more remarkable 'revolution' has taken place in recent history than that which occurred in Korea beginning March 1, 1919. The plan was to secure independence by moral force, without resort to violence,"" the document said.  ""Though fired upon by the police, sabred, bayonetted, arrested, beaten, tortured, and punished by court judgments, the persistence of the movement has been phenomenal, and the slight amount of retaliation by the Koreans has been amazing,"" it said.  The harsh Japanese colonial rule left deep scars on the hearts of Koreans as they were banned from using their own language at schools and forced to adopt Japanese names. Hundreds of thousands of Koreans were also mobilized as forced laborers and sex slaves.  The sexual slavery issue still remains unresolved as Japan has refused to formally apologize and compensate victims while attempting to whitewash the crime. It has been the biggest thorn in frayed relations between South Korea and Japan.

""We have done our best, and I can't think of anything better than sending personal letters to the victims, but the South Koreans are still telling us we didn't go far enough.""Such a position is not new, but the remark, made on record, strongly suggests that Abe will likely snub calls from victims and others for an honest and clear apology during his visit to the U.S., which includes an address to a joint session of Congress.Such an address will be a first for a Japanese prime minister.For decades, Japan has offered a number of apologies over its 1910-45 colonial rule of Korea as well as the sexual slavery and other crimes. But those apologies never stood long, with Japanese leaders and politicians taking steps or making remarks backtracking on and raising questions about the sincerity of those apologies.Abe's cabinet, for example, angered South Korea last year with its attempt to ""review"" the country's 1993 apology for the sexual slavery, known as the ""Kono Statement."" Though Japan said it still stands by the apology, the move was seen as an attempt to undermine the apology's credibility.Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mainly from Korea, which was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. But Japan has long attempted to water down the atrocity.The sexual slavery issue has been the biggest thorn in frayed relations between Japan and South Korea, with Seoul demanding Tokyo take steps to address the grievances of elderly Korean victims and Japan refusing to do so.Abe's weeklong trip is seen as a bellwether of Seoul-Tokyo ties amid widespread views that the relations are unlikely to improve unless he offers a sincere apology for Japan's imperialistic past and wartime atrocities.

""The politicians' offerings and tribute demonstrate that Japan still does not squarely face history.""The ministry urged Japan to show through action that it sincerely repents and apologizes for its wartime atrocities and meet public expectations for an improvement in bilateral ties.South Korean officials will also closely watch Abe's speech at the Asian-African Conference in Jakarta later Wednesday.The conservative leader has sought to disavow Tokyo's previous apologies for its wartime past in statements by his predecessors.Abe is also scheduled to address a joint session of the U.S. Congress next week.Since Abe's return to power in 2012, Japan's relations with South Korea and China have worsened over their shared history.President Park Geun-hye has rejected Abe's request for bilateral summit talks in protest of Japan's attempt to gloss over its wartime atrocities and territorial claim to South Korea's easternmost islets of Dokdo in the East Sea.

The Gender Equality Ministry signed an MOU with the heads of the country’s four biggest religious bodies ― the Christian Council of Korea, Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism, Won-Buddhism and Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seoul ― to collaborate on promoting the so-called “small weddings,” to encourage more people to get married without worrying about the cost of the ceremony. Upon signing, the four religious bodies agreed to offer their cathedrals and temples for use as wedding venues at a cost ranging from 200,000 won ($185) to 300,000 won. The organizations also plan to promote the importance of “spending less on weddings” via their broadcasting networks including PBC and WBS.“Today’s wedding culture, which consists of expensive wedding halls, costly furnishings for the newlyweds, and monetary gifts for the ceremony, is one of the biggest reasons why many young people either avoid or put off their marriages. We are even using terms such as ‘wedding-poor,’” said Gender Equality Minister Kim Hee-jung.“We are determined to change today’s (wedding) culture into one that opts for more affordable ceremonies.”The marriage rate is considered to be an important factor in Korea’s fertility rate. Along with its general fertility rate ― 1.18 children per woman ― Korea also has one of the lowest out-of-wedlock birthrates in the world, marking 2.1 percent in 2010. This means most Koreans do not generally have children unless they are married, but the number of those who put off marriage has increased dramatically. More than 50 percent of Korean men born between 1976 and 1980 were single for the period of 2006 to 2010, whereas only 13.9 percent of those born between 1956 and 1960 were not married at that age, according to Statistics Korea. While the youth unemployment rate is soaring, Korean couples spent an average of 238 million won ($216,000) on their wedding ceremonies in the last two years, according to wedding consulting firm Duowed. Meanwhile, the average annual income of a young university graduate and a full-time employee is 30 million won. Cho Sung-ho, a researcher at Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, said he isn’t sure if the Gender Ministry’s MOU with the religious sector would lift the fertility rate.“Wedding venues are just one of hundreds of things that cost money when one prepares to get married, such as housing and money gifts for the parents,” he said. “I don’t think it’s about ‘spending less’ on weddings and giving up what you want to have in your milestone event. I think the first step should be learning that weddings and marriage aren’t the same thing, and that great weddings don’t guarantee happy marriages. I think changes will naturally follow once the public accepts that.” By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","more childbirths the gender equality ,small weddings to encourage more ,more affordable ceremonies the marriage ,wedding poor said gender equality ,weddings to encourage more people","['the Gender Equality Ministry', 'MOU', 'the Christian Council of Korea', 'Jogye order', 'Won - Buddhism', 'Roman Catholic Archdiocese', 'Seoul', 'PBC', 'Gender', 'Kim Hee - jung', 'Korea', '― Korea', 'Koreans', 'korean', 'Statistics Korea', 'korean', 'Cho Sung - ho', 'Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs', 'the Gender Ministry ’s', 'MOU', 'Claire Lee']",1,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -1.12466574  0.25835615

Today, Japan and Australia are growing to be each nation’s most important security partner following the U.S.,” it added, citing a series of bilateral and multilateral pacts and other “institutionalized” consultation channels. In contrast, the U.S.-Japan-South Korea framework has “a long way to go,” though they belatedly clinched a memorandum of understanding in December to share intelligence on North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. “In the case of the U.S.-Japan-ROK trilateral, for instance, political tensions between Tokyo and Seoul have historically prevented the two non-U.S. actors from forging close security cooperation, which in turn has prevented the trilateral relationship from optimizing its potential,” it added.Aside from the fact that it was edited by a Japanese expert, the argument triggered criticism that it undermined the fundamental difference in geostrategic significance between South Korea ― home to 28,500 American troops working in tandem with the 600,000-strong homegrown army ― and Australia ― which will see the rotational presence of U.S. marines increase up to 2,500 by 2017 and has a military of some 30,000 forces.Yet the paper was seen to more reflect Tokyo’s efforts to prop up the U.S.’ rebalancing policy through its greater military role, increased military spending and other support. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s such drive for a “normal state” rekindled worries around the peninsula that it may make way for a return of the Japanese militarism of the early 20th century. Adding to the concerns is Abe’s ongoing attempts to undercut the country’s imperial past and previous apologies for wartime atrocities on the international stage.For Washington, however, Abe in many ways sates his needs, given economic woes and budget constraints, with U.S. President Barack Obama gearing up to bolster his foreign policy legacy in the final chapter of his term. Meanwhile, powered by Japan’s formidable lobbying, “history fatigue” is spreading in the government and academic circles in Washington that South Korea’s lopsided focus on the past and lack of pragmatism is obscuring critical trilateral collaboration, diplomatic sources say. Seoul, for its part, has apparently softened its stance in favor of a two-track approach under which it would sternly respond to Tokyo’s historical and territorial provocations while maintaining cooperation on North Korea, the economy and other areas of mutual interests. Calls are growing at home and abroad for Abe to atone for the Japanese military’s sexual slavery involving Korean and other women when he gives a speech later this month at an Asia-Africa summit in Indonesia and the joint session of U.S. Congress in Washington, as well as in August to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II. Yet the prospect remains dim for any about-face in his historical view, and for the possibility of a full-blown thaw between the two old foes.“Japan, which has long regarded Korea a partner with which to share common interests and universal values, could feel somewhat left behind as China becomes one of our top diplomatic priorities,” a Seoul official said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. “As Korea remains steadfast on the historical issues, Japan may think that it will only be able to move us forward through the U.S., and pursuing trilateral partnerships respectively with Australia and India of course serves its own interests but caters greatly to the U.S. rebalancing policy ... . While keeping up pressure on Japan, we’re continuing to speak to the U.S. on the significance of history in future cooperation.”By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","apology for wartime atrocities tokyo ,japan formidable lobbying history fatigue ,political tensions between tokyo ,japanese expert the argument triggered ,by japan formidable lobbying history","['Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'the Stimson Center', 'Washington', 'U.S.-Japan - Australia', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Washington', 'Japan', 'Australia', 'Japan', 'Australia', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'North Korea ’s', 'U.S.-Japan - ROK', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'u.s.', 'japanese', 'South Korea', 'american', 'Australia', 'U.S.', 'Tokyo ’s', 'U.S.', 'Shinzo Abe ’s', 'japanese', 'Abe ’s', 'Washington', 'Abe', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'Japan', 'Washington', 'South Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'North Korea', 'Abe', 'japanese', 'korean', 'Indonesia', 'U.S. Congress', 'Washington', 'Korea', 'China', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'Australia', 'India', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",8,"[ 3.          6.          1.         ... -0.3411482   0.19047736

The former soldiers fought against the invading North Korea backed by China during the 1950-53 war.In a symbolic goodwill gesture, Speakman donated 10 medals he earned during his 23-year military career, including three from his 10-month wartime service in Korea. He was a private affiliated with the First Battalion of the King's Own Scottish Borderers.""I decided to donate my medals to the people of South Korea, because ... you rebuilt your country and what you've done, it truly touches me,"" the elderly man said in a press meeting in Seoul. One of the medals is the Victoria Cross, the highest military decoration awarded for valor to members of the armed forces of Commonwealth countries. Speakman received it from Queen Elizabeth II in 1952.On November 4, 1951, at the age of 24, Speakman led his party in a series of grenade charges against heavy shell and mortar fire by more than 6,000 Chinese forces in the inter-Korean border town of Yeoncheon. Undaunted by severe wounds to his leg, he led operations to help save the lives of many of his comrades when they were forced to withdraw from their position.  Speakman recalled that it was ""not out of bravery but that was the way we were trained.""""(The donation) is just to show you about my appreciation about what you've done, and I sincerely hope that the future generation of South Korea will follow their forebears and look after this beautiful place of yours,"" he said. Expressing his ""sincere hope"" that North Korea will realize the repercussions of being divided, he stressed that ""the whole world wants to get Korea whole again as a beautiful, peaceful and loving place where people can all live together.""The Korean War broke out on June 25, 1950, when North Korean troops, backed by the Soviet Union, invaded the South. The United States and 20 other allied countries fought alongside South Korea under the United Nations flag, while China helped North Korea. It ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, leaving the two Koreas technically in a state of war.""I want my ashes to be brought back here to stay here in this country that I love and with these people,"" Speakman said.

The battlefield of diplomacy for the second history war is UNESCO, based in Paris.At issue is Japan's bid to register its early industrial facilities as UNESCO world heritage sites. The 23 candidate sites, which Japan claims are symbolic of the ""Meiji Industrial Revolution,"" include several coal mines and shipyards where tens of thousands of Koreans worked as slave laborers during Japan's imperialistic past.""The UNESCO listing is a pet project of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe,"" a government source here said Tuesday. ""Japan is lobbying very hard to get the sites registered.""  The International Council on Monuments and Sites, an expert group to review applications, is expected to decide whether to support Tokyo's move as early as next week. It will then announce a decision in mid-May for recommendation to the World Heritage Committee. The panel plans to hold a meeting in Germany from June 28 to July 8.South Korea is strongly protesting against Japan's attempt, saying it is a ""matter of a moral problem.""""Listing those facilities laden with the pain of a neighboring country violates the spirit of the UNESCO world heritage list,"" Seoul's foreign ministry said in a statement.It does not make sense to compare it with the listing of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in Poland, which was inscribed on the UNESCO list in 1979, officials here stressed.Germany is known for its sincere apology for its wartime atrocities and Auschwitz is meaningful as a reminder of the need not to repeat such a tragic history, but Japan is a different case, they added.Seoul's foreign ministry formed a task force to counter Tokyo's campaign.It is led by Choi Jong-moon, former ambassador to Sri Lanka and current ambassador for cultural and UNESCO affairs. This week, South Korea also named another veteran diplomat, Lee Byeong-hyun, as ambassador to UNESCO.Dozens of lawmakers here sponsored a draft resolution denouncing Japan's push and calling for the South Korean government to make all-out efforts to foil it.But it's apparently not an easy task to vote down Japan's campaign, with Tokyo wielding a lot of influence over the organization with huge financial contributions and a wide web of cultural diplomacy networks.""This is not without a positive sign, though.

Haruki Wada, professor emeritus at the University of Tokyo, urged the ultraconservative premier to clearly display his commitment to the Japanese government’s watershed apologies for the atrocities ― the Kono Statement in 1993 and the Murayama Statement in 1995. Wada added to growing calls at home and abroad for Abe to adopt a more repentant attitude toward history as he is slated to deliver an address later this month at an Asia-Africa summit in Indonesia and the joint session of U.S. Congress in Washington, as well as in August to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II. “While upholding the two statements is essential, the real focal point is how seriously Abe would take the issue, feel it deep down in the heart and reflect it in the anniversary statement,” the academic said in an interview with The Korea Herald on Saturday. “What matters is not only the words he picks but also the actions he would take to tackle the comfort women issue, which will be a litmus test of his sincerity.” Wada is one of the leading voices in Japan supporting the Korean and other women who were forcibly rounded up for sexual servitude for the Japanese Imperial Army during the conflict. He was visiting Seoul to give a speech on Korea-Japan relations at Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul upon a request by the Pacific Era Committee. For 12 years, the professor served as executive director for the Asian Women’s Fund set up under former premier Tomiichi Murayama in 1995 to provide some 360 sex slavery victims in Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan and the Netherlands with a publicly raised indemnity valued at 565 million yen ($4.8 million) and state-backed medical support worth 750 million yen.

(Sungkyunkwan University)But the fund triggered a backlash here as a majority of the survivors refused to accept the private donation which they accused of being a deviation from taking on official legal responsibility.Wada has nonetheless continued to make efforts to bring about change, providing crucial scholarly work, public lectures and criticism against the Abe administration’s attempts to whitewash the country’s militarist past. “It was regrettable that the fund did not work out well, though it made some good points,” he said.“We should and could have looked into its legal dimension and taken better care of domestic sentiment in both countries especially in light of the concept of atonement, for instance.” Calling the sex slavery dispute a “cancer in the body” for the bilateral ties, he stressed the significance of a statement jointly issued last June by civic organizations including the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan, a coalition of 37 women’s rights groups, in drawing a compromise between the two governments. The text calls on Tokyo to admit that the comfort women and station scheme was created directly by the military, and that the women were mobilized against their own will. After Abe portrayed the women as victims of “human trafficking” in a recent media interview, some officials and experts struck an upbeat tone, saying the premier virtually recognized the system’s forceful nature. Yet in Korea, it was deemed another attempt to undercut Tokyo’s direct involvement in the conscription process that was lost in translation. “At the end of the day, it will all hinge on how far would Abe go to shift his existing position on the comfort women issue and acknowledge the government’s responsibility, where the issue of forcibility is key,” Wada said. As the protracted strain threatens to chip away at practical gains and augments diplomatic burden, Seoul has recently formulated a two-track approach under which it plans to strictly respond to Tokyo’s historical and territorial provocations while maintaining cooperation on North Korea, the economy and other mutually beneficial areas. Wada acknowledged the Park Geun-hye government’s pursuit of reconciliation with Japan yet emphasized that the new strategy should entail greater efforts and pressure to resolve the sex slavery row. “It is good that Korea is trying to change Japan’s attitude through the two-track approach but they should not sit idle or concede to it if Japan continues to refuse to budge,” he said.“The issue must come to an end right now. Time is running out for the aging victims.”By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","aging sex slavery victims japanese ,slavery victims japanese prime minister ,sex slavery dispute cancer ,the japanese government watershed apologies ,aging sex slavery victims","['japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'japanese', 'Haruki Wada', 'the University of Tokyo', 'japanese', 'the Kono Statement', 'the Murayama Statement', 'Wada', 'Abe', 'Indonesia', 'U.S. Congress', 'Washington', 'Abe', 'the Korea Herald', 'Wada', 'Japan', 'korean', 'the Japanese Imperial Army', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Sungkyunkwan University', 'Seoul', 'the Pacific Era Committee', 'the Asian Women ’s Fund', 'Tomiichi Murayama', 'Korea', 'Philippines', 'Taiwan', 'Netherlands', 'Haruki Wada', 'the University of Tokyo', 'Sungkyunkwan', 'Wada', 'Abe', 'the Korean Council', 'the Women draft for Military Sexual Slavery', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'Abe', 'Korea', 'Tokyo', 'Abe', 'Wada', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'North Korea', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Japan ’s', 'Japan', 'time', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",3,"[ 0.          5.          1.         ... -0.63705605  0.37497985

The difference here is that nearly half of the roughly 200 employees are disabled. While the employment choice may be unconventional, the work efficiency of his company is similar to the competitors, the owner of the menswear manufacturer said in an interview with The Korea Herald.“Those with disabilities do not use tricks and they work with honesty. That’s immediately reflected in the quality of the suits,” Kim Chang-hwan, CEO of suit manufacturer The Beautiful People said.The company supplies menswear for several big companies and also sells its own custom-made business suit line.As of this month, 89 out of 206 workers are disabled, with 70 percent having severe disabilities. Types vary from hearing loss and autism to linguistic, physical, intellectual and mental disabilities. They work in various divisions from suit production to human resource management and accounting.The Beautiful People CEO Kim Chang-hwan (center) talks to one of his employees at a factory in western Seoul on April 10. (Kim Myung-sub/The Korea Herald)“Some think employees with mild disabilities will work better than those with severe problems but that is not the case at all,” the 58-year-old owner said. “The level of disabilities and the work capacity are irrelevant.” The business has been flourishing consistently, recording 19 billion won ($ 17.6 million) in sales last year, compared to 7 billion won in 2010.“There has never been a case where we failed to meet a deadline. On the contrary, the employees show better professionalism and expertise as they tend to change their jobs less often once they are employed,” the CEO said.Kim has run the company since 1998 but it was not until 2002 that he considered hiring the disabled.“To be honest, I didn’t think of recruiting the disabled with a philanthropic motive at first,” Kim said. “When I was having difficulties in recruiting nondisabled workers, I met a friend with a hearing disability. I thought it would be a good chance to offer him a job.”Witnessing the efficiency of the friend, the CEO gradually expanded the number of employees with various types of disabilities. Hiring them was not smooth at first. Some managers in charge of supervising the disabled workers expressed concerns over their abilities due to their lack of understanding. Kim was even forced to fire a manger after having a feud over the matter.“As managers get to know how much the disabled work harder with diligence, they now ask me to employ more,” he said with a smile. Having recognized his efforts for employing more and more people with disabilities, Kim won two awards including the Employment and Labor Minister Award in 2004. The Beautiful People was also designated an “exemplary company for disabled employment” by the government in 2010.In order to get designated as an exemplary company, the owner needs to hire at least 30 percent of disabled workers for over seven years, with 50 percent of them having severe disabilities. The company should also ensure minimum wages and be equipped with disabled-friendly facilities. As of last year, 174 companies were designated across the country, officials said. One of Kim’s key principle in running the company has been to ensure a harmonious working environment.He started to learn sign language for better communication, while holding a variety of events to foster a strong bond among workers.Every spring, Kim and all his employees take an overnight trip to different parts of the country. Next month, they are heading to the coastal city of Yeosu in South Jeolla Province.“I just would like to make my company a place where employees want to go to work every morning and work together,” Kim said, standing against the backdrop of a wall filled with photos taken by him during the memorable trips.The CEO also sometimes rents a theater to watch a movie along with employees. He said he mostly chooses foreign films with subtitles for those with hearing disabilities.“It’s not easy to work with the disabled unless you think of them with open-mindedness and sincerity, as you would your own children. I believe sincerity is what really matters,” Kim said.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","menswear for several big companies ,at factory in western seoul ,200 employees are disabled while ,hwan ceo of suit manufacturer ,ceo also sometimes rents theater","['Seoul', 'the Korea Herald', 'Kim Chang - hwan', 'Kim Chang - hwan', 'Seoul', 'Kim Myung - sub', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Award', 'Kim', 'Yeosu', 'South Jeolla Province', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.89707845  0.01223391

The government and the victims’ families are seemingly on the same page concerning the salvage of the 6,825-ton vessel. President Park Geun-hye recently said that she would “actively review” the operation, and Maritime Minister Yoo Ki-june implied last week that the operation was likely to be technically possible. Pedestrians pass by a rally demanding a thorough investigation into the Sewol disaster at Gwanghwamun Square in downtown Seoul on Wednesday. (Yonhap)Recovering the ship has been a key demand of the people who lost their loved ones in the incident, as it would mean possibly recovering bodies of the nine victims who remain unaccounted for.Last week, the Maritime Minister announced an interim investigation result saying that the operation was plausible. But even if technically possible, debate is likely to continue over the immense cost. According to Yoo, the operation alone would cost about 120 billion won ($109 million) over a period of 12 to 18 months. The government estimated the total cost related to Sewol to accumulate to 550 billion won. Groups of bereaved families continued their rallies, demanding that the Park administration guarantee the recovery of the ill-fated ship.In a press conference Tuesday, civic groups and bereaved family members held a joint press conference to announce they would put off the memorial service for the Sewol victims slated for Thursday unless the government formally announced it would salvage the vessel.Controversy also surrounds the so-called Sewol special bill.The families demand that Park not sign the Sewol special bill, which they claimed would compromise the activities of the special investigative committee into irregularities that may have played a part in the accident. The key issue is whether the committee can remain impartial. Public officials would head its subcommittees under the bill, but committee head Lee Seok-tae pointed out this is inappropriate since the government itself is one of the probe’s targets. “If the committee were to be launched right now, the government bodies will also be investigated. But the bill stipulates that officials from those very bodies would be entrusted with key tasks (in the investigative committee). We feel this makes it very difficult for the committee to remain independent from outside influences,” Park Ju-min, the legal representative of the Sewol victims’ family group, told local media.The group which Park represents is the biggest group of Sewol victim families as of now, with family membersof 226 out of 461 victims belonging to it. It has consistently remained skeptical of the parliament-approved special bill and disapproved of the compensation plan announced by the government earlier this month.But a smaller group ― consisting of families of 36 nonstudent Sewol passengers who died ― was more open-minded toward the plan, indicating a possible rift among the victims’ families.By all signs, reaching a closure for Sewol tragedy remains a distant goal, the road to which is littered with obstacles.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","its worst maritime disasters behind ,its worst maritime disasters ,worst maritime disasters behind ,of its worst maritime disasters ,worst maritime disasters behind it","['Sewol', 'South Korea', 'Park Geun', 'Yoo Ki - june', 'pedestrian', 'sewol', 'Seoul', 'Yoo', 'Park', 'sewol', 'Lee Seok - tae', 'Park Ju - min', 'Park', 'Sewol', 'Yoon Min - sik']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -1.09910035  0.66910869

On Tuesday, Rep. Choi Min-hee of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy proposed a revision to the Broadcasting Act toughening regulations against broadcasters’ unfair practices. Dubbed the “JYJ bill,” the proposed revision would enable the Korea Communications Commission to intervene when a broadcaster bans someone without reasonable cause.  JYJ member Kim Jun-su sings on local channel EBS’ music show aired late Monday night. It was his first appearance on a TV show in six years. E(BS)Citing the case of JYJ, Choi said that there needed to be a means to intervene in a broadcaster’s decision to ban certain individuals. JYJ was formed by Jaejoong, Yoochun, and Junsu in 2010 when they broke away from TVXQ. Following the move, JYJ experienced friction with their former agency SM Entertainment, as a result of which they were prevented from appearing on terrestrial broadcasters’ music programs. According to Choi, the Fair Trade Commission’s 2013 ruling in favor of JYJ has done little to enable the group to perform on television.

Two of these men remain at large, said Park, who leads SMPA's international security investigation team.Keum, a mother of twin daughters who had been homeless before meeting Mohhammad, agreed to marry him because she had no stable source of income and the man had promised her housing and monthly allowances. Mohhammad, who has a wife and children back in his home country, had worked in South Korea illegally since 1999 and was able to afford a place for Keum and her two daughters.Mohhammad became a South Korean citizen in June 2005 and divorced Keum seven months later.Within three months of their divorce, Mohhammad asked Keum to marry his friend, surnamed Ali, who never got to obtain South Korean citizenship due to a separate immigration fraud that led to his deportation in 2010. Ali has since been blacklisted.Last year, Mohhammad connived with his brother, who had also gained South Korean citizenship through a sham marriage, to have Keum's 21-year-old daughters marry their sons for the same reason. Police have yet to identify the whereabouts of Mohhammad's brother. Mohhammad's son wasn't naturalized with his father because Mohhammad had entered South Korea under a fake name.Keum and the girls were denied monthly rent, allowances and cell phone payments they had been promised after the first few months of their marriages.The scam was only revealed after Mohhammad's son molested one of Keum's daughters. Keum reported them to police, although she knew she and her daughters could face prosecution.Sham marriages in South Korea are punishable by up to 10 years in prison or a maximum fine of 50 million won ($46,000). The Mohhammads also face charges of fabricating official documents and sexual assault.

In Germany and the Netherlands, however, prostitution is legal as long as it is for one's livelihood.   Around 250 sex workers, mostly clad in sunglasses to apparently hide their identities, showed up to submit their petitions and attend the first public hearing on the issue. Only half, however, were allowed to enter the court room due to limited space.    The case came after a 44-year-old woman accused of sex trafficking in 2012 for what she claims was for a living filed a petition with the court, questioning the constitutionality of the current law.   Jeong Gwan-yeong, attorney for the woman, surnamed Kim, said South Korea should allow prostitution on a small scale, noting for some women, it's the only means to make ends meet.   ""Most of these workers have no other means of earning a living,"" he told the justices at the hearing.   But opinions vary even among those who want the law repealed.   For instance, Kim Kang-ja, a renowned activist for the legalization of prostitution, says both buying and selling sex should be allowed.    ""Everyone should have equal opportunities for sex,"" she told reporters after the hearing. ""Even single fathers or people with disabilities.""   The justice ministry, however, maintains most South Koreans believe sex trafficking is wrong.   ""There's a common need for us to ban and punish prostitution,"" one of the justices said.   Sex trafficking law in South Korea was first legislated in 2004, after fires in the red light district in Gunsan, 274 kilometers south of Seoul, in 2000 and 2002, revealed the poor conditions in which prostitutes worked.   Justices are to rule on the constitutionality of the law by the end of this year.

The ministries of gender equality and education announced they would jointly distribute supplementary textbooks on the comfort women issue, along with teaching aids including video clips and PowerPoint files, to 193 education offices and 800 public libraries starting this month. The move follows Japan’s approval this week of new textbooks that downplay its wartime atrocities.Scholars estimate that up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea and China, were forced to work in brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. Many of the victims, euphemistically called “comfort women,” have died of old age; there are only 53 known surviving victims in South Korea.The Korean public school textbooks currently in use only mention the victims briefly, sometimes in as little as a single sentence. History teachers’ use of the new materials will be encouraged ― but not required ― for a more in-depth education. All history teachers will also be given special education on the wartime atrocity.“It’s up to each teacher to make their own decision on whether or not to talk more about the matter using the new materials,” said Kim Jae-ryon, the director general of women’s rights promotion bureau of the Gender Ministry.“But they will be encouraged (by the government) to use the materials as much as they can. They will also be encouraged to talk about the issue when they are talking about human rights, peacebuilding and how to prevent sexual violence.” The materials, written by school teachers and currently being reviewed by academic and civic experts, will have three versions for elementary school children, middle school students and those who attend high school, respectively. All the materials for both teachers and students will also be available for the public to browse or download online. Nam Sang-gu, a researcher at the state-funded Northeast Asian Foundation, said the materials emphasized the importance of peacebuilding and overcoming the aftermath of military conflicts. Nam participated as one of the writers.“While our goal is to educate our children about what happened and what we should remember so such tragedy does not repeat in the future, we also don’t want them to form a negative sentiment against Japan as a whole,” he said. “In the material we also talk about how there are people in Japan who empathize with the victims and have worked for their rights and compensation.”Seoul has made repeated demands for an official apology and legal reparations for the victims, but Tokyo claims that the issue of compensation was settled in the 1965 Korea-Japan Normalization Treaty. Earlier this week, Japan’s Education Ministry approved updated versions of middle school textbooks that added stronger claims to the easternmost Korean islets of Dokdo while softening descriptions of its wartime aggression.Meanwhile, 56.2 percent of Korean parents said they preferred state-authored history textbooks, while 56.1 percent of teachers said they preferred materials penned by independent historians and experts, according to a 2014 survey organized by Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation. Following last year’s controversy surrounding a history textbook published by private publishing house Kyohak Publishing Co., which was opposed by left-leaning civic groups for their “overly favorable” depiction of Japan’s 1910-45 colonization of Korea among other things, the Education Ministry is currently considering whether to replace all history textbooks with state-authored ones. Currently, only elementary school textbooks are authored by the government, while middle and high school students use materials penned and published by private publishers. The ministry is to announce its decision in September.

The wage cap has been set at 5 percent.  South Korea plans to propose future talks to North Korea through the committee, according to government officials. The North has so far spurned the South's call for government-level dialogue.  Seoul's efforts for the talks have gained urgency as the deadline for the payment of March wages is April 20.  The industrial complex opened in the early 2000s and is the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation. It has served as a major revenue source for the cash-strapped communist country.

Japan’s Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida reported the 2015 edition of the Diplomatic Bluebook to the Cabinet, which claims that the islets are its “inherent territory” based on history and international law. Seoul’s Foreign Ministry instantly protested the announcement, calling in Kenji Kanasugi, a minister at the Japanese Embassy here. “No matter how much the Japanese government repeats its preposterous claims, the historical truth cannot be erased or changed that Dokdo, which is our indigenous territory, was the first victim of Imperial Japan’s aggression on the Korean Peninsula, and that the victims of the Japanese military’s sex slavery were forcefully conscripted and suffered from unspeakable pain and wounds,” the ministry said in a statement.  Kenji Kanasugi, a recalled minister at the Japanese Embassy, leaves the Korean Foreign Ministry office Tuesday. (Yonhap)Unlike last year, the latest text leaves out the description that the two nations “share fundamental values such as freedom, democracy and respect for basic human rights, and common interests in maintaining regional peace and security,” though it still says that they are “the most important neighboring countries to each other.” On the issue of Japan’s wartime sexual slavery, it reiterated Tokyo’s long-held position that the dispute has already been settled and introduced previous efforts to appease the victims such as through the 1995 Asian Women’s Fund. The document is expected to intensify their territorial brawl, dealing a fresh blow to Seoul’s efforts to mend the relationship ahead of the 50th anniversary of its normalization. One day earlier, Japan’s Education Ministry certified 18 updated versions of geography, social studies and history middle school textbooks, most of which newly added stronger claims to Dokdo. Seoul’s Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yong summoned Japanese Ambassador Koro Bessho to lodge a protest and warn about the diplomatic paper. Kishida and Japan’s Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga refuted Korea’s complaint over the textbooks, calling it “unacceptable.” “The decision was made fairly and neutrally based on professional and scholarly deliberations,” Suga said at a news briefing on Tuesday. Introduced in 1957, the bluebooks have in recent years carried the argument as part of Tokyo’s diplomatic activities and the regional and global security landscapes. Yet the Shinzo Abe administration has been ramping up its sovereignty assertion since its launch in December 2012. It has since installed within the cabinet secretary’s office a bureau solely in charge of territorial policy, revised teaching and schoolbook guidelines and multiplied expenses for promotion at home and abroad and propping up lobbying targeting foreign governments. The drive is also aimed at better coping with Japan’s territorial row with China over the Senkaku or Diayou islands in the East China Sea. For the first time, the full version of the bluebook will be translated into English for wider distribution this year, while dozens of past official documents and news articles are to be available in an online archive.With Tokyo spurring its campaign, Seoul is stepping up intra-agency efforts to better respond through stern diplomatic measures, improved public promotion and more thorough academic analysis. Experts have called for the government to formulate a more multifaceted approach and beef up its logic especially from the aspect of international law. The Foreign Ministry, for instance, launched websites in Italian, Portuguese and Hindi on Monday to raise awareness about Dokdo and Korea’s sovereignty overseas, bringing the number of available languages to 11. The Education Ministry plans to release a new curriculum policy as early as this month for elementary, middle and high schools so that future editions of textbooks contain more detailed and strengthened statements on Dokdo and Japan’s wartime sex slavery. While overhauling the country’s Dokdo education, it will also distribute teaching materials on the comfort women issues soon in collaboration with the Ministry of Gender Equality & Family, officials said. More exhibitions are expected to take place for the public. The National Assembly, for its part, is exploring ways to support the cause such as by adopting a resolution condemning Japan’s distortion of history and taking other legislative steps to reinforce government activities and enhance public education. “We need a two-track policy that we maintain our firm stance regarding territorial and historical matters, but pursue cooperation in areas that benefit both countries,” a Foreign Ministry official said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject.By Shin Hyon-hee heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","korean foreign ministry office tuesday ,seoul foreign ministry instantly protested ,japanese government repeats its preposterous ,an annual diplomatic paper tuesday ,tuesday further stoking territorial tension","['Japan', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Fumio Kishida', 'Cabinet', 'Seoul ’s Foreign Ministry', 'Kenji Kanasugi', 'japanese', 'Imperial Japan ’s', 'japanese', 'Kenji Kanasugi', 'the Korean Foreign Ministry', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'Asian Women ’s Fund', 'Seoul', 'Japan ’s Education Ministry', 'Seoul', 'Cho Tae - yong', 'japanese', 'Koro Bessho', 'Kishida', 'Japan', 'Yoshihide Suga', 'Korea', 'Tokyo', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Japan', 'China', 'Senkaku', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'the Foreign Ministry', 'italian', 'portuguese', 'Hindi', 'Korea', 'the Education Ministry', 'Japan', 'the Ministry of Gender Equality & Family', 'the National Assembly', 'Japan', 'Foreign Ministry', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",3,"[ 0.          7.          1.         ... -0.30818152  0.44926366

It was also only in 2012 that the law acknowledged women as capable of raping male teenagers and children. According to the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office in Seoul, the woman has been charged with attempting to rape her boyfriend, who was married to another woman at the time, after drugging him at her home last year. She is also charged with attacking him with a blunt instrument as the man tried to escape her home after he regained consciousness. The woman reportedly committed the crime out of anger after the man broke up with her.The punishment for rape is imprisonment for at least three years. The same punishment may be applied to those who are charged with attempted rape.However, the law does not acknowledge women as rapists against adult women or female children. “The crime of rape only refers to the penetration of the female sex organ by the male sex organ according to the current Korean law,” said an official from the Gender Equality Ministry.

According to the commission, the former KTX attendant joined Korea Railroad Corp.’s subsidiary KORAIL Tourism Development in May 2006.Until 2012, she worked at the company’s Seoul branch. She was then temporarily transferred to work on projects regarding the opening of the ITX line linking Seoul to Chugncheon, Gangwon Province between March 2012 and January 2013.

It comes amid lingering public debate over a need to improve public health against individuals’ right to smoke.The Ministry of Health and Welfare announced on March 31 that it would start penalizing those who smoke in public spaces such as restaurants, Internet cafes, coffee shops and other public areas. Violators will be fined up to 100,000 won ($90), while the owners of establishments who tolerate smoking will be fined up to 1.7 million won ($1,500).  Pedestrians pass a “no smoking” sign in Gangnam, southern Seoul. (Lee Sang-sub/The Korea Herald)Under the new measures, smokers must smoke in a designated area and are not allowed to smoke when they are eating in restaurants, playing games in Internet cafes or chatting at coffee shops. “We have advertised the policy to ban smoking in public spaces since late 2012. Before putting the policy into place this April, we have even given a grace period. Now it is time to enforce the policy,” said Ryu Si-ik, an official from the Ministry of Health and Welfare. The measure comes amid the government’s initiative to stop people smoking for the sake of public health. Last September, authorities increased the price of cigarettes by 2,000 won per pack and mandated tobacco companies put “cautionary pictures” on cigarette packs as a wake-up-call to smokers. However, the measures are still being met with opposition from smokers and business owners, who cite the individual’s right to smoke. Earlier this month, pro-smoking advocates protested at the Constitutional Court of Korea, calling the authority’s move to designate all restaurants “smoking-free zones” unconstitutional.“I think smoking is entirely an individual’s business,” said 27-year-old Chung Se-yoon, a former Air Force officer. “Business owners who cannot afford to build a smoking room, meanwhile, would go out of business,” said Chung. He cited a case in the Air Force that designated every base a smoke-free area in 2013, but stepped back from the restriction following opposition and operated designated smoking areas instead.Advocates against smoking, however, say the ban is long overdue and the government should do what it takes to improve public health. “Smokers cannot fathom how annoying and harmful it is sitting next to them,” said Chung Sang-ik, a 28-year-old public worker. “I used to go to Internet cafes a lot. Even though the cafe runs a designated room for smokers, they never bothered to go there and smoke.

According to the National Human Rights Commission, all foreign nationals at the centers -- which include refugee applicants and people waiting to be deported -- were prevented from having personal time at fixed schedules, except for three times a week for a one-hour workout and religious service time. Under the law, centers housing foreigners are not be run as general detention facilities, however the people held there are not free to leave. The report was documented based on the on-site inspection of facilities in three places: Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province; Cheongju, North Chungcheong Province; and Yeosu, South Jeolla Province. “Such an environment can make them feel like they are being detained rather than protected,” the state-run organization said. “Various types of protective facilities should be considered for vulnerable groups such as pregnant women, children or patients.” According to the commission’s analysis on the health records of the people held in the centers, 4 in 10 were found to have experienced mental anxiety due to the stress of living there. The longer they stayed in the facilities, the more they tended to suffer severe unease, it said. As part efforts to secure the residents’ mental health, the watchdog recommended that the facilities introduce mental health programs. The commission also pointed out the poor condition of the bathrooms. The sound and odor from the toilets could spread to separate shower rooms due to structure issues, the report said. People also had to change their clothes in places where other people might see them, it added.The report said children’s rights were also poorly protected. From January 2013 to April last year, 41 minors lived in the shelters. The NHRC said a 3-year-old had to stay in a center for three months because the child’s parents were caught violating immigration law. In 2011, the United Nations advised countries to regard children’s rights as the top priority and to refrain from detaining children of refugees or asylum-seekers.

413,413,[Reporter's Column] Korea-Japan relations hang by a hair,"Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is walking a tightrope as he continues to play down the country’s historical abuses ahead of his address at U.S. Congress and the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, stymying Seoul’s efforts to defrost bilateral ties.

He has been under growing international pressure to tone down his revisionist views and present a more repentant attitude to Japan’s wartime history. But skepticism persists over any sweeping turnaround in his approach in light of his elusive remarks on sensitive historical issues, namely Tokyo’s sexual enslavement of Korean and other Asian women during the war. In an interview last week with the Washington Post, the premier displayed sympathy and claimed to uphold the positions of his predecessors, some of whom offered apologies to the sex slavery victims, saying many women’s human rights were violated under conflict and pledging efforts to prevent it in the 21st century. Nonetheless, he once again attempted to whitewash the forced nature of the recruitment system by describing the so-called comfort women as victims of “human trafficking.” Though trafficking indicates the involvement of some form of coercion, Abe’s comments are primarily in line with the Japanese right-wing denial of its government’s immediate participation, and the assertion that the women involved were rounded up by their own family or private contractors. He also failed to identify the traffickers and purpose of sexual servitude. Such attempts frustrate South Korea, which is seeking a long-overdue reconciliation with the old foe following years of spats and tit-for-tat diplomatic actions. With the sex slavery issue being a must for a bilateral thaw, Seoul is taking a detour: trilateral cooperation including Beijing. The three countries held their first foreign ministers’ meeting in three years last week in Seoul and agreed to arrange a three-way summit “at the earliest possible date.” President Park Geun-hye had a brief encounter with Abe on the margins of the funeral for the late Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in the island country Sunday, during which the two leaders concurred on the need for follow-up measures for the trilateral talks. “As we created rare, crucial momentum through the tripartite ministerial meeting, we should bring the summit to pass,” South Korea’s Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said at a conference of chiefs of missions Monday, quoting the proverb, “strike while the iron is hot.” The upcoming speeches appear to have little chance of bringing about a significant change in Abe’s management of Japan’s history or Tokyo’s sudden concessions in its drawn-out sex slavery negotiations with Seoul. Given international criticism about his revisionist push, however, Abe may be compelled to express a more forward-looking position toward wartime atrocities in Washington and the anniversary statement, some observers say. Another potential burden is the fact that he will be the first Japanese premier in history to address a joint session of the U.S. Congress. In 2006, then-Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi pursued a congressional speech, but it did not materialize amid stiff resistance by some senior lawmakers over his historical perception and record of visiting the controversial Yasukuni war shrine. Domestic interests could also hold sway. A telephone survey conducted in Japan by Kyodo News over the weekend showed that 54.6 percent of the respondents said Abe should express regret and apologize for the country’s colonial rule and aggression when it celebrates the anniversary in August, whereas 30.5 percent opposed. “Despite Abe’s deep conservative belief and hawkish character, he could be realistic in terms of dealing with historical issues, taking every internal and external factor into account when delivering the addresses. The level of the messages may not meet our expectations, but it could facilitate a compromise on the sex slavery issue later on,” a Seoul official said on condition of anonymity, due to the sensitivity of the matter.

He was referring to a package of bilateral sanctions on Pyongyang.He also dismissed Pyongyang's claim that Seoul is cooking up a story on wartime abductees.Many South Korean nationals were forcibly taken to the communist nation during the 1950-53 Korean War, and some of them are believed to be still alive there, according to the South's government.The North said the South's view is groundless and it is making false reports for propaganda purposes.Lim said his government will continue efforts to confirm the fate of the abductees and get them repatriated.""We urge North Korea to respond positively to our humanitarian demand (with regard to the abductee issue),"" he said.Earlier Monday, North Korea played down South Korea's decision to join a China-led regional bank as a trade-off for the deployment of an advanced U.S. missile defense system on its soil.On its propaganda website, Uriminzokkiri, the North claimed the U.S. will take a full-fledged step to send a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery to the peninsula as quid pro quo for allowing Seoul to become a member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).After months of internal debate, the South's government announced its decision last week to participate in the envisioned AIIB, which Washington apparently views as part of Beijing's efforts to expand its influence.On its part, the U.S. is considering deploying the THAAD system in South Korea, citing growing military threats from the nuclear-armed North.Chinese officials believe Washington is actually seeking to curb Beijing's clout.The AIIB and THAAD issues represent a grim reality facing South Korea, sandwiched between its top ally and major economic partner next door.The North said the U.S. is ratcheting up pressure on Seoul for the deployment of THAAD after letting it join the AIIB.If THAAD is deployed on the peninsula, it added, the South and the U.S. will face serious consequences of war risks and an arms race.

Chun's visit was in return for one made by then-Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone a year earlier.Seoul delivered its stance to Japan that the Japanese emperor should make remarks containing an expression of deep regret or an apology for Japan's colonial rule and such comments should be made officially, according to the documents.The documents showed that Japan also believed it was ""inevitable"" for the emperor to make such comments at that time.But as Tokyo claimed that the contents of the remarks were not the subject of a diplomatic compromise, Seoul took the stance of remaining calm.""It is very regrettable that there was a miserable history between the two countries during that time of this century and such a history should not be repeated,"" the documents quoted then-Japanese Emperor Hirohito as saying at a welcoming dinner on Sept. 6, 1984.It marked the first time that a Japanese emperor, a symbolic figure of Japan's colonial rule, made such comments on the shared history.""It is meaningful that the Japanese emperor expressed regret for Japan's (wartime) history when meeting with the South Korean president,"" the Seoul government said at that time, according to the documents.Every year, Seoul's foreign ministry reveals diplomatic documents that were produced more than 30 years earlier after they have been reviewed.

The members physically attacked the unionized workers for offering financial support to schools for ethnic Korean children, established by a major ethnic Korean organization that has close ties to North Korea. The ultra-nationalist group members also verbally abused some of the female teachers, calling them “traitors” among other things.The group, which claims it has about 15,000 members, was founded in 2006 to “eliminate privileges” extended to noncitizen residents in Japan, mostly ethnic Koreans who are descendants of laborers from the Korean Peninsula before and during the World War II. The group has been criticized for its use of racist and hateful remarks against ethnic minorities. The members have used terms such as “cockroaches” and “criminals” while referring to ethnic Koreans living in Japan, and called for them to be killed. Last year, the Kyoto District Court ordered the group’s members to pay 12 million yen ($120,000) to a Korean school in the city for disturbing classes and attacking children by holding anti-Korean rallies outside the property.Also last year, Japan’s National Police Agency placed the group on its watch list for the members’ continued use of hate speech against ethnic Koreans in the country.

The latter request is unlawful because it can affect key management decisions and force companies to reveal business secrets.  Besides such actions, the watchdog said the GS and Lotte malls used their superior bargaining positions vis-a-vis producers to unilaterally hike up their sales commissions.   ""They claimed poor sales as the reason for altering their previously set commission rates that hurt their product suppliers,"" the FTC said.   In addition, the corporate regulator said home shopping malls failed to pay product cost on time after sales took place, and skipped paying interest on delayed payments in clear violation of existing rules.  The FTC said it will work with other agencies to keep close tabs on shopping malls so a free and fair trade environment can be maintained.  Companies that shipped products to home shopping channels said the latest action, comes after a steady stream of complaints have been filed for unfair practices.  ""Taking firm action should promote more fair trade and halt practices of passing along costs to suppliers, just because it was done that way in the past,"" an employee for a company that ships products to home shopping malls said.

Shinzo Abe (Yonhap)That dampened hope for a clear apology from Abe when he addresses the U.S. Congress.""On the question of comfort women, when my thought goes to these people, who have been victimized by human trafficking and gone through immeasurable pain and suffering beyond description, my heart aches,"" Abe said in the interview held Thursday.""And on this point, my thought has not changed at all from previous prime ministers. Hitherto in history, many wars have been waged. In this context, women's human rights were violated. My hope is that the 21st century will be the first century where there will be no violation of human rights,"" he said.These remarks were similar to a previous Abe statement on the issue, in which he only said without issuing an apology that he was ""deeply pained to think of the comfort women."" Rather than such vague statements, critics have said Japan should issue a clear apology as the perpetrator.Abe also said during the interview that his cabinet upholds the position on the recognition of history of the previous administrations, in its entirety, including the Murayama Statement in which the country apologized for the imperialistic past.He also said his government is not reviewing the Kono Statement of apology for the sexual slavery.Abe will become the first Japanese prime minister to address a joint session of Congress.Critics have claimed that Abe is not worthy of the honor because he has attempted to whitewash Japan's militaristic past and wartime atrocities, especially the sexual slavery issue, while refusing to acknowledge the country's responsibility and compensate victims.Korean-American organizations have campaigned against such an address by Abe and collected thousands of signatures. They also ran a full-page advertisement in a Washington-based newspaper demanding Abe apologize for the sexual slavery issue before speaking before Congress.Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mainly from Korea, which was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. But Japan has long attempted to whitewash the atrocity.The sexual slavery issue has been the biggest thorn in frayed relations between Japan and South Korea, with Seoul demanding Japan take steps to address the grievances of elderly Korean victims of the atrocity and Japan refusing to do so.

As far as sex crimes are concerned, the government will toughen the laws so civil servants and soldiers can lose their jobs when they are punished with fines for the crimes, the ministry said.The government also seeks to revise laws to fire all school teachers and restrict them from holding a similar position for life if they are dismissed from their posts or receive criminal punishment or medical treatment while in custody for sex crimes.One of the government-proposed bills is scheduled to be up for approval during a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, officials said.The measure came amid a recent surge in the number of sex crimes allegedly committed by university professors against students and senior military officers against subordinates.According to police figures, sex offenses involving those in superior positions have risen more than twofold from 140 in 2010 to 283 last year.In the latest in a series of sexual offenses involving senior military officers, the Navy said on Wednesday that a vice admiral is being probed over allegations that he demanded a female caddie to sing and dance for him at a golf range. In late January, an Army colonel was arrested on charges of sexually assaulting a female subordinate several times. Three months earlier, a major general in charge of an Army division in the Seoul metropolitan area was arrested on charges of sexually harassing a female subordinate at his office five times.""Crimes of sexual violence involving those in superior positions is not only a grave crime but also a behavior posing a threat to the foundation of a workplace,"" Kim Hee-jung, minister of gender equality and family, told reporters after the meeting.""Public offices will take a lead in uprooting crimes of sexual violence by firmly dealing with such crimes under the 'no lenience' principle.""

A South Korean-led investigation, including experts from the U.S., Australia, Britain and Sweden, concluded that the corvette was downed by a North Korean torpedo, but Pyongyang has denied any responsibility.Speaking at a memorial ceremony in Daejeon National Cemetery, 164 kilometers south of Seoul, Park vowed to push for reunification of the two Koreas to honor the fallen soldiers.""The government will expand our national defense capabilities and establish a firm war deterrent based on our solid alliance with the United States, and ensure that incidents similar to the attack on the Cheonan never happen again,"" Park said in her address to the more than 5,000 people gathered, including the bereaved families, survivors, top government officials and citizens.She also ordered the military to be on the alert against unexpected provocations and block all such possibilities.""I hope North Korea also abandons its reckless provocations and belief that nuclear weapons can protect it,"" Park said.

Such events, however, have been organized by South Korean civic groups in China before. The Chinese government built the memorial hall honoring Ahn early last year at the railway station in Harbin, where Ahn killed Ito. Ahn is viewed in both Korea and China as a symbol of the fight against Japan's Imperial Army, but Japanese officials have drawn criticism by describing him as a terrorist. In 1910, Ahn was executed at a Japanese prison in the northern Chinese town of Ryojun, now called Lushun.Lee Kyung-geun, a senior official at South Korea's Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs, and several lawmakers, including Rep. Suh Chung-won of the ruling Saenuri Party, led the memorial service held at the Lushun prison museum in the Lushun district of the northeastern coastal city of Dalian. In a speech read by Lee, Park Sung-choon, the South Korean minister of patriots and veterans affairs, said, ""The righteous movement by Martyr Ahn sounded the alarm against imperialists worldwide at the time."" Rep. Suh called for Japan to demonstrate its ""genuine remorse"" over its wartime history as this year marks the 50th anniversary of establishing diplomatic relations between South Korea and Japan. The assassination by Ahn took place a year before the Korean Peninsula was formally subjugated by Japan as its colony.

A South Korean-led international investigation concluded that a North Korean submarine torpedoed the ship, though Pyongyang has denied responsibility.""As we've experienced the enemy's attack, our focus has been on how to boost anti-submarine capabilities,"" said Cmrd. Choi Won-il, who led the ship at the time of the tragedy, stressing his and his colleagues' firm resolution to repel provocations by the North ""at any cost.""According to Navy headquarters, the military has equipped its newest Type-214, 1,800-ton submarines and destroyers with Haesung, an anti-ship cruise missile which can fly some 1,000 kilometers.Last month, the Navy also inaugurated a submarine command in the southern port city of Jinhae, becoming the world's sixth country to have such an entity. The command has taken full charge of submarine-related activities ranging from operations, education and training to maintenance and logistical support.It now operates 13 submarines -- nine 1,200-ton submarines and four 1,800-ton subs, with the Navy to add five more 1,800-ton submarines by 2019 and to deploy nine 3,000-ton submarines capable of launching ballistic missiles starting in 2020.In a move to beef up coastal defense capabilities, the Navy has been replacing 1,500-ton frigates and 1,000-ton patrol ships with 2,300-ton next-generation frigates which have a state-of-the-art sonar system and torpedo acoustic countermeasure equipment so they can avoid another torpedo attack. ""After a four-year project, the military completed building a three-dimensional geographic information analysis system for effective operations,"" a Navy officer said. ""We've also bolstered coastal artillery forces in the Yellow Sea.""North Korea, however, has further heightened tensions by making good on threats of provocations and continuing its military build-up near the Northern Limit Line, the de facto inter-Korean sea border.In October last year, South and North Korean patrol boats briefly exchanged fire after a North Korean naval vessel violated the NLL.Declaring 2015 the year of completing unification, the bellicose regime has carried out maritime exercises in the Yellow and East Seas under the scenarios of striking a U.S. aircraft carrier and attacking South Korea's Spike missiles bases on the border islands, according to the Navy. Pyongyang is also known to have been developing a submarine-launched ballistic missile in a move to boost its underwater missile strike capabilities after launching a new 2,500-ton submarine last year.""North Korea has significantly boosted its ability to launch surprise infiltration by, for example, building small submarines for littoral operations,"" an officer of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said. ""Though it is believed to have superiority in the sheer number of submarines, we are confident in our capabilities to counter their attacks. Enemies will be sure to be buried exactly where they launch the provocations,"" he added.

The former presidential official is suspected of pulling strings at public offices, including the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, to offer special favors involving state-led projects between 2008 and 2013. The prosecution is also looking into possibilities that Lee’s aide may have received kickbacks, the reports said.The prosecution declined to comment on the reports.The official, whose name was withheld, was a college professor before he joined the presidential campaign in 2007, according to vernacular daily DongA Ilbo. He is also suspected of pressuring conglomerates to financially support a scholarship foundation. The official is also alleged to have taken massive funds from municipal offices to build an art center in his hometown and illegally transferred the ownership of the building to himself, the newspaper claimed. The former presidential official denies the wrongdoings, the report added.The investigation is considered to be a part of a widening probe into the former administration, including a questioning of other high-ranking officials at the Culture Ministry who served while Lee was in power.Lee’s so-called energy diplomacy has been under escalating criticism that many of the investment decisions for energy projects overseas resulted in huge losses and wasted taxpayers’ money.Last week prosecutors raided the head offices of a construction company in Seoul and the state-run oil company suspected of making a botched investment in a Russian oil exploration project during the previous administration.

An international investigation concluded that the North torpedoed the ship, but the communist country has flatly denied the accusations.In May of that year, South Korea halted all cross-border trade and exchanges with the North, leaving only the joint industrial park in Kaesong, a North Korean border town, in operation.Liberal groups have long demanded that the government lift the sanctions to ease tensions and improve ties between the Koreas, but the conservative administrations of then President Lee Myung-bak and incumbent President Park Geun-hye have insisted the North first apologize and punish those responsible for the sinking.Rep. Yoo Seong-min, the floor leader of Park's ruling Saenuri Party, voiced opposition to the sanctions' removal.""If we recall the past from five years ago, it's impossible to unilaterally lift (the sanctions) as if nothing happened,"" he said during a party meeting.Rep. Kim Young-woo, a ruling party member of the parliamentary foreign affairs and unification committee, expressed agreement with Yoo's view.""If (the sanctions) were to be lifted suddenly as if nothing happened, that would damage the principle and consistency of our policy on North Korea,"" he said in a phone call with Yonhap News Agency.Other ruling party members, however, called for a change in the government's stance, saying it should pursue new policies in its push for inter-Korean reunification.""Under the May 24 measures, humanitarian aid is possible but even that hasn't been done so far,"" Kim Moo-sung, the party's chairman, said in a meeting with reporters, referring to the sanctions.

Another man surnamed Cheon ― who was later identified as Lee’s friend since middle school ― and his 7-year-old son were also killed. The bodies were transported to Ganghwa Hospital. (Yonhap)Lee’s second son, 8, was rescued from the site by a 43-year-year-old man surnamed Park who had been camping in a nearby tent. “I went into the tent after evacuating my own children, and found the boy who was crying near the entrance,” Park said.Park and the boy suffered from smoke inhalation and second-degree burns and were moved to Bucheon’s Soon Chun Hyang University Hospital and Bestian Medical Center, respectively, for treatment.According to fire officials and closed-circuit television footage, the fire engulfed the tent, made from inflammable material, in about three minutes. The flames were already subsiding by the time rescuers arrived on the scene, and died out completely approximately 25 minutes after ignition.Officials had yet to determine the cause of the fire. “There isn’t much evidence since the tent has been destroyed completely. We have to conduct further investigation to determine what exactly caused the fire,” Ryu Hwan-hyeong, the head of Incheon Ganghwa Fire Station, told reporters.CCTV images showed that the fire originated from a spark from inside the tent, leading police officials to suspect that an electronic heating device was responsible for the tragedy. They have requested the National Forensic Service to analyze the evidence. Police said they were questioning operators of the campsite over possible neglect of fire prevention or facility registration protocol. Investigators also commenced a probe against the site’s owner.The campsite was being used for so-called “glamorous camping” or “glamping,” a trend of camping that incorporates high-tech gadgets like computers, refrigerators, TVs and electronic heating devices. But the latest fad here remains largely in the blind spot of government regulations such as fire inspections due to a lack of inclusive guidelines that oversee such accommodation facilities nationwide.There was no fire extinguisher inside the tent, despite being furnished with multiple electronics that could have potentially started a fire. Park, the 43-year-old survivor, reportedly said some of the fire extinguishers found at the main campground did not work. Rescue workers found a total of five fire extinguishers at the spot, two of which were unused. Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo ordered prompt countermeasures after the accident, and urged Public Safety and Security Minister Park In-yong to step up fire safety inspections on campgrounds and lodging facilities across the country.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","campsite fire that broke ,island in incheon killed five ,lee died in the fire ,police 37 year old camper ,officials said the deadly fire","['Incheon', 'Ganghwado Island', 'inter - korean', 'Incheon Ganghwa Fire Station', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Ganghwa Hospital', 'Park', 'Bucheon ’s', 'Chun Hyang University Hospital', 'Bestian Medical Center', 'Ryu Hwan - hyeong', 'Incheon Ganghwa Fire Station', 'CCTV', 'the National Forensic Service', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Public Safety and Security', 'Yoon Min - sik']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37156254  0.56318736

A South Korea-led multinational probe team has concluded that a midget submarine torpedoed the 1,200-ton patrol ship ― a conclusion that Pyongyang has denied.Since the unprecedented attack, the South Korean Navy has bolstered its defense capabilities, including antisubmarine capabilities, with new equipment and changes in its operational strategies and tactics, and toughened personnel training. Cdr. Choi Won-il“Since the attack on Cheonan, our naval staff has worked its fingers to the bone to bolster antisubmarine capabilities. Thus, our efforts have made great progress in terms of operational doctrines, tactics, education, training and reinforcements of our equipment,” said Cdr. Choi Won-il, who led the ill-fated Cheonan at the time of the attack.“All naval forces including draftees and commanders are full of determination and resolve. We will fight and win if provoked again.”Amid the South Korean Navy’s push to bolster operational capabilities, the North has also been sharpening its naval capabilities. It has been developing submarine-launched ballistic missiles and has continued to bolster coastal artillery forces. It has also held drills aimed at infiltrating South Korea’s border islands.To counter Pyongyang’s persistent maritime threats, the South Korean Navy has launched a submarine force command in which it has incorporated its functions of underwater operations, training and education, and maintenance to conduct more integrated submarine operations. A marine touches a memorial portrait of one of the 46 sailors who died in North Korea’s 2010 torpedo attack on the South Korean corvette Cheonan, at a commemorative monument on Baengnyeongdo Island last Monday. (Related story on Page 3) (Yonhap)The Navy has also been pushing to bolster its 13-submarine naval fleet, consisting of nine 1,200-ton 209-class submarines and four 1,800-ton 214-class submarines. The Navy seeks to add five 214-class submarines by 2019 for a total of 18 submarines. In the 2020s, the Navy plans to add nine 3,000-ton submarines equipped with vertical launchers for submarine-to-ground missiles.To secure longer-range strike capabilities, the Navy has installed ship-to-surface cruise missiles on its major destroyers and submarine-to-surface missiles on its 214-class submarines. Both missiles have a range of some 1,000 km.The Navy has also established a naval intelligence analysis system that provides a three-dimensional map of underwater terrains to enable naval commanders to predict the enemy’s underwater infiltration routes. To avert another torpedo attack, the Navy has installed torpedo acoustic countermeasure equipment on all of its corvettes and bigger warships. When a warship equipped with the TACM system detects a torpedo, the system fires rounds into the sea up to 800 meters from the warship. The rounds then emit sounds louder than that of the ship in order to attract acoustic torpedoes away from the vessel.Despite the modernization of naval forces, the North continues to pose a grave naval threat. The North has recently conducted maritime exercises including amphibious landing drills based on a scenario of “striking and occupying” South Korea’s border islands. Last year, the North also held an amphibious landing exercise in which it designated guided missile bases on South Korea’s frontline islands as virtual targets. The bases on the islands are equipped with Israeli-made Spike missiles that are capable of launching precision strikes on the North’s coastal artillery hidden in mountain caves and tunnels.South Korean officials also believe that the North has continuously built midget 130-ton Yeoneo-class submarines ― the same type the North used to attack the Cheonan. Pyongyang is known to have some 10 130-ton Yeoneo-class submarines, about 20 1,800-ton Romeo-class submarines and 40 300-ton Sangeo-class submarines.

She also reportedly left the country for vacation without notifying or receiving approval from the university, failing to show up for her courses.The university decided not to renew her contract in February 2014.Since losing her teaching position, the ex-professor brought her case to the Appeal Commission for Teachers, which requested the university to reconsider its decision. The university responded by filing a lawsuit.The court ruled in favor of the university under the premise that the ex-professor, whose online postings had included vulgar English phrases, displayed “highly deplorable behavior that strayed far from what is required of an educator.”“Publicly mocking grammatical mistakes that her students made in an English course is highly condemnable behavior unfit for an educator,” the judge said.“The students who wrote the English essays ridiculed by the (former) professor likely suffered psychological damage while the university sustained damage to its public image and reputation.”By Sohn Ji-young (jys@heraldcorp.com)","ridiculed her students english essays ,her facebook mocking grammatically awkward ,posts mocking her students lack ,ex professor whose online postings ,on her facebook mocking grammatically","['Seoul', 'the Seoul Administrative Court', 'Ewha Womans University ’s', 'south african', 'English', 'Korean', 'the Appeal Commission', 'Sohn Ji - young']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ...  0.01040405 -0.03192611

During their meeting on Friday, the relevant ministries and the Saenuri Party said they would seek protective measures for low-income earners by setting a reasonable minimum insurance fee that would prevent the low-income bracket from being saddled with a higher payment obligation. The Ministry of Health initially proposed setting the minimum health insurance fee at 16,480 won ($15). Lawmakers argued, however, that the new fee, if implemented without any protective measures, would increase health insurance fees for 1.28 million low- or no-income households, which currently pay as little as 3,450 won per month for health insurance.“We reached a consensus that the government must set a minimum health insurance fee with a focus on strengthening equality,” said Saenuri Party Rep. Lee Myung-soo, the leading chairman of the joint discussion on reforming the country’s health insurance payment scheme.“It is unreasonable to ask low-incomers who have been paying insurance fees as low as 3,450 won to pay the difference because the fee has risen for everyone. There are some people who can’t even manage to pay the 3,450 won,” Lee said, stressing the need for a fairer payment system.Officials on Friday also agreed to work closely with the National Tax Service to collect more accurate data on citizens’ income levels and payment situations in order to develop more efficient reform measures.“There are reportedly 4 million citizens with no income, yet we haven’t been able to grasp that figure. We proposed building a more accurate database with the National Tax Services to better restructure the health insurance payment system,” Lee added.The next joint discussion on reforming the national health care insurance system will be held on April 8, with a focus on free-rider issues and related reforms affecting company-employed residents.By Sohn Ji-young (jys@heraldcorp.com)","better restructure the health insurance ,won 15 lawmakers argued however ,officials on friday also agreed ,won per month for health ,restructure the health insurance payment","['the Saenuri Party', 'the Ministry of Health', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee Myung - soo', 'Lee', 'the National Tax Service', 'the National Tax Services', 'Lee', 'Sohn Ji - young']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29792655  0.33229846

About 39 percent of those between 9 and 11 were exposed to bullying, which is 9 percent higher than those between 12 and 17, the report said. The survey was part of the study on children’s school life based on a survey conducted in 2013. “Children’s school violence experiences affect their mental health, family relationships and even their adult life,” the institute said. “It is necessary to enhance programs against school violence at schools for younger children as the survey shows that a higher proportion of younger students are victims of bullying.” Boys were more prone to violence with 33.4 percent, versus 30.9 percent of girls.The study also showed that the students’ backgrounds played a factor in their exposure to violence.Those living in urban cities were more exposed to bullying with 35.4 percent while others in suburban areas reached 25.1 percent. Slightly over 31 percent of the victims came from two-parent households, while about 39 percent were raised by a single parent or grandparents.Meanwhile, the report also noted that about 11 percent of the surveyed students were engaged in so-called defiant acts, some of them illegal.Of about 7 percent of the respondents who said they had tried alcohol, more were residing in smaller cities (9.5 percent) or suburban areas (5.0 percent), compared to those living in metropolitan cities (3.4 percent).The report also said students living in smaller cities (5.0 percent) or suburbs (5.6 percent) were more likely to have smoked than those in larger cities (2.6 percent).By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","in 2013 children school violence ,2013 children school violence experiences ,2013 children school violence ,exposed to bullying with 35 ,school violence while in 10","['the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.75413501 -0.22035912

In order to do that you have to unequivocally apologize and accept the historical responsibility of what happened through the systematic kidnapping of girls through the Japanese Imperial military,"" the lawmaker said.Honda, who has long championed the rights of sexual slavery victims, said it is still unclear whether congressional leaders had invited Abe, but he got a sense that they have.""When these kinds of things happen, they try to keep a very high security level so that they don't share a lot of information beforehand. This is not unusual,"" he said.The Washington-based newsletter ""Nelson Report"" also said that House Speaker John Boehner has agreed to officially extend an invitation to Abe for a speech to a joint meeting of Congress before Congress adjourns on April 29 for the spring recess.The report said, however, that no official announcement of the invitation will be made pending completion of certain technicalities and discussions, including ""final sign-off"" from House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce (R-CA).Royce's office rejected the report, saying such a decision is totally up to the speaker.""Reports of the chairman's 'sign off' are inaccurate. The decision on these types of invitations lies solely with the speaker, not with the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee,"" the official told Yonhap News Agency without providing any further details.Boehner's office said it does not have ""any news to announce at this point.""Korean-American organizations have campaigned against such an address by Abe and collected about 6,000 signatures so far. They also ran a full-page advertisement in the newspaper Hill demanding Abe apologize for the sexual slavery issue before speaking before Congress.Those opposed to an Abe speech have been looking to Royce to raise objections, just as former committee chairman Henry Hyde derailed Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's push for an address in 2000, citing his visits to a Tokyo shrine honoring war dead, including war criminal.Abe's visit, expected to begin around April 26, is likely to be an occasion for the U.S. and Japan to celebrate progress in negotiations on an Asia-Pacific free trade deal, known as the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), and a revision to their defense guidelines.White House officials have repeatedly said they would welcome Abe with grand ceremonies and other elaborate protocols as is with a state visit, even though Abe's trip is technically an official visit as he is not a head of state.

A group of students at Seoul National University gathered and arranged a joint movement demanding that the school conduct thorough investigations of on-campus sexual harassment and better protect the victims, rather than the assaulters.The campaign was sparked after the school was accused of having a lukewarm attitude in dealing with a high-profile sexual harassment case involving renowned science professor Kang Seok-jin last year.Kang, who is currently arrested, now faces charges of repeatedly sexually assaulting eight female students since 2008 and another woman during an event last July. Universities face growing calls to be more proactive about sexual harassment cases on campus. (Yonhap)The case rattled local academic circles, and the university was slammed for its lackluster measures. Soon after the scandal hit, the school accepted Kang’s resignation, only to rescind it later upon protests from students that a resignation would exempt Kang from an internal investigation as he would no longer be among the university’s faculty.“In sexual violence cases in universities, I don’t think the attackers are properly punished. It is frustrating to see the organization actually defending the perpetrators,” said Kim Ha-kyung, a member of SNU’s feminist student society Dal, which participated in the movement.The students argue that being subject to a sex crime on campus aggravates what is already a stressful experience due to education authorities’ nearly nonexistent protective measures.“There are no tangible measures to protect the victims (of sex crimes), nor are there any means to force punishment on the perpetrators,” said Kim.In incidents of on-campus sexual harassment, a student generally submits the case to the relevant school authorities ― such as SNU’s human rights center ― and school authorities investigate the case to determine the validity of the accusation to be handed over to the police. In most cases, the case wraps up with the school penalizing the teacher unless the victim decides to go ahead and file a charge with the police separately.What is further hindering the victims is the fear that Korea’s conservative male-dominant society will slap a scarlet letter on them for even being involved in such a case. “I went drinking with a professor and we went to a karaoke bar. He sat beside me and told me to sing a song, while he casually put a hand on my thigh. From then on, he kept touching my thigh or my waist,” said an anonymous student victim. Despite her discomfort, she was afraid to tell anyone about it because she was “scared of attracting attention.”“I didn’t care about strangers talking behind my back, but sometimes people with the best intentions can hurt me with kind words.”It is rare for victims of on-campus sexual violence to press criminal charges, out of concern that the case will become publicized and he or she will become topic of public scrutiny. Kang’s case was no exception, with the incident remaining under wraps until students at other schools began talking about it, and the students at SNU began to come forward only after the case was out in the open.Some 65.3 percent of student victims in sex abuse cases did not take any action, according to a survey by the Presidential Committee on Young Generation. They cited that many universities mandate the victims to submit their names, phone numbers and details of the abuse without a clear guarantee of information protection.Officials at the Korea Sexual Violence Relief Center said victims often tend to be timid, out of concern that people will accuse them of receiving grades or favors in exchange for sexual services. The victim’s shame and guilt are actually allowing sexual predators from facing due justice, they say.“Students, ironically, are afraid of the consequences that their teachers will face. Sometimes they think (the sexual harassment) is because ‘he likes me,’ which is a total misunderstanding. It is merely a sick habit,” said Bae Jeong-weon, a sex education councilor who heads the Center for Sexuality and Harmonious Life. “Students are young and innocent and could feel guilty about having someone fired. But it is purely because that person had a vulgar demeanor.”Calls for more organized and stricter investigations against sexual harassment on campuses are rising as the number of reported sexual harassment cases increase, not just by professors but among the students.Last week, Sogang University publicly apologized for an incident that occurred during its freshmen welcoming workshop, when a group of older students used sexually offensive terms in allocating rooms for first-year students. Some of the phrases stuck on the memos in the front doors of the rooms for female participants included “Touch it even if it’s small” and “I love breasts.”The incident ― which touched off a near-nationwide furor ― was only the latest in the long line of recent on-campus sex-related cases that have stained the reputation of Korea’s most prestigious universities, hinting at lackluster sexual awareness of the presumed intellectuals dwelling in the ivory tower.“Some young students think sex jokes makes them look open-minded and cool, but it is simply rude. It disregards the fact that each person has a different perception of sex depending on their upbringing, religious background and other factors,” Bae said.She also pointed to the lack of proper sex education for teenagers. Although the government mandates 15 hours of sex education per year for all schools, a survey by professor Woo Nam-sik from Kukje Theological University and Seminary found that 60 percent of teenagers said they learned “nothing new” in the school sex education cases. A recent survey by seven sex education institutions in Seoul found nearly half of middle school students in Seoul do not talk to anyone about sex.Experts have raised concern that without any authority figure to point the teenagers in the right direction, young students’ perceptions of sex are often influenced by other mediums such as pornography. Sexual predators have also been a problem in other countries such as the U.S. and U.K., where even top-tier schools like Oxford and Cambridge make sexual consent workshops a compulsory part of their freshmen orientations.A student at Northwestern University in the U.S. took legal action against the school after it failed to discipline a professor who sexually assaulted her.After a myriad of university sex crime cases bombarded the country last year, the Education Ministry in December recommended to universities to revise their regulations so professors accused of a sex crime could not voluntarily quit their jobs. Allowing those who committed sex crimes to resign offers them a near-free pass, since it spares them from further investigation conducted by the university. Unless the case is taken to court, which it rarely is, the perpetrator can evade justice and find another job. But the move, which the ministry claimed was “an unprecedented measure,” remains strictly voluntary for now.According to the ministry, the human rights standards related to sex crimes do not factor into the statewide college and university evaluation, meaning the government cannot force schools to comply under the threat of cutting subsidies or student openings.Each year, SNU provides online classes on prevention of sex-related crimes for faculty members. But according to Rep. Ahn Min-suk of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, only 20 percent of the professors take the lessons.Moreover, recent data provided by Rep. Park Joo-sun of the NPAD revealed that the Education Ministry is keeping track of sex offenses at 78 universities, only 38 percent of 98 universities here.The ministry vowed to pass a bill banning sex criminals from ever teaching again at college or universities within 2014. But the cited bill has not even been submitted to the National Assembly, raising questions about the authorities’ resolve to get to the bottom of the problem that has been ailing colleges and universities across the nation.By Yoon Min-sik, Won Ho-jung(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com) (hjwon@heraldcorp.com)","assaulting eight female students since ,school sex education cases recent ,university sex crime cases bombarded ,sexually assaulting eight female students ,sexual harassment cases on campus","['Seoul National University', 'Kang Seok - jin', 'Kang', 'Kang ’s', 'Kang', 'Kim Ha - kyung', 'SNU ’s', 'Dal', 'Kim', 'SNU ’s', 'Korea', '”“I', 'Kang', 'SNU', 'the Presidential Committee on Young Generation', 'the Korea Sexual Violence Relief Center', 'Bae Jeong - weon', 'the Center for Sexuality and Harmonious Life', 'Sogang University', 'Korea', 'Bae', 'Woo Nam', 'Kukje Theological University and Seminary', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'U.K.', 'Oxford', 'Cambridge', 'Northwestern University', 'U.S.', 'the Education Ministry', 'SNU', 'Ahn Min - suk', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Park Joo', 'NPAD', 'the Education Ministry', 'the National Assembly', 'Yoon Min - sik']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.02703092 -0.04772511

Also, children were more likely to become involved in traffic incidents during the spring semester, particularly in May. Cases involving 7-year-olds made up 13.2 percent of the cases analyzed.The findings were part of a report that inspected some 140 billion data points related to traffic accidents, weather, and dangerous driving behaviors to determine the necessary steps in revising traffic laws and policies. To tackle the high number of accidents near schools, the Seoul government said it would strengthen traffic safety measures such as building speed bumps around the 50 elementary schools that have the most accidents, and increasing traffic safety education for young students in cooperation with the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education.The report also included studies on traffic accidents involving senior citizens, drunken driving and jaywalking near bus stops. Senior citizens were most likely to be involved in traffic accidents around traditional markets or parks. Jaywalking incidents were five times more likely to occur around bus stations located on bus-only lanes than around regular bus stations on the side of the road. Seoul began utilizing the big data analysis to help frame its transportation policies in 2013. Last year, it expanded the use of big data to other areas like welfare and safety. The city government plans to expand the fields to transportation safety, culture and tourism, and energy by 2017, officials said.By Won Ho-jung (hjwon@heraldcorp.com)","10 traffic accidents involving children ,out of 10 traffic accidents ,seoul metropolitan government more accidents ,of 10 traffic accidents involving ,of 10 traffic accidents","['the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Seoul', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education', 'Seoul', 'Won Ho - jung']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.11976445 -0.09182928

The year also marks the 70th anniversary of Seoul's liberation from Tokyo's colonial rule in 1945.  Lee Sang-deok, Seoul's chief delegate to the talks, met with his Japanese counterpart, Junichi Ihara, earlier in the day in Seoul in their seventh round of talks to discuss the ""comfort women"" issue, according to the foreign ministry.  Last April the two countries launched the talks on sex slavery, but no major progress has been made as Japan is reluctant to sincerely apologize for its past wrongdoings.  The meeting comes as the Seoul-Tokyo ties have plunged to their lowest level in recent years mainly due to the sex slavery issue. Historians estimate the number of sex slaves at about 200,000 with only 53 South Korean victims alive today.  Seoul demands that Japan show sincerity by resolving the sex slave issue in a way that is acceptable to the living victims. But Japan has long dismissed Seoul's demands, saying that all grievances related to its colonial rule were settled through a 1965 treaty that normalized their bilateral ties.  In June, Japan irked Seoul and Beijing, victims of Tokyo's wartime aggression, by saying that its 1993 apology over the sex slavery issue, named the Kono Statement, was the outcome of a political compromise between Seoul and Tokyo.  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe plans to release a statement in August to mark the 70th anniversary of Japan's defeat in World War II.  Abe said he will express remorse over Japan's role in the war in his fresh statement, but the prevailing view is that the premier will not apologize for the sex slavery issue and may water down the spirit of Japan's 1995 apology for Japan's colonial rule, named the Murayama Statement.  Since taking office in early 2013, South Korean President Park Geun-hye has shunned a summit with Abe as a show of anger against Tokyo's refusal to face up to its historical grievances.

Police forwarded the case to the prosecutors, with charges of attempted murder, battery of a foreign delegate and obstruction of official duties. Their investigation into whether Kim violated the National Security Law and if there was any accomplice or an organization behind him will continue, they said.  Kim Chul-jun, a senior police officer at Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, announces the results of the investigation into the knife attack on U.S. Ambassador Mark Lippert at Jongno Police Station in Seoul on Friday. (Yonhap)Kim was found to have contacted a man previously convicted of spying for North Korea and a known member of a pro-North organization, but officials are yet to find tangible evidence linking either party to Kim. “Kim denied his intention to kill the ambassador. But due to the fact that he approached the envoy with a knife and attacked him immediately upon finding him, and stabbed the victim more than twice with the ferocity that was described as ‘hacking,’ we’ve concluded that his purpose was to murder (Lippert),” police said.Kim’s attack on March 5 during a morning seminar sparked diplomatic concerns over the Korea-U.S. alliance, reignited political debate over pro-North forces and prompted days of rallies by citizens in support of Lippert.While defined by the U.S. as an attack by a radical individual, Seoul officials and politicians lambasted the aggression as an attack on the alliance. Korean authorities escalated their investigation and bolstered security around foreign envoys here.Police said the 55-year-old attacker appears to have acted out of frustration with the Korea-U.S. military drill and that Kim, calling himself a patriot, believed the drill was the main reason hindering inter-Korean relations.The SMPA said they found Kim to be pro-North based on his testimonies, and that they confirmed he visited the communist country seven times. They also found evidence that Kim elaborately premeditated the attack such as by looking at Lippert’s blog and searching Lippert’s height and the criminal law the day before. Kim was arrested after approaching and wounding Lippert in the face and left wrist with a 25-centimeter knife. The police launched an 83-member team to investigate the case and questioned a total of 35 witnesses including the seminar’s organizer Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation. They searched Kim’s home and office and looked into his recent whereabouts, phone logs and bank accounts.After confiscating 43 items including books, the police said they received confirmation from experts that 24 of them contained contents “benefiting the enemy.”On Thursday, police visited Lippert for testimonies during which the envoy stated he wished for Kim to be punished.Upon the attack, President Park Geun-hye blasted it as an “attack on the South Korea-U.S. alliance,” while ordering a thorough investigation on the case. She visited the hospitalized ambassador Monday on the coattails of returning from her Middle East tour.The ruling Saenuri Party defined the attack as “an act by followers of North Korea,” and launched an offensive against the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy as “being a host for pro-North figures.”Although the investigation has not unearthed a direct connection between Kim and the NPAD, the Saenuri Party urged the opposition to announce they will sever ties with pro-North Korean advocates. The NPAD said they were mulling legal actions against Saenuri lawmakers that accused them of having connections with Pyongyang.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","centimeter knife the police launched ,attempted murder battery of foreign ,the enemy on thursday police ,the attack president park geun ,punished upon the attack president","['Kim Ki - jong', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Mark Lippert', 'north korean', 'anti - american', 'U.S.', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency', 'Kim', 'Kim Chul - jun', 'Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency', 'U.S.', 'Mark Lippert', 'Jongno Police Station', 'Seoul', 'yonhap)kim', 'North Korea', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Lippert', 'Kim', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'Lippert', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'Kim', 'inter - korean', 'SMPA', 'Kim', 'communist', 'Kim', 'Lippert ’s', 'Lippert ’s', 'Kim', 'Lippert', 'Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation', 'Kim', 'Lippert', 'Kim', 'Park Geun', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Saenuri Party', 'North Korea', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Kim', 'the Saenuri Party', 'north korean', 'Saenuri', 'Pyongyang', 'Yoon Min - sik']",15,"[ 2.          0.          1.         ... -0.51373571  0.20229842

The year also marks the 70th anniversary of Seoul's liberation from Tokyo's colonial rule in 1945.Seoul-Tokyo ties have plunged to lowest levels in recent years mainly due to the sex slavery issue. Historians estimate the number of sex slaves at about 200,000 with only 53 South Korean victims alive today.Japan angered Seoul and Beijing, victims of Tokyo's wartime aggression, in June by saying that its 1993 apology over the sex slavery issue, named the Kono Statement, was the outcome of a political compromise between Seoul and Tokyo.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he will express remorse over Japan's role in the war in his fresh statement that will come out in August to mark the 70th anniversary of Japan's defeat of World War II.But many analysts predict that the premier will not apologize for the sex slavery issue and may water down the spirit of Japan's 1995 apology for Japan's colonial rule, named the Murayama Statement.Since taking office in early 2013, South Korean President Park Geun-hye has shunned a summit with Abe as a show of anger against Tokyo's refusal to atone for its historical wrongdoings.

The expression is not something the perpetrator nation should say, Watanabe said.""This year is the 70 year anniversary of the end of war and Abe may make some statement and we can presume that something will be missing from his statement,"" Watanabe said, apparently meaning that no apology will be included in the statement.Watanabe said Abe is ""very consistent in denying the historical facts of the comfort women system."" ""Just a month before he became prime minister for the second time, he endorsed a revisionist opinion ... saying comfort women were mere prostitutes,"" she said.She said the Japanese government has taken out references to the comfort women issue from junior high school textbooks on grounds that junior high school students are too young to learn about the issue. Now, Japan is attempting to take it out from high school textbooks and is even trying to ""censure"" a U.S. textbook.The activist was referring to Tokyo's demand made late last year that U.S. textbook publisher McGraw-Hill alter the description of the sexual slavery issue in one of its textbooks. The demand was denounced as apparent attempt to water down the atrocity.Watanabe also criticized Abe for pledging at the U.N. General Assembly last year to help make the 21st century a world with no human rights violations against women and ""pouring millions of money"" for the cause while at the same time turning a blind eye to calls for reparations from sexual slavery victims.""Even if the government of Japan did something good to support the survivors of sexual violence inflicted by other states ... It does not evade the responsibility of the state of Japan to the survivors of comfort women system,"" she said.""If the government of Japan admits to the crime of its own military and meet its obligation under international law, to provide reparations to survivors, it would set a significant benchmark that states are held accountable for their crimes even after 70 years,"" she said.Shu-hua Kang, executive director of the Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation, also held a presentation about Taiwanese victims of the atrocity, and urged Japan to admit and formally apologize for the crime and provide compensation to victims.""Sexual slavery, a form of wartime violence directed against women, is one of the worst human rights abuses of our day,"" she said. ""For over 70 years, the Japanese government still denies any legal responsibility over the crime it committed against comfort women and refuses to compensate survivors directly.""Kang also urged Tokyo to reject any public statements distorting historical facts about comfort women and to ""incorporate the history of comfort women into the national curriculum so that younger generations can understand such crimes should never happen again.""

On Thursday, it arrested a senior official of an affiliate of Lee’s company for complicity in the case.  Lee Kyu-tae, chairman of Ilgwang GongyeongLee is suspected of pocketing some 50 billion won ($44.4 million) by defrauding Seoul’s Defense Acquisition Program Administration. Since 2002, Lee has brokered deals to procure the training system between the DAPA and the foreign firm.Investigators are also looking into why the government did not demand any compensation from the Turkish firm for the delay in the delivery of the training system. The delivery, which was to be completed by May 2012, had been postponed for about two months. The government did not ask for compensation in accordance with bilateral contract terms, triggering speculation that the Turkish firm might have been spared of the responsibility to pay the compensation following Lee’s suspected lobbying of officials in the military and the DAPA.As Lee’s 30-year-old brokerage firm has engaged in many state acquisition projects, the ongoing probe into the firm could reveal more corruptive activities involving former and current government officials.  The front gate of Ilgwang Gongyeong, a large Korean defense broker that has engaged in various high-profile state procurement deals. (Yonhap)It was not the first time that Lee has faced corruption charges. He was arrested on charges of dereliction of duty and embezzlement in 2009 after he worked as a defense broker in the process of purchasing Russian-made weapons.The acceleration of the probe, launched in November, came amid lingering public distrust over the investigative team.Critics accused the team of focusing too much on individuals’ alleged corruption rather than directing the probe toward helping to eliminate “structural problems” that have facilitated corruption in the defense industry.Announcing its interim result of the probe last Sunday, the investigation team said projects involving corruptive activities were worth nearly 200 billion won combined, and that it had indicted 23 people, including five retired generals and five active-duty officials, on corruption charges. But public criticism rose after it was reported that four of the five indicted active-duty officials were released, while all civilian suspects were still detained. Critics said the military judicial system was “too lenient” on military suspects, hampering the anticorruption campaign. The military authorities argued that the officials in question were released as they confessed to their corruption. But observers said those who were released could destroy evidence, posing hurdles to the ongoing probe against them.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo vowed to employ a zero-tolerance policy against corruption, calling the ongoing anticorruption campaign a “critical undertaking where the nation’s fate is at stake.”“Our government will muster up all its capabilities to carry out this historic task to stamp out corruption as we believe that there will be no other chance to push for it if we fail this time,” he said in a statement to the nation. “Whatever cost it may take, we will complete our task to eradicate corruption.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","corruption calling the ongoing anticorruption ,governmental team investigating corruption in ,wednesday the team arrested lee ,corruption charges but public criticism ,corruption in the defense industry","['Ilgwang Gongyeong', 'Lee Kyu - tae', 'Ilgwang Gongyeong', 'turkish', 'Havelsan', 'Lee ’s', 'Lee Kyu - tae', 'Ilgwang GongyeongLee', 'Seoul ’s Defense Acquisition Program Administration', 'Lee', 'DAPA', 'turkish', 'turkish', 'Lee', 'Ilgwang Gongyeong', 'korean', 'Lee', 'Russian', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'song Sang - ho']",1,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.23348488  0.26573363

The wounds required more than 80 stitches.Kim had told officers the reason he brought a knife was because his previous attempt to harm a Japanese ambassador to Seoul by hurling pieces of rock in 2010 had failed. He, however, said he did not mean to kill the U.S. ambassador.Kim's attorney, Hwang Sang-hyeon, also said Kim's attack was more of a ""symbolic performance"" than attempted murder.Authorities are now investigating what Kim had been up to since Feb. 17, the day he received an invitation to attend the breakfast event where the incident happened.Kim is currently hospitalized for a broken ankle but is continuing to be questioned by the authorities.Police have said they will refer the case to prosecutors by Friday.They are also investigating whether Kim violated a controversial security law that bans South Koreans from openly endorsing rival North Korea. More than a dozen books were found from Kim's home that are suspected of being in violation of the law.South Korea remains technically at war with the North after the Korean War in the 1950s ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.

With his shoulders slumped under the weight of his backpack, he heads toward yet another institute in his hectic day.The 11-year-old’s schedule, revealed in a recent report by ChildFund Korea, involved studying after school at English, Chinese, math and piano institutes, and going to bed at 2:30 a.m. “For kids in my neighborhood, sleeping five hours a day is pretty generous. We usually go to bed around 1 a.m., because of all the homework,” he said. Roughly 50 percent of Korean children say they are severely stressed by the pressure to achieve high academic results, the highest figure among 30 developed nations around the world according to a state-run institute.  About 50 percent of Korean children say they are under pressure to do well academically. (Yonhap)Kim Mi-suk, a researcher from the state-run Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, compiled data from the United Nations Children’s Fund and Korea’s Welfare Ministry to find out where children suffer the most from academic-related pressure. For her study, she looked at 30 countries ― most in North America and Europe, including the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Netherlands and Spain ― and compared them with South Korea. Other Asian countries were not included in the study.Some 50.3 percent of South Korean students scored three out of four in the category of “pressured by school work,” which was 17.2 percentage points higher than the average of 33 percent. Korea was followed by Spain, Slovenia and Portugal, and Dutch students were found to suffer the least from study-related stress ― only 16.8 percent said they were stressed out.South Korean is infamous for its extreme emphasis on education, which often starts early. According to Korea Consumer Agency, 41 percent of parents said their children started receiving private education before entering elementary school.On average, private education for elementary school students costs around 370,000 won ($328) per month.Experts are split on the effectiveness of early education. But some experts like Ewha Womans University professor Lee Ki-sook warn about the possible side effects of academic pressure on young minds.Lee, who conducted a six-year study on a group of 181 children, said children forced to study hard from a young age can become isolated or even aggressive later in life. Kim’s report also showed that severely pressured Korean children scored the worst in “life satisfaction,” with only 60.3 percent saying they were satisfied. The second-lowest country on the list, Romania, had a score of 76.6 percent.In contrast, 94.2 percent of Dutch children said they were happy with their lives.“Korean children’s low life-satisfaction is closely related to study-induced stress. This calls for (state-led) strategies to alleviate their pressure, such as adjusting class hours,” Kim said. “There is also a need to procure free time for children as well as infrastructure like parks.”By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","my neighborhood sleeping five hours ,neighborhood sleeping five hours day ,kids in my neighborhood sleeping ,in my neighborhood sleeping five ,my neighborhood sleeping five","['ChildFund Korea', 'Chinese', 'korean', 'korean', 'Mi - suk', 'Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs', 'the United Nations Children ’s Fund', 'Korea ’s Welfare Ministry', 'the United States', 'Canada', 'United Kingdom', 'Netherlands', 'Spain', 'South Korea', 'asian', 'south korean', 'Korea', 'Spain', 'Slovenia', 'Portugal', 'dutch', 'south Korean', 'Korea Consumer Agency', 'Ewha Womans University', 'Lee Ki - sook', 'Lee', 'Kim', 'korean', 'Romania', 'dutch', 'Kim', 'Yoon Min - sik']",1,"[ 1.          0.          3.         ... -0.7119059   0.38240728

But no such progress has been made regarding the thousands of women who were forced into sexual slavery during World War II,” she said in her keynote address at the meeting in New York.  Gender Equality and Family Minister Kim Hee-jung delivers a keynote address at the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women in New York on Monday. (Yonhap)“We must face up to past wrongdoings in order to not repeat history, and to ensure that women and children can enjoy a peaceful future.”As her ministry seeks to enlist documents related to the sex slavery as UNESCO heritage items, Kim boosted hopes for the registration process to be completed this year, which marks the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the peninsula from Japanese rule and the foundation of the U.N. She has long been leading the UNESCO drive since serving as a lawmaker. Shortly before the event, she held a meeting with Gay McDougall, a former U.N. special rapporteur who authored a landmark 1998 report detailing Japan’s “systematic rape, sexual slavery and slavery-like practices” during the war. “Because the issue of the so-called comfort women is directly linked with women’s human rights during conflict, which is a universal value, we should learn lessons through the materials that such a tragedy must not repeat again in human history,” the minister said at a news conference ahead of the U.N. meeting. Seoul and Tokyo have had five rounds of director general-level talks since last April to end the dispute but apparently made little progress due to stark differences in their positions. Seoul demands an official, sincere apology and compensation for the victims, while Tokyo claims the issue was settled in a 1965 agreement that normalized their testy bilateral ties.“What our government is demanding is that Japan acknowledge its past misconduct, make a sincere apology and provide correct history education for future generations so that this will not occur again,” Kim added.

One of the girls reportedly had to quit school as she was repeatedly visited by the boys’ parents in the classroom and verbally attacked for reporting their sons to the police. The victims were blamed for “seducing the boys” and “not behaving properly as girls.”“(In our experience), it is in fact common for parents of juvenile sex offenders to be unaware of what sexual violence is or means,” said Kim Yoon-kyung, an official in the Gender Equality Ministry’s division for youth protection from sexual crimes.“They may also feel defensive of their child and angry that she or he could be accused of such a crime. And that is why both young offenders and their parents need to be educated together.”Since 2013, the South Korean government has been offering classes for teenage sex offenders, which they are asked to attend with their parents. In an effort to prevent second offenses and to better protect the victims, the ministry plans to expand the number of required sessions this year, officials said. The classes will be given to 230 individuals from 81 households this year, up from only 123 people from 58 households in 2014.Kim stressed that most juvenile delinquents have problems at home. In South Korea, 1 in 5 juvenile offenders is from a single-parent household or broken home. Among 91,633 convicted juvenile offenders here in 2013, 54.7 percent were living below the poverty line, according to a study released by the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office.Kwon Hyun-jung, a women and children’s rights activist who has educated many teenage sex offenders, says one of the biggest family problems that may lead children to commit sex crimes is the lack of communication with their parents. “Children who don’t really talk to their parents, as well as those who think they are not getting the attention they need at home, often give no thought to parental reactions in the situation of temptation (of committing a crime),” Kwon told The Korea Herald.“And when the parent is not present psychologically when temptation to commit a crime occurs, it is much more likely that the child will commit the act.”However, most juvenile sex offenders commit a crime out of curiosity as well as lack of awareness, she said. “I would say, only 10 percent of the juvenile offenders end up doing such activities because they genuinely want to harm others,” she said.One of the juvenile offenders at Kwon’s organization in fact was a well-behaved high school student with good grades. He was caught after forcibly taking pictures of the private parts of an elementary school student. During his mandatory session with his parents, he broke down in tears, sharing how he had been stressed because of his schoolwork, and how difficult it was for him to tell his family about the academic pressure. “Looking at pornography was his way of escaping the stress, and that’s where he got the idea for his crime,” the activist said. “If he had other ways to relieve his stress or had someone who would listen to his problems, things could’ve been different.”Another teenage offender at the organization was a middle school student who gang-raped a fellow student. The student told his educators he was “simply curious” what it would be like to have sexual intercourse with a girl. His parents were strict and conservative, and the offender rarely talked to them at home. “Some of the notions he had were problematic,” Kwon said. “For example, he thought women shouldn’t drink (alcohol) or dress provocatively to avoid being raped. He also thought if a woman was drinking at the time of the rape or attack, the behavior of her abuser can be justified.”Kwon said the average age of juvenile sex offenders is dropping significantly; the youngest offender she has taught was a fourth-grader. “Under the current law, children aged 14 or under cannot be punished even if he or she commits sex crimes,” said Kim Jae-ryun, a lawyer who currently heads the Gender Ministry’s women and youth rights bureau.“That is why these education classes are extremely important.” In 2012, 23.5 percent of Korean children watched pornography for the first time as elementary school students, according to a study released by the Gender Ministry. The data also showed that 57.2 percent of teenagers that year did not use birth control when they had sex.“Inevitably, children are influenced by their parents and their authority figures,” activist Kwon said, adding that quality sex education and human rights awareness is needed for both parents and children. “Teenagers need either their parents or school to teach (them) what violence is and why it is never okay to engage in any act without the other person’s consent. In order to do that, grown-ups first need to accept that very concept of human rights.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","police after raping five schoolgirls ,after raping five schoolgirls ,after raping five schoolgirls on ,school student who gang raped ,raping five schoolgirls on multiple","['Miryang', 'South Gyeongsang Province', 'Kim Yoon - kyung', 'the Gender Equality Ministry ’s', 'south korean', 'South Korea', 'the Supreme Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Kwon Hyun - jung', 'Kwon', 'the Korea Herald', 'Kwon ’s', 'Kwon', 'Kim Jae - ryun', 'the Gender Ministry ’s', 'korean', 'the Gender Ministry', 'Kwon', 'Claire Lee']",1,"[ 1.          0.          1.         ... -0.39060402 -0.39933738

He was not hurt but a female junior diplomat who was translating beside the envoy was treated for a minor injury.But the latest incident sent shockwaves through the country not only due to its sheer cruelty but also the fact that South Korea is known for its relatively low crime rate.A series of incidents took place in the 1980s when anti-U.S. sentiment snowballed in the wake of a democracy uprising, with students occupying or setting fire to U.S. cultural institutes in Seoul, Busan, Gwangju, Daegu and elsewhere. Such provocations have died out and demonstrations have become more peaceful as democracy matured and the economy thrived. In another unusual case, activists hurled plastic water bottles and trash at the vehicle of then-U.S. Ambassador Kathleen Stephens at a rally in downtown Seoul in 2011 during which they unveiled a new monument dedicated to former President Rhee Syng-man. In 2011, a Chinese national named Liu Qiang was sentenced to 10 months in jail for throwing four Molotov cocktails at the Japanese Embassy building here, prompting Seoul’s dilemma in the face of a diplomatic spat between Beijing and Tokyo over his repatriation. “I understand that Lippert has been guarded properly until now, but it seems that the situation today was inescapable. We plan to reinforce security and vigilance for other diplomatic missions here,” an official at the Foreign Ministry said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.

Under the Philippines’ Anti-Mail-Order Bride Law, which was established in the 1990s, matchmaking agencies that connect Filipino women to foreign nationals for marriage are illegal. Matchmaking services, however, are legal in South Korea and about 2,500 Korean nationals sign up every year in hopes of connecting with a foreign-born spouse. Such matchmaking activities are also illegal in countries such as Cambodia, Vietnam and China, where a large number of foreign spouses in Korea are from. “The Korean law advises those who run such businesses to follow the rules of foreign countries if they choose to work overseas,” said Kim Dae-jung, a Gender Ministry official in charge of the country’s multicultural policies. “If a Korean marriage broker breaks a law overseas and we receive a complaint from the foreign government, the person loses his or her business license immediately.”The Philippine government filed its first-ever complaint in January over Korean marriage brokers operating in the country, Kim said. Last year, more than 80 percent of immigrants and foreign nationals residing in Korea were from Asian countries, the largest number coming from China and Vietnam.

In her Independence Movement Day address, she called for the two Koreas to meet to discuss reunions of families displaced by the 1950-53 Korean War, while expanding cooperation in sports, culture, arts and humanitarian areas. With the Korea-Japan relationship marking the 50th anniversary of its normalization, Park stressed a resolution of the issue of Japan’s sexual enslavement of Korean women during World War II, calling it a “historical task that must be tackled on the two countries’ journey to the future.”  President Park Geun-hye delivers a speech during a ceremony at Sejong Center for the Performing Arts in downtown Seoul, marking the 96th anniversary of the March 1 Independence Movement. (Yonhap)“History is not to be selectively remembered at one’s convenience, and acknowledging history is the only path to progress,” the president said, citing Alexis Dudden, a historian at the University of Connecticut who recently led a group of 19 U.S. scholars to issue a statement in protest against Japan’s attempts to press a textbook publisher to alter descriptions regarding the sex slavery. “As Germany and France have in the past managed to surmount conflict and enmity and jointly lead the establishment of a new Europe, I hope Japan will now accept the historical truth in a brave and honest manner and join hands with Korea to write a new history as partners for the 50 years ahead.” Park’s remarks appear to be intended to ratchet up pressure on Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, whose populist credentials have triggered concerns he may stoke further tensions by displaying revisionist views, such as through an envisaged address at U.S. Congress or a statement marking the 70th anniversary of World War II later this year. But her tone was somewhat softer compared with two previous speeches. Last year, she took a harder line in the wake of the premier’s visit to the controversial Yasukuni war shrine, saying that “a leader who cannot concede past wrongdoings will not be able to chart a new future.” With their bilateral sex slavery talks remaining in a gridlock, fatigue is growing gradually in the government and academic circles in Washington, powered in part by Japan’s intensified lobbying, that Seoul’s lack of flexibility and practical diplomacy is complicating a crucial three-way security partnership including Tokyo in the face of rising North Korean threats, sources say. At a seminar in Washington on Friday, Wendy Sherman, under secretary for political affairs at the U.S. Department of State, said that “disagreements” about history and territory issues between South Korea, Japan and China are “understandable, but it can also be frustrating.”“Nationalist feelings can still be exploited, and it’s not hard for a political leader anywhere to earn cheap applause by vilifying a former enemy,” she said. “But such provocations produce paralysis, not progress. To move ahead, we have to see beyond what was to envision what might be. And in thinking about the possibilities, we don’t have to look far for a cautionary tale of a country that has allowed itself to be trapped by its own history.” A senior official at Seoul’s Foreign Ministry downplayed her assessment as nothing new, saying it will be an “overinterpretation” to conclude that it was to back Japan’s claims while taking a swipe at South Korea and China. “In the overall context, her remarks were in line with the U.S.’ basic viewpoint that it serves U.S. interests that the three Northeast Asian countries cooperate closely to boost regional stability, peace and prosperity,” the official told reporters on customary condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. “She also clearly indicated that the countries should learn the lessons of the past, heal wounds of history and forge a future-oriented partnership.” As to Pyongyang, Park apparently sought to convey relatively conciliatory messages and focus more on humanitarian and civilian exchanges than military issues. This reflects South Korea’s pursuit to bring the communist regime to the negotiating table, now that it has set better cross-border ties and unification preparation as the centerpiece of Park’s third-year presidency. “Our efforts to prepare for unification is ever aimed at isolating North Korea but to help lead it to come out as a responsible member of the international community and take the course of mutual prosperity and peace,” she said. “North Korea should no longer turn away from inter-Korean dialogue.” The family reunions remain a top priority given the rapid aging of the survivors, she said, reiterating calls for talks “as soon as possible” to arrange regular meetings and exchange of letters and the identification of the families. To help restore the divided state’s national homogeneity, Park pledged to support various joint cultural and economic projects such as for historical study and a trans-peninsula railway. “North Korea should forgo the illusion that nuclear weapons will provide protection, and come out and take the path to opening up and change that can improve the livelihoods of the people and earnestly guarantee peace and regime stability,” the president added. Early this year, Seoul proposed inter-Korean meetings to discuss “all issues of mutual interest” including a possible lifting of bilateral sanctions and restart of lucrative tours to a mountain resort in the North. The North Korean leader also boosted hopes for a thaw by expressing, in his New Year address, his willingness for “highest-level” talks with the South. Yet the mood quickly cooled as the sides failed to build on the momentum and instead continued spats such as over launches of anti-Pyongyang leaflets by civic groups here. With South Korea and the U.S. scheduled for annual military drills until late April, tension on the peninsula will likely escalate as the Kim regime engages in a show of force in retaliation, firing short-range missiles, breaching the de-facto maritime border or staging other small-scale provocations, experts say.

According to the Justice Ministry, 94 out of 96 lawsuits have concluded in seizing property from descendants of Koreans who received land assets in return for working in favor of the Japanese government during the colonial period. Two cases are pending in the top court, it said. Since 2008, the government has launched a large-scale probe into the property that was rewarded to pro-Japanese traitors, and sought to reclaim it from the descendants, amid growing public pressure to set the history right. The value of the overall land property seized from 168 pro-Japanese workers’ generations amounts to about 100 billion won ($91 million), the ministry said.The legal battles were mainly divided into three cases ― state litigation launched by the government, administrative lawsuits sought by the concerned descendants who wished to take their property back after it was seized, and constitutional lawsuits over the legality of the asset confiscation project, officials said. Of these, the government won 97 percent or 91 cases, the ministry said. The state lost only three cases in which it was difficult to prove that the property owners were indeed pro-Japanese traitors or that the assets were clearly given to them in return of pro-Japanese activities, it added. The government said the asset redemption project is expected to be wrapped up by this year as final rulings of the remaining two cases are to be delivered soon.

In 2007, more than 120 South Korean victims were alive, but the number has since dropped to 53, with their average age standing at 90.""There is little time left to restore their honor,"" Park said in an address marking Korea's 1919 nationwide uprising against Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule.Park also lashed out at Japan's repeated attempts to distort history textbooks, saying Tokyo's moves hurt its relations with Seoul.Critics have accused Japan of glorifying its militaristic past and glossing over its wartime atrocities.Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony from 1910-45 and controlled much of China in the early part of the 20th century.Park urged Japan to muster up the courage to face up to history as Germany did for its neighbors so that Seoul and Tokyo can become partners for the future.Relations between South Korea and Japan have been at one of their worst points in recent years due to Tokyo's refusal to address the sexual slavery issue and its repeated claims to South Korea's easternmost islets of Dokdo.Park also used Sunday's speech to propose that South and North Korea quickly hold talks to stage reunions of families separated since the 1950-53 Korean War.Millions of Koreans remain separated since the Korean War, which ended in a cease-fire, not a peace treaty.Family reunions are a pressing humanitarian issue on the divided peninsula, as most of the separated family members are in their 70s and 80s, and wish to see their long-lost relatives before they die.The two Koreas last held family reunions in February in 2014.""North Korea should not ignore inter-Korean dialogue anymore,"" Park said.South Korea has repeatedly called on North Korea to come forward for talks to discuss the reunion of separated families and other issues.Still, North Korea has remained silent on South Korea's offer to hold talks. Instead, the North has threatened to retaliate against South Korea over its planned annual joint military drills with the United States. The North claims the joint military drills are a rehearsal for a nuclear war against it.Park also urged North Korea to abandon its expectations that its nuclear weapons programs can safeguard the country, and to embrace reform and openness that she says could guarantee peace and its stability.North Korea has described its nuclear programs a ""treasured sword"" against what it called Washington's policy of hostility.Park left for Kuwait later in the day on a nine-day, four-nation trip to the Middle East expected to focus on wide-ranging economic cooperation beyond energy and construction.

The survey released Monday by Yoon’s English School found that more than 90 percent of parents here were not planning to reduce spending on the subject.Some 82.9 percent of Korean parents said they would not reduce the amount they spent on English education, while another 10.3 percent were planning to spend more. The survey consulted 514 parents of elementary, middle and high schools. Only 6.8 percent said they would cut down on spending on private classes.The Education Ministry is planning to apply an absolute grading system to the English section of the state-commissioned college entrance exam ― called Suneung ― starting in 2017. The move is an attempt to relieve academic pressure on students. The current curved grading system sorts all students in to nine groups based on rank and assigns scores this way. The ministry claims that this has fueled what it called “excessive competition.”The new system would allow students to get grades based solely on their performances, irrespective of how well other students perform, the officials said.But the survey showed that Suneung English was the primary concern for just 7.3 percent of parents. The majority ― 51.8 percent ― thought English skills were important regardless of the college exam.“English is considered crucial (among parents) in several aspects of life, such as getting jobs or promotion, so the absolute grading system seems to have a limited effect on the actual private education market,” said an official from Yoon’s English School.Widespread distrust in the government’s education policy as a whole was also hinted, as 23.2 percent of the parents said they had to be prepared in case the authorities changed their minds about the absolute grading system. A recent survey by the state-run Korean Educational Development Institute showed that only 8.7 percent of Korean adults had faith in the government’s education policy.Students’ lack of trust in the public education system also appears to drive them toward private institutes. A recent survey showed that 69 percent of students said school classes were insufficient for trying to improve one’s English skills.“Korean law doesn’t even allow schools to fire an English teacher who got 415 in TOEIC. Authorities say they will enhance public education but it’s impossible to do so without improving the quality of teachers of the subject,” said an official from local education firm YBM. “If the public officials can’t improve the quality of education, then maybe they should entrust the task to the private sector.”By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","the survey consulted 514 parents ,82 percent of korean parents ,english education while another 10 ,percent of korean parents said ,survey consulted 514 parents","['Yoon ’s English School', 'korean', 'english', 'the Education Ministry', 'Suneung English', 'Yoon ’s English School', 'Korean Educational Development Institute', 'korean', 'TOEIC', 'YBM', 'Yoon Min - sik']",4,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.3736909   0.77748448

The detention, recorded by security cameras, set off a wave of spontaneous demonstrations in middle-class neighborhoods loyal to the opposition and on Friday a few hundred supporters gathered peacefully to denounce Ledezma's ""kidnapping.""The mayor was charged with conspiracy, a crime punishable by 8 to 16 years in jail, and sent Friday night to a military prison outside Caracas where other prominent government foes are being held. The arrest of the 59-year-old mayor, one of Maduro's fiercest critics, comes as the government struggles to avert a crisis years in the making but made worse by a recent tumble in oil prices. The president's approval rating was hovering around 22 percent in January, the lowest in 16 years of socialist rule, as Venezuelans are forced to cope with widespread shortages, runaway inflation and a plunge in the currency that shows little sign of abating. Maduro has taken to the airwaves in recent days to rail against his opponents, accusing them of conspiring with the United States to sabotage the oil-dependent economy, sowing chaos and carry out a coup timed to coincide with the anniversary this month of 2014 anti-government protests that left more than 40 dead.As part of the crackdown, he's also seized control of a major retail chain, jailed several executives and handed more power to the military to control protests and smoke out saboteurs.However, the dire situation hasn't translated into support for the frequently out-maneuvered opposition. Turnout at Friday's demonstration was the largest for an anti-government rally in months but nowhere near the throngs that rocked cities a year ago, a sign of the steep challenge the opposition still faces connecting with mistrustful voters ahead of legislative elections later this year. The government's case against Ledezma appeared to stem from a public letter he wrote with two other hardliners calling for a transitional government. Maduro said the letter, published in an anti-government newspaper, was the green light for a secretly hatched putsch and on Friday said that next week he would present videos and recordings detailing U.S. Embassy involvement in the plot. The U.S. called the accusations ""baseless and false.""  While Ledezma's arrest may be the boldest action against his rivals, it's unlikely to rattle Maduro's core base, which is better organized and more at ease in the throes of the crisis than the opposition, according to David Smilde, a Venezuelan researcher and senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America. ""The 20 percent that are left (supporting Maduro) are pretty hardcore and Ledezma is not a likable character,"" Smilde said. The embattled president could also be gambling that the allegations of a coup will enable him to distract attention from the mounting woes and weaken the opposition enough to allow him to prevail in legislative elections slated for later this year. But the growing crackdown is not without risks. Opponents, who seemed lifeless in recent weeks even as the country's problems have worsened, are enraged and international condemnation of Maduro's human rights record is likely to rise.On Friday, the Obama administration said it is considering additional actions to pressure the government after it expanded this month a travel ban on individuals accused of corruption and abuses. It also called on regional governments to ensure Venezuela lives up to its commitments to democracy. ""Venezuela's problems cannot be solved by criminalizing dissent,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporter.So far reaction has been muted, with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, the U.S.'s top ally in the region, urging that Ledezma's due process rights be respected but stopping short of calling for the mayor's release. Brazil, whose Workers Party government is close to Maduro and a major investor in Venezuela, expressed concern and called on both sides to ""work for peace and the maintenance of democracy.""Foreign ministers from the two countries and Ecuador are expected to arrive in Caracas in the coming days to try and open a channel of dialogue between the government and opposition. Ledezma has been a thorn in the side of the ruling party since he was elected mayor in 2008, beating out a member of the socialist party led by the late President Hugo Chavez. The government subsequently transferred most of his powers to a newly created office run by a loyalist.He was re-elected in 2013 and has been on the attack ever since alongside Leopoldo Lopez, a former mayor whom he'll now join in jail. Lopez was arrested a year ago for allegedly inciting violence at anti-government protests.Despite Ledezma's reputation as a rabble-rouser he's rare among opposition leaders in having family ties to the ruling elite by way of his stepdaughter, who is married to Tourism Minister Andres Izarra, a top government spokesman. Government critics say that as the administration loses strength, it is becoming more dangerous.""The mayor of the capital arrested just like that? That never happens. It's too ugly,"" said Maria Fernandez, who lives in the shadow of the presidential palace and makes her living selling loose cigarettes, candy and pirated movies.

Despite the destruction, authorities have so far not received reports of serious injuries, missing people, or deaths.""Everyone is breathing a deep sigh of relief that there has been, to this date, no loss of life,"" Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk told reporters.Palaszczuk said the central Queensland coastal town of Yeppoon, about 670 kilometres north of the capital Brisbane, and nearby Rockhampton were the worst hit.""The cyclone has actually caused quite some considerable damage in both Yeppoon and Rockhampton,"" she said, adding that some 60,000 people were without power.""Yeppoon has suffered the brunt of the cyclone and it is going to take a lot longer for power to be restored there.""Queensland's fire and emergency services said 200 homes in Yeppoon and 340 in Rockhampton were damaged or flooded.    - 'It just exploded' -Andrew Bennett described how his Yeppoon house was torn apart by the cyclone.""It was incredible, it just exploded,"" he told Brisbane's Courier Mail as he described the ""roaring"" wind. ""The house seemed to pulsate and the wind blew out the window. Then the roof blew off.

They stressed that no government has the right to “censor history.”The textbook says Japanese troops forcibly mobilized some 200,000 women, aged between 14 and 20, to make them work at comfort stations, or frontline military brothels. It also touches on the harrowing lives of the victims including some who were allegedly murdered after being caught fleeing.During a parliamentary session late last month, Abe said he was “very surprised (by the false description),” a comment that reignited criticism from South Korea and other countries.“Since the international community failed to fix what should have been corrected, such a textbook is being used in the U.S. Should we just sit quietly, the world will not look at us positively. We should clearly make our claims,” Abe reportedly said during the session.The comfort women topic has long been the thorniest issue in South Korea-Japan relations. Tokyo argues that all colonial-era concerns including the sexual slavery issue have been settled under a 1965 deal that normalized the bilateral relationship, and that there is no evidence to confirm the victims were forcibly mobilized by Japan’s military.But Seoul argues that the issue was not covered under the deal and should be dealt with separately from other issues, given that it concerns universal human rights.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","19 historians who criticized tokyo ,wartime sexual enslavement on monday ,american historians had decried tokyo ,their gratitude to 19 historians ,victims of japan wartime sexual","['korean', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'Tokyo', 'the House of Sharing', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Japan', 'Abe', 'Korea', 'the House of Sharing', 'american', 'Tokyo', 'U.S.', 'McGraw - Hill', 'japanese', 'Abe', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Abe', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Song Sang - ho']",3,"[ 2.          4.          1.         ... -0.56587929  0.55132949

Since the once--powerful uncle of Kim, Jang Song-thaek, was executed in December 2013 on charges of treason, corruption and others, North Korea has gradually summoned its businessmen in China who are believed to be royal to Jang. The high-profile execution of Jang, who had played an important role in initiating joint business projects with China, has also taken its toll on work by North Korean businessmen in the Chinese border cities of Shenyang and Dandong because it further dampens the already-fragile confidence of Chinese investors. A source in a northeastern Chinese city, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said only about 30 percent of the North Korean businessmen have returned to China after being summoned. The summonses are also believed to be part of efforts by North Korea to redistribute the ""rights of doing businesses with China,"" a key source of earning hard currency, to its ruling elite, the source said. ""The replacement of businessmen loyal to Jang Song-thaek has been gradually carried out and a lot of North Korean businessmen were summoned until late last year,"" the source said. ""Of those being summoned, only about 30 percent returned to China.""There are no official data on how many North Korean businessmen are working in the Chinese border cities.A second source in another Chinese border city with North Korea said that about 170 North Korean businessmen in the city were replaced over the past year.With Chinese investor confidence eroding over the North's unpredictable behavior, the new North Korean businessmen come under further pressure in building business connections with their Chinese counterparts, the second source said. The North Korean businessmen have also felt the pinch of a slowdown in the Chinese economy, which grew 7.4 percent last year, marking a 24-year low. A third source in the Chinese border city of Dandong said, ""As demand falls and prices decline in the face of an economic slowdown in China, it is difficult for North Korean businessmen to sell goods even at lower prices."" According to data compiled by the Beijing unit of the South's Korea Trade and Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA), North Korea's annual trade with China fell 2.4 percent from a year ago in 2014, marking the first decline since 2009. North Korea's trade with China totaled US$6.39 billion last year, compared with $6.54 billion in 2013, the data showed. Last year, North Korea's exports of coal to China slipped 17.6 percent from a year ago to $1.13 billion, marking the first drop in 8 years, according to the data.

Students already attending the institutes and those coming to the cited schools through a student exchange program, however, will be able to receive a visa.The measure is part of the ministry’s International Education Quality Assurance System that evaluates local tertiary education institutes’ capacity to host international students. “The visa restriction will last for a year, starting in the second semester of 2015. We would advise the cited schools to focus on managing the foreign students they have, rather than to trying to attract new foreign students,” said a ministry official.The key factors in the evaluation include the ratio of foreign students who are illegal residents, the number of foreign students who dropped out before receiving a degree and the school’s financial stability.“Since the IEQAS was introduced in 2011, Korea has seen a consistent decrease in the number of foreign students illegally residing in Korea. We were able to improve the general image of studying in Korea,” the official said.According to the Justice Ministry, the number of international students who stayed in Korea illegally slid from 7,546 in 2013 to 6,779 in 2014.The IEQAS committee consists of officials from the education and justice ministries along with civilian members.

Texts for Japanese history and world history classes in high school only briefly deal with the issue.Future textbooks should have clearer descriptions of the forced nature of the sex work and the issues surrounding the victims' human rights, the ministry said.The ministry also said it will develop separate teaching materials on the former sex slaves, possibly to be released by the start of the new school year next month, so that teachers can better educate students on the issue.Historians estimate there were about 200,000 sex slaves from all over Asia. Most of them are believed to have been Korean, though the South Korean government only has 238 registered in its database.Japan has yet to atone properly for its wartime sexual slavery and has not paid direct compensation to any of the victims. South Korea has pressed Japan to address the long-running grievances by extending a formal apology and compensating the victims. But Japan has refused to do so, saying the matter was settled by a 1965 treaty that normalized relations between the two countries.

The Health Ministry will require all clinics that perform surgeries involving general anesthesia to be fully equipped with emergency medical supplies including a pulse oximeter and a ventilator as well as uninterrupted power supply.The ministry is also set to ban plastic surgery advertisements that do not properly inform patients of possible side effects, including ones with dramatic before and after photographs and ones that feature celebrities as models. Also, clinics will be encouraged to install surveillance cameras in their operating rooms for their patients’ safety.In order to make sure every patient has access to information about the surgeons who are in charge of their treatment, clinics will be required to display the name of the surgeon in front of the operating room before and during surgical procedures. Some clinics have been accused of having inexperienced surgeons perform procedures while telling patients that their surgery is being performed by experienced ones, as they cannot make out once they are put under anesthesia.In December, a number of health workers were investigated by health authorities for having a birthday party in an operating room in the middle of a surgical procedure at a plastic surgery clinic. “These measures will enhance safety in the nation’s plastic surgery sector,” said the ministry in a statement. “We believe this will help attract more foreign patients as well.”The number of Korean patients filing medical disputes after receiving cosmetic surgery or other aesthetic treatments increased dramatically from 439 in 2012 to 805 last year.

The 20-year-old student attacked Sunday is the second Japanese woman raped in India in recent months. The man had met her in Jaipur and offered to act as her tour guide, according to police inspector general D.C. Jain.The man later took the woman on his motorcycle to a farming village outside the city in Rajasthan state, where he raped her on the side of the road before leaving her, Jain said. Villagers who heard the woman crying helped her contact police. A medical examination confirmed the woman had been raped. Police were searching for a man in his 20s and were certain ""the person who committed the rape is from Jaipur,"" Jain said, though police have yet to identify a particular suspect.The case was just one in a series of ongoing cases that has renewed public fury and horror over India's inability to halt chronic violence against women, despite strengthening laws against sex crimes in 2013. In December, a 22-year-old research scholar from Japan was held captive and gang raped for nearly three weeks in a village near a Buddhist pilgrimage center in Bihar state. Police have arrested several suspects in that case, which also involved a tourist guide who had offered to help the woman with sightseeing. She escaped from captivity on Dec. 26 and fled to the eastern city of Kolkata. In another case, police said Monday that they had arrested eight people suspected in the rape and murder of a Nepalese woman in the northwest Indian state of Haryana.  The 28-year-old woman had been staying with her sister when she went missing Feb. 1. Her mutilated body was discovered three days later, and an autopsy revealed that several organs were missing and that objects including stones, blades and a stick had been inserted into her body, police said. ""This is a matter of serious crime,'' police superintendent Shashank Anand said in announcing that a special investigative team had been formed.The woman's sister joined hundreds of protesters in criticizing police for moving too slowly in the case during a candlelight demonstration that blocked traffic on a major road outside of New Delhi over the weekend. She told reporters she wanted the culprits to be hanged. ""I get chills when I think of what happened to my sister, I want justice for my sister,"" she said.

Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, ringleaders of the so-called ""Bali Nine"" drug smuggling gang, were arrested in 2005 and sentenced to death the following year after being caught trying to traffick heroin out of Indonesia.They lost a legal bid last week to have their cases reviewed, effectively dashing their final hope of avoiding the firing squad. Jakarta has said they will be executed this month.Indonesia last month executed six drug offenders, including five foreigners. On Monday the families of Chan and Sukumaran, who in recent days have been on the resort island of Bali where the men are held, visited Jakarta to appeal for authorities to spare the lives of the men, who are in their early 30s. ""We beg you for mercy for our sons, we beg you to spare our sons' lives, we beg you that they not be killed,"" said Sukumaran's mother Raji Sukumaran, sobbing as she read from a statement signed by her and Chan's mother, Helen Chan.At an emotionally charged press conference, the women called on President Joko Widodo, the vice president, the attorney general and ""the Indonesian people to show mercy on our children"".""I understand the serious crime my son committed. They are both very sorry for this. We are very sorry for this. They are not the same people who committed that crime almost 10 years ago,"" Raji Sukumaran added. She said the pair had been rehabilitated and were now the ""driving force"" behind improving the notorious Kerobokan jail on Bali, through starting programmes that ranged from painting and photography to dance and sewing. Chan's brother Michael, who attended the event, added: ""If we can show the president that these guys have done such an amazing job with what they've had to deal with, I just want them to have that second chance to show that to other people.""Earlier, their lawyer Todung Mulya Lubis said he planned one last attempt to save their lives by challenging in an administrative court Widodo's decision not to pardon them.Both men lost their appeals for presidential clemency in recent months. The legal move has been rarely attempted before, but Mulya said he did not believe Widodo could simply reject the men's pleas on the basis of a drug emergency.Widodo has been a vocal supporter of capital punishment and warned Indonesia was in a state of emergency due to drugs, with dozens of people dying every day.""I don't think the president can use that blanket argument to refuse all the clemency applications,"" he said, adding: ""It is unfair, it is unjust, it is unacceptable.""The lawyer added the challenge was ""probably the only legal recourse left for us"" and he hoped the attorney general would exclude the pair from any executions this month while the legal process was ongoing.","australian drug smugglers on death ,month executed six drug offenders ,tearfully begged authorities on monday ,death row in indonesia tearfully ,drug smugglers on death row","['AFP', 'australian', 'Indonesia', 'Andrew Chan', 'Myuran Sukumaran', 'Indonesia', 'Jakarta', 'Indonesia', 'Chan', 'Sukumaran', 'Bali', 'Jakarta', 'Sukumaran', 'Raji Sukumaran', 'Chan', 'Helen Chan', 'Joko Widodo', 'indonesian', 'Raji Sukumaran', 'Kerobokan', 'Bali', 'Chan', 'Michael', 'Todung Mulya Lubis', 'Widodo', 'Mulya', 'Widodo', 'Indonesia']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54077512  0.23204978

This is part of the court’s new measures to protect the children’s rights in family litigation, officials said. Public criticism grew over minors’ rights as many of them were being used as pawns in custody battles.To better carry out the new measure, the authorities will provide the underage litigants with legal assistants who will support the lawsuit processes, the court said.The court also made it mandatory to listen to the testimonies of children if the domestic cases affect the welfare of minors, the authorities said. Until now, the court was not obligated to hear children under 13 in parental rights or custody battles. The court authorities also strengthened the punishment for divorced parents who do not provide child support expenses without reasonable excuses.

The book also touches on the harrowing lives of the victims including some who were allegedly murdered after being caught fleeing.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe attends an Upper House Budget Committee meeting of Parliament in Tokyo, Monday, Feb. 2. (AP)During a parliamentary session late last month, Abe said he was “very surprised (at the false description),” a comment that reignited criticism from South Korea and elsewhere in the world.“As a result of the international community failing to fix what should have been corrected, such a textbook is being used in the U.S. Should we sit quietly, the world would not look at us positively. We should clearly make our claims,” he said during the session.In the historians’ statement, they supported McGraw-Hill, underscoring that “they stand with many historians in Japan and elsewhere that have worked to bring to light the facts about the comfort women issue and other wartime atrocities.”“We practice and produce history to learn from the past. We therefore oppose the efforts of states or special interests to pressure publishers or historians to alter the results of their research for political purposes,” the statement said.The comfort women issue has long been the thorniest issue in South Korea-Japan relations. Tokyo has long argued that the issue has been settled under a 1965 deal that normalized the bilateral relationship, and that there is no evidence to confirm the victims were forcibly mobilized by Japan’s military.But Seoul argues that the issue was not covered under the deal and should be dealt with separately from other issues, given that it concerns universal human rights, an issue that goes beyond the bilateral relationship.For the U.S., Tokyo’s apparent moves to whitewash wartime atrocities are disheartening as it is also the victim of Japan’s 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor in which historians say some 2,400 Americans were killed. Historical revisionists in Japan argue their country staged the war to fend off Western powers’ invasions of East Asia and should be credited with the endeavors to “liberate” the Asian region. They also say their wartime wrongdoings are exaggerated or falsified.By Song Sang-ho and news reports (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","the scholars also criticized tokyo ,19 american scholars decried tokyo ,scholars also criticized tokyo for ,scholars decried tokyo recent request ,scholars also criticized tokyo","['Tokyo', 'U.S.', 'american', 'Tokyo', 'U.S.', 'Asians', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'Tokyo', 'Tokyo', 'U.S.', 'McGraw - Hill', 'Japan', 'Global Perspective', 'japanese', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Upper House Budget Committee', 'Parliament', 'Tokyo', 'Abe', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'McGraw - Hill', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'Americans', 'Japan', 'western', 'asian', 'Song Sang - ho']",3,"[ 2.          8.          0.         ... -0.61620563  0.55942017

Results announced in December showed that Park had taken testosterone, a substance banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency.But Friday’s indictment appears to support claims by Park that he had never been informed of the doctor’s injection of the material. Park reportedly said he had consistently asked the doctor, identified by his surname Kim by prosecutors, if the injection could cause doping test problems.Kim had assured the athlete nothing would go wrong, according to statements from Team GMP, Park’s agency. Prosecutors added their investigations showed that neither Kim nor Park knew the injected materials violated WADA regulations.The indictment is also expected to affect decisions by authorities at a related hearing to be held on Feb. 27 by FINA, the international governing body of swimming, in Switzerland. The hearing will probe Park’s doping allegations.Despite the indictment that appears to clear Park’s name, FINA authorities may still ban the swimmer from the 2016 Rio Olympics and take away the medals he won in the 2014 Asian Games. Park won one silver and five bronze medals in the competition last fall in Incheon, South Korea.Park has expressed “shock” at the doping test results. The 25-year-old has vowed to continue practicing despite the ongoing investigations.Park’s popularity has only grown in South Korea since he rose to fame in the 2008 Beijing Olympics as the country’s first international Gold-medalist swimmer.

Currently, 53 Korean victims are alive with their average age standing at 88.  ""As this year is a landmark year for the Seoul-Tokyo relations, the government will ramp up more efforts to help heal your pains and restore your dignity,"" Cho told a meeting with six victims of Japan's sex slaves.  The sex slavery issue has been the main impediment to improvement in the relations between Seoul and Tokyo at a time when this year marks the 50th anniversary of normalization of the diplomatic ties between the two nations.  This year also marks the 70th anniversary of Seoul's liberation from Tokyo's 1910-45 colonial rule.  In April, the two historical rivals launched the talks on the sex slavery issue, but progress has been meager as Japan has been reluctant to sincerely apologize for the issue.  ""South Korea will utilize all available resources to let the global community more understand that this is also an issue of universal human rights on the top of the bilateral historic issue,"" he added.  Cho left a message on a visitors' book that reads that the Seoul government will do its best to help the victims regain their dignity while they are alive and not to make their courageous confession fruitless.  During the meeting with Cho, the victims spoke about their painful experiences, slamming Japan for not sincerely apologizing for its wartime atrocities.  ""I want to see the Japanese government apologize for (this issue) before I die,"" said Yi Ok-seon, 88.  Yoo Hee-nam, 86, said that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe does not even blink an eye at Tokyo's horrible wartime acts.  ""I hope that the Korean government will help ease our pains and sorrows before we all die by letting the issue be further known globally.""  Abe has irked Seoul and Beijing, both victims of Tokyo's wartime aggression, as Japan has attempted to whitewash its past military atrocities.  Abe said last month that he would not use key words from Japan's previous apologies for its wartime atrocities in his new statement that will be issued in August to mark the 70th anniversary of the country's defeat in World War II.  The Japanese premier said that he will express remorse over Japan's role in the war, but there is a prevailing view that he will water down the spirit of past administrations' apologies.  Japan issued two key statements containing apologies for past wrongdoing -- the 1993 apology on the sex slavery issue, named the Kono Statement, and the 1995 apology for Japan's colonial rule, named the Murayama Statement.  South Korea demands that Japan show sincerity by settling the sex slave issue ""in a way that is agreeable to the living victims,"" including through a sincere apology and compensation.  Japan has long dismissed Seoul's demands, claiming that all grievances related to its colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula were settled through a 1965 treaty that normalized their bilateral ties.

""But the entire system is brutal and inhumane. The way the surveillance is run ... The physical aspect is just one side of the experience."" In a letter to Kim, the commission of inquiry even warned that he could be held accountable. The U.N. General Assembly late last year approved a resolution urging that North Korea's human rights situation be referred to the International Criminal Court. North Korea tried to stop the momentum by raising the possibility of allowing a U.N. human rights visit to the country, but moments after it became clear that the resolution had strong support, its diplomats threatened another nuclear test. Now Pyongyang has shifted its approach. After another prominent defector last month said he had changed important parts of his life story, North Korea declared that anything based on Shin Dong-hyuk's testimony could not be trusted. This week, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Su Yong wrote to the U.N. secretary-general saying the U.N. resolution has ""collapsed"" and is illegal. Human rights groups and the head of the commission of inquiry, retired Australian judge Michael Kirby, say the report and ensuing resolution are based on the testimony of scores of North Korean defectors and remain solid. Jang called the drama over Shin's story ""kind of disappointing,"" saying there is so much more to North Korea's abuses than the questioning over which prison camps Shin grew up in and when. The former propaganda poet pointed to North Korea's pervasive system of surveillance and control. Practically all citizens of the entire desperately poor, nuclear-armed country are sealed off from the Internet. Informers are embedded in every level of society. Entire families can be punished for one person's mistakes or crimes. Jang says he fled North Korea after he lent a classified foreign document to a friend, who then left it on a train by mistake. He soon made it to South Korea, where he founded a news outlet called New Focus, featuring reports on North Korea based on sources within the country. Jang's escape is recounted in ""Dear Leader."" As with other defectors' accounts, many details can be almost impossible to verify. South Korean reports have said his name is a pen name. ""Why would I put my reputation on the line?"" Jang said when the question of changing narratives was raised. But he understands the pressures some North Korean defectors face to make their stories more compelling, perhaps especially as international attention to North Korea's human rights situation has grown. ""It's true that a lot of people are pressured to want to appease people's expectations,"" Jang said. ""But in Shin's case, it was not for money. His motive was just to tell the world. ... It wasn't deliberate fraud. It was more of a mismatch between outside expectations and the world he came from.""

Nineteen scholars belonging to the American Historical Association co-signed the joint statement titled, ""Standing with Historians of Japan.""  ""The statement matters now because the history involved -- the so-called 'comfort women' -- has long been accepted as fact not only in Japan but also around the world. Targeting this particular history now for political reasons ... raises serious concerns about the state of academic freedom in Japan today,"" the professor said.  ""As for Prime Minister Abe, it is important ... to understand that memory and history are different things. In this instance we have a politician who would openly supplant long proven histories with preferred national memories,"" he said.  The statement is ""an act of professional solidarity with historians in Japan and elsewhere -- South Korea, the Philippines, Australia, Indonesia -- who research and write about these issues, Dudden said.  ""Our aim is to show respect and solidarity for the efforts of historians everywhere who have long worked on the so-called comfort women issue and have published their work according to professional standards of evidence and multiple cross-referencing. This is how we produce the work we do, and why we hold to it as accurate and proven,"" he said.  In the joint statement, the scholars expressed ""dismay"" at Japan's pressuring of the textbook publisher, accusing the Abe administration of ""vocally questioning the established history of the comfort women and seeking to eliminate references to them in school textbooks"" as part of its effort to promote patriotic education.  They also stressed that ""no government should have the right to censor history.""  ""We practice and produce history to learn from the past. We therefore oppose the efforts of states or special interests to pressure publishers or historians to alter the results of their research for political purposes,"" the statement said.  Dudden stressed that ""academic freedom is at stake"" when certain political views summon history.  ""This is how memory takes over what it calls history by picking and choosing from the past at will instead of learning from it,"" he said.  ""Our small group agrees that it is the responsibility of historians who are able to practice in societies as open as the United States to recognize moments when colleagues elsewhere are themselves targeted and have their work targeted,"" he added.  Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mainly from Korea, which was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. But Japan has long attempted to whitewash the atrocity.  The sexual slavery issue has been the biggest thorn in frayed relations between Japan and South Korea, with Seoul demanding Japan take steps to address the grievances of elderly Korean victims of the atrocity and Japan refusing to do so.

He also reportedly wrapped his arm around a third student’s waist. In addition, there are allegations that he verbally abused female students, asking them their underwear size and about their physical relations with boyfriends.Meanwhile, a police station in southern Seoul is investigating another professor, surnamed Baek, into charges that he kissed a female student in November 2014. The professor is suspected of having touched her thigh a number of times over several months.The SNU human rights center is also conducting a probe into the claim. As soon as the center finalizes its inquiry, the school is expected to set up a decision-making panel to determine the sanction severity.In November, professor Kang Seok-jin of the department of mathematical sciences at SNU tendered his resignation following a scandal that he sexually abused dozens of his students for years.Kang had been under a prosecutors’ investigation for allegedly molesting a female intern who worked for him during the 2014 International Congress for Mathematicians in August, at which he was one of the speakers.After the case was reported, other female students spoke out claiming they too were sexually harassed by him.Kang was eventually placed under custody in early December on charges of molesting 22 students over the past 10 years. The university initially accepted his resignation, virtually letting him off the hook for the alleged crimes.A resignation before the university punishes him could ensure his severance pay, pension and little disadvantage when he seeks new jobs.However, following a public outcry, SNU rejected his resignation and vowed to continue its investigation.The school unveiled a plan in September to draft a Charter of Human Rights, becoming the first university to do so. The charter involves a code of conduct and guidelines for school personnel and students specifically banning any verbal or physical abuse, including sexual harassment.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","crimes resignation before the university ,he verbally abused female students ,charges of molesting 22 students ,verbally abused female students asking ,abused female students asking them","['Seoul National University', 'Seoul', 'Baek', 'Kang Seok - jin', 'SNU', 'Kang', 'Kang', 'SNU', 'Charter of Human Rights', 'Kim Yon - se']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.16242206  0.07601649

Efforts to normalize relations have stalled over Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programmes and on the continuing distrust over the kidnapping of Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 80s.  Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Koreans live in Japan, mostly a legacy of those who emigrated or were forced to move to Japan during its 1910-1945 colonial rule of the Korean peninsula.  About 10 percent are believed to be affiliated with Chongryon, which charges that the community is persecuted by authorities and harassed by right-wing activists.

(Yonhap)About 50.4 percent of Japanese students took issue with Abe’s denial that the Japanese military had forcibly turned women in Korea and other Asian countries into “comfort women,” a euphemism referring those coerced into sexual slavery by Japan during World War II. The survey by Seo Kyoung-duk, professor of general education at Sungshin Women’s University, was conducted on 250 students from South Korea and another 250 from Japan.Only 18 percent of Japanese students said Abe was “headed in the right direction” while another 18 percent said his approach was “controversial but inevitable for Japan’s future.” Some 13.6 percent called it a “failed policy.” Students from both South Korea and Japan thought their discord in history-related issues like comfort women and the South Korean islets of Dokdo was the biggest hindrance in the relationship between the two countries ― 78.4 percent of the former and 46.4 percent of the latter saying so. But 19.2 percent of Japan’s youth said Abe’s political stance was the biggest obstacle.“Japanese students’ discontent with Abe was not something I anticipated. It showed that the current (Japanese) administration may not be as popular as it claims to be,” said Seo. Abe’s administration has attempted to whitewash Japan’s wartime atrocities like comfort women, one of the thorny issues in South Korea-Japan relations. It recently asked a U.S. textbook publisher to revise its description of Japan’s sexual enslavement of some 200,000 Asian women.His attempt backfired when the publisher shot down the request and said “scholars are aligned behind the historical fact of comfort women.” U.S. Congressman Mike Honda even called Abe’s tactics “an act of nonsense.”But Seo’s survey also showed that students from two countries had different thoughts on comfort women. Although 94.4 percent of Koreans said Japan needs to apologize and compensate for the comfort women issue, only 32.4 of Japanese agreed.Some 37.6 percent said Japanese government has already compensated sufficiently for its crimes.“I was surprised to see that such high a number of Japanese students thought their government had done enough for the comfort women,” Seo said. “The results showed that Japan’s distortion of history was even more severe than I’d anticipated.”Among possible measures to close the widening gap between the two countries, joint historical research was the most popular choice among students of both countries, with Koreans at 58.4 percent and Japanese at 32 percent. It was followed by a South Korea-Japan summit, more exchange in the private sector, cultural exchanges and economic cooperation.

His wife reportedly delivered part of the ransom to them in exchange for the release.  The case was the latest kidnapping targeting South Koreans in the Philippines where violent crime such as murder and robbery aimed at Korean nationals have been on the rise in recent years.  Four South Koreans were set free on Jan. 26 after being held as hostages in the city of San Juan for four days.  Ten South Koreans were killed there last year while 13 Korean nationals were murdered there in 2013, according to the foreign ministry. In 2014, three cases of abduction of South Koreans took place.  The Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao consists of five Muslim provinces. Security in Mindanao remains unstable as Al-Qaeda-linked fundamentalist group Abusayapu and other Muslim extremists have been involved in crime targeting foreigners.  South Korea has imposed a special travel warning on Mindanao as crime targeting South Koreans there has increased. The travel warning calls for immediate withdrawal from the region.  Currently, an inspector-level officer is assigned to Manila's state police agency to handle criminal cases involving South Koreans.

Sadly, less than a year later, Adolf Hitler’s Germany invaded Poland when it would not surrender to German territorial demands. Germany had finally started a real war, World War II. Bruce W. BennettWhat Chamberlain appeared to miss is that the German objective was not to achieve “peace,” but rather to diplomatically undermine the strength and sovereignty of its neighbors en route to German dominance of Europe. For Hitler and other Nazi leaders, negotiations were an alternative means of waging war.We see a similar pattern with the current North Korean regime. It has reportedly declared that 2015 is the “year of a great war for unification.” It undoubtedly recognizes that the relative economic power of South Korea would allow South Korea to dominate any peaceful Korean unification, and therefore that a war of conquest is the only route for North Korea to dominate unification of Korea.But for North Korea to win a war of conquest against the South, the North must undermine the South Korea-U.S. alliance and degrade the readiness of the combined South Korea and U.S. military forces. The North has thus chosen to attack the major South Korea-U.S. military exercises that strengthen South Korea-U.S. military capabilities and cooperation. It has done so by promising not to carry out a nuclear test (which the United Nations has prohibited the North from doing) and by offering negotiations with the South and separately with the United States if the South Korea-U.S. exercises are canceled.For many, the North Korean approach seems reasonable. “The state-run Rodong Sinmun daily on Sunday said if the South Korean government ‘truly wants North-South talks and improved ties, it should demonstrate its sincerity by taking action to stop all the war rehearsals against North Korea,” the South Korean news outlet The Chosun Ilbo reported recently. Yet if this North Korean offer were sincere, wouldn’t the North stop talking of preparing for a “great war of unification” and offer to cancel its own preparations for such a war: its ongoing winter training exercises? But the North has not offered to cancel its winter training exercises. How hypocritical can the North be? If the North is serious about negotiating for improved Korean relations, it should “demonstrate its sincerity by taking action to stop all the war rehearsals’’ against South Korea.Meanwhile, many have complained about the U.S. government position of “strategic patience” with regard to North Korea. Because North Korea has reneged on many of its past-negotiated commitments, the United States has been waiting for the North to demonstrate its sincere intent to denuclearize before the United States returns to the Six-Party Talks or starts other formal negotiations. In practice, few in South Korea expect that the Six-Party Talks will lead to North Korean denuclearization unless the North changes its attitude ― exactly what the United States is asking North Korea to demonstrate. Instead, the North apparently wants the Six-Party Talks to recognize the North as a nuclear power, the opposite of denuclearization; why should the United States and South Korea join such negotiations?North Korea insists on not having to meet preconditions before restarting the Six-Party Talks. Yet the North is insisting that South Korea, in particular, meet preconditions for other negotiations with the North. Is North Korea really sincere about wanting to negotiate improved relations with South Korea and the U.S., or is it seeking to undermine the strength and sovereignty of its neighbor, just as Germany did before World War II?There is, of course, value to negotiating with any state, including North Korea, in part to test whether there is any possibility of peace and improved relations. President Park Geun-hye has properly argued that negotiations with the North will be useful to build trust and test the trustworthiness of the North. But there is little to be gained by meeting North Korean preconditions given the North’s history of not being trustworthy and its current hypocrisy. It is North Korea’s turn to demonstrate that South Korea and the United States should trust it. If the North is unprepared to demonstrate its sincerity, what chance is there that negotiations will amount to anything more than Kim Jong-un’s effort to wage war by another means? Does North Korea seek peace for our time, or dissolution of the South Korea-U.S. alliance en route to conquest of the ROK?By By Bruce W. BennettBruce W.

The ticket prices are in the relatively cheap 30,000 won ($27.36) range. The carrier has been changing sites after three to four days.  Industry sources estimated that about 20,000 tickets have been sold through TMON since last week, with more than 10,000 tickets also sold via WeMakePrice and Coupang.   It is not unprecedented but unusual that Korean Air has turned to social commerce stores to sell tickets in large numbers, especially for the Seoul-Jeju route which is heavily dominated by low-cost carriers.   The move is seen as an effort by Korean Air to lure customers away from the budget carriers, which have been chipping away at its dominance in domestic flight services. It also comes amid worries that customers are shunning Korean Air after the so-called ""nut rage"" incident that has tarnished its image among travelers.   Cho Hyun-ah, the eldest daughter of the airline's chairman, is on trial for endangering aviation safety after she ordered a senior crew member to deplane, angered that her macadamia nut snack was served in an unopened bag instead of on a plate. The Dec. 5 Seoul-bound flight out of New York had to return to the gate so that the crew member could get off.  On Monday, prosecutors sought a three-year prison term for Cho.  Experts say that the incident tarnished the image of Korean Air, which led many travelers to pick other airlines for their travel.  In December, Korean Air transported a total of 482,000 passengers through its domestic lines, down 6.6 percent from a year earlier. In contrast, Asiana Airlines, the second-largest air carrier, said its domestic flight customers increased 13.2 percent.

It is also considering employing a “one-strike” system in which senior officials, caught sexually harassing subordinate soldiers, will be forcibly expelled from the military for good, a senior Army official said.“We will toughen our disciplinary rules for sex crimes to mete out heavy punishments to those who sexually harass someone in the Army or commit worse sexual crimes,” the official told the media, declining to be named.Heavy punishments include suspension for one to three months, demotion, dismissal from the current position and expulsion from the military. The Army has taken such a hardline stance as sex crimes have continue to occur despite its adoption of a no-tolerance policy. It is expected to announce a comprehensive package of plans next month to stamp out sex crimes. The Army also plans to form a special agency at its headquarters dedicated to handling sex crimes. The agency to be headed by an Army deputy chief will consist of senior officials in charge of military investigation, law and personnel management. It will also be used to check whether each unit sternly deals with sex crimes on-site. To enhance education against sex crimes, the Army seeks to conduct a three-hour educational session for enlisted soldiers every three weeks. Soldiers have so far taken only one session each year.“We seek to improve education against sex crimes. Rather than offering just a rote-memorization class, we will devise a program in which draftees can engage in active discussions (to prevent sex crimes),” an army official said on condition of anonymity.”Last week, military police arrested an incumbent brigade commander on charges of sexually assaulting a female noncommissioned officer.

A special task force team is being launched in a bid to deal with fraud phone calls and new tricks from scammers, a police official said.The state-run financial regulator also warned that voice phishing scammers actively make fraud calls pretending to be parcel delivery services, since many Koreans send gifts for the occasion. “Be suspicious of unsolicited calls even if the caller claims to represent a respected or well-known company,” an official from the Financial Supervisory Service said.When a government organization has to contact individuals, it will never be through phone call but by sending a written statement, it added.A voice phishing scammer is caught on CCTV camera installed at a bank in Seoul. (Yonhap)According to the FSS data, there were 5,795 victims of voice phishing and a total of 58.6 billion won ($53.5 million) stolen in the first half of 2014 alone -- an increase of 39.2 percent and 121.1 percent respectively on-year.The Korea Internet and Safety Agency data showed that the amount of damages from scamming was 10.6 billion won from 1,480 cases in 2006.Experts said the numbers soared in 2013 as scams became sophisticated with the advent of smartphones -- from smishing to pharming and voice phishing. But the FSS data showed that just one out of 10 victims (11.4 percent) was able to recover the lost money in the first half of 2014. It is a 5.2 percent drop compared to 2013.Over the years, vishing scam calls came from China and were untraceable. But the tricks that scammers use have grown bold off late.When the new regulation surrounding year-end tax adjustment became a hot issue recently, smishing scammers sent text messages with a link to the financial organization website -- a fake website that charges large sums from the phone bill.A growing number of scammers pretended to be an official of the FSS or a government organization. They asked victims to update their personal confidential information such as bank account, credit card number and pin number. They used this information to withdraw cash or credit cash advances from ATM machines.Some even worked in teams to extort money from victims in a more systematic way.Police said Thursday that a team of eight unemployed college graduates were arrested for allegedly extorting 1.1 billion won over five years from some 100 victims in Daegu, North Gyeongsang Province.These perpetrators worked in pairs so they could withdraw money as quickly as possible from the ATM machines as well as to wipe their history quickly, a Daegu police official told a local media outlet.

The rest of the recommendations will be revised or improved, the ministry said. As for academic credit, the ministry seeks to allow draftees to acquire it after completing three weeks of military training. It also plans to establish a system under which conscripts can acquire 18 credits ― enough to complete one university semester. Defense Minister Han Min-koo, (Yonhap)“Currently, 110 universities recognize these military credits, and other universities including Seoul National University have also expressed their willingness to recognize the credits,” said Minister Han.To reduce abuses among draftees in hard-to-monitor military installations, the ministry seeks to install more surveillance cameras, which it believes will help prevent and promptly detect abuse cases.To address the increase in the sex crime rate in the military, the ministry plans to apply a toughened rule to prosecute any soldier charged with sex crimes, and detain those suspected of a serious sex crime during an investigation process.By next year, the military also plans to offer mobile phones to all units to be shared by the enlisted troops so that they can better communicate with their families, particularly parents.As for its consideration of offering some extra points in the recruitment exams after soldiers’ discharge, the ministry plans to further develop the plan as it is still difficult to determine who will receive the extra points. The ministry previously said the extra points will be given those who “perform conscientiously.”Meanwhile, the Army is reportedly moving to draft a code of conduct to strengthen discipline against sexual misconduct. The move comes after a series of sex crime cases including a recent one in which a brigade commander sexually assaulted a young female noncommissioned officer.Under the code, a soldier is reportedly barred from entering the military residence of another of the opposite sex, and physical contact between male and female soldiers is strictly limited to shaking hands.

The ministry also vowed to toughen punishment for those who desert animals or who do not properly protect their pets. Those who do not remove pet waste in public will also face a tougher fine, officials said. For those who want to give up raising pets, the government said it would launch a pilot project that allows owners to consider their decision for a certain period.

Prosecutors said they considered him a witness, rather than a suspect. The details of the case he was involved in were not immediately clear. He was once in charge of the Navy’s shipbuilding division.“We send our condolences to the bereaved family for this tragedy,” an official investigating the case said, asking not to be named. “Ham never complained about the interrogation process and we’re confident we’ve followed the proper protocol.” Police said they discovered a car, a suicide note and a pair of shoes near the scene. Professional divers have been deployed to search for the body, they said.In November, South Korea launched a task force comprised of prosecutors, military officers and government officials to root out corruption in the defense industry.The move came after an expensive homegrown salvage ship was proved defective at the peak of efforts to save those missing from a ferry disaster last year.

The suspect was confirmed Monday to be the son of a former aide to National Assembly Speaker Chung Ui-hwa. Police said he called Cheong Wa Dae’s civil affairs office Sunday around 2:39 a.m. and threatened to bomb it. Tourists take photographs with Cheong Wa Dae in the background on Jan. 25, the day the bomb threat was made. (Yonhap)“If you do not show me your willingness by noon, I will blow up Cheong Wa Dae,” he said in his message, without elaborating on what he meant by “willingness.”He made similar threats on Jan. 17 on Twitter, saying he would bomb the residence of President Park Geun-hye and her Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon.His motives were not yet known as of Tuesday, but he is believed to have a history of mental illness.The suspect was accompanied by his father, who on Friday submitted his resignation and headed to France to talk his son into facing authorities here. His father was a Grade-4 assistant at the assembly speaker’s office, and was in charge of arranging external events.Investigators have yet to definitively comment on how plausible the suspect’s threat was, but said there was “very little possibility” that he would have been able to carry out the bombing.The suspect left for France on Jan. 13 without his parents’ knowledge, and is unlikely to have had time to prepare the supposed attack. While Kang specified when of his attacks would take place, nothing actually occurred at the cited times. “As of now, the bomb threats appear to have been a simple prank with no possibility of being carried out. But we cannot conclusively say so untill we’ve questioned him,” said a police official.

Park’s approval ratings recently hit a new low of 34.1 percent.Under the new system, the authorities levy less taxes throughout the year and return less in tax settlements at the beginning of a new year. The key issue is that workers who did not spend much through the year face greater tax burdens in February.Though the Finance Ministry had asserted that the new scheme was aimed at improvement in wealth distribution, there are concerns that more middle and low-income workers could eventually be subject to higher taxation.The meeting drew attention as four extraordinary aides, who was appointed early Monday, joined discussions with the senior presidential secretaries. The post of extraordinary aide have been created to bolster communications with the public.Public support for Park waned further last week, after preliminary calculations of this year’s tax settlements showed that taxpayers nationwide could end up paying more taxes, or receive much smaller rebates than expected. Revisions to tax codes in 2013 by the government were blamed for the increased taxes.Meanwhile, the leader of the main opposition party on Monday denounced Cheong Wa Dae for Friday’s personnel reshuffle.“The public had continued to call on the presidential office to drastically revamp the aides’ organization after (the behind-the-scenes) power struggle scandal. But (the president) still showed credibility toward Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon and three core secretaries,” said Moon Hee-sang, chairman of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy.Moon said the administration had glossed over public opinion as it conducted the overhaul without dismissal of the chief of staff and some others, who were seen as accountable for the scandal.In contrast, the opposition leader highly assessed Prime Minister nominee Lee Wan-koo. “He pushed forth wide communications with opposition lawmakers as a floor leader of the (ruling) Saenuri Party.”Moon, however, vowed to thoroughly review his personal records in the coming confirmation hearings of the National Assembly.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","workers over their increased tax ,presidential office to drastically revamp ,party on monday denounced cheong ,citing salaried employees growing anger ,dae for friday personnel reshuffle","['Park Geun', 'Park', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Park ’s', 'the Finance Ministry', 'Park', 'Cheong', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'Moon Hee - sang', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Moon', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Saenuri Party', 'the National Assembly', 'Kim Yon - se']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29737628  0.39484307

But the plan has sparked confusion from education circles as the government has presented it without details.The ministry said it would push to apply a “personality test” section for admission, currently used by some colleges, to all higher education institutes starting next year. Colleges that pilot the personality tests for admission will receive incentives, according to the policy revealed Thursday at the 2015 policy briefing at the presidential office. But the ministry appears to have hastily presented the plan. “We will need to conduct further research on how exactly we will increase the personality test part,” said a high-ranking ministry official, suggesting that the ministry could recommend colleges to ask more personality-related questions in interviews.The lack of explanation touched off a commotion among teachers and students, who felt the pressure of having to come up with a totally new admissions strategy.“Many teachers are perplexed about having to deal with another policy that came out of the blue. The ministry did not reveal any specific plans, but we as teachers feel like we have to come up with some kind of countermeasure,” said a Seoul-based high school teacher surnamed Lee. The Education Ministry attempted to address an array of complaints by reiterating that it is not introducing any new measures, but simply enhancing an existing one currently being practiced mostly at tertiary education institutions for teachers. “The controversy stemmed from the general misunderstanding that the government has created a new college admissions model,” explained another official from the ministry’s university admissions division, adding that its plan is merely to accredit colleges that use personality tests effectively, and expand their models to other institutes.But some experts expressed their concerns that the government’s emphasis on personality tests may give birth to a new private education market. While such a test is not conventionally covered at cram schools, they said Koreans’ low trust in the public education system may drive parents to turn toward private education.According to a recent survey by a Gangsa.com, a job information website for private education, 44.5 percent of people aged 10 to 50 thought public education was not enough for their children’s education, as opposed to 34.1 percent who said it was. The rest ― 21.5 percent ― said it was “so-so.”But some predicted the new plan would have minimal effect.“The confusion derives from the ministry introducing an already-existent policy as if it is a brand new one,” said an official from local private education institute Uway. “But I don’t think the government plans will spark an increase in private education, since character education is not something private education can do anything about.”He added that it was unlikely that many colleges would add personality tests since it would prolong the admissions process.

The Ulsan District Court ruled that the sea captain must pay 110 million won ($102,000) to three family members of the defector, who worked for him as a diver, for not taking efficient safety measures to protect his life. The diver, who fled to Seoul in 2011, died of carbon monoxide poisoning while working underwater in 2013. The court, however, ruled that the captain only held 60 percent of the blame, as the diver was partly responsible for his own safety.The suit was filed by the diver’s older brother, who had been the first of the two to escape to Seoul. The brother, who has been the diver’s legal representative, named their parents and the victim’s wife as the plaintiffs.Despite the unprecedented ruling, speculation over whether the bereaved family in the North can indeed receive the compensation remains uncertain amid the strained ties between North and South Korea, legal experts said. Until the compensation is delivered to the plaintiffs, the legal representative is obliged to safeguard it under the court’s supervision, court authorities said. The compensation is not allowed to be handed over without the court’s permission, they added. The court is also allowed to appoint someone else to take care of the compensation if the legal representative is found to have mismanaged the money, court sources said.

(Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)On Jan. 19, 1990, Ilham, an Azerbaijani newlywed, took to the streets of Baku to protest against the Soviet invasion. Unarmed, he yelled, “Stop firing at innocent civilians.” Soviet soldiers shot him dead.Upon hearing the news of his death, his wife Farida committed suicide later in the evening. Their bodies were cremated together the next day and buried at Martyrs’ Lane cemetery in Baku. 25 years since, their graves have been visited by throngs of lovers and couples.Ilham and Farida were among 137 Azerbaijanis who died during the Soviet troops’ violent two-day crackdown on the independence demonstration, which later became known as “Black January.” “Under the authorization of former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, 26,000 troops and tanks stormed our country and killed, tortured and imprisoned Azeris who demanded independence from the Soviet Union,” Azerbaijani Ambassador to Korea Ramzi Teymurov said in a keynote speech at a 25th anniversary memorial at the embassy building in Seoul last Monday. Azerbaijani Ambassador Ramzi Teymurov“The purpose of the heinous attack was to delay the Soviet demise and suppress Azerbaijan’s freedom demands.”More than 130 people were killed and 800 injured. The event only hastened the Soviet collapse, already set in motion by the glasnost and perestroika reforms, Teymurov said. The Soviet justification was to “stop pogroms and violence against Armenians in Azerbaijan,” 50 of whom were killed in an ethnic clash a week earlier on Jan. 13. The Azerbaijani Embassy refuted the claim, saying the Soviet militarily intervened to transfer jurisdiction of the Nagorno-Karabakh region from Azerbaijan to Armenia.Ethnic tensions between Azerbaijanis and Armenians erupted into a full-scale war in 1991. Armenia, backed by the Russian military, gained control of the region. International organizations such as the U.N. General Assembly, Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and the Organization of the Islamic Conference have condemned the Armenian occupation, Teymurov said. In 1994, a cease-fire agreement was signed with no resolution of a peace agreement to date ― a situation similar to North and South Korea, the ambassador added. Through the conflict, over 1 million ethnic Azerbaijanis became refugees and internationally displaced persons. Gorbachev, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1990, apologized to Azerbaijan in 1995 and said, “The declaration of a state of emergency in Baku was the biggest mistake of my political career.”Azerbaijan has since pursued an independent foreign policy track, one characterized by “pragmatism, restraint and a helpful bias toward integration with the West,” a U.S. diplomatic cable was quoted as saying in a New York Times article on Jan. 9, 2015. At the same time, Baku’s current relations with Moscow remain “very positive” as a strategic partnership, the ambassador added. He said that despite the political instability, economic breakdown, social chaos and lack of defense capacity of the early 1990s, Azerbaijan developed rapidly as a sovereign and economically vibrant nation. The “contract of the century” ― aimed at tapping into the country’s rich deep-water oil reserves ― was signed between Azerbaijan’s state oil company and 13 Western oil companies in 1994.Azerbaijan is the third-largest ex-Soviet oil producer. The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline passes through Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey for 1,768 kilometers, supplying Azeri crude oil to the European markets. “We are now trying to diversify our economy by developing non-oil industries,” Teymurov said. “Our government is investing the oil and gas revenues in the information and technology, construction, infrastructure, agriculture and tourism sectors for future growth.” Teymurov noted that more than 40 Korean companies have participated in various public projects in Azerbaijan in the last five years. Total Korean investment stands at $150 million and bilateral trade volume reached $300 million in 2013. Interparliamentary and military cooperation has been active, Teymurov added, affirmed by Korean Prime Minister Chung Hong-won’s visit to Azerbaijan last November. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev visited Korea in 2007, and again in 2012 to participate in the Seoul Nuclear Security Summit.

COI report is ""sheer lies"" because testimonies by North Korean defectors, including Shin, which the report is based on, cannot be trusted.""So needless to say, all the 'resolutions on the human rights' forcibly adopted against the DPRK on the basis of such false documents are invalid,"" the statement noted.The statement was later followed by letters to the U.N. and its Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon by North Korean Ambassador to the U.N. Ja Song-nam, as well as So Se-pyong, ambassador to the North Korean mission to Geneva, which called for the suspension of human rights violation charges against North Korea.The U.S. and COI Chairman Michael Kirby came to the defense of the human rights report earlier this week, saying that the report is sufficient enough as evidence of North Korea's deplorable human rights situation.Despite the defense, the North may muster further efforts to discredit testimonies of North Korean defectors, as well as human rights violation charges based on the testimonies, experts said.""So far, the testimonies of North Korean defectors played the key role in formulating the image of North Korea to the outside world,"" said Chang Yong-suk, a researcher at the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies at Seoul National University. ""The country could attempt to capitalize on the recent episode of Shin in order to renew its negative image,"" Chang noted.The COI report, which accused North Korea of ""systemic, widespread and gross human rights violations,"" was the basis of the U.N.'s adoption of a human rights resolution late last year, calling for the referral of the human right situation to the International Criminal Court.North Korea has vehemently resisted the COI report, saying it's a U.S. plot to topple the regime.

Out of the 5,157 names listed on the records, 2,091 were immediately confirmed as bona-fide victims of Japan's forced labor.The records were compiled in 1953 under the Rhee Syng-man administration following South Korea's independence from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule.The confirmation comes as some local labor victims are awaiting a court ruling in a landmark damage suit filed against some Japanese companies that were involved in the colonial-era forced labor.Officials said a court decision in favor of the South Korean labor victims may trigger a flurry of economic and diplomatic issues to be settled between the neighbors. The government estimates that up to 7,820,000 Koreans had been forced into hard labor under the brutal colonial rule of Japan.Only 600,000 so far have been officially recognized as labor victims entitled to state financial support.Japan has long declared that all liabilities toward the South Korean government and individual victims were settled through the 1965 treaty between the two countries, which restored diplomatic ties. In the treaty, Japan provided a large sum of money to the South Korean government.

The report pointed out, however, that Abe’s remark about expressing “remorse” for the war in the statement to be issued in August has set off speculation that the “planned document may stop short of a forthright apology.”It also criticized Abe for demonstrating “an inconsistent pattern” of making and then recanting controversial statements that upset China and South Korea, referring to Abe’s 2013 comments that suggested his government would not reaffirm a 1995 statement of apology made by then Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama.The so-called Murayama Statement is regarded as Japan’s most significant official apology for wartime acts, the report said.

Our religion does not allow that,"" said Zamfis Anuar, a Muslim primary school teacher in Kuala Lumpur.But the reaction in the West ""makes (Muslims) think, 'who are your friends?""The issue has emerged at a delicate time for Malaysia and Indonesia -- the world's most populous Muslim country -- with both nations on alert over Islamic State militants' proven ability to lure their citizens to jihad in Syria.Many Muslims in Southeast Asia, like their counterparts elsewhere, believe a Western anti-Islam agenda exists, said Noorhaidi Hasan, a lecturer on Islam at Indonesia's Sunan Kalijaga Islamic University.""The Charlie Hebdo incident likely strengthens at some level their belief in that conspiracy theory,"" he said.  If coupled with worsening economic conditions, this could ""give rise to radicalism"", he added.      - Lure of Islamic State -   =========================   Frequently feted by the West as examples for the rest of the Muslim world, stable and economically dynamic Indonesia and Malaysia have centuries-old traditions of moderate Islam, which experts say are unlikely to change.But Indonesia has vivid memories of Islamic militant attacks including the 2002 Bali bombings that killed 202 people, mostly foreign tourists, and small-scale extremist strikes still occur occasionally.Anti-terror crackdowns in both nations have dramatically weakened militant networks, but IS has attracted at least hundreds of Indonesian and Malaysian recruits, raising fears they will bring the group's violent ideology back home. Last year, tiny, oil-rich Brunei underlined a slow but steady regional drift toward more conservative Islam by phasing in a new sharia criminal code that will eventually include death by stoning, amputation of limbs and other harsh penalties for a range of crimes.In Malaysia, meanwhile, a conservative Islamic party has stepped up its own calls for similar measures in a state it controls.The Paris attack was likely quietly applauded among hardline conservative Muslims in the region, who feel Charlie Hebdo pushed too far, said Joseph Liow, an expert on Southeast Asian militancy at the Brookings Institute in the United States.""Even those classified as 'moderate' would be uneasy with Charlie Hebdo even if they condemn the attacks.  To them, Charlie Hebdo is, to put it in simple terms, extremist.""In this environment, leaders in the two countries have walked a delicate line. Indonesian President Joko Widodo condemned the Paris attacks, while saying no one should ""mock or insult"" religions, echoing similar calls by Malaysia's Najib Razak.       - Paris rally 'nauseating' -   ============================   But some in Muslim-majority, multi-ethnic Malaysia have used the attacks to decry the West.A conservative firebrand suggested the magazine had it coming, and popular Youth Minister Khairy Jamaluddin called the post-attack anti-terror march in Paris by various world leaders ""nauseating"".""Muslims are no longer talking about the attack but about the West's hostility. This can increase radical ideas,"" said Mohamad Asri Zainal Abidin, former official mufti, or Islamic scholar, for the northern Malaysian state of Perlis.""Many Muslims may start to believe that there is no space for good relations with the West, which leaves no hope for moderates.""Some Malaysian officials, meanwhile, have sparked concern by using the episode to justify an ongoing crackdown on free speech that has dismayed progressives.Both countries have warned of possible attacks at home by IS sympathisers, with Malaysian officials saying Charlie Hebdo could potentially escalate the threat.On Monday, Malaysia's Najib issued an unusual call for the country's Islamic authorities to use their influence to counter jihadism, and police have said they are stepping up monitoring of Islamic schools.AFP reporters who visited one such school outside Kuala Lumpur recently found teen students openly expressing a desire to die in the IS jihad.But observers said both countries have a firm grip on militancy and that the core tolerance embedded in their cultures appeared secure, especially if their economies remain stable.""Indonesia is on the right track,"" said Hasan, the Indonesian academic.

We indeed killed them, as our Lord instructed us in His Book,"" Shekau said in the 35-minute message, which was posted on the video-sharing website YouTube.The militant leader was shown speaking in front of four white pick-up trucks, with eight masked and heavily armed men.

This is not much. You'll see.""Representatives from Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon have been meeting to seek a regional response to the threat from Boko Haram because of increasing fears of cross-border raids.Ghana's President John Dramani Mahama has also suggested a new force, possibly under the auspices of the African Union, to crush the group.But in the video, Shekau dismisses the threat and shows off a huge arsenal of weapons, apparently from the military base, and said Boko Haram would take on all-comers.""The kings of Africa, you are late.

Those sex slaves were euphemistically described by the Japanese military as “comfort women.”“The bottom line of Japan’s wartime sex slavery is that Japan systematically mobilized women to perform during the war and the human rights of many women were abused,” Seok said in his article, which was also published in the Chinese language by a Hong Kong-based newspaper, Ta Kung Pao, on Friday.“If the Japanese government of Shinzo Abe continues to take steps toward the wrong path and cause friction with neighboring countries, it will eventually undermine Japan’s own national interests,” Seok said. Japan has yet to atone properly for its wartime sexual slavery and has not paid direct compensation to any of the victims. Earlier this month, Japan’s foreign ministry asked an American publisher to change references of the victims of wartime sex slavery, in a fresh bid to whitewash Japan’s record of wartime atrocities abroad.South Korea has pressed Japan to address long-running grievances by the victims of wartime sex slavery by extending a formal apology and compensating them. But Japan has refused to do so, saying the matter was settled by a 1965 treaty that normalized relations between the two countries.Little progress was reported in this week’s new round of talks between Seoul and Tokyo over wartime sex slavery.

After the 2013 exams in November, four test-takers challenged the accuracy of a world geography question. The Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation, in charge of making the questions, refused to recognize the error and engaged in a yearlong legal battle with the students. In October, a Seoul court ruled in favor of the students and the government subsequently proposed a set of measures to offset the damages. These included granting college admission to some students who failed to enter the colleges of their choice due to the flawed question.But the plaintiffs ― 100 students who had taken the world geography test ― said Monday that they were substantially penalized by errors in college admission. They blamed the state and the KICE, saying their reluctance to admit their faults ultimately worsened the damage caused by the error. “The flaw of the cited question could have been easily determined through statistics. The KICE had ample time to admit the errors and minimize the damage, but they did not,” the students said in their petition.According to Kim Hyeon-cheol, their legal representative, the focus of the lawsuit is not the error itself but the defendants’ attitude after the students challenged the question. The total compensation requested by the students comes to 2.34 billion won ($2.16 million). As of Tuesday, 450 students across the country said they intended to take part in the lawsuit.The grades of 18,884 students nationwide were affected by the flawed question. The incident is widely considered one of the worst Suneung-related disputes since the national exam was introduced in 1994. In the aftermath of the public uproar that followed, which was stoked by the discovery of two more flawed questions in the 2014 exams, the Education Ministry vowed to announce a reform plan by March.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","college entrance exam lodged lawsuit ,november four test takers challenged ,korea after the 2013 exams ,legal battle with the students ,entrance exam lodged lawsuit against","['Korea', 'the Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation', 'Seoul', 'KICE', 'KICE', 'Kim Hyeon', 'the Education Ministry', 'Yoon Min - sik']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.17356737  0.6135242

Canada is only involved in Iraq operations.Canada sent some 600 air crew and other military personnel -- as well as six fighter jets and other military aircraft -- to the region in November to participate in the air strikes against the Islamic State.The Canadian deployment is due to end in April, unless parliament votes to extend the mission.There are also 69 Canadian special forces training and advising Iraqi troops on the ground, but theoretically not in combat.Most of the instruction, a key plank of Western moves to defeat the emboldened IS group, takes place ""well behind front lines,"" Rouleau noted.The Islamic State group gained international notoriety last August when its fighters and those from other militant groups swept through the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, then overran swaths of territory north and west of Baghdad, threatening to overrun the capital.Western governments fear IS could eventually strike overseas, but their biggest immediate worry was its gains in Iraq and Syria, and the likely eventual return home of foreign fighters.US President Barack Obama has outlined plans for the broad international coalition to ""significantly degrade"" the group in Iraq and Syria.The coalition air strikes in Iraq and Syria have targeted IS fighting positions, heavy weapons and buildings used to store weapons.Lieutenant General Jonathan Vance said the Islamic State ""has been stopped (in Iraq) and they are unable to mount broad offensive operations that would somehow change the situation dramatically.""But, he added, using another acronym for IS, ""a large-scale reversal of ISIL's position in Iraq has yet to come.""Using aerial maps, he pointed out ""relatively modest areas where the tide has turned and Iraqi forces are in control of the area.""

543,543,Key North Korean defector 'misled' him on life story,"A prominent North Korean defector who fled a prison camp and became the face of international efforts to hold the country accountable for widespread human rights abuses has changed important parts of his life story. Author Blaine Harden says in a statement on his website that he has pressed Shin Dong-Hyuk to ""explain why he had misled me'' during interviews for Harden's book on Shin, ""Escape from Camp 14.'' North K...","A prominent North Korean defector who fled a prison camp and became the face of international efforts to hold the country accountable for widespread human rights abuses has changed important parts of his life story. Author Blaine Harden says in a statement on his website that he has pressed Shin Dong-Hyuk to ""explain why he had misled me'' during interviews for Harden's book on Shin, ""Escape from Camp 14.'' North Korea tried to discredit Shin late last year as it fought a U.N. General Assembly resolution that backed the findings of a groundbreaking U.N. commission of inquiry into Pyongyang's human rights abuses.  Human rights groups say the U.N. inquiry was based on interviews with scores of North Korean defectors. ""Its findings are still valid,'' said Brad Adams, Asia director for Human Rights Watch. The organization last year gave Shin an award for extraordinary activism and said he is ""regarded as the single strongest voice on atrocities taking place in North Korea.'' Shin was traveling and could not be reached for comment. He was expected to arrive in Seoul from the U.S. on Monday afternoon, said Greg Scarlatoiu, executive director of the Washington-based Committee for Human Rights in North Korea. ""Every one of us have stories, or things we'd like to hide,'' Shin said in an apology for the inaccuracies in recounting his past in his latest Facebook post, giving few details. He said he may or may not be able to continue his work of trying to eliminate North Korea's political prison camps but urged others to keep fighting. ""These will be my final words and this will likely be my final post.'' Shin's story originally drew widespread attention because he said he had lived in a high-security political prison camp in North Korea from his birth until his escape through an electrified fence. He describes himself on Facebook as ""the only known person born in a North Korean prison camp that escaped and survived to tell the tale.'' Harden has described Shin as a reluctant narrator, and a sometimes unreliable one. ""In writing this book, I have sometimes struggled to trust him,'' Harden wrote in the introduction to his book. ""He misled me in our first interview about his role in the death of his mother, and he continued to do so in more than a dozen interviews. When he changed his story, I became worried about what else he might have made up.'' Harden's statement says he passed along Shin's new information to The Washington Post, his former employer. Its report over the weekend said Shin now says he was transferred around the age of 6 to a lighter-security prison camp with his mother and brother. It was there, not the harsher camp, where he informed authorities about an escape attempt by his mother and brother. For that, they were executed. He now says he was later transferred back to the harsher camp. Shin didn't realize that changing dates and places of major events would be important, Harden's statement says. ""The fundamental building blocks of his story have remained the same, although I am fully aware of the differences between (the two camps),'' Scarlatoiu said Sunday. ""Still, born and raised in a camp, he was subjected to forced labor, induced malnutrition and torture. He informed on his mother and brother, who were executed. He escaped from the camp, and lived to tell his story. None of that has changed.'' Shin's earlier account helped drive the international effort to hold North Korea accountable. He and another defector met with then-U.N. human rights chief Navi Pillay just days before she called for the commission of inquiry in early 2013. ""Their personal stories were extremely harrowing,'' she said at the time. North Korea's government denies the existence of the harsh political prison camps, and human rights groups and others rely on both information from defectors and satellite images for information. The North Korean government did not allow the U.N. commission of inquiry to visit the country for its work. A spokesman for North Korea's mission to the United Nations had no immediate comment. The commission of inquiry's report, released early last year, detailed abuses including mass starvation and forced abortions, and it recommended that North Korea's human rights situation be referred to the International Criminal Court. The commission of inquiry also sent a letter to leader Kim Jong Un warning him that he could be held accountable. That alarmed North Korean authorities, and its diplomats circulated a DVD called ""Lie and Truth: Who is Shin Dong-Hyuk?'' in an attempt to discredit him by using footage of his own father speaking out against him and saying the family had never lived in a ""so-called political prisoner camp.'' But Shin said the DVD merely proved that his father was still alive.

The new year also marks the 70th anniversary of Seoul's liberation from Tokyo's colonial rule in 1945.Since taking office in early 2013, South Korean President Park Geun-hye has shunned a summit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as a show of anger against Tokyo's refusal to atone for its historical wrongdoings.In her new year press conference on Jan. 12, Park repeatedly urged Japan to face up to history, warning that the issue could be a ""big burden"" on Japan unless it is quickly resolved.South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se told reporters in Seoul earlier in the day that Japan is seen as not offering sufficient conditions for the bilateral summit to be held.""Japan seems to deal with the sex slavery issue solely from the perspective of a bilateral matter. But the comfort women issue is a matter of universal human rights,"" Yun said.The foreign minister expressed hope that the Seoul-Tokyo talks on the sex slavery could produce progress so that it could set the stage for improvement in bilateral ties.The Seoul-Tokyo ties have plunged to the lowest levels in recent years mainly due to the sex slavery issue. Historians estimate the number of such sex slaves at about 200,000 with only 55 South Korean victims alive today.In June, Japan angered Seoul and Beijing, both victims of Tokyo's wartime aggression, by saying that its 1993 apology over the sex slavery issue, named the Kono Statement, was the outcome of a political compromise between Seoul and Tokyo.Abe said he will express remorse over Japan's role in the war in his fresh statement that will come around Aug. 15 to mark the 70th anniversary of Japan's defeat in World War II.But analysts predict that the premier is not likely to apologize for the sex slavery issue and may water down the spirit of Japan's 1995 apology for Japan's colonial rule, named the Murayama Statement.

The measure is considered the most effective U.S. sanction yet on the North.""Frankly, I was in government when it happened. We were all surprised it worked so well,"" Hayden said. ""When you can turn the torque up on elites for luxury goods and the ability to exchange money you do have an effect on the North Korean regime. Those (latest) sanctions ... are not that.""The U.S. later lifted the BDA sanctions to get Pyongyang back to denuclearization talks.Former Congressman Mike Rogers also said the latest sanctions were ""light at best.""""There is no real financial grind that they are going to go into to impact the people who are living well in North Korea,"" said Rogers, who served as chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the primary House committee charged with the oversight of the U.S. intelligence community.""Most people don't even have electricity. One in 10 have access to electricity and that's not for 24 hours a day. So, if you are going to do this, you have to start impacting the people who are enjoying all of the niceties of life with no consequence,"" he said during the forum.Despite such doubts about the latest sanctions, U.S. administration officials have argued that the measures are an ""important new tool"" that gives a ""tremendous amount of flexibility"" against those who provide support for the blacklisted North Korean entities and officials.Meanwhile, John McAfee, founder of anti-virus firm McAfee, said he can say for sure that it is not North Korea that hacked Sony. He claims he has been in touch with the real perpetrators and said the FBI was wrong in blaming the North.""I can guarantee they are wrong. It has to do with a group of hackers -- I will not name them -- who are civil libertarians and who hate the confinement, the restrictions the music industry and the movie industry has placed on art and so they are behind it,"" McAfee said, according to IBTimes UK.Some private cyber-security experts have raised questions about the FBI's finding, claiming the skills employed in the attacks were too sophisticated for the North. They have raised the possibilities that laid-off Sony employees or others might have been behind the attacks.FBI Director James Comey said at a cyber-security conference last week that he is sure that the North was the perpetrator in the Sony hack.

Some of you lost part of your families. All I can do is keep silent. And I walk with you all with my silent heart.""Many in the crowd wept as Francis spoke, overcome by the memory of the Nov. 8, 2013, storm that leveled entire villages with ferocious winds and 7-meter (21-foot) waves and left more than 7,300 people dead or missing. Francis joined them in solidarity, even donning the same yellow rain poncho over his vestments that Mass-goers were given to protect them from the storm.He drew applause when he told them that he had decided to visit the city of 200,000 in the eastern Leyte province in the days immediately after the storm.""I wanted to come to be with you. It's a bit late, I have to say, but I am here.""Francis spoke in his native Spanish -- which he reverts to when he wants to speak from the heart. He ditched his prepared homily and instead composed a brief prayer off the cuff that began:  ""Thank you, Lord, for sharing our pain. Thank you, Lord, for giving us hope...""As he spoke, the winds whipped the altar cloth and threatened to topple over the candlesticks.Francis was scheduled to have lunch with survivors of Haiyan and meet with clergy who provided relief to the victims in the storm's aftermath before returning to the capital, Manila. But the Mass was pushed up by 45 minutes, and the rest of his day in Tacloban put into question by approaching Tropical Storm Mekkhala. The storm, packing winds of 100 kilometers (62 miles) per hour, suspended ferry services to Leyte province, stranding thousands of travelers including some who wanted to see the pope. With the winds strong enough to blow away thatched roofs common in the regions, it is forecast to slam ashore on nearby Samar Island later Saturday. A police official estimated the crowd at 150,000 before the pope's arrival and said tens of thousands more were lined up outside the airport area. Wearing plastic raincoats, the festive crowd in the city clapped in unison to blaring music welcoming the pope, cheering when his plane landed after the hour-long flight from Manila.The pope blew kisses, waved and flashed the thumbs up sign to the crowd while riding on a covered popemobile from the airport terminal to the nearby altar.""I hope the pope can help us forget and help us accept that our loved ones are gone,"" said Joan Cator, 23, weeping as she spoke. She lost two aunts and four nieces and nephews. ""We still cry often and don't talk about what happened.""Villagers hung banners welcoming the pope from the bow of a steel-hulled cargo shop that smashed houses when it was swept in by Haiyan and remains on shore.""Pope Francis cannot give us houses and jobs, but he can send our prayers to God,"" said Ernesto Hengzon, 62. ""I'm praying for good health and for my children too. I am old and sickly. I'm praying that God will stop these big storms. We cannot take any more of it. We have barely recovered. Many people are still down there.""Francis is visiting the Philippines after stopping in Sri Lanka earlier in the week.On Sunday, he is due to celebrate the culminating Mass of the visit in Manila's Rizal Park, where as many as 6 million people are expected. St. John Paul II drew a record 5 million people to his final Mass in Manila in 1995, and organizers say they think Francis may top that record.During his visit, Francis has condemned the corruption that deprives the poor and he issued his strongest defense yet of church teaching opposing artificial contraception. He also made a surprise visit to meet with street children cared for by a Catholic foundation. Photos of the event show a beaming Francis sitting with two boys on his lap, and another with children embracing his belly.Security has been tighter than it has ever been for this pope. It appeared to let up a bit outside of Manila: Cellphones worked in Tacloban and the police presence appeared to be less intrusive, though Mass-goers were told not to bring umbrellas.","devastating 2013 typhoon braving rains ,survivors of devastating 2013 typhoon ,of devastating 2013 typhoon braving ,devastating 2013 typhoon braving ,of devastating 2013 typhoon","['Philippines', 'AP', 'Francis', 'Philippines', 'Francis', 'catholic', 'Tacloban', 'Typhoon Haiyan', 'Francis', 'Francis', 'Spanish', 'Francis', 'Haiyan', 'Manila', 'Tacloban', 'Leyte', 'Manila', 'Joan Cator', 'Haiyan', 'Francis', 'Ernesto Hengzon', 'Philippines', 'Sri Lanka', 'Manila', 'Rizal Park', 'John Paul II', 'Manila', 'Francis', 'Francis', 'catholic', 'Francis', 'Manila', 'Tacloban']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41560149  0.03760819

Bullying was found to be the motive for the rampage.He then ran away from his 22nd Infantry Unit with his rifle and a stash of ammunition. Two days later, he was captured while being under siege by thousands of troops right after a botched suicide attempt.Two months later, Lim was indicted on charges of murder and desertion.During his final court-martial hearing held at the First Army Headquarters in Wonju, some 132 kilometers southeast of Seoul, military prosecutors demanded the capital punishment, arguing that he committed a ""cruel and premeditated attack"" on unarmed comrades.""""Such a severe punishment is inevitable as he has been trying to justify his wrongdoings while putting the blame on his colleagues who had allegedly ostracized him for his behavior,"" the prosecution said in its argument.But Lim's lawyer appealed for leniency, contending that the exact cause of the incident has yet to be determined.""It's questionable if the death sentence can resolve the problem,"" the lawyer said in his final argument.Earlier in the day, the military court adopted as an evidence the result of a psychiatric test conducted on Lim for a month from November. According to military sources, the test showed that the soldier was ""generally normal.""South Korea's military law stipulates that a soldier faces the capital punishment for killing a superior officer. One of the fallen soldiers was a staff sergeant in Lim's unit.The sentencing is due to take place on Feb. 3.

Launched last April, the consultations will be their sixth session. With Korea regarding the issue’s resolution as essential for a rapprochement, Japan acceded to the first-of-its-kind meeting ahead of a trilateral summit between President Park Geun-hye, U.S. President Barack Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. But the two sides appear to have since made little progress given stark differences in their stances, with some Seoul officials saying that the negotiations were only “backpedaling” amid Abe’s revisionist push. Seoul has been demanding an official, sincere apology and compensation for the victims, while Tokyo claims the issue was settled in a 1965 agreement that restored their relations.Korea is expected to once again press for a breakthrough as the two countries mark the 50th anniversary of normalized ties this year. “The issue of the so-called comfort women is a humanitarian one concerning wartime violence against women, and we’re hoping for an early resolution given the old ages of the victims,” presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook told reporters Friday. On Thursday, a group of lawmakers led by Rep. Suh Chung-won, a longtime confidant of Park and senior member of the ruling Saenuri Party, met with Abe in Tokyo. They delivered the president’s message that this year would hopefully provide a chance for the two countries to “make a fresh start.” Abe, in response, expressed his sympathy for the victims and said he upholds a 1993 apology issued by then-Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono. But the nationalist leader stopped short of indicating a resolve to put an end to the longstanding dispute with concrete measures, expressing regret that the issue was becoming “politicized.” Up to 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, are believed to have been forced to provide sex to Japanese troops in frontline brothels during the war. Of the 237 Korean women who have come forward as former sex slaves, 55 are still alive.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","ministry on monday in tokyo ,sexual slavery involving korean women ,their sixth session with korea ,president barack obama and japanese ,korean women during world war","['Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'korean', 'Lee Sang - deok', 'northeast asian', 'the Foreign Ministry', 'Junichi Ihara', 'asian', 'oceanian', 'Japan ’s Foreign Ministry', 'Tokyo', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Park Geun - hye', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Seoul', 'Abe ’s', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Korea', 'Min Kyung - wook', 'Suh Chung - won', 'Park', 'Saenuri Party', 'Abe', 'Tokyo', 'Abe', 'Yohei Kono', 'Koreans', 'japanese', 'korean', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",12,"[ 0.          2.          2.         ...  0.18896449  0.7092213

The new year also marks the 70th anniversary of Seoul's liberation from Tokyo's colonial rule in 1945.The Seoul-Tokyo ties have plunged to the lowest levels in recent years mainly due to the sex slavery issue. Historians estimate the number of such sex slaves at about 200,000 with only about 50 South Korean victims alive today.Japan angered Seoul and Beijing, victims of Tokyo's wartime aggression, in June by saying that its 1993 apology over the sex slavery issue, named the Kono Statement, was the outcome of a political compromise between Seoul and Tokyo.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he will express remorse over Japan's role in the war in his fresh statement that will come on Aug. 15 to mark the 70th anniversary of Japan's defeat of World War II.But many analysts predict that the premier will not apologize for the sex slavery issue and may water down the spirit of Japan's 1995 apology for Japan's colonial rule, named the Murayama Statement.Since taking office in early 2013, South Korean President Park Geun-hye has shunned a summit with Abe as a show of anger against Tokyo's refusal to atone for its historical wrongdoings.In her New Year press conference on Monday, Park urged Japan to face up to history, warning that the issue could be a ""big burden"" on Japan unless it is quickly resolved.

The hawkish premier is currently working on a statement to be unveiled on Aug. 15 to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, which will likely determine Tokyo’s relations with its two key neighbors. With Abe pushing for a constitutional revision, a greater military role and various revisionist moves, academics around the world, including pro-Japan experts, have been saying that for the policies to win support at home and abroad a sincere atonement for the country’s wartime atrocities should be made. For Seoul, the issue of Tokyo’s sexual enslavement of Korean women during the conflict remains the biggest thorn in their bilateral relationship, with their reconciliation hinging on the resolution of the issue. “Abe needs to realize that this is a lose-lose issue for Japan,” Jeffrey Hornung, a professor at the Hawaii-based Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies, said in a recent article for the journal Foreign Affairs, referring to the so-called comfort women dispute. While embracing the comfort women statues in Korea and the U.S., the premier should reaffirm his strong commitment to the 1993 Kono Statement by reissuing it as his own apology, Hornung said. The statement made by then-Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono offered Japan’s “sincere apology and remorse” for the “immeasurable pain and incurable physical and psychological wounds” inflicted during its rule. “Abe recently reiterated his commitment to it. Now he should reaffirm it as official government policy by putting it out in his capacity as prime minister: an Abe statement,” the professor said. “He should place a rose on the empty chair at the statue in front of Japan’s embassy in Seoul. Such an act would be powerfully symbolic, demonstrating to the world his country’s embrace of the issue, his remorse, and a reminder to the world of Japan’s commitment to peace for the past 70 years.” Michael Auslin, director of Japan Studies at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, stressed that Abe’s past endorsement of previous formal apologies, including one issued in 1995 by then-Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, had been deemed “inapt and offensive” due to other remarks and moves that suggested otherwise. The prime minister “must put all this behind him” by offering a genuine apology this year, he said, which would help him execute his pursuit of greater military engagement in Asia and enable his people to better understand and discuss more comprehensively their past and future. “While expressing ‘remorse’ is inward looking, an apology is outward directed,” Auslin wrote on the Commentator, a website. “Abe, who has a bold and largely coherent plan for Japan to play a larger and more beneficial role in Asia, should take this anniversary as an opportunity to once and for all signal official Japanese acceptance of the tragedy of the past.”By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","pressure on japanese prime minister ,enslavement of korean women during ,japanese acceptance of the tragedy ,world including pro japan experts ,for japan jeffrey hornung professor","['Japan', 'Korea', 'China', 'U.S.', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Tokyo', 'Abe', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'korean', 'Abe', 'Japan', 'Jeffrey Hornung', 'Hawaii', 'Asia - Pacific Center for Security Studies', 'Foreign Affairs', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'Hornung', 'Yohei Kono', 'Japan', 'Abe', 'Abe', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'Michael Auslin', 'Japan Studies', 'the American Enterprise Institute', 'Washington', 'Abe ’s', 'Tomiichi Murayama', 'Commentator', 'Abe', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",3,"[ 0.          6.          1.         ... -0.19213906  0.4989849

During a meeting with Korean correspondents in Japan, Suh said that among many pending bilateral issues, what mattered the most was restoring the honor of Korean women who were forced into sexual slavery by Japan during World War II.“Japan should again present a clear stance on upholding the Kono Statement,” he said in Tokyo. “Should any other words (that could challenge the statement) come out (of the Tokyo government), it will be difficult (to improve the bilateral ties).”Suh, the head of the Korea-Japan Parliamentarians’ Union, arrived in Japan on Wednesday, along with other South Korean lawmakers, for a three-day visit to help work toward improving relations, which have been strained due to territorial and historical feuds.Following the press meeting, Suh was to hold a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during which he was to convey a message from President Park Geun-hye.Suh’s remarks on the Kono Statement came amid concerns that the Abe government could move to discredit or water down the Kono Statement, in which then-Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono apologized to the victims of sexual slavery.Tokyo carried out a controversial review of the apology last year. Following the review, Tokyo suggested the apology was the product of a political compromise between Seoul and Tokyo, challenging its credibility. Amid criticism from South Korea and China, Tokyo said it would keep the apology.The content of Park’s message to Abe was not immediately known. But the message was expected to carry Park’s wish for the two sides to work together to forge a future-oriented partnership, particularly as this year marks the 50th anniversary of the normalization of their diplomatic relations.Attention is focused on whether Suh, dubbed the “leader of the Pro-Park faction” in the ruling party, could forge a reconciliatory mood between the two countries to resolve a series of pending issues including the issue of a one-on-one summit between Park and Abe. The two sides have not held any summit so far, although the leaders met in a three-way meeting last year that was brokered by U.S. President Barack Obama.During her New Year’s address to the nation on Monday, Park called for a “shift in Japan’s stance” toward history. She reiterated that as the victims of sexual slavery were old, the comfort women issue should be addressed as soon as possible, or else would remain unresolved for good.

The professor of general education at Sungshin Women’s University led a variety of publicity campaigns abroad to refute their claims on history and territory. At home, he has focused on education for Korean youths who appear increasingly indifferent to the painful history. The former battle earned him the reputation as Korea’s foremost civilian public diplomacy practitioner. On the second, however, he says his endeavor still has miles to go. “In dealing with the issues of the Dokdo Islets and comfort women, the biggest enemy is not the Japanese government. It is our own indifference,” the professor said in an interview with The Korea Herald. Last week, the Japanese government permitted a publisher to omit references to Japan’s wartime sexual enslavement of Asian women in its school textbook. “Japan is clearly aware of the importance of education. The only way we can fight back is to learn the correct version of history,” said Seo,Koreans often resort to venting fury at Japan’s blatant attempts to distort history. But the important thing is not to get emotional but to acquire facts and establish logic, he said. “The comfort women issue, in particular, extends beyond Korea and Japan. It is a human rights issue,” he said.Seo gained his reputation as a Dokdo campaigner in 2005, when he placed a full-page advertisement in the New York Times in protest against the Japanese prefecture of Sinema’s designation of Feb. 22 as “Takeshima Day.” Takeshima is the Japanese name for Dokdo.“That’s when I realized that staying still will solve nothing. But at the same time, making a ruckus would not solve a thing either. We need to approach the issue by providing cultural content,” Seo said. Since then, he has been trying to raise awareness on the issue through ads in other big media outlets, creating a Dokdo song and producing a documentary film called “Sorry, Dokdo.”He said that history educators needed to take a similar approach via different mediums. In 2013, he co-authored a book named “Ten Moments in Korean History You Should Know” which he said is part of an effort to make history more approachable.“As of now, I’m working on a webtoon (Internet-based cartoon) on historical issues. We need to work on adding education content like webtoons and videos that students can easily access,” he said.  Seo Kyoung-duk (Park Hyun-koo/The Korea Herald)Seo was shocked recently to find out how little students knew about Korean history. During his lectures, he realized that some students were misinformed about Ahn Jung-geun, one of best-known independence fighters during Japan’s colonialization of Korea from 1910-1945. A recent survey by a local daily showed about 36 percent of middle and high school students said the comfort women system was created to provide “job opportunities for Korean women,” while 12.4 percent could not spell out the term, even confusing it with prostitute.Over 60 percent of students were unaware of the 1993 Kono Statement, in which then-Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono acknowledged that women from Korea and other Asian nations had been forced into sexual slavery during World War II.“Some people say kids nowadays are selfish, because they don’t care about social issues. I don’t think so. We (adults) made them that way,” said Seo. “We can’t get mad at them for not knowing about the March 1 Independence Movement when we didn’t even provide the historical content to them.”While he emphasized the importance of cultural content in teaching history, he added that it has to begin in the classroom. In 2005, Korean history became an optional subject for the college entrance exam, resulting in students placing less importance on the subject.“If we don’t even teach it in the classroom, students cannot learn anything (about our history). What do we have? A history camp? Videos about comfort women? Nothing. Take textbooks out of the equation, and it just doesn’t make sense,” he said. Starting in 2016, all Korean students taking the state-commissioned college entrance exam will have to study Korean history. The measure, implemented by the Education Ministry in 2013, is a culmination of efforts by local experts and activists like Seo who campaigned for the often-disregarded subject.Seo plans to take more direct actions, particularly when it comes to educating students about comfort women issues.“At this stage, nothing’s been decided yet, but I want to establish an educational institute on the human rights issue of comfort women,” he said. The facility will be modeled after his “Dokdo School,” which operates educational programs on Dokdo for teenagers.In addition to raising historical awareness in Korea, Seo plans to expand his activities in Japan. Last year, Seo visited Tokyo to hold a lecture about comfort women. This year, he plans visit 10 cities for a survey on Japanese teens’ opinions on Korea, comfort women and Dokdo. The survey will be conducted together with another survey in Korea to study how Korean teens view Japan. The data will be used for his projects to mark the 70th anniversary of Korea’s independence.Recently hate protests by Japanese far-right groups has shaken the media and the animosity between two countries has deepened. Seo said that through the survey, he hoped to show it was not all like that, and to help the two peoples understand each other.“I received a lot of hate mails from far-right groups. They even target my family and my school, urging it to fire me. But the fact that they resort to blackmail shows that they are not proud of what they’re doing,” Seo said.However, there was progress as well. “Some students at the lecture were genuinely surprised. They told me ‘If you’re telling the truth, then Japan committed a serious crime. I’ll have to do some research.’”“If my lecture can move even one out of 50 people, I consider it a success. It can motivate them to partake in activities. This is the power of education,” he said. It has been 10 years since the professor began the herculean task of promoting Korea. For Seo, however, it is merely the start and a long uphill battle still awaits.“(Japanese Premier) Shinzo Abe won’t apologize for the comfort women. Why would he? Even Rep. Mike Honda (of the U.S.) said pressuring Abe over comfort women was a waste of energy and time,” he said. “But I believe the power of truth will prevail. If we succeed in persuading those around the world, Japan will have to give in.”If Korea successfully persuades Japan to acknowledge its past wrongdoings, Seo says it can create a path for a joint historical textbook between Korea, Japan and China, proposed in 2013 by President Park Geun-hye. Seo added that this was still premature, especially with China laying claim on Korea’s ancient Goguryeo Kingdom. This process would have to start with education, he said. He also said focusing on education for the young generation is very effective as they are less prone to prejudice.“If we attempt to make (a joint textbook) with the two countries, we need to make sure we have a solid footing on our own history,” he said.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","korea independence recently hate protests ,korean history during his lectures ,of korea independence recently hate ,recently hate protests by japanese ,korea independence recently hate","['Seo Kyoung - duk', 'Japan', 'Sungshin Women ’s University', 'korean', 'Korea', 'japanese', 'the Korea Herald', 'japanese', 'Japan', 'asian', 'Japan', 'seo', 'Koreans', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'the New York Times', 'japanese', 'Sinema ’s', 'japanese', 'seo', 'korean', 'Seo Kyoung - duk', 'Park Hyun - koo', 'the Korea Herald)Seo', 'korean', 'Ahn Jung - geun', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Yohei Kono', 'Korea', 'asian', 'seo', '1 Independence Movement', 'korean', 'video', 'korean', 'korean', 'the Education Ministry', 'Seo', 'seo', 'Korea', 'seo', 'Japan', 'Seo', 'Tokyo', 'japanese', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'japanese', 'Seo', 'seo', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Seo', '“(Japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Mike Honda', 'U.S.', 'Abe', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Seo', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'China', 'Park Geun', 'seo', 'China', 'Korea', 'Goguryeo Kingdom', 'Yoon Min - sik']",17,"[ 0.         12.          8.         ... -0.25161579  0.58064032

The survey was conducted on 990 middle and high school students.In addition, the report suggested a mismatch between what students thought was important and what was being taught primarily at schools. Some 61.4 percent said speaking was the most crucial skill in English, but 58.4 percent of the students thought their classes focused mostly on grammar. Such a trend appears to have evolved from the test-based culture in Korean classrooms, as 64 percent of students said the teachers’ extensive focus on grammar was because it was the main focus of exams.”Local experts have pointed out the ineffectiveness of Korea’s English education system as it is mostly based on test scores. A recent report by the Educational Testing Service showed that Korea’s IBT TOEFL were among the lowest among members of the Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation, especially in the speaking section, on which only Japan and Turkey performed worse.The percentage of students who thought English classes in school were not sufficient increased as students got older ― from 60.6 percent among first year middle school students to 74.7 percent among high school seniors.On the contrary, 84.4 percent of students thought private education helped them study English, and 73.2 percent said they would get private education if they can.Naturally, the biggest reason for getting private education was “because I can’t speak English well by just taking school classes,” 40.7 percent of the students said. The report showed that students are turning to private education due to their lack of trust in the public education system. Koreans are estimated to spend about 6.3 trillion won ($5.8 billion) annually on English private education, which is the highest of all subjects.“The government needs to provide accurate information about policies regarding English education to parents, who play a pivotal role in deciding whether or not students will get private education,” said Jeong Yu-gyeong, lead author of the survey, who teaches at Dongduk Girls’ Middle School.“It must also expand training programs for English teachers, so they can offer well-balanced classes.”In a bid to tackle the high cost of English education, the Education Ministry last year said it would implement an absolute grading system for the English section of the annual college exam in place of the existing curved grading system. But some experts raised questions about whether the measure would be effective, as it may simply intensify the competition in other subjects like math or Korean language.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","taking school classes 40 percent ,high cost of english education ,students said the teachers extensive ,korean classrooms as 64 percent ,ineffectiveness of korea english education","['Seoul', 'korean', 'Korea', 'the Educational Testing Service', 'Korea', 'the Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation', 'Japan', 'Turkey', 'Koreans', 'Jeong Yu - gyeong', 'english', 'the Education Ministry', 'Yoon Min - sik']",1,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -0.38443768  0.31113538

His four-year term was confirmed at the top court in February 2014.The SK chief’s brother Chey Jae-won, who also completed one-third of his term, was given three years and six months for similar charges.LIG Nex1’s Koo has been in prison for more than 800 days after he was indicted for issuing fraudulent commercial paper. His jail term is four years.President Park Geun-hye on Monday reiterated the fairness in the coming selection of the Justice Ministry. “It is not appropriate for business leaders to be granted any favors. (On the contrary), it is also not appropriate to inflict reverse discrimination on them,” she said in her New Year’s press conference.When the ministry finally excluded the three business tycoons from the roll, they are to pin hopes on the next conditional release, which will be on the March 1 Independence Movement Memorial Day.Over the past few decades, many imprisoned conglomerate CEOs and senior executives enjoyed special pardons by previous presidents as well as the justice minister-led parole.The 2009 pardon for Samsung Group chief Lee Kun-hee is believed to have resulted in Korea’s winning bid to host the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, Gangwon Province, while Hyundai Motor chief Chung Mong-koo, pardoned in 2008, served as the honorary chairman of the 2012 Yeosu Expo organizing committee.Meanwhile, the civic group People’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy recently said in a statement that “forgiving someone because he is expected to make money will damage social justice.”By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","decades many imprisoned conglomerate ceos ,screening process for parole ,next week other major tycoons ,include imprisoned business leaders ,many imprisoned conglomerate ceos","['the Ministry of Justice', 'Saenuri Party', 'Justice Ministry', 'SK Group', 'Chey Tae - won', 'SK Group', 'Chey Jae - won', 'Koo Bon - sang', 'Chey Tae - won', 'Chey Jae - won', 'Nex1', 'Koo', 'Park Geun - hye', 'the Justice Ministry', 'Samsung Group', 'Lee Kun - hee', 'Korea', 'PyeongChang', 'Gangwon Province', 'Hyundai Motor', 'Chung Mong - koo', 'People ’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy', 'Kim Yon - se']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.8880859   0.20053579

In a nationally televised news conference on Monday, South Korean President Park Geun-hye expressed her hope for the two Koreas to hold a new round of reunions of families separated by the1950-53 Korean War, around Lunar New Year’s Day, which falls on Feb. 19.Seoul’s Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok, however, denied the report, saying that the exercise schedule was fixed a long time ago. “It has nothing to do with possible family reunions, though the exact date of when to begin the drill is subject to change.”In a brief email statement, U.S. Forces Korea said South Korea and the U.S. “are preparing for exercise Key Resolve ... Key Resolve focuses on crisis management and command and control of alliance forces. More information on the exercise will be available at a later date.” The North has called on the U.S. and South Korea to stop joint military drills, claiming that they are a rehearsal for a northward invasion. But the allies have vowed to continue the exercises, as they are defensive in nature.The drill usually involves tens of thousands of troops from both sides. About 28,500 U.S. soldiers are stationed in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War.

Of the injured, 11 are in critical condition, officials said.The fire broke out from a motorcycle spark at a parking lot on the first floor of the apartment, the Uijeongbu Police said after analyzing the building’s surveillance cameras. Having started from the spark, the blaze soon spread through the apartment complex and to two other adjacent residential buildings, resulting in property losses of at least 9 billion won ($8.2 million), they added. A fire broke out at an apartment in Uijeongbu, Gyeonggi Province, early Saturday, leaving four people dead and over 100 residents injured. (Yonhap)The investigators conducted a first round of inquiry with the owner of the motorcycle to gather further details. The possibility of an arson attack is low, the police said.The police also said no measures were taken in the first 17 minutes, allowing the fire to further spread. Some victims claimed that the flame spread to other buildings due to the wind from firefighting helicopters. “The fire was almost put out in 30 minutes in the first apartment but the helicopter propellers led the flame to spread to other buildings,” a group of the concerned residents was quoted as saying by Yonhap. Two helicopters were at the scene to help evacuate a dozen residents waiting on the rooftop. Of these, only four were rescued by the helicopter while others escaped using emergency stairs. The fire was brought under control in about two hours.Fire officials, however, refuted such claim, saying that evacuating people with a helicopter at a fire scene is a basic rule. They also stressed that the blaze quickly spread because the apartment walls were made of highly combustible materials. Uijoengbu police authorities vowed to look into any illegalities concerning the affected buildings, including violation of construction law and fire safety law. Meanwhile, Uijoengbu city government said that it would seek for a “special disaster region” declaration as part of its efforts to better support the accident victims. More than 220 apartment residents have become refugees and are staying at a temporary shelter set up at a local elementary school. Once the city is declared a special disaster region by the government, the city is allowed to receive special assistances ranging from finance to medical treatments. The city also vowed to provide the refugees with an urgent subsidy of about 600,000 won per person. For the medical expenses, the municipality will pay the full cost first and seek reimbursement later from the building owners or insurance companies, it added.

She said she hopes to be able to return to both Koreas.The Korean Peninsula remains technically in a state of war, split along the world’s most heavily fortified border, because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. In South Korea, praising North Korea can be punished by up to seven years in prison under the National Security Law. Shin Eun-miIn Washington, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Shin had been barred from exiting South Korea for three weeks, and the U.S. has seen reports indicating the prosecution has asked for her to be deported and banned from the country for five years.In a rare note of criticism of a key ally, Psaki said that despite South Korea’s generally strong record on human rights, the security law limits freedom of expression and restricts access to the Internet.Supporters argue that the law is needed because of continuing threats from North Korea. But critics want it scrapped. Past authoritarian leaders in South Korea frequently used the law to suppress political rivals.Shin posted stories about her trips to North Korea on OhmyNews, a popular South Korean online news site. Her book on her trips was included in a government-designated reading list in 2013, but the Culture Ministry removed it this week. Ministry officials said they will seek to retrieve 1,200 copies that were distributed to libraries across South Korea. During a November lecture in Seoul, Shin said many North Korean defectors living in South Korea had told her they want to go back home and that North Koreans hope new leader Kim Jong Un will bring change. She also praised the taste of North Korean beer and the cleanliness of North Korea’s rivers. Shin has said she had no intention of praising the country and was only expressing what she felt during her travels there.Conservatives have sided with government moves to expel Shin, accusing her of ignoring North Korea’s abysmal human rights conditions. But her impending deportation drew sharp criticism from liberals who say the conservative government of President Park Geun-hye is clamping down on freedom of speech.“The decision to deport her is a clear violation of human rights,” the Hankyoreh newspaper said in an editorial Friday. “The government is taking the lead in trampling on human rights.”At the United Nations, the deputy spokesman for Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Farhan Haq, told reporters: “The secretary-general’s position on freedom of expression and freedom of opinion is well-known. ... That would apply here as well.” Ban is South Korean.In October, prosecutors indicted a Japanese journalist on charges he defamed Park by reporting rumors that she was absent for seven hours on the day of a ferry disaster last April because she was with a man. Last month, the Constitutional Court ordered the dissolution of a small leftist party that officials say advocated a North Korean-style socialist system.In December, a high school student threw a homemade explosive device toward a podium where Shin was speaking, injuring two people. Shin was not injured. The student was sent to a juvenile detention center and is awaiting trial.

A fourth suspect – the common law wife of the market attacker – was still at large and believed to be armed.Medical teams evacuate a person on a stretcher as members of the BRI police elite unit launch an assault on the HyperCasher supermarket at Porte de Vincennes in Eastern Paris on Friday. YonhapAl-Qaida's branch in Yemen said it directed the attack against the publication Charlie Hebdo to avenge the honor of the Prophet Muhammad, a frequent target of the weekly's satire.The brothers were not unknown to authorities: One had a terrorism-related conviction for ties to a network sending fighters to battle American forces in Iraq, and both were on the U.S. no-fly list, according to a U.S. official.President Francois Hollande urged his nation to remain united and vigilant, and the city shut down a famed Jewish neighborhood amid fears of more violence.``The threats facing France are not finished,'' Hollande said. ``We are a free people who cave to no pressure.''The drama, which played out on live TV and social media, began with the brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi methodically massacring 12 people Wednesday at the Charlie Hebdo offices, stopping to shoot a wounded police officer in the head before escaping by car.On Thursday, a gunman police identified as Amedy Coulibaly shot a policewoman to death south of Paris, although authorities were not sure at first if it was related to the Charlie Hebdo shootings.It all ended at dusk Friday with near-simultaneous raids in two locations: a printing plant in the town of Dammartin-en-Goele, northeast of Paris, where the Kouachis were holed up, and the Paris supermarket where Coulibaly killed four hostages and threatened more violence unless the police let the Kouachis go.As scores of black-clad security forces surrounded both sites, booming explosions, heavy gunfire and dense smoke heralded the news that the twin sieges finally had ended.The three gunmen were dead – but the authorities also discovered four dead hostages at the market. Sixteen hostages were freed, one from the printing plant and 15 others from the store.The attackers had ties both to each other and to terrorist activities that reached back years and extended from Paris to al-Qaida in Yemen. They epitomized Western authorities' greatest fear: Islamic radicals who trained abroad and came home to stage attacks.After the killings at the Charlie Hebdo offices, Cherif Kouachi, 32, and his 34-year-old brother Said led police on a chase around northeastern France, robbing a gas station and stealing a car before ending up at the printing plant in Dammartin-en-Goele, near Charles de Gaulle airport. One of the brothers was wounded in the neck at one point during a shootout with police after he commandeered a car, Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said.Authorities said the brothers temporarily took a man hostage at the plant but let him go, and a second man was later discovered to have been hiding inside the building.A member of the al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula gave a statement in English to The Associated Press saying the group's leadership ``directed the operations and they have chosen their target carefully.''The attack was in line with warnings from the late al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden to the West about ``the consequences of the persistence in the blasphemy against Muslim sanctities,'' the member said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the group's regulations do not permit him to give his name.He said the group has delayed its declaration of responsibility for ``security reasons.''The brothers were cornered there for much of the day before the explosions and gunfire rang out in the twilight and a police SWAT team clambered onto the roof. ``They said they want to die as martyrs,'' Yves Albarello, a local lawmaker inside the command post, told French television station i-Tele. At the kosher grocery near the Porte de Vincennes neighborhood of the capital, the gunman burst in shooting just a few hours before the Jewish Sabbath began, declaring ``You know who I am,'' the official recounted. The attack came before sundown when the store would have been crowded with shoppers, and Hollande called it ``a terrifying anti-Semitic act.''Coulibaly killed the four people in the market shortly after entering, Molins said.Several people wounded in the grocery store were able to flee and get medical care, the official said. About 100 students were locked down in nearby schools and the highway ringing Paris was closed.The mayor's office also shut down all shops along Rosiers Street in the city's famed Marais neighborhood in the heart of the tourist district. Hours before the Jewish Sabbath, the street is usually crowded with shoppers. The street is also only a kilometer from Charlie Hebdo's offices.Charles de Gaulle airport, not far from the standoff in Dammartin-en-Goele,  briefly closed two runways to arrivals, and Hollande held a series of crisis meetings with his security team throughout the day.Police released a photo of Coulibaly and his wife, Hayat Boumeddiene, described as an accomplice.Authorities increasingly grew to see links between the attackers after they discovered that Boumeddiene and the companion of one of the Kouachi brothers had exchanged about 500 phone calls, Molins said.He added that several people have been given preliminary charges in the investigation. They include relatives of the three gunmen. Several people who were wounded when the gunman opened fire in the grocery store fled and got medical care, the official said. Minutes before police stormed both sites, Coulibaly had threatened more violence if authorities launched an assault on the two brothers, a police official said. A group of people holed up in the supermarket's freezer _ apparently unbeknownst to the gunman.BFM also said it spoke with Coulibaly, who said he and the Kouachis were coordinating their actions, and that he was with the militant Islamic State group. The organizations are normally rivals. The TV station said Coulibaly didn't hang up properly after the phone call and that this allowed police to hear him saying a final prayer before his death, perhaps suggesting that this prompted the police raid.In the final assault, phalanxes of security forces converged on the store entrance behind a flash from a stun grenade _ and fired inside. Frenzied civilians _ one of them carrying a toddler _ scurried out under escort by helmeted police in body armor. Police said Coulibaly had been a co-suspect with Cherif Kouachi in a court case involving terrorism that never made it to trial.Cherif Kouachi was convicted of terrorism charges in 2008 for ties to a network sending jihadis to fight U.S. forces in Iraq. According to a Yemeni security official, Said Kouachi is suspected of having fought for al-Qaida in Yemen. Another senior security official added that Said was in Yemen until 2012. Both officials spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because of an ongoing investigation into Kouachi's stay in Yemen. Both brothers were also on the U.S. no-fly list, a senior U.S. counterterrorism official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss foreign intelligence publicly.The attacks in France as well as a hostage siege last month in Sydney and the October killing of a solder near Canada's parliament prompted the U.S. State Department to issue a global travel warning for Americans. It also cites an increased risk of reprisals against U.S. and Western targets for the U.S.-led intervention against Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq.Authorities around Europe have warned of the threat posed by the return of Western jihadis trained in warfare. France counts at least 1,200 citizens in the war zone in Syria _ headed there, returned or dead. Both the Islamic State group and al-Qaida have threatened France, home to Western Europe's largest Muslim population.The publication Charlie Hebdo had long drawn threats for its depictions of Islam, although it also lampooned other religions and political figures. It had caricatured the Prophet Muhammad, and a sketch of Islamic State's leader was the last tweet sent by the irreverent newspaper minutes before the attack.Eight journalists, two police officers, a maintenance worker and a visitor were killed in the newspaper attack, including the paper's editor. Charlie Hebdo plans a special edition next week, produced in the offices of another paper.

However, illegal immigrants who reside in Seoul are not eligible for any allowance for raising or educating their children.Among the 12 citizen representatives selected by the SMG to make their decision on the matter, eight voted in favor of the rights of undocumented children during their hearing last month. “The citizen representatives concluded that excluding illegal immigrants from the childcare benefits is an act of discrimination on the basis of their nationality, and we have put this into our decision to advise the SMG,” the human rights experts said in a statement. Article 2 of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child states that every child’s rights to education and protection must be ensured regardless of the parent’s or legal guardian’s race; color; sex; religion; or national, ethnic or social origin; among others. Article 8 of the convention also states that if a child is illegally deprived of some or all of the elements of his or her identity, “States Parties shall provide appropriate assistance and protection, with a view to reestablishing speedily his or her identity.”Park Sook-mi from the SMG also said article 2 of the Human Rights Ordinance of SMG applies to those who stay in Seoul temporarily as Seoul citizens. “There are about 400,000 foreigners who live in Seoul and we strive to be a global city that values and promotes human rights,” said Yeom. “The SMG should pay more attention to this matter and come up with a proactive plan to protect them.”In response to the experts’ advice, the SMG said it would launch a study to find out exactly how many illegal immigrants with children reside in Seoul. “After that has been done, we can talk about the needed budget and other things to bring (about) this change,” said Park.

""They should make clear on their stand on the problems.""  The leaflet campaign, often led by North Koreans who fled their home country to settle in the South, has long been a major source of tension between the two Koreas, as it aims to stir up dissent against the regime. Seoul has dismissed Pyongyang's demands to ban the campaign, citing freedom of speech. The North Korean spokesman also raised suspicions over Seoul's intentions to seek peace, denouncing the South Korean military for its pledge to ""continue nuclear war exercise against North Korea.""South Korea and the U.S. have conducted joint military drills which are ""defensive in nature"" on a regular basis, while Pyongyang calls it a rehearsal for the invasion of the communist country.""The DPRK will watch the future movement of the South Korean authorities with vigilance,"" the statement said.

The largest number of violations ― 65.9 percent ― occurred in small restaurants and cafes nationwide. Other employers that broke the rules included hair salons, bakeries, convenience stores and movie theaters. Almost 40 percent of the reported cases had to do with not informing employees about working conditions, including wages, working hours and holidays. Some employers purposely did not include all the required information in their written contracts, said Koh Young-sook from the Gender Equality Ministry.While 16.6 percent of the cases involved not offering any written contracts, 12.2 percent of the violations had to do with not informing the workers about the minimum wage. More than 25 percent of the reported employers did not undergo the required education on sexual harassment at the workplace.Under the current law, an employer can be fined up to 5 million won ($4,500) for not informing employees about working conditions, and up to 20 million won for paying workers below the minimum wage rate. Currently, the minimum wage in Korea is 5,580 won an hour. Jeong Eun-hye from the ministry said the government is planning to launch a service whereby legal or labor experts would visit teens in need at their workplaces, should they face problems with wages or experience any form of harassment.

The man, identified by his surname Kim, was convicted of smuggling 5 kilograms of methamphetamine into China in April 2012, a senior ministry official told reporters on customary condition of anonymity. A higher court upheld the ruling six months later. He was arrested in May 2010. Under Chinese law, producing, carrying or selling 50 grams or more of heroin or methamphetamine is punishable by death. Kim was also believed to have previously been found guilty for smuggling narcotics three times and carrying them one time. The execution took place on Dec. 30 in Beijing. Seoul lodged a protest for the six-day delay in delivering the information. “The government regrets that the execution was carried out despite our repeated requests not to do so from the humanitarian and reciprocal points of view,” the ministry said in a statement, referring to growing international calls against capital punishment and a virtual moratorium on executions at home. “We will continue to strengthen cooperation not only between related authorities here but also with relevant countries to prevent our citizens from being implicated in drug crimes.” Kim is the fourth South Korean drug smuggler to be executed since August and the fifth since 2001. Some 20 South Korean citizens are currently on death row in China, mainly convicted of drug trafficking or murder. Many of them have been granted a reprieve, officials said.China has executed several other foreigners over drug-related crimes in recent years. They include a Japanese and a Pakistani in 2014, a Filipino in 2013, four Filipinos in 2011, four Japanese in 2010 and a Briton in 2009, according to ministry officials.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","fourth south korean drug smuggler ,guilty for smuggling narcotics three ,china mainly convicted of drug ,found guilty for smuggling narcotics ,methamphetamine into china in april","['south korean', 'China', 'Foreign Ministry', 'Kim', 'China', 'chinese', 'Kim', 'Beijing', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'south korean', 'south korean', 'China', 'China', 'japanese', 'pakistani', 'Filipinos', 'Japanese', 'Briton', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.20312133  0.70134097

The move effectively blocks students from retaining their status as an incumbent student without registering for a new semester while seeking a job.Due to the prolonged economic slump that froze the job market, it has become common for university students to delay their graduation until they land a job. Several companies are known to discriminate against graduates when recruiting new workers, and it is common for internship opportunities to be offered exclusively to current students.“Over the past few years, it has become harder to find a job. Students are postponing graduation in a bid to buy time to become more qualified (for jobs),” said a 28-year-old graduate student at a Seoul-based university. To delay their graduation, students usually register for extra semesters or deliberately refuse to hand-in the assignments required to graduate. The latter is usually preferred as the former requires considerable amount of tuition fees that virtually serves no purpose academically.Ewha’s new policy, however, made it impossible for its students to use the second option. A student of the university said although students who “completed” the course are technically not graduates, it is still likely to hurt their chances since they are no longer considered an incumbent university member. “On top of that, they told us this important decision right before the semester, which was inconsiderate,” she said.Other universities like Konkuk University are also making it mandatary for students to register in order to be considered an active member of the university. Observers said the universities’ measure is likely to drive students to register for extra semesters rather than to risk entering the job market early.Prolonging the school years for graduation has already become a dominant trend in Korea. Data revealed by Rep. Park Chang-sik of Saenuri Party showed 2,276 students in 2013 registered themselves for nine or more semesters in a bid to put off graduation.As a result, it is taking more time than before for young people to find work. According to Korea Employment Information Service, the average age of new employees at companies with 100 or more workers was 33.2 for men and 28.6 for women. Another survey by Saramin showed 76.2 percent of the companies thought the average age for job applicants was rising.The trend of older job applicants appears to have changed the definition of “youth” in the job market. State-run institutes are mandated to allocate 3 percent of their jobs to youngsters. Last year, the definition of “youth” in the cited regulation was changed from 29 or younger to 34 or younger.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","for new semesters sparking complaints ,job students are postponing graduation ,delay their graduation students usually ,university to delay their graduation ,postpone graduation without signing up","['Ewha Womans University', 'Seoul', 'Konkuk University', 'Korea', 'Park Chang - sik', 'Saenuri Party', 'Korea Employment Information Service', 'Saramin', 'Yoon Min - sik']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48014373  0.06329957

The South Korean may have contracted the virus last Monday while treating a patient.Berlin city officials and doctors announce Saturday at the city’s Charite hospital that a South Korean health worker who was taken to Germany with a suspected Ebola infection after volunteering in the Republic of Sierra Leone has tested negative for the virus. (Yonhap)The health worker was flown to Berlin, Germany on Saturday for possible treatment and monitoring and not to Seoul, in order to protect the patient’s anonymity. Officials have not disclosed the medic’s gender, age or profession.“First of all it’s good from a transportation point of view to come here and secondly it’s better for the person’s anonymity to be treated here in Europe,” Dr. Frank Bergmann, the official overseeing infectious patients said at the Charite hospital in Berlin on Saturday.The South Korean health worker was using a hypodermic needle to draw blood from a patient when the patient reportedly jolted, causing the needle to penetrate the South Korean medic’s protective gloves. The syringe apparently contained the local patient’s blood.“The patient had a very high viral load and died the next day, which means that there was a very high risk of infection,” Bergmann said.The South Korean is under quarantine at the Berlin hospital.Medical officials appear optimistic though. The South Korean is taking the situation well in a professional way, Bergmann said. The doctor added that there have been multiple cases of high-risk exposure health workers turning out not to have been infected.A U.S. doctor exposed to Ebola through a needlestick injury was released in October last year after a medical team at the U.S.-based National Institutes of Health monitored him for a few weeks.Close to 8,000 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of death due to the latest Ebola virus outbreak have been reported, according to the World Health Organization.

Half-blind and in rags, Kim grabbed another slave, and the two disabled men headed for the coast. Far from the glittering steel-and-glass capital of Seoul, they were now hunted men on this remote island where the enslavement of disabled salt farm workers is an open secret. “It was a living hell,” Kim said in a recent series of interviews with The Associated Press whose details are corroborated by court records and by lawyers, police and government officials. Lost, they wandered past asphalt-black salt fields sparkling with a patina of thin white crust. They could feel the islanders inspecting them. Everyone knew who belonged and who didn't. Near a grocery, the store owner's son rounded them up and called their boss, who beat Kim with a rake and sent him back to the salt fields. Slavery thrives on rural islands off South Korea's rugged southwest coast, nurtured by a long history of exploitation and the demands of trying to squeeze a living from the sea. Two-thirds of South Korea's sea salt is produced at more than 850 salt farms on dozens of islands in Sinan County, including Sinui island, where half the 2,200 residents work in the industry. Workers spend grueling days managing a complex network of waterways, hoses and storage areas. Five times during the last decade, revelations of slavery involving the disabled have emerged. Kim's case prompted a nationwide government probe of thousands of farms and disabled facilities that found more than 100 workers who'd received no, or scant, pay. Yet little has changed on the islands, according to a months-long investigation by the AP based on court and police documents and dozens of interviews with freed slaves, salt farmers, villagers and officials. In this Feb. 19, 2014, lawmakers and human right activists look at salt farms as a part of human rights inspection on Sinui Island, South Korea. Slavery thrives on this chain of rural islands off South Korea’s rugged southwest coast, nurtured by a long history of exploitation and the demands of trying to squeeze a living from the sea. Five times during the last decade, revelations of slavery involving the disabled have emerged, each time generating national shame and outrage. (Yonhap-AP)Although 50 island farm owners and regional job brokers were indicted, national police say no local police or officials will face punishment, despite multiple interviews showing some knew about the slaves and even stopped escape attempts. Soon after the national investigation, activists and police found another 63 unpaid or underpaid workers on the islands, three-quarters of whom were mentally disabled. Kim's former boss, Hong Jeong-gi, didn't respond to multiple requests for comment through his lawyer. He's set to appeal a 3 year prison sentence next week. Other farmers often describe themselves as providing oases for the disabled and homeless. “These are people who are neglected and mistreated,” Hong Chi-guk, a 64-year-old salt farmer in Sinui, told the AP. “What alternative does our society have for them?” The night of July 4, 2012, Kim, who'd been homeless for a decade, was sleeping in a Seoul train station when a stranger offered him a place to stay and a job in the morning. Hours later, he stood on a Sinui island salt farm. Hong had paid an illegal job agent the equivalent of about $700 for his new worker, according to court records. The beatings began the first day on the farm for Kim, who's visually disabled and described in court documents as having the social awareness of a 12-year-old. “Each time I tried to ask him something, his punch came first,” Kim told the AP. Only a week after his first escape was thwarted, Kim began to plan another. He and the other slave, Chae Min-sik, again tried to find their way to a port. But the grocery owner's son, identified by officials only as Yoon, rounded them up again and called Hong. After another beating, it was back to work. Hong, Kim discovered, was an influential man, a former village head. Despite his fear, Kim ran again at the end of the month. Again, Yoon captured them. Furious, the owner said that if Kim ran again, he'd get a knife in the stomach. Hong beat Kim so badly he broke Kim's glasses. He worked Kim so hard the slave was too tired to think about escape. The number of people enslaved is difficult to determine because of the transient work, the remoteness of the farms and the closeness _ and often hostility _ of the island communities. Social workers believe many slaves have yet to be found, and that investigations have so far been inadequate. “If the recent investigation was done properly, then pretty much everyone on the island should've been taken to the police station and charged,” said Kim Kang-won, an activist who participated in the recent investigation on Sinui. “The whole village knew about it.” Provincial police have vowed to inspect farms and interview workers regularly, but people familiar with the island confirm that slavery is rampant. “The police chief would tell me that I'd eventually come to understand that this was how things on the island worked,” said Cho Yong-su, a doctor who worked at the Sinui Island public health center from 2006 to 2007. Han Bong-cheol, a pastor in Mokpo who lived on Sinui Island for 19 years until June, sympathized with farmers forced to deal with disabled, incompetent workers. “They spend their leisure time eating snacks, drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes. They are taken once or twice a year to Mokpo so they can buy sex. It's a painful reality, but it's a pain the island has long shared as a community.”After a year and a half as a slave, Kim made one last bid for freedom. He managed to mail a letter to his mother in Seoul. Kim's mother brought the letter, which gave directions to the farm, to Seo Je-gong, then a police captain. Because Kim's letter noted collaboration between local police and salt farm owners, Seo and another Seoul officer went to the island posing as tourists who'd come to fish and buy salt. They visited Hong's home while he was away and found the slaves sitting on a mattress in a room without heat or hot water. Kim, Seo said, looked like a homeless person. Kim was frightened and baffled, then relieved. “I am going to live,” he said. Chae initially refused to leave Sinui but was freed later after Seo found a 2008 missing person's report for Chae. He now lives in a Seoul shelter. Yoon, who repeatedly captured Kim and Chae, was fined $7,500. Kim, who lives in Seoul and occasionally works construction jobs, settled with Hong for about $35,000 in unpaid wages. He has nightmares and receives treatment for his injuries. He also gets flustered when he talks about salt, disgusted when he sees it. “Just thinking about it makes me grind my teeth.” (AP)","disabled salt farm workers ,day mining the big salt ,enslavement of disabled salt farm ,of disabled salt farm workers ,freed slaves salt farmers villagers","['Kim Seong - baek', 'Kim', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'the Associated Press', 'Kim', ""South Korea 's"", ""South Korea 's"", 'Sinan County', 'Kim', 'AP', 'Sinui Island', 'South Korea', 'South Korea ’s', 'Yonhap - AP)Although', 'Kim', 'Hong Jeong - gi', 'Hong Chi - guk', 'Sinui', 'AP', 'Kim', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'AP', 'Kim', 'Hong', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Yoon', 'Kim', 'Hong beat Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim Kang - won', 'Sinui', 'Cho Yong - su', 'Han', 'Mokpo', 'Sinui Island', 'Mokpo', 'Kim', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'Seo Je - gong', 'Kim', 'Seo', 'Seoul', 'Hong', 'Kim', 'Seo', 'Kim', 'Sinui', 'Seo', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Seoul', 'Hong', 'AP']",15,"[ 3.          0.          0.         ... -0.66232723  0.05923499

The ministry claimed that not having native speakers in private institutes ― known here as hagwon ― would considerably reduce the amount parents spend on English private education. “The costs of hagwon hiring foreigners is way too high. Our preliminary research indicates that the cost of hiring a foreigner is about 1.5 times that of hiring Koreans under the exact same working conditions” a ministry official said. He said this could be done by not issuing work visas to foreign nationals entering Korea to work at preschool hagwon.“It is still a work-in-progress. Details include whether or not it will apply to foreigners of Korean descent, whether or not to ban those already in Korea (from working at those hagwon) and whether to grant a grace period or implement it right away,” he said. The official reiterated that the plan was still in an early stage, and there was a possibility that the entire scheme would be scrapped. But it drew a fierce reaction from those in the private education industry.“Banning foreign teachers from being hired (at private institutes) is a plan potentially in violation of people’s constitutional right to receive education. It can also cause diplomatic issues, since it limits foreign nationals’ right to work in Korea,” the Korea Association of Hakwons said in a press conference last week. The association claimed that the increase in the number of native English teachers helped reduce the number of younger students going abroad to study English. The amount of money spent on studying abroad increased from 431.3 billion won ($396 million) in 2007 to 522.7 billion won in 2012, but the figure decreased for elementary school students. The group also quoted a 2011 survey by Korea Institute of Child Care and Education that showed about 60.7 percent of parents wanted English education for their children in the preschool stage. Whether the ministry measure will be effective in driving down the costs of private education remains to be seen. The average monthly cost of employing a native speaker in major private institutes usually hovers a little above 3 million won including housing and other expenses, according to industry sources. They said it generally costs more to hire a native speaker than a Korean to teach English, but claimed the difference is not jaw-dropping.Members of the Korea Association of Hakwons, a group of local private institutes, speak during a press conference on Dec. 23 in Seoul. (Yonhap)“On average, the costs of English private institutes or English kindergartens are not as high as people think,” said Kim Eun-sook, an official at YBM Education, a local private institute. She said the fees for public kindergartens average about 1.34 million won, which is actually higher than English hagwon. “Hagwons are monitored (by the association) based on how much we charge the parents. We have a ceiling on how much we can pay the foreign teachers, so this talk about reducing costs makes little sense,” Kim said.The measure also sparked outrage from foreign workers here, who saw the news as another door being slammed shut in their face. Public schools have seen significant reductions in NET staff in the past three years. According to Rep. Yoon Jae-ok of the ruling Saenuri Party, the percentage of schools with native English-speaking teachers dropped from over 85.7 percent in 2011 to 48.6 percent in 2014.Last year, Incheon’s education office said it had canceled hiring new native English teachers due to budget restraints. The Seoul education office is also planning to cut its budget for native teachers for this year, saying their effectiveness has been “unproven.”“I can understand why the government would try to cut down spending on private education, but this is ridiculous. Why can’t they just put a cap on how much hagwon charge?” said an American who used to teach at a school in Incheon. “How would specifically targeting non-Korean workers help? The only possible thing I can think of is maybe it can help more Koreans get jobs.”Elementary school students attend a class taught by a native English teacher.

She added that foreign teachers were hardly the main problem presented by English hagwon. These institutes often place immense stress on children, forcing them to do six or seven hours of work each day. Lee said the Education Ministry first needs to persuade parents that it was not absolutely critical for children to learn English early on in their lives. Rather than just banning foreign teachers from private institutes, the government needs to conduct research on the effectiveness of early-stage English education, she said.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","education industry banning foreign teachers ,banning foreign teachers from preschool ,budget restraints the seoul education ,private education industry banning foreign ,education said banning foreign teachers","['the Education Ministry', 'Koreans', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'the Korea Association of Hakwons', 'Korea Institute of Child Care and Education', 'Korean', 'the Korea Association of Hakwons', 'Seoul', 'Kim Eun - sook', 'YBM Education', 'Kim', 'NET', 'Yoon Jae - ok', 'Saenuri Party', 'Incheon ’s', 'Seoul', '”“i', 'American', 'Incheon', 'non - korean', 'Koreans', 'Korea Herald', 'Lee Seul - gi', 'world without worry about Private Education', 'Lee', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'the Education Ministry', 'Yoon Min - sik']",1,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.43802392  0.00849049

While 92.8 percent of all colleges have adopted the system, only 2.3 percent of students have used it as of the first semester of 2014 due to several restrictions.For example, many colleges prohibit scholarship recipients from using the system. Students also cannot get student loans in the middle of the semester, so students who fail to make a payment are forced to quit mid-year.  STUDENT PROTEST AT HUFS ― Students at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies on Wednesday protest the university’s decision to apply a curved grading system to all classes at the university campus in Seoul. (Yonhap)The ministry said it would ban the restriction on scholarship winners and allow students to take out loans in the middle of the semester. It will also allow students to make more frequent payments, which is also expected to increase the number of students using the system. According to 2012 data provided by Rep. Min Byung-joo of the Saenuri Party, students are more likely to use the system if they are allowed to make more frequent payments. Freshmen and transfer students, however, will not be able to use the installment payment system.The new measures will be applied to all colleges starting this year, officials said. It is still unclear how many colleges will actually adopt the ministry’s plan since, as of now, it is a merely a guideline.“The ministry does not plan to penalize schools that refuse to comply. But we may provide incentives for schools that adopt the system in the future,” a ministry official said.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","many colleges prohibit scholarship recipients ,wednesday protest the university decision ,college tuition while 92 percent ,example many colleges prohibit scholarship ,many colleges prohibit scholarship","['the Education Ministry', 'Hankuk University of Foreign Studies', 'Seoul', 'Min Byung - joo', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Yoon Min - sik']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.11626482  0.17752957
