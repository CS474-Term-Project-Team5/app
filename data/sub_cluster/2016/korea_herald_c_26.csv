It had a vibrant and festive market atmosphere, and attracted people from adjacent towns. Over 20,000 people from across the nation flocked to the market looking for jobs up to the 1990s.But the advent of shopping malls and the decline of the knitwear industry in the face of cheap Chinese products in the years that followed spelled doom for the old market located in the upper part of Haebangchon, Seoul.  These days, there are just three to four knitwear shops left. The number of residents in the area has also fallen to 12,000 people, with at least 15 percent of them aged over 65. “The number of people wanting to rent a place to open a business  went down as its visitors drastically decreased. So we tried to renovate shops into houses so people could live here at a cheap price,” said 74-year-old Park Il-young, who has headed an association of business owners at Shinheung market for over a decade. The main entrance of the Shinheung market in Haebangchon, Yongsan-gu in central seoul “Businesses here have long been in trouble, I used to hardly believe that the market would be revived,” he said, adding that 43 other members of the association also held the same view until two years ago when the city government came up with the city revitalization project.In 2014, the Seoul Metropolitan Government selected Shinheung market as one of eight urban revitalization projects, including Seongsu-dong in Seongdong-gu and Changshin-dong in Jongno-gu. A project was initiated to transform the market into an art street for textile workers and young business owners.The Seoul Metropolitan Government said that the area is being promoted by art workshops and revitalized by young businesspeople and artists. It said that the main goal of the project is to fully utilize the characteristics of Shinheung market and harmoniously unify residents and visitors.“We will open an art market where residents’ life and art can coexist to improve the general environment and atmosphere of Shinheung market. We are also trying to prevent the gentrification phenomenon here, as gentrification is a growing concern among residents of other parts of Seoul,” said a SMG official. In a bid to deter the displacement of poorer communities, increases in rent and property values, and changes in the district’s character and culture, the SMG earlier this month signed an agreement with 44 business owners at Shinheung market to freeze rental fees there for the next six years. Through this measure, young artists or studio owners would be able to settle in the area with less burden and support revitalization of the town. Cafe Orang Orang, located in the Shinheung market in Haebangchon, shows a minimal exterior, which blends in with the atmosphere of the old traditional market.“I found Shinheung market an attractive place to open a cafe, not only due to the cheap rent, but also the exotic atmosphere that the old traditional market gives. The building was vacant for four years before I moved in, but I tried my best to leave the building as it is, to keep its unique characteristic,” said Ahn Sung-hyun, owner of the coffee shop Orang Orang. Seoul City is pouring 10 billion won  over the next five years to revitalize the town, with the help of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. From refurbishing old slate ceilings to installing more light stands inside the market to brighten up the place, an urban revitalization project task force has been discussing ways to revive the market with residents, following the first meeting that kicked off in March last year. But city officials say that refurbishment is not the main objective of the revitalization.“We can refurbish old buildings for now. But what happens after this project ends in five years? We are helping residents to be able to revive the town with constant talks and cooperation such as through ideas of creating town rules or installing a common lounge for residents. We are trying to lay a foundation for them to coexist from now,” said Kim Dae-woo, an official from Yongsan-gu Office’s city revitalization division.Currently, a total of 583 members, including tenants, foreign residents, students and shop owners are part of a residents association. “I personally believe strong bonding between residents will initiate people to help revive the area, while the young generation can give fresh ideas to promoting Haebangchon’s Shinheung market,” said Park Ki-dong, who runs a leather crafts studio in Haebangchon. “When residents gather ideas to come up with plans to revive the culture and the atmosphere of the town, there will be a fruitful outcome for this urban revitalization project. It is something like the Saemaeul Movement, which is focused on creating a village community,” said another resident Son Haeng-jo.This year, residents and artists who have studios in Haebangchon hosted the 11th Haebangchon Festival. They not only sold their art projects but helped old residents to sell Korean traditional food such as gochujang, or red pepper paste. But opinions are still split among some residents over the city-led urban revitalization project.According to a Yongsan-gu official who declined to be named, struggles remain between residents and tenants over property value. “There is always opposition when discussion unfolds. Some old residents would rather have the city government reconstruct the whole town, instead of revitalization. Some also did not really like the idea of the rent fee freeze, because they wanted to sell property in the area at a high price and leave this old town,” said him.“Haebangchon is a geographically difficult place to go under reconstruction. But many old residents seem to still have a lingering wish to have their old town reconstructed with clean buildings,” he added.

Police predict some 40,000 participants for the second major rally since the Choi Soon-sil scandal surfaced. It is scheduled to begin at 4 p.m. in Gwanghwamun Square in central Seoul. The rally organizers -- an association of labor unions, student groups and civic organizations -- say nearly 100,000 people could turn up, larger than the first one which took place on Oct. 29. South Korean protesters on Friday call for the resignation of President Park Geun-hye over the Choi Soon-sil scandal during an event to commemorate the late Baek Nam-gi, a protester who died late September after being knocked down by a police water cannon during an anti-government rally held in November last year. The anti-Park protest is to coincide with the funeral for an activist farmer who died after being knocked down by a police water cannon during an anti-government rally last year. Baek Nam-gi, 69, died on Sept. 25, but his funeral has been delayed for more than a month amid controversy as to whether an autopsy is necessary to determine his cause of death. The funeral service is scheduled for 8 a.m. at Seoul National University Hospital. Police, while saying they would “flexibly” respond to protesters, decided to disapprove of the organizers’ plan to march across central Seoul after the rally, citing possible traffic disruption.Police are said to be mulling ways to keep the rally under control without using measures such as water cannons, as they are mindful of public sentiment and possible backlash against them. The Police have been embroiled in controversy over the use of force, with civic groups slamming them for using “excessive” force and oppressing freedom to public assembly. During last weekend’s rally, the police appeared to avoid violence at all costs. The protest was dispersed after a three-hour confrontation as police lined up to block marching toward the presidential office. Hong Wan-seon, chief of the Jongno Police Station, even said through a loud speaker: “We understand how worried you are about this nation and how much you love this nation, but you are occupying main roads.”Jeong Won-jae, a 31-year-old officer worker, said that he was surprised by the “respectful attitude” of the police. “I was angry that police still did not open a way for protesters toward the presidential office, but I felt that they were respectful.” Despite President Park’s second apology in a televised address, some associations of teachers, students and civic groups released statements demanding Park step down. By Ock Hyun-ju /","rally in seoul on saturday ,south korean protesters on friday ,korean protesters on friday call ,the upcoming rally in seoul ,korean protesters on friday","['Park Geun - hye ’s', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'Park Geun', 'Baek Nam - gi', 'Baek Nam - gi', 'Seoul National University Hospital', 'Seoul', 'Hong Wan - seon', 'the Jongno Police Station']",4,"[ 0.          3.          0.         ... -0.35101774  0.29508057

While her work takes her in to the far corners and back alleys of Seoul to inspect the living conditions of those that receive a monthly stipend, she is now part of a select few Seoul citizens dedicated to uncovering public street art. In August Kim become one of the 100 participants in the “Art on Seoul’s streets found by citizens” project, a two-month municipal program to promote lesser-known street art and landmarks. Once a week, each team of 10 goes out to discover relatively unknown artwork and come up with ideas on how to promote and preserve these hidden gems. Since Kim’s job requires a lot of walking around, it has been easy for her to track down hidden public art, but she admits that appreciating art is a skill she had to learn.“In the beginning I did not know what public art is and what is not, because I knew nothing about art,” said Kim. But with field experts and art connoisseurs helping the group, she soon found a new appreciation for street art. “I came to have an eye for the hidden charm of public art on the street. When I view public art, now I think about why that statue is standing there and for what purpose. I can now appreciate the influence of public art and the joy it brings to ordinary citizens’ lives who may just pass by it in their everyday lives,” added Kim.Participants at municipal citizen program “Art on Seoul’s streets found by citizens” attend a weekly meeting to discuss Seoul’s public art. Lee Kyung-mi, a freelance curator who supervised the project as one of the leading field experts, said it is important to bring change to the perception that citizens can only enjoy art in galleries. “Many think that citizens can only enjoy art by visiting museums or galleries, when they change that perception they realize that they have the perk of viewing art on the street,” said Lee.“The true enjoyment of art, including public art, can come from a variety of places and spaces. I believe more municipal support  can enhance the quality of public art, allowing public art to easily mingle with citizens’ lives,” she added.By Kim Da-sol","weekly meeting to discuss seoul ,citizens project two month municipal ,social worker at the seoul ,citizen program art on seoul ,meeting to discuss seoul public","['Kim Mi - hyang', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'Kim ’s', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Seoul', 'Lee Kyung - mi', 'Lee', 'Kim Da - sol']",5,"[ 0.          3.          0.         ... -0.36314473  0.05469045

It is currently run by the Seoul City’s Sejong Center for Performing Arts.The city government also plans to spend 10 billion won  to renovate by the end of next year the five hanok buildings that constitute Samcheonggak.  Designated by the city as a Modern Cultural Heritage in 2000, the venue is frequented by foreign visitors for its traditional Korean food as well as cultural events such as traditional music, crafts and Korean traditional cuisine cooking classes. It is also popular among locals as a venue for weddings and fine dining as it has a serene view surrounded by a forest.Samcheonggak According to Seoul officials, Samcheonggak’s five hanoks, which can hold up to 430 visitors, will be turned into exhibition halls that display royal cuisine and temple food after the renovation. The biggest one, Ilhwadang, will be used as a venue for events such as family gatherings, business meetings, seminars and weddings.“We will firstly renovate hanok buildings at Samcheonggak in a bid to provide the best Korean dining and cultural experiences for foreigners from food to shopping, but details will be confirmed once the new business operator is decided,” an official said.Built in 1972, Samcheonggak has witnessed some of Korea’s most dramatic and historic moments.During the military regime, it was mostly used for clandestine meetings of high-ranking government officials. Many important political and diplomatic events were held there as well, including the banquet for the landmark Joint Statement between North and South Korea in 1973.In more recent years, however, Samcheonggak has suffered from poor management and decreasing sales. It closed down several times. In 2000, the Seoul City acquired it for 22.7 billion won.Since 2009, Sejong Center for Performing Arts has been operating it -- at a deficit for the past three years.   Earlier this year, it was revealed that some Seoul City officials had frequently eaten at Samcheonggak, paying nothing or a small portion of the bill.

According to Chuncheon District Court and local reports, the accused, identified only by surname Cho, sent a box of rice cakes to thank the officer for adjusting his or her summons on the first day of the law effectuation, Sept. 28, in the city located about 80 kilometers northeast of Seoul. The police officer immediately returned the gift and reported it to his superiors, as required by the law. The Improper Solicitation and Graft Act, more frequently referred to as the Kim Young-ran act, restricts people from offering government officials, journalists and private school faculty meals worth over 30,000 won, gifts over 50,000 won, but the value is not relevant if there is a direct conflict of interest.More than three weeks has passed since the act came into effect, but confusion has persisted over what constitutes illicit solicitation. The trial is expected to draw keen interest from the public and experts as well as those enforcing the law, who are hoping to find clear guidelines. If found guilty, Cho would face a penalty of a fine two to five times the illicit gift’s monetary value.   Although not a case of a legal breach, an elementary school teacher may face serious disciplinary action for receiving some Japanese crackers, a piece of cake and soap worth of 42,000 won in total from three parents between Sept. 19 and 22, before the Kim Young-ran act took effect.The 30-year-old teacher in Daegu is accused of infringing on the code of conduct for civil servants in the city, whose enforcement has become stricter in line with the introduction of the tough anti-graft act.  The investigation team found that the teacher kept the soap in her classroom but brought the crackers and cake home.By Jo He-rim","rice cakes worth 45 000 ,cakes worth 45 000 won ,gave rice cakes worth 45 ,45 000 won to police ,rice cakes worth 45","['Chuncheon District Court', 'Cho', 'Seoul', 'the Improper Solicitation', 'Kim Young - ran', 'Cho', 'japanese', 'Kim Young - ran', 'Daegu', 'Jo He - rim']",6,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.39624757  0.13050148

David Chen, a 10-year veteran venture capitalist and co-founder of Shanghai-based AngelVest venture capital firm, said Korea has “interesting assets” to attract more overseas investors.“There are various types of local companies spanning from the technology and biotechnology industry to the media and entertainment industry with strong potential,” Chen told The Korea Herald. “While both Korea and China should look into a long-term relationship, beyond temporal blips in bilateral ties, Korean companies which continue to sharpen their own competitiveness and make them unique will be able to create opportunities,” Chen added. Pan Wen, 37, senior consultant of OBOR Investment Co., who flew from Hong Kong to participate in the event, said he is willing to invest in Korea’s information technology companies.“While many are expecting PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympics, Chinese investment firms, including myself, are also interested in real estate and construction equipment,” Pan said. “Active economic cooperation between China and Korea will be the powerful way to recover the current bilateral ties between the two countries,” he added. Representatives from Korean companies and Chinese venture capitals participate at a one-on-one counseling session during the inaugural Seoul-China Investment Week in Seoul on Tuesday. Tuesday’s one-on-one counseling session, held as part of the two-day China Week program organized by the Seoul Metropolitan Government, was attended by some 300 participants from 148 local companies and 56 Chinese venture capitals, who settled down at tables, shared portfolios and asked questions on their future business goals.Kim Min-ho, 32, director at Korean IT and finance consulting group Yello Financial Group, said it had been difficult for startups to individually meet overseas investment firms.“While we have to normally spend a lot of time arranging meetings with overseas investors,  is a great opportunity for startups like us, which enables us to gain opportunities in the Chinese market in a much easier and faster way,” said Kim.“We will more actively find Chinese capital which can support us to finance our business model, while I also believe succeeding in our business also means promoting Korea’s resources and technology scene,” Kim added.In a bid to attract Chinese investment into the city-run businesses, the Seoul municipal government gave a presentation that introduced the city’s projects, such as the Digital Media City, a high-tech complex for digital technology firms, networked offices and cultural centers located in northern Seoul. Huang De, top executive of Bank of China‘s Seoul branch, said in a speech that, “sustained economic development of the two countries can create a wide range of market development and investment opportunities.”“As Seoul city has led many Korean enterprises to cooperate with Chinese enterprises in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, promoting bilateral economic and trade exchanges will lead to both countries’ win-win development,” said Huang.By Kim Da-sol","winter olympics chinese investment firms ,inaugural seoul china investment week ,issue chinese venture capitalists wish ,economic retaliation on korean businesses ,10 year veteran venture capitalist","['chinese', 'korean', 'chinese', 'Seoul', 'David Chen', 'Shanghai', 'AngelVest', 'Korea', 'Chen', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea', 'China', 'korean', 'Chen', 'Pan Wen', 'OBOR Investment Co.', 'Hong Kong', 'Korea', 'chinese', 'Pan', 'China', 'Korea', 'korean', 'chinese', 'Seoul - China Investment Week', 'Seoul', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'chinese', 'Kim Min - ho', 'korean IT', 'Yello Financial Group', 'chinese', 'Kim', 'chinese', 'Korea', 'Kim', 'chinese', 'Seoul', 'Digital', 'Seoul', 'Huang De', 'Bank of China‘s Seoul', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'chinese', 'Beijing', 'Shanghai', 'Guangzhou', 'Huang', 'Kim Da - sol']",11,"[ 0.          5.          5.         ... -0.15941052  0.31999385

According to Hotel Shilla on Monday, the sales of its affiliated Shilla Duty Free in Jangchung-dong in Seoul from Chinese tourists this year were mostly driven by those in their 20s and 30s, accounting for 36 percent and 41 percent, respectively. The 77 percent total by Chinese tourists in their 20s and 30s marked a sharp increase from 34 percent in 2009. The upward trend of sales by young tourists, started in 2009, led to a steady increase in the following years: 53 percent in 2011, 60 percent in 2013 and 74 percent in 2015.Shilla said 20-somethings turned out to be the main drive behind revenue increase, as their proportion climbed tenfold to 36 percent this year from 4 percent in 2009. The world’s third biggest duty free shop in the nation, Lotte Duty Free, also estimates that Chinese tourists aged 40 and below have contributed to more than 80 percent of total revenue this year. The upturn in the number of young Chinese tourists appears to be powered by the traveling boom in China and the popularity of hallyu content. “Younger Chinese tourists absorbed in K-pop and dramas flock to South Korea, and they spend more,” said an official working in the travel industry.By Bak Se-hwan","chinese tourists in their 20s ,hallyu content younger chinese tourists ,south korea helping boost sales ,number of young chinese tourists ,younger chinese tourists","['chinese', 'South Korea', 'Hotel Shilla', 'Jangchung - dong', 'Seoul', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'Lotte Duty Free', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'China', 'chinese', 'South Korea', 'Bak Se - hwan']",11,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.66052032  0.61945724

Seoul Zoo, located in Gwacheon, Gyeonggi-do, opened its doors in 1984 with 77 species of animals on a 196,000-square-meter plot. “I had the intention of learning about deer when I first joined, because I was thinking of operating deer farms in my hometown,” said Han, reminiscing the past when antlers could be sold at high prices.Han Hyo-dong, 58,  poses with his colleague zookeeper Park Han-min, 27, in front of a tiger named “Ahreum.” “But a year later, I was sent to take care of crocodiles. I was in charge of making the best environment for the crocodiles to lay eggs and hatch them. I felt all my efforts paid off the first time I welcomed a baby crocodile,” Han said in an interview with The Korea Herald.Because many of the animals kept at Seoul Zoo are far away from their original habitats, the conditions of soil, water, food and even climate should be controlled to cater to each animal.In 2003, Seoul Zoo kicked off the Behavior Enrichment Program, developed to induce wild animals in the zoo to behave as they would do in nature. After a year-long research and studies on the traits of each animals, the zoo says they were able to reduce the animals’ abnormal behavior by providing them with a similar environment to that of nature.Installing ropes, play structures, and pools at animal breeding grounds is also part of the program. “If human beings wanted to live in the wild, there would be a lot of preparation involved. Likewise, there must be a lot of preparation and consideration for wild animals to live with human beings,” said Han. Han said such program may be far lacking compared to zoos abroad, considering other countries’ high quality of animal welfare and sufficient funding for operating zoos, but he also stressed the importance of visitors’ attitudes.“It is very heartbreaking when I see visitors throwing trash or stones at animals just because animals are not moving or showing reactions. When a boy asks his mother ‘why is that lion not moving?’ a mother should be able to explain why the animal is not moving, instead of throwing a stone at the lion to make it move,” said Han. Han said that he hoped to see more participation from zoo visitors such as fund donation to be help develop the zoo into a better place for both animals and humans. “Although many animal activists argue that zoos play support animal cruelty, without zoos’ efforts to study endangered species and provide environments for wild animals to give birth to another generation, it would be more cruel to see them just dying out.”He added that zoos and aquariums can teach visitors about nature and that by giving them a memorable experience, it could encourage them want to protect it.“The zoo’s role is to constantly educate people, research animals and build resting zones for both animals and visitors. Rather than only craving economic benefits, zoos should be able to provide happiness to animals and people,” said Han.By Kim Da-sol","zookeeper supervising carnivores including tigers ,58 master zookeeper supervising carnivores ,leopards at seoul zoo first ,hyo dong 58 master zookeeper ,deer farms in my hometown","['Han Hyo - dong', 'Seoul Zoo', 'Seoul Zoo', 'Gwacheon', 'Han', 'Han Hyo - dong', 'Han', 'Han', 'the Korea Herald', 'Seoul Zoo', 'Seoul Zoo', 'the Behavior Enrichment Program', 'Han', 'Han', 'Han', 'Han', 'Han', 'Kim Da - sol']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.10772154  0.50421375

The documents are shared with three other zookeepers in the tiger team during a morning meeting.After a short briefing, he preps meals for badgers and raccoons living next door to the tigers. Eggs, apples, bananas, carrots, sweet potatoes and grapes are their favorite foods.Waiting for a truck full of fresh meat for tigers’ breakfast to arrive, he and his colleagues skillfully move and separate the tigers into individual cages to clean their shared enclosure.One of the most important routines for Han and his colleagues is to sweep and inspect the feces, which is the most effective way of noticing health conditions of the tigers, and to decide whether to leave them in their segregated areas or bring them out for public viewing.For safety, every door in the tiger’s zone is double locked, and the zookeepers work in a team of two. The strengthened regulation was put in place after their colleague was killed by a tiger when he went to clean the enclosure by himself.“To this day, I am still haunted by the incident and deeply lament that I should have joined him,” Han said.According to the Korean Association of Zoos and Aquariums, there are 22 registered zoos and aquariums nationwide. Aside from these, there are also smaller, mobile zoos that operate by visiting culture centers at department stores, kindergartens and child care centers.But a number of safety accidents and wider awareness on animals’ rights in recent years have pointed to the lack of legislative system to protect and manage the animals in the zoos, or for the safety of their keepers. The National Assembly in May this year passed the revised law on zoos and aquariums aimed to enhance the protection of animals kept at the facilities, after three years of delays. But animal activists pointed out that the revised version fails to serve the full propose by having deleted some of the crucial items to protect the animals from any abuse such as by fortifying the watch by establishing a separate state watchdog against animal abuse, or banning forced training or threatening of the animals.While controversies persist over zoos, such as commercialization of the public zoos due to operational difficulties, they are yet to dent the popular demands of the venues.“My 3-year-old toddler loves going to the zoo. Seeing the actual animals that she has only seen in picture books completely enchants her. The way her eyes lit up when she saw the elephant for the first time in her life is just priceless,” said Seo Hye-jeen, who said she visits the Seoul Zoo at least once a month.When the food truck arrives at around 10 a.m., zookeepers, including Han, get busy distributing the 80 kilograms of the chicken and 28kg of raw beef among 24 tigers based on their size and health conditions. “Ahreum! Suho!” Han calls out tigers’ names.Tigers eat two chickens at a time but chickens do not need to be chopped as tigers can eat a whole one in several bites, after licking it with their tongues covered with fleshy bristles that soften the meat before they eat it. The biggest tiger at the zoo’s Beast Pavilion, 7-year-old Koa, weighs about 210 kg. But he also receives the same portion as other tigers. He weighed just 2.3 kg when he was born.At breakfast, the beasts are welcomed by the visitors, many of them children. This is when Han is on high alert, since many of the young animal watchers tend to lean over or climb up the railings and knock on the glass wall. Zookeepers have to advise their parents to keep the children safe, and later, erase several hundreds of fingerprints left on the glass windows.Twice a day at 2:30 p.m. and 4 p.m., Han climbs up to the top of a square tiger enclosure with a microphone attached to his mouth, in order to introduce each tiger and demonstrate feeding them in front of the visitors. Pieces of raw beef and some chicken legs during this demonstration become the last meal of the day for tigers. After finishing up the 4 p.m. presentation, zookeepers attend “zoo-university” class hosted by the Seoul Zoo once every month. The class is lectured by a veterinarian residing at Seoul Zoo to share useful facts about animals they take care of.Finishing up by writing afternoon logs about the tigers, Han takes shower and changes back into his clothes, leaving the office at around 6:30 p.m.“I feel like these tigers are my kids. I have been there from when they were brought to the breeding center as little babies to become the mighty beasts that they are now. I always feel grateful to have worked with them without getting hurt for so many years,” Han said.By Kim Da-sol","seoul zoo master zookeeper who ,zookeepers attend zoo university class ,seoul zoo master zookeeper ,each tiger condition every morning ,dong seoul zoo master zookeeper","['Han Hyo - dong', 'Seoul Zoo ’s', 'the Seoul Zoo', 'siberian', 'Han', 'Han', 'the Korean Association of Zoos', 'aquarium', 'the National Assembly', 'Seo Hye - jeen', 'the Seoul Zoo', 'Han', 'Han', 'Beast Pavilion', 'Han', 'Han', 'the Seoul Zoo', 'Seoul Zoo', 'Han', 'Han', 'Kim Da - sol']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3150889   0.93749952

Hyundai Research Institute estimated North Korea's nominal GDP per capita at $1,013 in 2015, up from $930 from the previous year, based on its own income analysis model. The reclusive state's nominal GDP reached $986 in 1987, but has since declined to around $650 in the early 2000s.  According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the North produced 4.78 million tons of crops in 2015, a 10.7-percent fall from a year earlier, due to severe drought. The price of rice per 1 kilogram surged 5.6 percent on-year to 5,200 won .Trade with China was valued at $5.71 billion won last year, down 16.8 percent from 2014, mainly due to a drop in the North's exports of natural resources to its largest trading partner. In contrast, inter-Korean trade rose 15.6 percent on-year to $2.71 billion in 2015, the institute said. The international community's aid to Pyongyang was tallied at $31.87 million last year, up 12.4 percent from a year ago, but less than 2011's $97.11 million, it noted. The research institute evaluated the communist state's economic power is equivalent to that of South Korea in the mid-1970s. North Korea's per-capita GDP lags far behind of other Asian nations, including China , Vietnam  and Laos . It is even below other underdeveloped countries, such as Bangladesh  and Myanmar , according to the institute.""North Korea's current economy is not capable of standing alone,"" said Kim Cheon-koo, a researcher at Hyundai Research Institute.

Kim Seong-hwan, head of Samsung General Labor Union, said in a press briefing Wednesday that the Euro tour aims to raise awareness around the world of Samsung Group’s unethical business practices, anti-union policy and human rights violation. The legally unauthorized union, along with volunteers, plan to stage rallies in front of Samsung Group’s factories and stores across Europe and partner with left-wing civic groups there to seek to put international pressure on the multinational firm. “We need to let the world know  Samsung Group’s crackdown on labor unions. Samsung has exerted significant influence over the nation’s politics, economy and media with its money,” the organization said in a press release. “Without solving such a problem, there is no true democracy for the Korean society.” Samsung General Labor UnionSamsung Group said that it respects union activities under the laws and regulations of the country. ""At Samsung, we the matter of protecting and promoting our workers' rights very seriously,"" an official from the firm said. ""Samsung’s priority will be to continually provide the best working environment to meet the needs and expectations of our employees.""Samsung Group, with 59 affiliates ranging from tech and construction to fashion, is known for its “anti-union” policy, though the company has maintained its workers choose not to join labor unions because they don’t feel the need. The formerly Incheon-based Samsung General Labor Union received a permit to establish a labor union open to Samsung workers based in Incheon from Incheon Metropolitan Government in 2003. As the union later revised its rules to accept workers laid off by the company, the municipality canceled its authorization.In 2013, Samsung Fire & Marine Insurance, one of the affiliates of Samsung Group, filed a complaint against SGLU for using the term “labor union” during anti-Samsung rallies, as it is not actually a legally approved union. Only two unions -- one of less than 10 workers under Samsung Everland and the other for irregular workers under Samsung Electronics Service -- are legally approved. Samsung General Labor Union is fighting to gain legal recognition from the court, with the final ruling stalled at the Supreme Court. Lower courts have confirmed the legitimacy of the union.The union also plans to address issues surrounding alleged dangerous working conditions for factory workers at Samsung Group and its subcontractors.With no exact figures available, Banolim, an advocacy group representing victims of alleged workplace illness, claims there are 223 victims of diseases that appear related to hazardous conditions at Samsung’s factories. Among them, 76 had died as of July.  Despite Samsung Electronics’ official apology, some of the victims and their families have criticized the company for pushing for a unilateral compensation scheme.Since late January, four workers belonging to Samsung Electronics’ mobile parts suppliers allegedly suffered loss of vision and brain damage due to methanol. The firm has denied responsibility. The tour is scheduled for Dec. 2-18 around France, the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Luxembourg.By Ock Hyun-ju","union during anti samsung rallies ,to launch 17 day tour ,volunteers plan to stage rallies ,during anti samsung rallies ,wednesday that the euro tour","['Samsung General Labor Union', 'Samsung Group ’s', 'Kim Seong - hwan', 'Samsung General Labor Union', 'Euro', 'Samsung Group ’s', 'Samsung Group ’s', 'Samsung Group ’s', 'Samsung', 'korean', 'Samsung General Labor UnionSamsung Group', 'Samsung', 'Samsung ’s', 'Incheon', 'Samsung General Labor Union', 'Samsung', 'Incheon', 'Incheon Metropolitan Government', 'Samsung Fire & Marine Insurance', 'Samsung Group', 'SGLU', 'anti - samsung', 'Samsung Electronics Service', 'Samsung General Labor Union', 'the Supreme Court', 'Samsung Group', 'Banolim', 'Samsung ’s', 'Samsung Electronics ’', 'Samsung Electronics ’', 'France', 'the United Kingdom', 'Belgium', 'the Netherlands', 'Germany', 'Luxembourg', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3910597   0.30968437

South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se arrived in New York over the weekend to deliver a keynote address at the General Assembly and hold some 15 rounds of bilateral and multilateral talks with his counterparts from the US, Japan and other countries. Atop his agenda is rallying member states behind ongoing efforts to formulate a new UN Security Council resolution following the North’s fifth atomic blast on Sept. 9. South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se talks to the press before heading for New York to attend the UN General Assembly on Saturday. Yun will kick off the drive with a tripartite session with US Secretary of State John Kerry and Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and a two-way meeting with Kishida, both scheduled for Sunday afternoon, during which he is also expected to coordinate their independent punitive steps.  “We’re currently in in-depth consultations with UNSC members and other nations on how to complement Resolution 2270, which was approved after the fourth nuclear test, and how to make North Korea feel pain from its latest nuclear test,” Yun told reporters shortly before his departure from Incheon International Airport late Saturday. “From the UN level, issues like refugees and climate change are critical. On our side, I will focus on three areas -- North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats, which is one of the gravest challenges not just to the peninsula but also in Northeast Asia and the international community, as well as its severe human rights violations.” North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho is likely to defend the country’s much decried nuclear program through a speech at the assembly this Saturday. During a meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement in Venezuela last Thursday, he argued the newest underground explosion was a “legitimate, inevitable self-defensive measure” to counter “constant threats” from the US. Pyongyang is ready for a “counterattack against US provocations” including last Tuesday’s flying of two B-1B supersonic bombers over the peninsula in a display of force.The recent experiment signaled the communist state’s progress in its nuclear development, as it showed the largest explosive power to date. Tension is running high given the lingering possibility of an additional blast. Citing commercial satellite imagery from Sept. 15, the US-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies said Friday that Pyongyang may detonate further devices at the unused tunnels at its Punggye-ri complex, echoing the South Korean military’s assessment days earlier. The five permanent UNSC members, including China and Russia, also issued a joint statement condemning the recent North Korean provocation after their two-day conference in Washington late Friday. It called for a “complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in a peaceful manner,” reaffirming their commitment to peace and stability in the region as well as the 2005 denuclearization accord of six-party talks.

Ahn Hoon/The Korea HeraldThe focal point of emphasis for many participants, especially the delegation from South Korea, is the ongoing North Korean nuclear and ballistic missile programs.In a video message, President Park Geun-hye said the North’s provocations represent a blatant threat against the international society’s efforts toward peace.“In order to address the North Korean nuclear issue that is threatening world peace, cooperation and unity of the international society is of the utmost importance,” Park said.Hwang echoed the president’s remarks and called for tight cooperation among nations and regions against worldwide security issues, vowing that Seoul will actively participate in efforts to resolve North Korean nuclear programs, eradicate terrorism and deal with natural disasters and climate change.Minister Han said that the world currently faces challenges ranging from the “traditional liabilities” of the North, to disputes among countries in the North East Asia region over territory and history-related issues, terrorism, along with cultural and religious conflicts leading to violence. “Despite efforts by the international society to achieve peace, humanity still faces numerous challenges. ... The most pressing task in order to accomplish global peace and stability is  North Korea’s nuclear issue,” said Minister Han in his opening remarks. “I hope that the SDD 2016 will provide insights for dealing with North Korean nuclear and missile programs, cyber threats and for achieving global peace,” Han said.The OPCW Director-General Uzumcu stressed the importance of his organization’s chemical weapon convention that has seen 93 percent of declared chemical weapons destroyed to date. He mentioned the ongoing mission against Syria’s chemical weapons, adding that reports of a fact-finding mission has found likelihood of chlorine being used as a weapon and that the UNSC is expected to discuss follow-up measures.“There nonetheless remains both new and unfinished business to attend to -- respectively, the specter of chemical terrorism and the contingency of having to eliminate other chemical weapons programs, which North Korea is widely suspected of operating,” he said. The first plenary session was about the denuclearization of North Korea and international cooperation. North Korea is currently under UN Security Council resolutions that impose economic sanctions and bans it from carrying out any nuclear or ballistic missile programs.David Shear, the US principal deputy under secretary of defense for policy, said that North Korean nuclear programs represent threats not only to South Korea, but also to Japan and the US, along with other countries in the region.He reiterated that the US will not recognize Pyongyang as a nuclear state, saying that the US will use deterrence, pressure and diplomacy so Pyongyang “will not achieve prosperity while it flouts obligations.”“The US will continue to further strengthen our defense of the ROK ,” he said.With North Korean missile programs emerging as an imminent threat, local experts said that the gathering of defense officials from around the world can help boost security in the region.“ brings together high-ranking officials and experts from not only countries around the peninsula and Asia-Pacific, but also Europe and Americas to discuss specific plans of cooperation in defense and solutions to current crisis,” said Kim Chang-su, a senior fellow for the local think tank Korea Institute for Defense Analyses. “This will serve as a reminder of the grave nature of security issues and the potential of feasible solutions .”By Yoon Min-sik","westin chosun seoul on thursday ,missile tests the fifth annual ,kicked off thursday to discuss ,korean nuclear programs eradicate terrorism ,seoul on thursday ahn hoon","['North Korea ’s', 'the south Korean Defense Ministry', 'the Westin Chosun Hotel', 'Seoul', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Defense', 'Han Min - koo', 'Ahmet Uzumcu', 'the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons', 'south korean', 'Han Min - koo', 'Ahn Hoon', 'Korea', 'HeraldThe', 'South Korea', 'north korean', 'Park Geun', 'North ’s', 'north korean', 'Park', 'Hwang', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'Han', 'North Korea ’s', 'Han', 'north korean', 'Han', 'OPCW', 'Syria', 'UNSC', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'UN Security Council', 'David Shear', 'US', 'north korean', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'US', 'US', 'Pyongyang', 'US', 'Pyongyang', 'US', 'ROK', 'north korean', 'Kim Chang - su', 'Korea Institute for Defense Analyses', 'Yoon Min - sik']",3,"[ 0.          2.          1.         ... -0.53800082  0.73688751

An official from the district office asked Wi and his teammates to avoid playing soccer there at night, as there had been complaints that the bright lights at the field disturbed residents. “But it doesn’t make sense that we play soccer with the lights turned off. The field is open for all citizens to use,” Wi said.Eventually, the district office, the residents and the soccer team reached a temporary compromise to use the stadium lights only up to 10 p.m.Strong light is emitted from the lights at a public soccer field in Seoul. This incident was one of 1,216 cases reported to the Seoul Metropolitan Government regarding light pollution last year. There are no concrete regulations restricting the use of bright lights at night, making it difficult for parties involved to reach a solution on light pollution.According to the SMG, complaints related to light pollution issue have been increasing each year. In 2012, 857 cases were reported and there were 1,571 cases in 2014. Most of them were made by residents who complained their sleep was being disturbed and they were being inconvenienced by bright lights.  Light pollution refers to when an inappropriate use of light disturbs one’s health or living status, or damages the environment, according to the Ministry of Environment.Most light pollution in the city come from neon-light advertisements on the streets, light-emitting diode light bulbs installed around buildings including restaurants and cafes, and headlight beams from vehicles, among others. South Korea, along with Italy, have been listed as countries with the most extensive light pollution among the G20 countries in a report released by the Italian Light Pollution Science and Technology Institute in June.An interactive map from the Italian Light Pollution Science and Technology Institute reveals the full extent of light pollution around the globe. South Korea ranked second, reaching the 89.4 percent level in light pollution index, just 0.9 percentage point behind Italy.Researchers added that more than 80 percent of the world population suffers from light pollution, while 1 in 3 people around the globe cannot observe the Milky Way from the sky in their home countries. The report explained that light pollution creates a luminous fog or “sky glow,” which impairs the view of stars and constellations in the night sky.Light pollution can also be detrimental to health. In human bodies, light works as a biological trigger that suppresses health-improving functions that should naturally occur in our bodies at night.Studies have showed that being exposed to light at night can lead to health damages linked to obesity, depression, sleeping disorders and cancers. Scientists have also found an undisputed connection between sufficient sleep and good health.Meanwhile, the World Health Organization has underlined the importance of exposure to daylight during the day and darkness at night to maintain a routine circadian rhythm. The WHO lists “shiftwork that involves circadian disruption” as a probable carcinogen.To come up with countermeasures regarding light pollution in the city, the government enacted a light pollution protection law in 2013, but the effectiveness of its enforcement is still under question.According to the law, each district office is responsible for restrictions on light pollution by designating a so-called environment protection zone for light control. However, conflicting opinions between district offices and owners of restaurants and cafes frequently lead to disputes.To effectively control the light pollution issue, the Seoul City set up a special committee last year to check and require newly constructed buildings to receive an approval regarding light options.When neon-sign advertisements which emit strong lights at night are installed in residential areas, their brightness should be under the level of 25 lux, -- the unit for luminance and luminous emittance -- equivalent to the brightness emitted by 25 candles, explained an official from the SMG’s life environment division.If a light-emitting facility does not follow the regulation, it will receive up to 3 million won  in penalty. If it ignores the district order to follow the regulation, it can be fined to up to 10 million won.“We are in the course of promoting clearer and specific standards and requirements to cope with the light pollution issue,” the official said.The SMG also added that it has started to install street lights with automatic light sensors that allow them to be turned on when human motion is detected. This follows the first and successful installation of the “Smart LED road light control system” last year at some dozen streets in Dongdaemun-gu.

He said the city will continue to draw up detailed plans to create an urban park upholding the historical value of the site.After several rounds of talks stretching decades, South Korea and the US agreed in 2004 to relocate the US military headquarters in Yongsan to an expanded military base in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province. In 2010, both agreed to complete the relocation by 2017.Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon speaks during the press conference at the City Hall on Wednesday. The US Army Garrison in Yongsan was first set up in 1945, allowing US troops to hold de facto control of the Yongsan region for its strategic location in the capital after South Korea became independent.Giving an example of Stanley Park -- the park that borders the downtown of Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada -- Mayor Park said that building Yongsan Park can decide Seoul’s future and reputation as a city landmark.“Stanley Park is one of the most beloved parks that was created by the Vancouver City Council to celebrate the first year of independence from the UK,” said Park during the press conference at City Hall.“As you can see, the park became Vancouver’s pride and a historical symbol, appreciated by citizens who can enjoy the green oasis in the city as well as to remember the historical meaning,” he added. In 2006 the SMG announced it would turn the Yongsan base area into a park larger than London’s Hyde Park when US troops move out. However, its initial plan to fully use the 3.58 million square meters of the land fell through, as central government ministries competed for use of the land.According to city government, state organizations, such as the Defense Acquisition Program Administration, have beaten the city to reserve the use of 930,000 square meters of land. Another 220,000 square meters of land will be handed to US troops for the relocation of the US embassy in 2019. Additional distribution of the remaining land lots can be made to the US upon their request.Currently, 68 percent of the site can be turned into a park.In 1992, some 290,000 square meters of land, including a golf course, was returned to the city government for the use of the site for the National Museum of Korea and Yongsan Family Park.Park claimed that the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport unilaterally pushed its position to use the land without considering the purpose or value of the park.In May, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport announced its plan to build a national science museum following the relocation of US troops.Park contended that there are a number of historical and cultural resources in the Yongsan area, including a prison that was used during the Japanese colonization era.“Based on our blueprint for the park, we will first set up a data bank and research archive to study the historical value of Yongsan, and ultimately apply for UNESCO listing,” Park said.The Seoul Metropolitan Government also added it would actively support citizens to engage in creating the park by operating citizen-run design labs and seminars.By Kim Da-sol","relocation by 2017 seoul mayor ,wednesday the us army garrison ,the relocation by 2017 seoul ,talks stretching decades south korea ,2017 seoul mayor park","['Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Yongsan', 'US', 'South Korea', 'US', 'US', 'Yongsan', 'Pyeongtaek', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Park Won - soon', 'the US Army Garrison', 'Yongsan', 'US', 'Yongsan', 'South Korea', 'Stanley Park', 'Vancouver', 'British Columbia', 'Canada', 'Park', 'Yongsan Park', 'Seoul', 'the Vancouver City Council', 'UK', 'Vancouver ’s', 'SMG', 'Yongsan', 'London', 'Hyde Park', 'US', 'the Defense Acquisition Program Administration', 'US', 'US', 'US', 'the National Museum of Korea', 'Yongsan Family Park', 'the Ministry of Land , Infrastructure and Transport', 'the Ministry of Land , Infrastructure and Transport', 'US', 'Yongsan', 'japanese', 'Yongsan', 'UNESCO', 'Park', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Kim Da - sol']",5,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.23505704  0.36719429

That is about the same level of noise you would experience while using a lawnmower. Based on the law, noise over 60 decibels after 10 p.m. is considered noise pollution.Following the growing number of residents’ complaints about noise pollution, the Mapo-gu Office began mandating that buskers’ performances finish by 10 p.m. in July.The current Noise and Vibration Control Act states that authorities can “control noise and vibration emitted from a workplace, construction field, etc. to maintain a tranquil living environment for residents.” Members of civic groups hold a press conference calling for comprehensive measures and due safety regulations related to noise between floors in June 2015. But the authorities that are responsible for managing noise differ, with varying standards and different regulations, making it difficult for complainants to seek a solution.The Environment Ministry for instance addresses noise pollution through the Framework Act on Environmental Policy, while the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport is in charge of controlling noise created from construction sites with its regulations on standards on housing construction.The number of noise complaints filed with authorities have been rising consistently.Last year, a total of 41,286 noise pollution complaints were filed with the Seoul Metropolitan Government, an on-year increase of 24 percent.Another set of Seoul City data collected from 2013 to June this year showed that slightly over 96 percent or 524 cases of civil disputes filed regarding city environment were about noise pollution.Of them, 347 cases were about noise pollution from construction sites while 95 cases were noise between floors. The National Environmental Dispute Resolution Commission  under the Environment Ministry received 210 cases last year, of which 84.3 percent pertained to conflicts over noise. Of the noise-related disputes, most concerned construction sites.Disputes from noise between floors have also been a chronic problem in South Korea. Half of residents in South Korea live in an apartment complex, according to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. Since Korean apartments are mostly separated by cement walls, sound easily transfers between them.According to the Korea Environment Corp., the number of complaints over noise in apartments has grown threefold to 15,619 cases in 2015, compared to 7,021 cases in 2012.To placate these complaints, the government even created a noise complaint reporting center to mediate disputes between neighbors. In 2012, Korea Environment Corp., which is under the Environment Ministry, launched the National Noise Information System to listen to complaints about noise between floors via phone counseling. The program helped resolve approximately 70 percent of some 75,000 reported cases, as of July.An official works at the neighbor dispute resolution center that opened in June at Seoul Metropolitan Government. Counselors receive the complaints upon which legal professionals work on resolving the confllct. While some cases of noise pollution between floors are brought to courts, there have been tragic examples of disputes escalating into violence. Most recently in July, a man in his 30s was arrested for killing a woman who lived upstairs and wounding her husband after months of dispute over noise.A recent survey by the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission had shown that 88 percent of South Koreans had experienced noise pollution between floors. Some 36 percent of them were caused by the sounds of children running, 18 percent from the use of electrical equipment such as televisions or washing machines, 16 percent from the sound of adults walking on the floors, 9 percent from musical instruments, and 9 percent from doors shutting.Experts say that continued exposure to noise pollution can negatively affect physical and mental health. “Noise pollution can give direct unpleasant feelings to sensory organs and cause symptoms such as headache or heart beating rapidly,” said Bae Myung-jin of professor of voice communication at Soongsil University. Noise pollution in rural areas, meanwhile, harms animals as well. Bae, a resident of Jangseong County in South Jeolla Province, has been running a farm raising soft-shelled turtles for two decades before he saw the sudden deaths of over 3,500 turtles last year.Bae said that turtles’ deaths were caused by noise created as the KTX passed by on a nearby railroad. The railroad was located about 35 meters away from his two water pools containing thousands of turtles.Korea Rail Network Authority, the operator of the KTX, argued that all its trains are operated under standard noise level requirements -- normally from 45 to 70 decibels at the distance of the turtle pools. They argued they were under no obligation to compensate Bae.After the case was brought to the NEDRC, the final decision ruled in favor of Bae, ordering the KRNA to pay 70 million won. The NEDRC conducted an experiment that showed that the KTX produced noise at least 30 decibels louder than the standard level.The Seoul Metropolitan Government vowed to address noise pollution, starting by creating a so-called noise pollution city map. The city aims for a reduction in complaints by 2018.“We will mark and pay extra attention to noisy areas in the capital to effectively control noise pollution through random on-site inspection or resident counseling program,” said the Seoul Metropolitan Government official from Life Environment department.“By doing so, we will be able to dramatically view the concentration and source of noise pollution in the capital,” she added.It also said that it will conduct inspections on some 62 major construction sites and car wash areas in Seoul to check whether they follow the standard noise level requirements.By Kim Da-sol","with talented young buskers seoul ,on seoul battle against three ,young buskers seoul daehangno ,talented young buskers seoul daehangno ,talented young buskers seoul","['Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Kim Ju - hyun', 'Hongik University', 'Hongdae', 'the Environment Ministry', 'the Ministry of Land , Infrastructure and Transport', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Seoul City', 'the National Environmental Dispute Resolution Commission', 'Environment Ministry', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'the Ministry of Land , Infrastructure and Transport', 'korean', 'the Korea Environment Corp.', 'Korea Environment Corp.', 'the Environment Ministry', 'the National Noise Information System', 'Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'the Anti - Corruption and Civil Rights Commission', 'South Koreans', 'Bae Myung - jin', 'Soongsil University', 'Jangseong County', 'South Jeolla Province', 'Bae', 'KTX', 'Korea Rail Network Authority', 'KTX', 'Bae', 'NEDRC', 'Bae', 'KRNA', 'NEDRC', 'KTX', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Life Environment', 'Seoul', 'Kim Da - sol']",5,"[ 0.          3.          0.         ... -0.41497868  0.09900881

Temperatures also remained high throughout the night. It led to sleepless tropical night phenomena which has continued for 19 days in August alone.The KMA’s wrong weather forecast marks the third error made in August alone on the heat wave. The KMA previously predicted the heat wave will come to an end on Aug. 14, but changed it to Aug. 21.The KMA announced Monday that daily highs will hit the low 30s starting this Friday and will fall to 29 degrees Celsius by next Tuesday.Some questioned the KMA’s inexperience in utilizing the super computer, a device used in analyzing weather forecast data. In February, the KMA purchased four super computers at 53 billion won to enhance the accuracy of weather forecasts. Operating the machines costs at least 250 million won a month.The weather forecast is made by KMA officials who analyze collected weather forecast models, based on a UK-based weather analysis model stored in the super computers.Experts pointed to the lack of an efficient personnel system at the KMA.“Since the weather data is analyzed by officials at the KMA, it is crucial for them to have years of experience and expert-level knowledge for an accurate forecast result. But the KMA, for instance, does not necessarily consider one’s expertise or experience when naming a person to the Forecast Bureau chief position that is responsible for distributing the forecast,” an official of a local private weather forecast company told the Korea Herald, on condition of anonymity.Meanwhile, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday that a total of 1,994 individuals have been diagnosed with heat-related diseases as of Aug. 20. This is more than 1.7 times higher than the total number of patients treated for the condition last year and 3.2 times higher than the number treated in 2014.As of Aug. 22, 16 Koreans have died after suffering heat-related causes such as heat stroke -- the highest number since the state compiled data on heat stroke patients in 2011.By Kim Da-sol","celsius in seoul on monday ,monday while heat wave warning ,seoul on monday while heat ,degrees celsius by next tuesday ,36 degrees celsius in seoul","['the Korea Meteorological Administration ’s', 'KMA', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'KMA', 'KMA', 'KMA', 'KMA', 'KMA', 'UK', 'kma.“since', 'KMA', 'KMA', 'Forecast Bureau', 'the Korea Herald', 'the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Koreans', 'Kim Da - sol']",4,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.56037807  0.28394538

Containers are piled next to a crane at a Yantai port. But the coastal city of Yantai has always stressed the importance of integrating China’s “One Belt, One Road” with Korea’s resolve to expand cooperation with neighboring countries. The “One Belt, One Road” initiative is a development strategy envisioned by the Chinese government that focuses on China’s connectivity and cooperation with neighboring countries.A visiting group of international journalists in June were introduced to the China-South Korea Yantai Industrial Park, a joint development project between the two countries. “The Yantai industrial park, set up under the China-South Korea FTA, represents a crucial opportunity to strengthen cooperation with Korea and seek mutual development through it,” said Yantai Mayor Zhang Yongxia. “Yantai will create an industrial environment that follows the international standards to attract investment. I believe the industrial park is the best choice for Korean firms.”She said that Korea is the city’s biggest partner in terms of foreign investment and trade, and stressed that the cooperation was not only in industrial sectors, but also in culture and tourism.“Korea has a substantially large capacity in cultural content, which is welcomed in China. I hope Yantai will become a foothold for Korean firms in such industry seeking to enter Chinese market.”The industrial park, while still in its initial stages of development, is expected to attract 117.3 billion yuan  worth of investment in the next 10 years, officials said. It is also to receive 24 different benefits from the government in nine sectors such as trade, investment, finance and transportation.  A freighter is seen at a port in Yantai. The economic cooperation between Korea and Yantai is rooted in robust investment, which appears to have stepped up to a higher level after the Korea-China FTA took effect last year. According to a recent report by China Daily, the contractual investment from Korea on Yantai was estimated at $160 million from January to May, marking a 65 percent on-year hike.Korean firms have invested a total of $5.56 billion in the city, with 3,651 projects having been launched as of the end of May.Located just 448 kilometers from Incheon, which makes it closer to Korea than Beijing, its 7 million residents contribute roughly 644.6 billion yuan  in gross domestic products. The trade volume between Yantai and Korea is estimated to be around $11 billion, accounting for about one-third of Shandong province’s total trade volume with the country.Roughly four out of 10 companies based in Yantai export their products to Korea.It also houses key Korean corporations including Doosan Infracore, LG Electronics, Hyundai Motor, Hanwha Group and Posco, with roughly 15,000 Koreans residing there.In a bid to assist Korean firms in settling down, Yantai operates the Yantai Korean School for children of employees working at such companies. Its curriculum is largely based on the Korean public education system to help children adapt better to Korean universities, while it also has localized programs such as Chinese language courses. Children at Yantai Korean School pose for a photo during visit by international group of journalists. Projects that received joint investment from the two countries include Luye Bobath Rehabilitation Hospital, the first domestic rehabilitation hospital in China, commenced operation in June.While 13 ships and 17 air freight flights are operated each week to major Korean destinations from Yantai, the city looks to increase connectivity by pushing for a project that would operate a ferry carrying a freight train directly Korea.“The ferry train operated between Yantai and Dalian  managed to shorten the distance of transportation and costs by a large margin,” said Liu Jun, the general manager of the Sino Rail Bohai Train Ferry Co, Ltd. “I hope that Korea will pursue the train ferry between Yantai and the port of Pyeongtaek  in the near future.”By Yoon Min-sikcaption: credit: Yoon Min-sik/ The Korea HeraldA freighter is seen at a port in Yantai.Containers are piled next to a crane at a Yantai port.Children at Yantai Korean School pose for a photo during visit by international group of journalists.","korean billboard in yantai shandong ,best choice for korean firms ,key korean corporations including doosan ,on year hike korean firms ,the future reads korean billboard","['choose Yantai', 'korean', 'Yantai', 'Shandong province', 'chinese', 'Korea', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Korea', 'the US', 'Yantai', 'Yantai', 'China', 'Korea ’s', 'chinese', 'China', 'China', 'Industrial Park', 'Yantai', 'FTA', 'Korea', 'Yantai Mayor Zhang Yongxia', 'Yantai', 'korean', 'Korea', 'China', 'Yantai', 'korean', 'chinese', 'Yantai', 'Korea', 'Yantai', 'the Korea - China FTA', 'China Daily', 'Korea', 'Yantai', 'korean', 'Incheon', 'Korea', 'Beijing', 'Yantai', 'Korea', 'Shandong province ’s', 'Yantai', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Doosan Infracore', 'LG Electronics', 'Hyundai Motor', 'Hanwha Group', 'Posco', 'Koreans', 'korean', 'Yantai', 'the Yantai Korean School', 'korean', 'korean', 'chinese', 'Yantai Korean School', 'Luye Bobath Rehabilitation Hospital', 'China', 'korean', 'Yantai', 'Korea', 'Yantai', 'Dalian', 'Liu Jun', 'Sino', 'Korea', 'Yantai', 'Pyeongtaek', 'Yoon Min -', 'Yoon Min -', 'Korea', 'Yantai', 'Yantai', 'Yantai Korean School']",10,"[ 0.          0.         12.         ... -0.56671119  0.85224986

Her main concern is not the scorching weather, but the food smell that wafts over to her house from a “galbi”  restaurant across the street.Kim has been living in Seoul’s southeastern town Jamsil in Songpa-gu for about five decades.Smell and smoke from grilling pork invade her house day and night. A giant plastic container filled with food waste is also placed outside overnight, stinking up the entire street.“I have tried telling the restaurant owner about the malodor pollution. I also called Songpa-gu Office and filed a civil complaint,” Kim said. Bins filled with food waste placed on a street in Seoul. “District office officials came back to me with ridiculous answers. They told me that malodor pollution does not provide a legal basis for officials to intervene and control,” she added.This summer, Kim has resorted to turning on two air purifiers inside her house 24/7, adding to her electricity bill. Malodor is a major bugbear in metropolitan cities during summer and it is considered a major form of pollution, along with light and noise.The scorching heat of summer volatilizes malodor caused from materials such as food waste, leading to serious sanitary problems, city officials explained.  Malodor not only stimulates the olfactory sense, but also can have an impact on the respiratory system, mucous membrane and eyes, potentially leading to a headache, nausea, loss of appetite and higher stress levels. According to the Seoul Metropolitan Government, the number of civil complaints on malodor hit 4,022 last year, more than four times higher than the 957 complaints in 2009. By district, Songpa-gu had the highest number of civil complaints on malodor, followed by Dongdaemun-gu and Gangnam-gu. All three districts are known to have popular food alleys and a large floating population.District officials say that although the odor sometimes reaches intolerable levels in food alleys during summer, it is hard for them to crack down on it. “When we receive civil complaints on malodor from a restaurant, we send an enforcement notice to the restaurant owner. If they fail to provide a solution for the third consecutive time, we levy them with a 200,000 won penalty,” said an official from Songpa-gu office.Current law states that facilities that emit malodor can pay “all or part of costs necessary for the operation of public malodor treatment facilities.” In 2003, the government enacted the Malodor Prevention Act and defined malodor as “any odor that causes displeasure and disgust to people by stimulating their olfactory sense with hydrogen sulfide, mercaptane, amine, or other pungent substances.”It was made to ensure that citizens can “live in a healthy and pleasant environment by preventing malodor produced due to business activities,” but the act only states that it applies to large-scale businesses or factories.Authorities dispatched to sites to settle civil complaints also face difficulties. “We also feel difficulty providing solution to malodors since we have no malodor detecting device. As we are not professionals or experts, all we can do is to give warnings to malodor-emitting facilities,” said a district office official.Experts say it is difficult to define the exact cause of malodors since they are invisible. The severity of malodors also varies per person. For now, it is important to develop a detailed plan to find the causes of malodors and prevent them, said experts.“It is necessary to plan out a customized management system on controlling malodor, since there are a variety of smells and origins such as drain pipes, factories and restaurants,” said Kim Young-doo from the Public Health and Environment Research Institute under Seoul City.""We are planning to provide a consulting program and facility renovations such as improving sewage system and food waste disposals,” he added. The SMG earlier this month vowed to inject 170 million won  to install more malodor reduction devices, aiming to lower the number of civil complaints on malodor by 30 percent by 2018.Malodor reduction devices, similar to an air purification system, works by injecting a certain amount of oxygen to prevent gas stored inside septic tanks from being released as malodor through manholes or inlets on streets. It costs approximately 2 million won to install such a device in a five-story building.It will also conduct random inspections at some waste landfills and septic tanks operators to make sure they meet waste exhaust standards. The city government said that it has so far installed over 1,000 malodor reduction devices at septic tanks and removed 980 rainwater pipes from bus stops and crosswalks near pedestrian roads. It also carries out regular cleaning of drains every year.

This image provided by the Education Ministry on Aug. 17 shows how a solar school is operated. South Korea started the project in 2013 as part of its efforts to share its e-learning development experience in three African countries -- Kenya, Ghana and Ethiopia -- before later widening it to include three other African countries -- Uganda, Rwanda and Mozambique -- earlier this year.The ministry plans to give e-learning training to a group of educators from the six countries where solar schools are installed in the southeastern city of Daegu from Aug. 17-27.According to a ministry official, the project has been paying off. He said, ""In Ghana, the rate of students missing school at a solar school has fallen 40 percent from those days when there was no such solar school system, with the passing rate of moving up to a higher grade rising to 94 percent from 14 percent.""","the solar school project classroom ,solar school project classroom ,ministry said wednesday solar school ,solar school project classroom is ,solar panels to power learning","['South Korea', 'Zambia', 'Tanzania', 'Zimbabwe', 'the Education Ministry', 'african', 'the Education Ministry', 'South Korea', 'african', 'Kenya', 'Ghana', 'Ethiopia', 'african', 'Uganda', 'Rwanda', 'Mozambique', 'Daegu', 'Ghana']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.15594684  0.1069602

Some 400 U.S. military officials, KATUSA war veterans, KATUSA reservists and active-duty KATUSA soldiers participated in the event at Camp Jackson, a U.S. military base, in Uijeongbu, north of Seoul.KATUSA Veterans Association Chairman Kim Jong-wook and 2nd Infantry Division Commander Theodore D. Martin were among the participants. Chairman Kim delivered a welcoming speech following a silent tribute to patriotic martyrs and then Commander Martin as guest speaker gave a keynote speech on the meaning of the 66th anniversary for the two allies.Commander Martin said KATUSA has operated like a set of well-running wheels for the U.S. and South Korean armies for the past 66 years. He asked KATUSA soldiers to continue their bridging role in strengthening the bilateral alliance.   Photo taken on June 6, KATUSA soldiers and U.S. soldiers pay tribute to KATUSA soldiers downed during the Korean War in a memorial service held at the UN Memorial Cemetery in Korea, located in Busan, 453 km south of Seoul. ""The alliance between the two countries has gotten stronger over the past decades due to KATUSA soldiers who were downed during the  Korean War and active-duty KATUSA soldiers have helped harden the U.S.-Republic of Korea alliance,"" Kim said. After the speeches, three generations of a family ? a grandfather, a father and a son -- won commendation for their services at KATUSA. Cpl. Choi Ho-eun, currently serving in the 2nd Infantry Division, was the latest generation of the family. His father Choi Yoon-seong served in the field army's artillery regiment in the same 2nd Infantry Division in the late 1980s and his late grandfather Choi Sang-ho fought in the Korean War as a KATUSA soldier.   A cake-cutting ceremony was held to commemorate the 66th year of the augmentation troops' foundation on Aug. 15, 1950, nearly two months after the Korean War broke out on June 25.Back then, Gen. Douglas MacArthur of the U.S. Army, who led the United Nations Command during the early part of the inter-Korean civil war, asked for a dispatch of Korean soldiers to the U.S. Army due to a lack of soldiers. South Korea's inaugural President Rhee Syng-man accepted the request. KATUSA soldiers initially assisted U.S. soldiers with their knowledge of local terrain while helping to avoid miscommunication between the two armies. But they now serve as an integral part of the U.S. Army in Korea.  Each year, about 2,000 are recruited as KATUSA soldiers. So far, about 300,000 KATUSA soldiers have contributed to beefing up the joint defensive capabilities between the U.S. and Korean military forces.","soldiers south korea inaugural president ,korean war in memorial service ,army in korea each year ,of soldiers south korea inaugural ,korean soldiers to the army","['the Korean Augmentation Troops', 'the U.S. Army', 'KATUSA', 'the KATUSA Veterans Association', 'U.S.', 'KATUSA', 'KATUSA', 'KATUSA', 'U.S.', 'Uijeongbu', 'Seoul', 'KATUSA Veterans Association', 'Kim Jong - wook', '2nd Infantry Division', 'Theodore D.

Moscow, along with Beijing, opposes the deployment, saying it will destabilize the regional security landscape and undermine its security interests.The bilateral relationship has also deteriorated since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, which the South Korean government, in tandem with the international community, maintains breached international law and undermined Ukraine's territorial integrity.""Park is likely to use her summit with Putin to ease Russia's concerns over THAAD and secure Moscow's support in handling North Korea-related issues including the communist state's pursuit of nuclear arms,"" said Nam Chang-hee, international politics professor at Inha University.Amid strong opposition of the deployment of THAAD, particularly from residents in South Korea's southern town of Seongju, the selected site for the deployment, the president has defended the decision as a ""self-defense"" measure to safeguard her country in the face of evolving nuclear and missile threats from Pyongyang.Since 2006, Pyongyang has conducted four underground nuclear tests, with the last one being carried out in early January. This last nuke test and the subsequent launching of a long-range missile caused the United Nations Security Council to slap the most stringent sanctions on the North to date. During the upcoming summit with Putin, Park is likely to stress that THAAD would only target North Korean missiles and call for Russia's cooperation in creating a situation in which Pyongyang has no other option but to renounce its nuclear ambitions, experts said.Following the decision to deploy a THAAD battery, concerns have also persisted that friction in relations with Russia and China would weaken international cooperation in pressuring the North to give up its evolving nuclear weapons program through strong sanctions. Considering such concerns, Park is expected to capitalize on her summit diplomacy with Russia to tighten the screws on a recalcitrant Pyongyang, observers pointed out.During her visit to Vladivostok, the South Korean chief executive will also face the crucial task of restoring bilateral diplomatic and economic ties.From a bilateral project to expand cooperation in the development of the resource-rich Russian Far East to a three-way economic cooperation scheme that also involves Pyongyang, Seoul and Moscow had pushed for a series of mutually beneficial programs.But such efforts to expand economic ties have lost traction due to Pyongyang's continued provocations and Russia's conflict with the United States -- South Korea's core security ally -- and the West in the wake of the Crimean crisis.""Aside from the THAAD issue, the second-most-important issue  will be to beef up efforts to expand bilateral economic ties, which have been delayed since the West slapped sanctions on Russia ,"" said Ko Jae-nam, director general of the Department of European and African Studies at the state-run Korea National Diplomatic Academy.On the occasion of the two-day Eastern Economic Forum, which will be held in Vladivostok under the main theme of ""Opening up the Russian Far East,"" Park and Putin are expected to explore ways to develop Russia's underdeveloped regions.Russia's eastern region has been at the core of the country's ""balanced"" regional development scheme and its strategy to strengthen its geopolitical presence in East Asia and emerge as a fulcrum of global power and wealth.In this respect, South Korea, along with China and Japan, has been a crucial partner for Russia pursing an eastward policy, analysts pointed out.At the EEF, some 100 South Korean government officials and business leaders, which include Seoul's Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Joo Hyung-hwan, will be present to seek new business opportunities from Russia's efforts to develop its eastern region.","the upcoming summit with putin ,her summit diplomacy with russia ,said her trip to russia ,upcoming summit with putin ,upcoming summit with putin park","['Park Geun', 'Russia', 'Seoul', 'Moscow', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'vladivostok', 'russian', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Russia', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'Moscow', 'Beijing', 'Russia', 'Crimea', 'south korean', 'Ukraine', 'Putin', 'Russia', 'Moscow', 'North Korea', 'Nam Chang - hee', 'Inha University', ""South Korea 's"", 'Seongju', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'the United Nations Security Council', 'Putin', 'Park', 'north korean', 'Russia', 'Pyongyang', 'Russia', 'China', 'Park', 'Russia', 'Pyongyang', 'vladivostok', 'south korean', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Moscow', 'Pyongyang', 'Russia', 'the United States', ""South Korea 's"", 'Crimean', 'thaad', 'Russia', 'Ko Jae - nam', 'the Department of european and African Studies', 'Korea National Diplomatic Academy', 'Vladivostok', 'Putin', 'Russia', 'Russia', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Japan', 'Russia', 'EEF', 'south korean', ""Seoul 's Trade , Industry and Energy"", 'Joo Hyung - hwan', 'Russia']",12,"[ 0.          3.          0.         ... -0.42220077  0.46008402

The eight-member delegation arrived in the city on July 6 and discovered his absence as it was preparing to return to North Korea after the closing ceremony the night before the International Mathematical Olympiad at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Seoul’s Foreign Ministry declined to verify the news reports, citing rules based on concerns over defectors’ personal safety and diplomatic sensitivity. But a ministry official indirectly confirmed the student’s asylum, saying he will likely be sent to Seoul “after the controversy dies down.” Police have reportedly tightened security around the consulate in the Admiralty district of Hong Kong since then, including the placement of armed officers. Despite the student’s disappearance, the remainder of the team went back home on July 19 via Beijing, the South China Morning Post said. The Olympiad’s website listed Ri Myong-hyok and Jon Kum-song as North Korean gold medal winners and Choe Un-song, Han Yu-song, Kim Il-jin and Ri Jong-yol as silver medalists. The two Ris are believed to be 18 years old. The team came in sixth among the 109 countries that took part in the competition.Such defections have often taken place at South Korean missions, especially in Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand and Laos. But the latest case is unusual given that the student was part of an official delegation that followed a tightly choreographed schedule and close monitoring. This week, two workers at a North Korean restaurant in Malta were found to have defected last year, followed by a construction worker early this year. Last April, 13 staff members of a North Korean diner in the Chinese city of Ningbo arrived in Seoul. By Shin Hyon-hee","international math contest local news ,an international math contest local ,in an international math contest ,international math contest local ,seoul after the controversy dies","['north korean', 'South Korea ’s', 'Hong Kong', 'Ming Pao', 'north korean', 'the International Mathematical Olympiad', 'the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology', 'North Korea', 'the International Mathematical Olympiad', 'the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology', 'Seoul ’s Foreign Ministry', 'Seoul', 'Hong Kong', 'Beijing', 'the Olympiad ’s', 'Ri Myong - hyok', 'Jon Kum - song', 'north korean', 'Han Yu - song', 'Kim Il - jin', 'Ri Jong - yol', 'south korean', 'southeast asian', 'Thailand', 'Laos', 'north korean', 'Malta', 'north korean', 'chinese', 'Ningbo', 'Seoul', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",13,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.69687593  0.63860518

After visiting six enterprises here, three of the students sat with The Korea Herald for an interview on KAIST campus in northern Seoul to share their experiences and thoughts on Korea’s business environment. “I wanted to learn about Korean and Chinese companies’ strengths ,” said Handa Mayuka, a Japanese student doing an MBA course at Keio University. “Japanese  focus on details and academic solutions, while  Chinese are more interested in practical solutions. Koreans are balanced by pursuing both.” Handa Mayuka , Huang Dean-yuan and Pan Lei sit for an interview at the KAIST college of Business campus in Dongdamun-gu, Seoul. Pan Lei, a Chinese private banker pursuing an MBA at Tsinghua University, noted Korean companies’ globalization.“Chinese companies are big in size and mostly cater to customers in China because the market is big enough for them to grow,” Pan said. “But for Korean companies, the Korean market is not big enough, so I think they are much more globalized and tend to focus on business-to-business rather than business-to-customer marketing.” “We are different, but I think all the three countries share a similar work culture,” he said. “We are quick in setting a goal, making a decision and getting a task done as a team with one voice.” Huang Dean-yuan, a Taiwanese-Korean student doing a MBA course at KAIST, said he was impressed by Korea’s small companies aggressively expanding their sales channels. “I also learned that Korea’s small companies are flexible and offer work-and-life balance for their employees,” he added. The students offered ideas on how Korean companies can thrive further.“For Korean small companies not to be too reliant on large conglomerates, they should build their competitiveness and flexible work culture to attract competent laborers,” Handa said. Pan added, “It is important to achieve economies of scale to cut costs and make themselves powerful enough to compete on the world stage.” KAIST College of Business, which opened in 1995, is a Seoul-based graduate school affiliated with the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. The school has been ranked first in Asia five consecutive years based on the Financial Times rankings and provides part-time and full-time MBA programs in finance, IT, environment, corporate social responsibility and media.

The key is to understand the strengths and weaknesses of one’s own body and its organs, said Korean medicine professor Lee Young-jong from Gachon University. For instance, some people tend to sweat more than others during summer, which makes them lose energy easily. “But for certain people, sweating in fact does not affect their energy levels. So different food can help different people, according to their types and needs,” he explained.  Professor Lee Young-jong of Gachon University’s college of Korean Medicine. According to Korean traditional medicine, people are divided into four body types: “Tae-yang,” “Tae-eum,” “So-yang,” and “So-eum.” A visit to a traditional Korean clinic can help identify each type, but each category has some basic traits. Those who fall under “Tae-yang” have large lungs and a small liver, and they are also usually highly sociable and ambitious. Meanwhile, “Tae-eum” individuals have a large liver and small lungs, and they are thought to be reliable and conservative. Those who belong to “So-yang” have a large spleen and small kidneys, and they are often creative and emotional. Lastly, those who are “So-eum” have large kidneys and a small spleen, and they are usually organized, reserved and well-behaved. Professor Lee said those who are “So-eum” tend to lose energy once they sweat a lot. They also lose their appetite easily when they are stressed or tired. This is because they have small spleens and as a result, many of them have poor digestive systems. Lee recommended samgyetang and other warm chicken dishes in summer for such individuals. He also advised them not to consume cold food such as ice cream. Beef is known to boost energy for those who are the “Tae-eum” type, according to Korean medicine experts. Meanwhile, those who are “So-yang” tend to have a lot of heat within their bodies, due to their large spleens. Lee said this particular group is vulnerable to temperament problems during summer, as the hot weather is not compatible with their “already warm” organs. As they usually have strong digestive systems, consuming cold foods does not damage their health, he added. Lee recommended watermelons, vegetable juice and other Korean melons for them, as well as duck and pork. On the other hand, those who are “Tae-eum,” generally have weak respiratory systems, according to Lee. Hence, exercise that improves lung capacity, such as running, is recommended for them. Unlike the other types, sweating can be good for those who are “Tae-eum,” and many of them feel refreshed, rather than tired, afterward. Beef can also help strengthen their stomach and muscles. Porridge made of eels or Chinese yam, as well as walnuts are also recommended. Individuals who are “Tae-yang,” also contain a lot of heat within their bodies. They are especially vulnerable to nausea and even vomiting during summer. Lee recommended that they eat seafood, such as shrimps and sea cucumber, as well as buckwheat noodles.As for the popular Samgyetang, or ginseng chicken soup, Lee said that having the dish once during summer would not be harmful, but those who are “So-eum” benefit from the warm chicken soup the most. He also advised those who are “So-yang” and “Tae-eum” not to have this dish too frequently.

""Tourism officials  agreed on the trilateral project at their meeting in  Rason last Tuesday,"" Radio Free Asia quoted a tourism bureau official from the far eastern Chinese city of Hunchun, Jilin Province, as saying.The officials also agreed to make use of the North Korean ship as a tour boat that will cover a section of the route from the North Korean port of Rajin to Russia's Vladivostok, the radio said.Undated photo shows the North Korean ferry Mangyongbong anchored at the Japanese port of Niigata. The ship is likely to be used as a cruise ship on a China-North Korea-Russia tourist route next month. The tour will also link Rason to Hunchun in China, although what ship will be employed for this leg of the route has not been mentioned.After the meeting, the attendants inspected the interior facilities of the ship moored at the Rajin port. The 3,500-ton vessel will undergo a safety check, and start its pilot operation on Sunday, the broadcaster said. According to the accord, the Mangyongbong will leave Rajin at 11:00 p.m. , and arrive at Vladivostok the following morning after eight hours of sailing. Then the boat will depart at 4:00 p.m. and arrive at Rajin before dawn the following day, according to the media. The ship is scheduled to provide the service 10 times a month, it added.

The vessel reportedly has been remodeled of late to be used as a tour boat.Japan has banned the ship's entry into its port since 2006 as sanctions on Pyongyang's first nuclear test and missile launches that year.","reported tuesday tourism officials ,tour route next month washington ,last tuesday radio free asia ,russia tourist route next month ,korean ship as tour boat","['north korean', 'Mangyongbong', 'China', 'Russia', 'Washington', 'Rason', 'chinese', 'Hunchun', 'Jilin Province', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'Rajin', 'Russia', 'vladivostok', 'north korean', 'Mangyongbong', 'japanese', 'Niigata', 'China', 'Russia', 'Rason', 'Hunchun', 'China', 'Mangyongbong', 'Rajin', 'Rajin', 'commission', 'north korean', 'Wonsan', 'Japan', 'Niigata', 'Koreans', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Pyongyang']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47368735  0.65310323

""Preparations have been made to launch the foundation in the middle of July, and the plan now is to officially launch it next week,"" the source close to the matter told Yonhap News Agency on condition of anonymity.An 11-member preparatory committee was formed in late May to spearhead the opening of the envisioned foundation, which originally should have started work around the end of June. The committee has recently rented an office big enough to house about 30 staff members in western Seoul. It is likely to make an application for the launch of the foundation with the government in the days to come, another source said.The money promised by Japan has not been handed over to the foundation yet. A government official declined to comment on it, saying that what is more important is whether both sides will faithfully carry out what was agreed upon in the December deal.The deal reached on Dec. 28 has been hailed by the international community as a step in the right direction given that the comfort women issue has been a long-standing obstacle to ties between the two neighboring countries.Victims and liberal civic groups have accused the government of striking a deal lacking Japan's acknowledgment of legal responsibility. They also said the agreement was reached without prior consultation with the victims. Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese troops during World War II.

China's imports of ramyeon increased 65.5 percent in 2015 to $21.81 million from $13.37 million the previous year. Ramyeon sales are likely to increase more once China's import tariffs on the product are fully eliminated under the bilateral free trade agreement that took effect in December, the office said. The current tariff rate is 13.5 percent.Ramyeon has also earned customers in Malaysia. KMT Tradings, the exclusive importer and distributor of Nongshim's product in the country, said it now records an annual sales of 15 billion won . The company is regarded as a mid-size enterprise, having over 100 employees.KOTRA offices in Wuhan and Kuala Lumpur cite the different taste of Korean ramyeon as the source of its success, highlighting the tangy and spicy side of the food. The Kuala Lumpur office said the popularity of Korean pop music and dramas in the country helped create synergy and recommended that South Korean food exporters focus on getting halal certification for bigger market access to the country's Muslim population.Kimchi exports have sagged in traditional markets like Japan and Hong Kong, but it has picked up new customers in the United States and Australia. Korea exported $5.34 million worth of the fermented pickled cabbage to the United States last year, being used in various fusion dishes. For instance, it has been successfully mixed with tacos to add the spicy hot flavor. In Utah, food trucks selling Korean-style cup rice have received good customer reviews. Soups cooked with beef broth, made through long hours of boiling in low heat, have been described by local media as healthy slow food.According to the KOTRA office in Chicago, sales at Korean restaurants in the United States, estimated at $2.1 billion at present, are expected to grow 2.8 percent every year until 2021.Australians have also grown fonder of kimchi. Korea exported $2.27 million worth of the side dish to Australia last year, making it the fifth largest kimchi export market.Korea's bakery chains stand tall in China with menus developed to please local consumers. Paris Baguette, who opened its first Chinese store in Shanghai in 2004, now operates 134 shops in the country. Making its luxurious interior design and premium image its corporate trademark in China, the confectionery company fills 20 percent of its menu with locally developed products, including mango-laced and oil-rich breads.Tous Les Jour made a hit with its bread using red beans, another popular ingredient with Chinese customers.""China is the next biggest market after the United States in confectioneries, recording over 10 percent annual growth,"" KOTRA's Guangzhou office said. ""Customers in large cities care more about product freshness, store sanitation, taste, interior design and brand image than price,"" it said.  In Russia, the new interest has been on Korean-made frozen dumplings. Exports of the product to Russia last year reached $43,000, a 134 percent increase from the previous year.  ""Russia's Far East is geographically close to Korea, so quite a number of people there have tried frozen dumplings and are favorable to them,"" the trade body's office in Vladivostok said.","said monday korea instant noodles ,utah food trucks selling korean ,korea exported 27 million worth ,monday korea instant noodles ramyeon ,monday korea instant noodles","['korean', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Taiwan', 'chinese', 'China', 'the Korea Trade - Investment Promotion Agency', 'Wuhai', 'China', 'China', 'Malaysia', 'KMT Tradings', 'Nongshim', 'kotra', 'Wuhan', 'Kuala Lumpur', 'korean', 'Kuala Lumpur', 'korean', 'south korean', 'muslim', 'Kimchi', 'Japan', 'Hong Kong', 'the United States', 'Australia', 'Korea', 'the United States', 'Utah', 'korean', 'KOTRA', 'Chicago', 'korean', 'the United States', 'Korea', 'Australia', 'Korea', 'China', 'Paris Baguette', 'chinese', 'Shanghai', 'China', 'Tous Les Jour', 'chinese', 'the United States', 'KOTRA', 'Guangzhou', 'Russia', 'Korean', 'Russia', 'Russia', 'Korea', 'Vladivostok']",14,"[ 0.          0.          6.         ... -0.2442953   0.77701443

""Golden Blue is the only whisky brand that marked a two-digit growth for three consecutive years, while the domestic whisky market has been on a downturn over the past eight years,"" the company said.Golden Blue has imported an undiluted solution from Scotland and mixes different aged whiskies to create the desired flavors.Unlike a typical whisky with a Scotch label and 40 percent alcohol, the liquor in the dark blue bottle has 36.5 percent alcohol content and does not show its age on its package.Since its debut, Golden Blue has immediately made a splash in the market as younger consumers prefer low-alcohol whisky, and Scotch whisky fell out of favor amid the prolonged economic slowdown.","thursday golden blue homegrown whisky ,2009 by fledgling korean distiller ,thursday golden blue homegrown ,golden blue korean whisky with ,said thursday golden blue homegrown","['Golden Blue', 'korean', 'Golden Blue', 'korean', 'Busan', 'Golden Blue', ""Pernod Ricard 's"", 'Imperial', 'Diageo', 'the Korea Liquor Import Association', 'Golden Blue', 'Imperial', 'Golden Blue', 'Scotland', 'Scotch', 'Golden Blue', 'Scotch']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48655742  0.58149588

Korea has welcomed a growing influx of Muslim travelers thanks to the rising popularity of Korean pop culture and medical tourists from the Middle East.""The number of tourists from the Middle East has steadily increased with the help of the Korean Wave over the past years,"" the ministry said in a release. ""We have to enhance the tourism infrastructure to attract more tourists from the Middle East and Southeast Asian nations in the wake of the lifting of sanctions on Iran.""The number of Muslim tourists has risen from 540,000 in 2012 to 750,000 in 2014.

Currently, only 12 restaurants are officially certified by the Korea Muslim Federation, with eight located in Seoul. The state-run Korea Tourism Organization has introduced a guidebook on ""Muslim-friendly restaurants,"" but many of them are located in the Seoul metropolitan area.

To further draw tourists, the government will push for easing visa regulations for tourists from countries that don't have terrorist ties.

This will include organizing exchanges and meetings among industry players, academia, research institutes and the government to coordinate policies with business trends and technology. Immersive media, or “realistic media,” refers to next-generation media that provides exceptionally improved expression, clarity and a sense of reality that can be applied in broadcasting, movies and games, as well as graphics, display and other industries,  Choi explained.The smart media center will include 15 experts and two public officials who will cooperate to work on ways to create jobs in the field and attract investments to help the local economy, he added.Immersive media usually involves 3-D, ultrahigh definition technology and holograms. It is differentiated from other media in that it provides “immersion” and “presence” by integrating the way human eyes recognize visuals and experiences.Choi underscored the importance of the “human factor” in immersive media.“When people watch a 3-D video wearing 3-D glasses, many of them complain of their eyes getting tired or feeling nauseated. They therefore start to avoid such stereoscopic images, which lead to limited creation of contents and a stagnant industry,” Choi said.“In order to solve this, we must take human characteristics in consideration. This is why more research on the safety and effectiveness of immersive media services is all the more important.”As part of such efforts, Choi said it is crucial for the government to continue supporting education programs to foster experts in the field. There is also a need for wider research and development investment for software in the production, editing and distribution stages.

He is welcomed by a representative of a U.S.-based firm, who wastes no time in explaining his complaints and demands related to doing business in Korea.The translator opens his mouth, only to be stopped mid-sentence by the director.“Thanks, I’ll take it from here. I can speak English,” he says. He then goes on struggling to sustain a conversation with less-than-perfect, if not downright broken English.“It was a bizarre sight. He told me not to translate, and just write down the conversation,” said the in-house translator, who works for a government agency. He wished not to be identified. “Of the officials in high-ranking positions, people who think they speak English well enough are reluctant about using a translator, even though it is clear that they can benefit from professional assistance. This is because they feel compelled to appear as though they are fluent in English to save face,” he said.The incident, witnessed on several occasions by the translator, was a reminder of how fluency in English is considered a yardstick in one’s ability in studies, work and life.While many companies say they look past academic credentials when hiring new employees, most of them still require certified English scores with their applications.Even people already secure in their jobs are required to study English in order to move up the company ladder.A survey by YBM, a private education provider that also runs the Test of English for International Communication in Korea, showed that 87.6 percent of employees felt they needed to study English regardless of the type of work they do.The top reasons were “for their own development,” “to move to another job” or “to be promoted.”“More companies are requiring applicable English skills when looking for someone to promote, so a fairly high number of office workers are preparing for TOEIC and other certified English tests in parallel to working,” an YBM official said.Aside from promotions at work, English skills of prominent figures have often also become a topic of interest among Koreans.A video comparing the reaction to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s speech from native English speakers and Koreans went viral online a few years ago. The video, originally aired by the Educational Broadcasting System, had aimed to remind that the content of the speech -- not the native speaker-like pronunciation -- was vital to conversation.The program delved into different reactions among Koreans and English speakers, with the former being ruthless in judging Ban’s rather “candid” pronunciation of English.   U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon The public’s interest in Ban’s English skills and how fluent they thought he did or did not sound indeed acted as a testament to Koreans’ obsession over English and being absolutely perfect in it, right down to native-like intonation.English lecturer Jake K. Lee had even once said, “Koreans are perhaps the only people who take issue with the U.N. secretary-general’s  pronunciation.” While Ban’s case showed Koreans’ high standards in English, another case involving President Park Geun-hye showed high-ranking officials’ eagerness to show off their linguistic capacities.Since taking office, President Park Geun-hye has gained a reputation for giving speeches in the language of the country she visits. In her latest U.S. visit in 2015, she delivered three of a total of seven speeches at the U.N. in English.While her choice of language may have been out of courtesy to the host country or for efficiency, her aides wasted no time touting the president’s global competitiveness showcased through her -- albeit prewritten -- English speeches.The hype immediately prompted criticism, chiefly from opposition camps. Former lawmaker Kim Han-gil of the minor opposition People’s Party criticized the tendency, saying a leader using his or her mother tongue during speeches was a matter of national pride.The media and the general public, meanwhile, were entertained.Upon Park’s English speech to the joint session of U.S. Congress in 2013, for instance, search terms such as “Park Geun-hye,” “U.S. Congress” and “English speech” brought up scores upon scores of stories on Park’s English speeches.Among them were: “Park’s English speech applauded 41 times at the U.S. Congress ... Frantic reaction,” “Park’s English speech receives standing ovations,” “Park to stand at the U.S. Congress later today with an English speech,” “Park speaks English fluently at the Congress ... Applauded 40 times.”What the headlines didn’t describe was the content of the speech, which was her vision for peace in Northeast Asia.While these articles were featured in the “lighter” part of the news, it showed just how much the Korean media and the public are interested in fluent English speaking and whether such ability is approved by the audience of native speakers.The tendency to equate one’s English ability to one’s intellectual competence appears to derive mostly from the fact that English is often treated as an academic field that one must master, rather than a linguistic capacity as a tool, according to observers.English education in Korea can be traced back as far as the late 19th century, and has remained one of the key subjects since Seoul National University established English and English education majors in 1946. The Education Ministry’s report in February showed that of the 190,000 won  per month spent for private education on average by students, the greatest amount was devoted to studying English, at 80,000 won.Kim Chang-eun, the head of a Korean school in Yantai, China, said his curriculum is largely based on regular Korean educational curriculum, but devotes extra periods to foreign languages like English and Chinese. He explained that this is to assure that the students will be competent in entering university, including universities in Korea.The Korean curriculum’s extreme emphasis on the language is what many Koreans perceive as one of key demonstrations of the country’s obsession with English.“In school, ‘fluent English speaker’ would often mean ‘good student,’ as only the top students get to be any good in English,” said 31-year-old Hong, himself a graduate of English literature at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. “Students who excel in English would often stand out in class, even more so than students who did well in other subjects because it was seen as a rarer talent.” Some experts say a deeply rooted inferiority complex, admiration for English-speaking societies and the fixation on continuing the country’s industrialization with globalization may be factors behind the English craze.In the book “Korean and English,” author Gang Jun-man describes the deeply rooted English craze via 1930s advertisements in the Chosun Ilbo newspaper. “Old or young, if you don’t speak English, there is only darkness in today’s world” and “Those who do not know English are the losers of the society,” the ad copy read.Gang said English has been used as a means to gain power since colonial times, with many prominent figures using the language to move up the social ladder and top-tier universities adopting English tests for entrance exams even back then. The 1962 novel “Kapitan Lee” depicts an opportunistic protagonist who survives the turbulent years of Japanese occupation, liberation and division via studying Russian, then English. Korea’s earliest politicians, including former presidents Syngman Rhee and Yun Po-sun, were fluent English speakers.The previous Lee Myung-bak administration upped the emphasis on English education, with some such as right-leaning novelist Bok Geo-il saying Korea should make English an official language. The proponents of the wider use of English have said it would enhance the “international competence” of Koreans.But Kim Young-myung, a professor of social science at Hallym University and an advocate of Hangeul use, harshly opposed the move, saying it appeared as “thoughtless worshipping of the outside power.” He pointed out in his column that there was no substantial evidence that a society’s collective English-speaking ability leads to competence. While advocates of wider English use stresses “globalization,” there is more to globalization than just speaking the language, he wroteThe obsession over English and the consequent social expectations have led to English being a coveted trait, especially among those in the higher positions. The aforementioned translator said that high-ranking officials who tried to flaunt their insufficient English skills often ended up misleading the entire discussion with their foreign counterparts.“It appears to be fine from an outside point of view. Because this person holds a prominent position , the foreigner would not be overly aggressive in the conversation. He or she would just move on from a misunderstood or not-really-answered questions,” he said.“The official himself would think that the conversation is going well, which is frustrating from my standpoint. He is actually risking the interest of the organization he is representing in order to protect his ‘elite’ status.”Kim Doh-yeon, president of Pohang University of Science and Technology, pointed out in his recent column that many majors in science and engineering are “wasting time” studying English when they don’t really need to.“Ninety percent of the people will face the necessity to speak English only once or twice a year. ... Yet, the English studying becomes a burden to us all because the society, for some reason, believes that English speaking ability is a barometer to an individual’s intellectual capacity,” he wrote.“English is merely a means of communication, not a tool to assess one’s abilities. We should discard the ‘myth’ that only people who speak English well are the elite.”By Yoon Min-sik","of commerce walks into conference ,studying russian then english korea ,business in korea the translator ,english fluently at the congress ,observers english education in korea","['Korea', 'YBM', 'Korea', 'TOEIC', 'YBM', 'Koreans', 'U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon ’s', 'Koreans', 'the Educational Broadcasting System', 'Koreans', 'english', 'Ban ’s', 'U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Ban ’s', 'Koreans', 'Jake K.

Korean painter Lee U-fan reconfirms authenticity of paintings suspected of being fake,"Renowned South Korean artist Lee U-fan confirmed Thursday once again that he did paint all 13 paintings that are suspected of being forgeries.In a press briefing in central Seoul, the artist said the paintings in question were his work beyond a doubt.""I checked them with my own eyes and they are certainly all mine judging from their breath, rhythm and colors,"" the artist said.He continued: ""Breath and rhythm are like...","Renowned South Korean artist Lee U-fan confirmed Thursday once again that he did paint all 13 paintings that are suspected of being forgeries.In a press briefing in central Seoul, the artist said the paintings in question were his work beyond a doubt.""I checked them with my own eyes and they are certainly all mine judging from their breath, rhythm and colors,"" the artist said.He continued: ""Breath and rhythm are like fingerprints, which no one can copy. A third person, however talented the person might be, can't do exactly like the artist does.""An artist would know if a certain painting is an authentic work of his or hers within a minute. My paintings, in particular, are very simple so it is easily noticeable if not authentic.""He made the same argument on Wednesday when he appeared at theSeoul Metropolitan Police Agency for an investigation. Police began looking into the forgery scandal last year when they were tipped off from someone in the art circle that counterfeits of Lee's signature paintings such as ""From Dots"" and ""From Lines"" worth billions of won or millions of US dollars had been circulated in galleries in Seoul's Insa-dong neighborhood from 2012 to 2013.They have since arrested the owners of the galleries suspected of circulating the alleged counterfeits and commissioned the National Forensic Service and civilian experts to analyze whether the 13 works they seized from the galleries are forgeries or not.Both sides then confirmed them as counterfeits after comparing them with six of Lee's authentic works.Earlier this month, a 66-year-old gallery owner was indicted on forgery and fraud charges for allegedly earning 1.3 billion won by selling counterfeits of three of Lee's works, including ""From Point."" The man identified by his surname Hyun admitted to having forged the paintings during police questioning.Lee said, however, he immediately knew that those paintings were his during his first visit to police, but he took some time just in case. The next day, he came back to police and told them that all the 13 paintings were his work.He vented his frustration on the way the police investigated the on-going forgery scandal. He said he was only able to see the paintings by himself nearly a year after the police had launched the investigation despite his repeated requests to do so.""When the artist is alive, his or her opinions should be given priority, which is common sense in other countries. I can't really understand why police ignored this and asked ambiguous experts and the National Forensic Service to verify the authenticity. Moreover, they released the investigation result to the press first, not me.""Lee also claimed that police tried to make a deal by telling him to admit that four of the works are forgeries. He said police made his lawyer leave the room in the process, closeting him with an investigator. Police immediately denied Lee's claim, saying they only tried to persuade him to be honest, free from his prestige as an artist. They said a one-on-one talk is an often used tactic to draw sincere statements from a testifier.""I asked Lee to have a private conversation as I wanted to hear honest words,"" said the investigator who was in charge of the interrogation. ""I thought there could be some external pressure put on him as he said all the works are genuine articles just 10 seconds after looking at them.""During the briefing, Lee said ""I am the painter"" several times in frustration. Asked about the presence of serial numbers, he said, ""I was so poor at that time and my paintings weren't in high demand. I didn't put a serial number on each painting. All I did was paint.""","did paint all 13 paintings ,paint all 13 paintings that ,the 13 paintings were his ,paint all 13 paintings ,forged the paintings during police","['south korean', 'Lee U - fan', 'Seoul', 'theSeoul Metropolitan Police Agency', 'Lee', 'Seoul', 'the National Forensic Service', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'the National Forensic Service', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Lee']",6,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.69047111 -0.12939382

The event took place in S-Plex Center in northwestern Sangam-dong in Seoul and featured about 100 3-D printers.  Participants explain their model in a prototype demonstration to a judge during Seoul City’s hackathon event at S-Plex Center in Seoul on Sunday. Kim Da-sol/The Korea HeraldUnder the theme “Make Seoul Better,” the 30-hour hackathon hosted by the Seoul Metropolitan Government was attended by some 100 teams, who vied to find solutions and create business models to solve urban issues in Seoul.Kim, a sophomore student at Gachon University’s IT college, heads the one-man startup Lapis, which manufactures and distributes 3-D printer components. He participated in the hackathon as a mentor for 3-D printing and modeling. Among the prototypes produced by 3-D printers included a box that contained motion-detecting sensors to be installed at the doorsteps of houses and a plastic installation stand for commuters to be able to swipe their traffic cards before getting on buses.3-D printers installed during the ‘Make Seoul Better’ hackathon from Saturday to Sunday. Kim Da-sol/The Korea HeraldA hackathon -- a word that combines “hack” and “marathon” -- is an event where computer programmers and software developers come together for intensive discussions and projects. On Saturday, each team was given tasks such as making prototypes and suggesting practical products or new services based on technology. These were related to issues in Seoul across topics such as welfare, environment, tourism, health and transportation. Many teams presented their ideas with products made from the 3-D printers.The Seoul Metropolitan Government said that the event worked as an opportunity to explore technological proposals involving innovative products, policies and programs.Industry experts and judges from various fields also participated to support the teams that were made up of college students and start-up members. “There are a lot of great thinking and global opportunities in Korea,” Arnold Chung, a professor of International Business from Kookmin University told The Korea Herald. He participated at the event as one of the judges.Professor Chung added that hackathon events would continue to expand in Korea and will grow to cover life sciences, biomedical science and agriculture.The top prize was awarded to a team comprised of foreign students from Sungkyunkwan University for their creation of a water saving system that involved installing a washstand on top of public urinals. The Seoul Metropolitan Government said the city government will provide the award-winning 15 teams with up to 1.3 million won  to authorize their patents, in addition to covering 200 million won of research and development cost. The City added that they will also support them in proceeding with patent registration and business set-ups.“I am very impressed by the passion that participants showed for today’s event,” said Mayor Park Won-soon while walking around the tables of participants who were adding the finishing touches to their prototypes before the presentation. “We hope to continuously find answers to urban issues through citizens’ participation and seek ways to turn them into real business models,” he added.Sun Hahm, one of the participants of team Pedegraph from the U.S. said having showed their idea and business model at a hackathon was “just a beginning.”“ we are going to continue working on our project and work on our flaws based on the feedback we got today,” Hahm said. His team had presented an idea to have motion sensors installed around crowded crossroads -- such as those in Gangnam -- so they can detect traffic flows on a real-time basis and send data to a mobile application that allows users to avoid possible traffic or empty paths at night. Joo Hyoung-cheol from Seoul Business Agency under the Seoul City said that they have witnessed how gatherings like this can provide creative solutions for urban issues through technology.“We also saw possibilities of bright ideas from foreign teams, which we think we will attract more business models and ideas from outside Korea,” he said.

The main branch in Lotte Department Store in Myeongdong renovated the food court on the 12th floor into duty-free space to accommodate more cosmetic and perfume brands and reopened last week. Lotte Duty Free said it aims to raise 2.78 trillion won  in sales at the main outlet ranging four floors this year.The renewal was timed in the closure of another duty-free store at Lotte World Tower in southern Seoul.  Travelers shop at the newly opened duty-free floor in Lotte Department Store in downtown Seoul on June 27.The duty-free store located in the 123-story skyscraper, which generated 611.2 billion in sales in 2015, ended operations on Monday after it failed to renew its license in a November bid. Lotte, the world's No. 3 duty-free operator, also faces tougher competition as local retailers have opened several new outlets in Seoul to court deep-pocketed Chinese travelers amid the flagging domestic consumption. Shinsegae Department Store last month opened a new duty-free store in Myeongdong next to Lotte's main outlet, fueling competition in the highly coveted area. To cater for the growing needs of travelers, the Seoul government plans to issue four new operating licenses for duty-free stores within this year. Lotte is one of the strong candidates by capacity, but it remains unclear whether Lotte World Tower can get a second chance in the upcoming competition as prosecutors have looked into lobbying allegations linked with its duty-free unit.  Shin Young-ja, the head of Lotte Foundation and daughter of group founder Shin Kyuk-ho, has been under probe on suspicions of receiving kickbacks from the chief of cosmetic brand Nature Republic in return for favorable space in duty-free shops.Hotel Lotte, the hotel and duty-free operator unit of Lotte Group, had to cancel its planned initial public offering earlier this month as prosecutors have widened their investigation into the nation's fifth-largest conglomerate over slush fund allegations.","in downtown seoul on june ,lotte duty free korea largest ,downtown seoul on june ,reopened last week lotte duty ,downtown seoul on june 27","['Lotte Duty Free', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Lotte Department Store', 'Myeongdong', 'Lotte Duty Free', 'Seoul', 'Lotte Department Store', 'Seoul', 'Lotte', 'Seoul', 'chinese', 'Shinsegae Department Store', 'Myeongdong', 'Lotte', 'Seoul', 'Lotte', 'Lotte World Tower', 'Shin Young - ja', 'Lotte Foundation', 'Shin Kyuk - ho', 'Nature Republic', 'Hotel Lotte', 'Lotte Group']",4,"[ 0.          6.          1.         ... -0.24804166  0.32920626

Construction is expected to be completed within 12-14 months, according to the Korea International Cooperation Agency.The institute will be tasked with studying techniques related to packaging, processing, storage and others deemed to be critical to improving the yields and productivity of farming products after being harvested.Myanmar is known for its large amount of farmland that produces many different fruits and vegetables. Lack of know-how and sophisticated techniques, however, has been cited as a major problem that drives down its overall productivity.The research center, if completed, will be the first of its kind built in the country.KOICA, a major aid group under the wing of South Korea's foreign ministry, plans to inject US$4.5 million to help construct facilities and to supply the equipment and training necessary to operate the institute. The Myanmarese government is providing land, workers and other administrative support.""On behalf of the agriculture ministry and the government, I would like to express my great appreciation to KOICA for providing$4.5 million and much other support to make it possible to build this institute that deals with the most important thing in the farming sector,"" Farming and Livestock Minister Aung Thu said in a speech.

It is also in such ethnic zones that Chinese immigrants tend to search for an affordable home in their new country.These tight-knit foreign communities are also found in other areas of the city, including the Vietnamese town in Wangsimni, Nepalese town in Changsin-dong and Mongolian town in Gwanghui-dong. In Itaewon is an Islamic town stretching down the alleys and in Hyehwa-dong a Filipino community market is held every weekend.The Jongno-gu district office once tried to close down the Filipino market, citing pedestrian inconvenience, but has now turned to protecting the event -- not only for the sake of nostalgic immigrants, but also for the tourist attraction for visitors.The immigrant towns started to appear here back in 1985, when a group of French people living in Seoul gathered near Banpo-dong after the French International School relocated its building in the neighborhood. The Seorae Village, meaning “those coming from the West,” has since then been dubbed “Little France.”The number of foreign residents in these regional clusters is quickly burgeoning. According to Yeongdeungpo-gu, where one of the biggest Chinatowns is located, at least 66,000 Chinese residents were tallied to live in the district as of last year. An alley in Jayang-dong near Konkuk University in Seoul shows a row of Chinese restaurants. Kim Seung-su, 28, says that the increasing variety of ethnic food alleys is a big attraction for Koreans who wish to “experience the original taste of foreign countries.”“I came across a Sichuan-style pork dish in Daerim-dong in Yeongdeungpo-gu, very similar to one I tasted when I was in southwestern China,” Kim told The Korea Herald with his mouth watering.“I am thrilled to have access to all these original dishes from different parts of the world here in Seoul.”According to mobile app Poing, a restaurant app for foodies in Seoul, the soaring Thai, Philippine and Vietnamese restaurants have been garnering popularity especially among women in their 20s and 30s. Poing showed that at least 98 such restaurants are scattered around the capital.But with the rising popularity, the destinations have also become increasingly exposed to crimes.The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency said Sunday it would designate an alley in Jayang-dong in Gwangjin-gu near Konkuk University as a special safety zone, making it the fourth such district after Daerim-dong, Garibong-dong and Itaewon.The “lamb skewers alley” in Jayang-dong has become notorious for the increasing frequency of thefts, blackmail and frauds by Chinese immigrants residing in the vicinity. “ I am worried about the low security level, so avoid going to those areas at night,” said 28-year-old Lu Han-yen, a Chinese student who has been living in Seoul for five years.Officials said they are set to tighten their regular patrol, as well as the inspections of suspicious passersby. Supervision on prostitution will also be reinforced.Some, however, point out that intensified police supervision may not be an appropriate solution to the security issue in foreign towns.“I think that the measure may be discriminatory against foreign residents in the corresponding areas,” Pao Yuan Chang, a 33-year-old Chinese-Korean, told The Korea Herald.Police argued that the proportion of crimes by foreigners in these areas under police control is in fact on a downturn, contrary to general wariness.According to police data, foreign criminals in special safety zones of Seoul stood at 27.7 percent last year, down from 30.8 percent in 2013 and 29.9 percent in 2014.By Kim Da-sol","district chinatown for exotic menus ,chinatown for exotic menus featuring ,chinatown for exotic menus ,app for foodies in seoul ,many seoulites visit to daerim","['Daerim - dong', 'Yeonnam - dong', 'chinese', 'vietnamese', 'Wangsimni', 'nepalese', 'Changsin - dong', 'mongolian', 'Gwanghui - dong', 'islamic', 'Filipino', 'french', 'Seoul', 'Banpo - dong', 'the French International School', 'the Seorae Village', 'France', 'Chinatowns', 'chinese', 'Jayang - dong', 'Konkuk University', 'Seoul', 'chinese', 'Kim Seung - su', 'Koreans', 'Daerim - dong', 'China', 'Kim', 'the Korea Herald', 'Seoul', 'Poing', 'Seoul', 'Thai', 'philippine', 'vietnamese', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency', 'Jayang - dong', 'Gwangjin', 'Konkuk University', 'Daerim - dong', 'Garibong - dong', 'Itaewon', 'Jayang - dong', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'Seoul', 'Yuan Chang', 'chinese - Korean', 'the Korea Herald', 'Seoul', 'Kim Da - sol']",11,"[ 0.          6.          0.         ... -0.72474527  0.69379783

Partial repair works will also be subsidized by up to 10 million won.The support will be wider for the building of hanok in areas designated as hanok preservation sites, going up to 150 million won. Up to 180 million won in subsidies will be offered for comprehensive repair work. The evaluation process for the subsidies will also be simplified, such as by removing vague terms such as “preferably” or “as possible,” the city said.In considering eligibility for the support fund, the city will provide basic requirements for maintaining the traditional architecture of the hanok, such as in designing and building the roof, exterior surface and fence walls. “It is hoped that with the revised evaluation standards, we can secure consistency and shorten the time in the review process,” said Jeong Yoo-seung from the city’s housing construction bureau.Earlier this month, the city designated five areas in Bukchon, Seochon, Insa-dong, Donhwamunro in Jongno district and Seonjamdanji in Seongbuk district as hanok preservation sites.In these areas, only construction of hanok is permitted.

The institute will pour 18.5 billion won  into the construction project.The establishment of the primate breeding colony is aimed at mass-producing resources of high-quality, specific pathogen-free nonhuman primates to address South Korea's increasing demand for such animals.South Korea has relied entirely on imports for its nonhuman primate needs as it faces a high demand for the animals required for the testing of pharmaceutical products and vaccines, research on pandemics such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and brain research.The facility plans to introduce mother nonhuman primates in phases and come up with a system to mass-breed them before providing domestic access to them without relying on imports.It has drawn up a plan to supply 50 nonhuman primates to related laboratories by 2021 and 700, which is half of the country's demand, by 2025.Chang Kyu-tae, chief of the institute, said there has been concern over industrial technologies being drawn out of the country as many companies have asked overseas bodies to test new drugs on nonhuman primates.""We hope the domestic supply of nonhuman primates will contribute to the country's development of new drugs and vaccines and its clinical research on anti-aging, brain science and regenerative medicine,"" Chang said.","tank on biotechnology said thursday ,biotechnology held groundbreaking ceremony ,new drugs on nonhuman primates ,biotechnology held groundbreaking ceremony to ,and biotechnology held groundbreaking ceremony","['Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology', ""South Korea 's"", 'South Korea', '2025.Chang Kyu - tae', 'Chang']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.16326238  0.6617282

Some South Korean medical institutions have already set up operations there. They include two liaison offices to attract UAE patients to South Korea, one rehabilitation center, one neurosurgery facility and one general hospital. “We have secured a bridgehead to spread the superiority of our infertility treatment technology to the Middle East and other parts of the world,” said Kim Tae-kyung, vice chief of Cheil hospital.The hospital, launched in 1963, is the first medical institution in South Korea dedicated to women.The hospital currently operates 16 departments and 32 specialized clinics including a state-of-the-art Mother and Baby Center, providing the country’s largest medical facility related to pregnancy, birth, infant care and obstetric ultrasonography. It is particularly renowned for high-tech labs dedicated to research in endocrinology, genetics, and infertility.Al Garhoud Hospital has been enjoying positive review since its opening, including receiving a certification from the U.S. Joint Commission International in 2013 for its ultramodern system and services.

Another 12 countries will also dispatch delegations of high-level defense officials to the meeting. Observers said that North Korea will be a prominent topic at the meeting since this year's dialogue comes as the international community is trying to rein in the country’s defiant pursuit of nuclear weapons. They add that China's relentless territorial claims to the South China Sea may also feature dominantly, as it did last year, especially since several Southeast Asian countries along with the United States and Japan have been opposed to what they see as Beijing's territorial expansionism.South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-koo, who is set to fly into Singapore in the afternoon, is scheduled to deliver a speech at a plenary session on Saturday where he will call for increased and concerted international efforts to deter North Korea's nuclear weapons ambition.He will also stress the need for all members to follow through with a recent United Nations Security Council sanction adopted in March in retaliation for Pyongyang's nuclear test in January and long-range missile test the next month.

The technological advance could eventually reduce the heavy reliance on internal combustion engines that produce greenhouse gases, largely responsible for global warming.","thursday to further facilitate startups ,creative economy following her summit ,french tech hub in seoul ,both sides select five startups ,seoul in march to help","['south korean', 'Park Geun', 'South Korea', 'France', 'Seoul', 'european', 'french', 'Francois Hollande', 'France', 'the French Tech Hub', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'France', 'South Korea', 'France', 'Seoul', 'Paris', 'south korean', 'french', 'french', 'South Korea', 'ICT', 'french', 'South Korea ’s', 'Park', 'Seoul', 'Paris', 'French Air Liquide S.A.', 'South Korea ’s', 'Hyundai Motor Co.', 'Hyundai', 'Tucson']",5,"[ 0.          4.          0.         ... -0.54433411  0.87725329

North Korea watchers said the forthcoming convention may have been timed to come shortly after the Workers' Party of Korea congress in May so as to allow the country to drum up support from the youth so they can become the main support base for the current leader.""The move is aimed at opening a new era for Kim Jong-un on the basis of support from the young generation,"" Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies, said.","of korea congress in may ,youth league held on monday ,korea will hold youth congress ,meeting on monday the kcna ,korea congress in may","['North Korea', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Kim Il - sing', 'Socialist Youth League', 'Congress', 'Pyongyang', 'Korean Central News Agency', 'North Koreans', 'Kim Il - sing', ""the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea"", 'Kim Jong - il', 'KCNA', 'North Korea', ""the Workers ' Party of Korea"", 'Kim Jong - un', 'Yang Moo - jin', 'the University of North Korean Studies']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59733158  0.4242124

The program also allows local people to experience South Korean culture.   Nine South Korean doctors and nurses will join hands with 10 Ugandan counterparts to provide basic medical services to about 150 local people near Mpigi, according to South Korean officials.   South Korea said it plans to provide the Korea Aid program for Ugandans once or twice a month.   In Mpigi, Park and Museveni also met with several dozen village leaders across Uganda in an opening ceremony of facilities meant to train local people on agriculture and Seoul's ""Saemaul Undong"" or new community movement.   The rural development program, initiated by Park's father, then-President Park Chung-hee in the 1970s, is credited with helping modernize the then-rural South Korean economy.   ""As a close friend of Uganda and a partner of Saemaul Undong, South Korea will always be on that path with Uganda,"" Park said in the opening ceremony.   Park left for Kenya, the third stop on her swing through Africa, later in the day after wrapping up her state visit to Uganda -- the first since South Korea and Uganda established diplomatic relations in 1963. The trip already took her to Ethiopia.","yoweri museveni launched south korea ,program for uganda on monday ,korean doctors and nurses will ,uganda in an opening ceremony ,latest sign of seoul commitment","['Park Geun', 'Ugandan', 'Yoweri Museveni', ""South Korea 's"", 'Uganda', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'Park', 'Museveni', 'Uganda', 'south korean', 'south korean', 'Mpigi', 'south korean', 'South Korea', 'Korea Aid', 'Ugandans', 'Mpigi', 'Park', 'Museveni', 'Uganda', 'Seoul', 'Saemaul Undong', 'Park', 'Park Chung - hee', 'south korean', 'Uganda', 'Saemaul Undong', 'South Korea', 'Uganda', 'Park', 'Kenya', 'Uganda', 'South Korea', 'Uganda', 'Ethiopia']",5,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.32262218  0.86632818

It did not specify the date of the game."" expressed great satisfaction over the successful game they played with deep friendship, displaying admirable technique,"" the KCNA said.The North's team won the game 82-73 after earlier beating China's team twice, it said.In September 2013, Kim, known as an avid basketball fan, watched an exhibition basketball game in Pyongyang with former NBA star Dennis Rodman.The basketball game between North Korea and China was held as their ties have been frayed amid the North's continued nuclear and missile tests.South Korea's unification ministry declined Monday to give its assessment of Pyongyang's move to hold the basketball game with China.But experts said that it could be a sign that the two countries may be attempting to see how willing the other side is to mend fences.The exhibition game was held less than one month after Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory message to Kim over his election as the ruling party's chairman.""North Korea appears to be sending a message to China that it is also willing to improve ties with Beijing ,"" said Chang Yong-seok, a researcher at Seoul National University's Institute for Peace and Unification Studies.Kim's latest move marked his first public activity related to China since July 2013, when he visited the cemetery of Chinese soldiers buried in North Korea who fought in the 1950-53 Korean War.But analysts said that it would be difficult to expect the improvement of Pyongyang-Beijing ties and Kim's possible visit to China in the imminent future.""To this end, North Korea should show its sincerity toward denuclearization or at least freeze its nuke program,"" said Kim Heung-kyu, head of the China Policy Institute under Ajou University. ""Without this effort, it would be hard for the two countries to anticipate better relations.""Last year, signs of better ties between the North and its traditional ally, China emerged as Beijing sent its ranking party official Liu Yunshan to the ceremony to celebrate the 70th founding anniversary of the ruling Workers' Party in October.But the prospect for their ties has become murky since the North's all-female propaganda group Moranbong Band abruptly canceled its December concert in Beijing hours before it was supposed to begin.A diplomatic source said China had decided to send officials of lower rank to the concert in response to the North's leader Kim hinting that Pyongyang had developed a hydrogen bomb.","exhibition basketball game in pyongyang ,friendly basketball match between north ,pyongyang with former nba star ,avid basketball fan watched an ,watched the friendly basketball match","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'chinese', 'Kim', ""North Korea 's"", 'Sobaeksu', 'chinese', 'Choe Ryong - hae', 'the Korean Central News Agency', 'KCNA', 'China', 'Kim', 'Pyongyang', 'NBA', 'Dennis Rodman', 'North Korea', 'China', ""South Korea 's"", 'Pyongyang', 'China', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'Kim', 'Korea', 'China', 'Beijing', 'Chang Yong - seok', ""Seoul National University 's Institute for Peace and Unification Studies"", 'Kim', 'China', 'chinese', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Kim', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Kim Heung - kyu', 'the China Policy Institute', 'Ajou University', 'China', 'Beijing', 'Liu Yunshan', ""Workers ' Party"", 'Moranbong Band', 'Beijing', 'China', 'Kim', 'Pyongyang']",17,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.31904396  0.58909804

But for 54-year-old housewife Kim Young-mi, deep-fried chicken was once a special treat her late father used to bring home on payday or for special occasions in her childhood. “It was when Korea was poor and meat was scarce,” she said. “I gave most of the chicken to my younger brother and sister, but it was still one of the best moments in my childhood.”Today, it is not easy to find the old-fashioned deep-fried chicken she used to have, she noted, with chicken joints continuously experimenting with diverse recipes to cater to shifting consumer tastes.Back in the 1950s and ’60s, the most common way of cooking a whole chicken in Korea was to boil it with rice and ginseng, a dish called samgyetang. The birth of the deep fried chicken dates back to the late 1960s when Myeongdong Yeongyang Center in Seoul began to sell the whole chicken grilled in an electric oven. The nongreasy, crunchy yet tender fried chicken started to become a common staple in the 1970s in line with the nation’s economic growth, emergence of cooking oil and vast improvement in chicken farming. The first modern-day fried-chicken joint Lims Chicken, owned and run by Shinsegae Department Store, was established in 1977. The popularity of the fried chicken in Korea soared further upon arrival of American chain Kentucky Fried Chicken in 1984. In 1982, the chicken chains started to put their own spins on the fried chicken, with Pelicana Chicken in 1982 starting to coat the chicken in hot and sweet sauce, now famously called “yangnyeom  chicken.” It was the first such recipe in the world.The competition in the chicken industry grew in the 1990s as the nation’s fast food chain Lotteria joined the bandwagon. BBQ Chicken, the nation’s best-selling chicken brand, has reaped a success since its opening during the Asian financial crisis in 1997 by promoting an idea of fried chicken delivered to the door.What sets Korean-style fried chicken apart from America’s variety with thick, well-seasoned crust, is that Korean fried chicken is fried at least twice, which makes it extra crispy. In the 2000s, Korean chains started to add different flavors to the chicken using diverse seasoning ranging from barbecue and hot-pepper sauce with toppings including spring onions, cheese and garlic. “American-style fried chicken has less variety of flavors, but it usually has more meat instead of bones,” said Christopher Cashel-Cordo, a 27-year-old English teacher from the U.S., indicating that Korean fried chicken is much smaller than its American counterpart. “I definitely like a combo of chicken and beer. There are more and better flavors here.” Fried chicken is thought to originate from Soul Food, a term used for an ethnic cuisine traditionally prepared and eaten by the African-American community, during the slavery period. African slaves were given only off-cuts of meat from their masters to be fried and eaten to maximize the calorie intake, which they seasoned and added spices to enrich the flavor to invent the American-style fried chicken.

Every year over 10 million tourists visit Jeju from home and abroad. Jeju is designated as a world natural heritage site and a biosphere by UNESCO. Recently, it was also voted as one of the new Seven Wonders of the World.Perhaps a lesser known but no less important fact is that it is also an “island of world peace,” and every spring, thousands of people gather to talk about peace and prosperity. This annual gathering, the Jeju Forum for Peace and Prosperity, is attended by some of the biggest names in Asia and around the world, including former and current heads of state, CEOs of global conglomerates, and renowned scholars. But it is also a gathering for everyone and anyone who cares about peace. Almost 30 years ago, when the Cold War was drawing to a close, then newly elected President of South Korea Roh Tae-woo introduced “Nordpolitik.” Under the new doctrine, South Korea would reach out to countries it had previously considered enemies. It would seek to normalize diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and China. The ultimate target was, of course, North Korea. South Korea’s efforts paid off. In September 1990, South Korea and the Soviet Union normalized their relations. The following year, then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev was mindful of North Korea, and suggested that the summit be held away from Seoul and away from North Korea. As a result, Jejudo was chosen.The Roh-Gorbachev summit not only contributed to ending the Cold War, it also started a community-wide movement to turn Jejudo into an “island of peace.” In April 1996, former President Kim Young-sam and former U.S. President Bill Clinton had a summit in Jejudo, followed by a summit between former President Kim and then Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. China’s former President Jiang Zemin also visited Jejudo and famously played the piano there. The Jeju Forum for Peace and Prosperity, which began in 2001, aims to promote peace through dialogue and achieve prosperity through cooperation. In essence, the Jeju Forum continues and expands the tradition of summit meetings to discuss peace among friends and former adversaries. In 2005, the Korean government officially designated Jejudo as an “Island of World Peace.”In this time of heightened tensions in the region, one may argue that “peace through dialogue” is too idealistic. But existing “realist” mechanisms in Northeast Asia are becoming increasingly costly and irrelevant. For instance, the ROK-US alliance is becoming increasingly irrelevant in deterring the North from cyber or nuclear attacks on the South or even on the United States. The North has already launched successful cyberattacks on South Korean and U.S. targets. A capable North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile or submarine-launched ballistic missile that can reach a U.S. mainland target will cast doubt on the credibility of the U.S. nuclear umbrella and the essence of the alliance. Not only that, even an effective ROK-U.S. alliance is unable to force the North to denuclearize or provide an incentive to implement a regime change. On the contrary, past behavior by the North indicates that a stronger alliance is likely to harden its stance. In addition, efforts by the ROK-U.S. alliance against the North agitate China and deepen the security dilemma for the South. Indeed, it is time for fresh new approaches.This is where the Jeju Forum can come in. From its very origin as a regional, multilateral security dialogue, the forum has been serving as a venue where new ideas for peace and prosperity have been proposed, discussed, and shared. This year’s forum will also do just that. Thousands of participants from over 60 countries will gather and discuss Asia’s new order -- and disorder -- and explore ways to develop a cooperative leadership. May is a great month to visit Jejudo. Come to Jejudo for its beauty and also to find peace.Han In-taek is director of research at the Jeju Peace Institute, which organizes the Jeju Forum for Peace and Prosperity.","10 million tourists visit jeju ,million tourists visit jeju ,year over 10 million tourists ,10 million tourists visit ,million tourists visit jeju from","['Han', 'Jejudo Island', 'Jeju', 'Jeju', 'UNESCO', 'South Korea', 'Roh Tae - woo', 'South Korea', 'the Soviet Union', 'China', 'North Korea', 'South Korea ’s', 'South Korea', 'the Soviet Union', 'soviet', 'Mikhail Gorbachev', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'Roh - Gorbachev', 'Kim Young - sam', 'U.S.', 'Bill Clinton', 'Kim', 'japanese', 'Ryutaro Hashimoto', 'China', 'Jiang Zemin', 'korean', 'ROK', 'US', 'the United States', 'south korean', 'U.S.', 'north korean', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'ROK', 'U.S.', 'ROK', 'U.S.', 'North', 'China', 'Han', 'the Jeju Peace Institute']",18,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.13076746  1.0876472

The symposium was renamed the “Jeju Forum for Peace and Prosperity” in 2011, and has since grown in size and scope to go beyond its focus on international relations and security, encompassing diverse subjects linked to global businesses, environment, women, education and culture.This year, around half of the forum’s 70 scheduled sessions will be dedicated to international relations and security, including nuclear security, the Northeast Asia Peace Initiative and sustainable development goals. The other half will focus on important topics regarding the international economy, renewable energy, climate change and women’s rights.KH: What sets Jeju Forum apart from other international forums?Moon: While the Davos-based World Economic Forum and China’s Boao Forum for Asia mainly focus on international business and management, Korea’s Jeju Forum has its roots in the international relations and security front. Compared to the WEF, the Jeju Forum still has a long way to go in terms of international recognition and influence. It is similar to the Boao Forum in that it is organized by a private institution, but it receives active support from the government. I believe that the Jeju Forum can play an integral role in dealing with various global issues as a “Track 1.5” diplomatic forum that invites both the public and private sectors to participate in multilateral dialogue and discussion.KH: What efforts are being made to add more diversity to the Jeju Forum?Moon: Initially founded as part of the government’s aim to promote Jejudo Island as an “Island of World Peace,” the forum has so far mainly focused on discussing global peace-related issues. However, it is increasingly becoming difficult to mark clear boundaries in the session topics today, as diverse issues such as low growth, climate change, terrorism, infectious disease and cybersecurity all overlap and influence one another across physical borders.Given this, we have been inviting various institutions and NGOs including the United Nations, the Korea International Cooperation Agency, the Human Development Institute and the World Culture Open to expand the forum’s scope to include diverse economic and sociocultural agendas. As for the cultural aspect, we are inviting U.K.-born tenor Paul Potts and Korean singer Insooni to perform for the public this year, following Sumi Jo who performed for us last year.KH: What were some major hardships faced in preparing for this year’s forum?Moon: Securing a prominent speaker lineup, with influential and internationally acclaimed figures, is at the core of an international forum’s success. Thus far, we have mainly relied a lot on our Korean diplomats around the world to help invite speakers to the Jeju Forum. My former experience as the Korean ambassador to Germany, Panama and other countries has certainly helped the preparation process as well.We had been working for years to invite Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar to join our symposium. Given her positive response, we had high expectations for her presence this year. However, after winning Myanmar’s democratic elections in November 2015, she informed us that she would be unable to attend this year’s forum.KH: How should Jeju Forum proceed in the future?Moon: Originally founded as a dialogue for peace and cooperation, Jeju Forum must go further to redefine “peace” to include nontraditional security arenas -- such as climate change, energy, health, human rights, women and cyberspace. How we use the Jeju Forum is up to the country. We must ensure that high-ranking government officials, including the president, are present each year, in order to strengthen the Jeju Forum as a globally recognized platform for discussing global agenda. Though best known for its natural wonders, Jejudo Island is more than just a resort island. Geographically positioned in the center of Northeast Asia, the island is naturally a suitable location to host a discussion on sustainable peace and prosperity in the region. I hope that the Korean government will spare no expense and support in promoting the Jeju Forum’s future growth and development.","again inviting some 500 policymakers ,the symposium kickoff on may ,korean diplomats around the world ,inviting some 500 policymakers business ,global businesses environment women education","['asian', 'the World Economic Forum', 'Korea', 'north korean', 'Jeju Forum Executive Committee', 'Moon Tae - young', 'Jeju Forum Executive Committee', 'Moon Tae - young', 'Haevichi Hotel & Resort Jeju', 'Jeju Forum', 'Davos', 'World Economic Forum', 'Korea ’s Jeju Forum', 'WEF', 'the Jeju Forum', 'the Boao Forum', 'the United Nations', 'the Korea International Cooperation Agency', 'the Human Development Institute', 'Paul Potts', 'korean', 'Insooni', 'Sumi Jo', 'korean', 'the Jeju Forum', 'korean', 'Germany', 'Panama', 'Myanmar', 'Jeju Forum', 'Jeju Forum', 'Jejudo Island', 'korean', 'the Jeju Forum ’s']",5,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.32826045  0.53261358

It was renamed the Jeju Forum for Peace and Prosperity in 2011, and has since evolved to include insights from business, technology, environment, women, education and culture sectors, in addition to discussing political and diplomatic issues.For one, the 2012 Jeju Forum invited Steve Wozniak, cofounder of U.S. tech giant Apple, to discuss the end of the personalized computer era and the future of the Internet technology industry, alongside political leaders such as Australia’s former Prime Minister Paul Keating and secretary general of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Lamberto Zannier, among others.In 2013, Quantum Fund cofounder Jim Rogers, a legendary figure in the world of investment and trading, shared his insights on investing in a post-financial crisis economy. Among other presenters, Freda Miriklis, international president of BPW International gave her views on gender equality in the corporate world.The 2014 Jeju Forum invited Japan’s Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Hakubun Shimomura, and former CEO of Hewlett-Packard Carly Fiorina. The forum’s 2015 edition touched on subjects including cybersecurity and terrorism, Asia’s financial markets and trust-building among East Asian states.This year, around half of the forum’s 70 scheduled sessions will be dedicated to international relations and security, including nuclear security, the Northeast Asia Peace Initiative and sustainable development goals, said Jeju Forum Executive Committee chairman Moon Tae-young.The other half will focus on important topics regarding the international economy, renewable energy, climate change and women’s rights, Moon said.","build peace in east asia ,peacebuilding in east asia ,tech giant apple to discuss ,toward peacebuilding in east asia ,asia peace initiative and sustainable","['Jeju Forum', 'the Haevichi Hotel & Resort', 'Jeju Peace Forum', 'korean', 'the Jeju Forum for Peace and Prosperity', 'Jeju Forum', 'Steve Wozniak', 'U.S.', 'Apple', 'Australia', 'Paul Keating', 'the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe', 'Lamberto Zannier', 'Quantum Fund', 'Jim Rogers', 'Freda Miriklis', 'BPW International', 'Jeju Forum', 'Japan', 'Culture , Sports , Science and Technology Hakubun Shimomura', 'Hewlett - Packard Carly Fiorina', 'east asian', 'Jeju Forum Executive Committee', 'Moon Tae - young', 'Moon']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3629491   0.58457446

Chang Jin-young, the spokesman for the minor People's Party, also agreed that teachers are having a tough time in the classroom, and the urgent task is to guarantee and boost teachers' authority.According to data from the Ministry of Education, there were 10,329 cases of teachers' rights violations between 2013 and 2015.Among the reported cases, abusive language from students accounted for 64.6 percent, or 8,415 cases.","major political parties on sunday ,party also agreed that teachers ,classroom are increasing all parties ,saenuri party we will beef ,best efforts to improve teachers","[""South Korea 's"", 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Jung - jae', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Lee Jae - kyung', 'Minjoo Party', 'Chang Jin - young', ""People 's Party"", 'the Ministry of Education']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66693264  0.40759099

145,145,[WEEKENDER] Turning sour on sugar,"Earlier this year, local food columnist Hwang Gyo-ik made headlines by arguing that Korean cuisine culture was “uncivilized.” He said Koreans used too much sugar in almost every dish including kimchi, stir-fired anchovies and even the famous Korean barbecue.“It’s hard to find other countries that use sugar in almost every dish,” he said in a recent radio interview. “Sure, they have desserts, but they also have ...","Earlier this year, local food columnist Hwang Gyo-ik made headlines by arguing that Korean cuisine culture was “uncivilized.” He said Koreans used too much sugar in almost every dish including kimchi, stir-fired anchovies and even the famous Korean barbecue.“It’s hard to find other countries that use sugar in almost every dish,” he said in a recent radio interview. “Sure, they have desserts, but they also have plenty of other dishes that do not contain sugar.” He argued that the “less civilized” have a tendency to consume sweeter foods due to a lack of healthier recipes. Regardless of Hwang’s controversial remarks, South Korea has recently declared war against sugar, releasing measures to reduce its citizens’ sugar consumption. The move came with a government study that revealed almost half of Koreans aged 3-29 are consuming too much sugar, leaving them vulnerable to a number of health conditions including obesity and diabetes. The study showed that sugar accounted for more than 10 percent of their daily caloric intake, which makes them 39 percent more likely to develop obesity and 66 percent more likely to develop high blood pressure.Sugar itself doesn’t cause diabetes, but high sugar consumption can lead to obesity -- which often causes one’s body to resist insulin, the hormone that controls blood sugar. When this happens, an individual’s risk of diabetes goes up. “Our number one priority is to discourage young children from consuming processed foods,” said researcher Park Sun-young from the country’s Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. “But we are also coming up with recipes for home dishes so more people can make them without using too much sugar.”For example, bulgogi, the famous Korean dish of grilled marinated beef, has a sugar content that ranges from 5-8 percent, according to the Food Ministry. The agency in 2014 came up with an alternative recipe for the signature Korean dish, which suggested mixing a small amount of sugar with mirim, a type of rice wine known for its sweet taste. By using mirim instead of sugar, the Food Ministry said one can reduce the dish’s sugar content down to 1.7 percent. “We also offer low-sugar recipes for strawberry jam, sikhye, a traditional sweet Korean rice beverage, and kongjaban, a side dish made of salty black beans,” Park said. Besides the low-sugar recipes, the new measures against sugar include nutrition labelling of food products and banning certain items with high sugar levels, such as carbonated drinks, from being sold at schools. According to the government study, the largest proportion of Koreans consume sugar by drinking carbonated drinks, followed by pastries, cookies and rice cakes.As of last year, Koreans on average had 65.3 grams of sugar daily, the Food Ministry said. Among all age groups, teenagers aged 12-18 had the highest sugar consumption, eating 80 grams of sugar daily, followed by those aged 19-29, who consumed 70.9 grams of sugar every day. South Korea has been seeing an increasing number of obesity patients in recent years. According to a study released by the National Health Insurance Service, the number of obese Koreans -- those with a body mass index of 30 or above - accounted for 4.2 percent of the entire population in 2012, up from 2.5 percent in 2002. A new guideline released by the World Health Organization last year says that intake of sugar varies by age and country. In Europe, it ranges from 7-8 percent of total energy intake for adults in countries like Hungary and Norway to 17 percent in countries like the U.K. and Spain. Intake is much higher among children, ranging from about 12 percent in countries like Sweden and Denmark to nearly 25 percent in Portugal. “Research shows that children with the highest intake of sugar-sweetened drinks are more likely to be overweight or obese than children with a low intake of sugar-sweetened drinks,” the WHO said in a statement.The WHO also revealed in April that the number of diabetes patients worldwide had nearly quadrupled to 422 million in 2014 from 108 million in 1980. High blood sugar levels are linked to 3.7 million deaths worldwide each year. The WHO also warned that the numbers would only increase unless drastic actions are taken. The WHO also recommends adults and children reduce their daily intake of sugar to less than 10 percent of their total energy intake. A further reduction to below 5 percent, or 25 grams  per day, would provide additional health benefits, it said. In response to the Food Ministry’s announcement, the local food industry has plans to cut sugar in their products, including CJ CheilJedang’s ongoing investment in developing sugar substitutes.By Claire Lee","koreans used too much sugar ,sikhye traditional sweet korean rice ,made of salty black beans ,low sugar recipes for strawberry ,famous korean barbecue it hard","['Hwang Gyo - ik', 'korean', 'Koreans', 'korean', 'South Korea', 'Koreans', 'Park Sun', 'Ministry of Food and Drug Safety', 'korean', 'the Food Ministry', 'korean', 'the Food Ministry', 'korean', 'Park', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'the Food Ministry', 'South Korea', 'the National Health Insurance Service', 'Koreans', 'the World Health Organization', 'Hungary', 'Norway', 'U.K.', 'Spain', 'intake', 'Sweden', 'Denmark', 'Portugal', 'who', 'who', 'who', 'who', 'the Food Ministry ’s', 'CJ CheilJedang ’s', 'Claire Lee']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40404484  0.59081823

Co-hosted by Busan Port Authority , Busan Metropolitan City and Korea Tourism Organization, the event will look into the present and future of Asia as an important source market for cruise passengers and as a key destination for cruise ship deployment. Some 2,000 people from global cruise companies from 27 countries, global vacation companies including Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. , and the Cruise Lines International Association  will attend the convention, the BPA said.There will be discussion sessions and presentations by industry experts.The ""Korea and the Wider Asian Market"" session on Thursday morning will be joined by industry heavyweights including Dr. Zinan Liu, president of the North APAC & China Region at Royal Caribbean International; Bruce Krumrine, vice president of Shore Excursions of Holland America Group; and Buhdy Bok, president of Costa Group Asia. On Thursday afternoon, the port city plans to sign a memorandum of understanding with Chinese travel company CTRIP and RCCL to attract more Chinese cruise tourists and to bring the cruise company's mega 220,000-ton Oasis-class cruise ships to the city.The next day, the city and the BPA will sign an MOU with Italian cruise company Costa Cruise for it to use Busan as a ""home port,""where a cruise ship is based. It is seen as a helpful condition by industry experts to vitalize the local cruise tourism industry.The exhibition is open to the public on Saturday after the two-day business-only event.","annual seatrade cruise global organized ,annual seatrade cruise global ,the annual seatrade cruise global ,from 27 countries global vacation ,the annual seatrade cruise","['Busan', 'London', 'Korea', 'Busan Port Authority', 'Busan Metropolitan City', 'Korea Tourism Organization', 'Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.', 'the Cruise Lines International Association', 'BPA', 'the Wider Asian Market', 'Zinan Liu', 'the North APAC & China Region', 'Royal Caribbean International', 'Bruce Krumrine', 'Shore Excursions of Holland America Group', 'Buhdy Bok', 'Costa Group Asia', 'chinese', 'CTRIP', 'chinese', 'BPA', 'MOU', 'italian', 'Costa Cruise', 'Busan']",13,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.67670834  0.30539834

Nikpay was visiting South Korea to sign a sisterhood relations pact.The two countries have maintained good relations since they established diplomatic ties in 1962. Iran was the only oil-producing country that supplied the critical resource to South Korea during the 1973 oil crisis.In the 1970s, some 200,000 South Koreans earned foreign currency in Iran, working at numerous construction sites. The two countries' relations cooled after the 1979 Iranian Revolution. In the 1980s, residents in the Gangnam district asked the city government to change the name of the 10-lane Tehran Street as the Middle Eastern country became isolated from the international community.Still, the name survived and is now synonymous as one of the main hubs of international finance in South Korea and a magnet for Seoul's countless venture firms.The area first became the heart of the IT industry when leading IT firms started to settle in the area in the 1990s. It was a time when the country was hit by a boom of the new technology.The research lab of Ahn Cheol-soo, an entrepreneur-turned-politician who currently co-leads the minor opposition People's Party; the headquarters of Thrunet, which was one of the largest high-speed internet service providers in the country; and former South Korean portal Netian were all located on Tehran Street. Such a concentration of IT firms caused the neighborhood to be dubbed South Korea's Silicon Valley.The district that surrounds the business quarter is also renowned for apartments that fetch top prices.With Grand Intercontinental Seoul Parnas, the Korea World Trade Center and the Convention and Exhibition Center , as well as Hyundai Department Store, the area is literally one of the busiest and richest regions in South Korea. The street also boasts the Seoul office of steel giant POSCO.In 2000, the area faced a crisis with the vacancy rate soaring up to 20 percent.However, with the offices of an affiliate belonging to Samsung Group, the country's largest family run conglomerate, at the west end and firms under Hyundai Motor Group towards the east, as well as other institutes supporting start-up businesses moving in, the vacancy rate recently shrank to below 10 percent.Tehran Street now aims to pull off another great leap forward with the growth resurgence of venture companies. The commercial rent price per 1 square-meter on the street is 21,700 won  as of January, the fourth highest in the city, according to the Korea Appraisal Board. The Jongno district in central Seoul, Myeongdong and Gangnam Boulevard led the list.Posco Art Museum, which features Frank Stella's ""Amabel"" flowering structure and works by Korean-born American media artist Paik Nam-june, and LG Arts Center also attract tourists to the street.Tehran Street's counterpart Seoul Street in the Iranian capital also stands as a symbol of the two countries' friendship.The 3-kilometer-long road, also called Seoul Boulevard, runs in the north part of the capital with four to six lanes.In 2003, Seoul Park opened in the capital amid the rising popularity of Korean pop culture in the Middle Eastern country.Then Mayor of Tehran Mohammad-Hassan Malekmadani led the project to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the two countries' amity. The park is filled with about a hundred pine trees which are uncommon in the Middle East.A park keeper said the park is enjoyed by ordinary citizens for jogging and is crowded with families on picnics during the weekends. Sarah, a 30-year-old housewife living in Tehran, said she uses the park to play with her children.""This is a place that I visit all the time. The visit of the South Korean president to Iran this time made me think of the meaning of this place,"" she said.South Korean President Park Geun-hye made a groundbreaking visit to Iran earlier this month, the first such trip by a South Korean president since the establishment of bilateral diplomatic ties in 1962. Park secured Iran's support for denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula during talks with her Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, in Tehran. The president and Rouhani observed the signing numerous memorandums of understanding  worth up to $45.6 billion.Seoul hopes the MOUs will pave the way for South Korean companies to eventually win massive infrastructure projects under way in Iran.","richest regions in south korea ,tuesday the kilometer long tehran ,for seoul countless venture firms ,tehran street in southern seoul ,rising popularity of korean pop","['Tehran', 'Seoul', 'Seoul Street', 'Iran', 'Tehran Gholamreza Nikpay', 'Koo Ja - choon', 'South Korea', 'Iran', 'South Korea', 'South Koreans', 'Iran', 'Gangnam', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Ahn Cheol', ""People 's Party"", 'Thrunet', 'south korean', 'Netian', ""South Korea 's"", 'Grand Intercontinental Seoul Parnas', 'the Korea World Trade Center', 'the Convention and Exhibition Center', 'Hyundai Department Store', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Samsung Group', 'Hyundai Motor Group', 'the Korea Appraisal Board', 'Seoul', 'Myeongdong', 'Gangnam Boulevard', 'Posco Art Museum', ""Frank Stella 's"", 'Amabel', 'Korean', 'american', 'Paik Nam', 'LG Arts Center', 'iranian', 'Seoul Park', 'korean', 'Mohammad - Hassan Malekmadani', 'Sarah', 'Tehran', 'south korean', 'Iran', 'south korean', 'Park Geun', 'Iran', 'south korean', 'Iran', 'iranian', 'Hassan Rouhani', 'Tehran', 'Rouhani', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'Iran']",5,"[ 0.          5.          0.         ... -0.73861271  0.5966689

Nexus reached the U.S. market in 1997.The ground-breaking program is now considered the longest surviving online game in tech-heavy South Korea. It also won a Guinness title as the oldest MMORPG in 2011 to mark its 15th anniversary.The accumulated number of users came to 23 million, which accounts for nearly half of South Korea's population of 50 million.On average, each user played the game for three hours on a daily basis.Nexus operators said while some were concerned that Nexon would make only a penny from the old program, the company is actually seeing better-than-expected profitability.""Baram as we know it today was based on the participation of many developers, and not just myself,"" Song told Yonhap News Agency. ""But it is true that many were pessimistic about 'a game like this' back then. I was so proud to find a breakthrough.""The first-generation of Internet users in South Korea cheered Nexus upon its release. Many users were willing to bear monthly data fee of hundreds of thousands of won in the 1990s, just to play the never-before-seen game.Nexus began its full-fledged growth in the late 1990s following the boom of Internet cafes in South Korea, which made online games more accessible to a wider scope of users, including students without PCs at home.Song started his dream of becoming a developer when he first encountered a computer in the early 1980s as a middle school student. Although he did not have one for himself, Song eventually became enthusiastic about computers and studied them.""After I first learned about computers, I was immersed in playing games. But I was not too good at them, especially for those that called for quick responses. I am so bad at strategic games like SimCity or StarCraft. But I was good at role-playing games that called for diligence,"" Song said.In the late 1990s, South Korean online users were enthusiastic about the so-called ""Multi User Dungeon ,"" which refers to text-based multi-player games. While users could communicate with each other, there were no graphics to be shown, and participants had to use their imagination.Another popular type of game was the first-generation role playing game, which boasted graphics but could not feature multi-player mode.Then came Nexus, which allowed multiple users to enjoy high-end graphic content at the same time. It is considered the first-generation of MMORPG, although the term did not exist back in 1996.""In the 1990s, the speed of modems was very slow. Even the delivery of text was very slow. Due to those circumstances, many claimed that a graphic-based online game was technologically impossible. And I thought I could, and I did,"" Song said.Song sought to solve the slow Internet speed by having users pre-download graphic data on their computers. Song began his project to develop Nexus after dropping out from KAIST and working at Hancom Inc., a South Korean software developer. He joined forces with Kim Jung-ju to start Nexon Corp. in 1994. For Song, however, Nexus was an unfinished task. A few months ahead of the official release, Song left Nexon in December 1995, and the project was carried on by other developers. Nexus helped Nexon to emerge as an online giant from a young startup.In September 1998, Song also gave birth to Lineage, another MMORPG, at NCsoft Corporation. Song then left NCSoft to start his own business.Song now heads XLGAMES Inc. Although the company's first racing game failed to gain popularity, its own MMORPG ArcheAge became a hit in the North American and Chinese markets. The company posted an operating profit of 1.2 billion won  in 2015.Amid the boom of smartphones, which did not exist 20 years ago, Song is currently working on developing his first mobile role-playing game, which will be similar to Nexus.On his humble desk with nothing else other than his computer with two monitors, even now, Song is sharing his idea with 10 younger developers, continuing to expand his dream, which all began when he was a simple graduate student. ""The only good memories I have right now was when feeling relieved after solving programming-related problems everyday during the development of Baram,"" Song said. ""Now I want to think only positively. I am happy to still have an opportunity to develop games.""","first massively multiplayer online role ,1990s south korean online users ,the country first internet cafes ,online giant from young startup ,country first massively multiplayer online","['South Korea', 'Korea Advanced Institute of Science', 'Song jae - kyung', 'Song', ""South Korea 's"", 'Role - Playing Game', 'Nexus', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Guinness', ""South Korea 's"", 'Nexon', 'South Korea', 'Nexus', 'Nexus', 'South Korea', 'song', 'Song', 'SimCity', 'StarCraft', 'song', 'south korean', 'Nexus', 'song', 'song', 'Nexus', 'KAIST', 'Hancom Inc.', 'south korean', 'Kim Jung - ju', 'Nexon Corp.', 'Song', 'Nexus', 'Song', 'Nexon', 'Nexon', 'Song', 'Lineage', 'MMORPG', 'NCsoft Corporation', 'song', 'NCSoft', 'song', 'XLGAMES Inc.', 'MMORPG ArcheAge', 'chinese', 'Song', 'Nexus', 'Song', 'Baram', 'song']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.91528517  0.53027588

It helped South Korea transform itself into an economic powerhouse from the ashes of the 1950-53 Korean War.   Buoyed by diplomatic and economic achievements, Park is expected to hold meetings with new leaders of the three major political parties.    Last week, Park said the meeting could take place soon after her trip to Iran, though she did not set a specific time frame.   The meeting could set the tone for Park's relations with the new parliament set to begin its term on May 30.   On Wednesday, the president sent potted orchids to Chung Jin-suk and Kim Gwang-lim, the new floor leader and the chief policymaker of Park’s ruling Saenuri Party, to congratulate them on their new posts through her aide.   Last week, Park also sent similar orchids to the new floor leader and the policymaker of the minor opposition People's Party.   Park's ruling Saenuri Party suffered a crushing defeat in last month's parliamentary elections, a result that will compel the president to seek compromise with opposition parties for parliamentary endorsement of a set of bills.   Cheong Wa Dae, South Korea's presidential office, said Park's latest diplomatic and economic feat could give a much-needed boost to the chief executive.   A poll, conducted by a local pollster R&Search; on Sunday, showed that Park's job approval rating came to 32.9 percent, up 2.9 percentage points from a week earlier.","her groundbreaking visit to iran ,friday the president also garnered ,domestic reforms park secured iran ,office said park latest diplomatic ,after her trip to iran","['Park Geun', 'Iran', 'Park', 'Iran', 'iranian', 'Hassan Rouhani', 'Tehran', 'Iran', 'Ayatollah Ali Khamenei', 'Iran', 'North Korea', 'Rouhani', 'Park', ""North Korea 's"", 'Iran', 'Seoul', 'Tehran', 'South Korea', 'Iran', 'Tehran', 'North Korea', 'Park', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', ""Workers ' Party"", 'Rouhani', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'Iran', 'U.N.', 'the United States', 'Tehran', 'Park', 'Iran', 'Koreans', 'South Korea', 'Park', 'Park', 'Iran', 'Park', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'Kim Gwang - lim', 'Park ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park', ""People 's Party"", 'Park', 'Saenuri Party', 'Cheong', 'Dae', ""South Korea 's"", 'Park', 'Park']",3,"[ 0.          3.          0.         ... -0.32687399  0.62167686

The underground pathway will house exhibition centers, cultural venues, museums, restaurants and shopping malls. Gwanghwamun Square in central Seoul “Currently, Gwanghwamun Square does not serve as a square. It has only become a massive median strip ,” Park said in a meeting with reporters.The city will push to turn the traffic lanes in front of Sejong Culture and Art Center into part of Gwanghwamun Square and only open the lanes in front of the U.S. Embassy to vehicles.The plan is strongly opposed by the central government, citing possible traffic congestion and safety issues surrounding Cheong Wa Dae and the U.S. Embassy.Residents in the neighborhood also object to the scheme, saying that expansion of the square will further cause noise and traffic congestion. The square is frequented by foreign visitors, while also acting as a walking trail for commuters and office goers in the area as well as a popular venue for large-scale rallies.“Expanding Gwanghwamun Square does not cost much. We need more fundamental leadership from the central government,” the mayor Park said. The mayor also revealed the city’s long-term plan to restore Yukjo Street of the Joseon Dynasty in Gwanghwamun Square leading to Gyeongbokgung Palace. The street had been home to six major government edifices.The city will reinterpret Yukjo street in a “modern” way and construct a three-story building running through Gwanghwamun Square, the mayor said. The first floor will be cleared for pedestrians to freely walk around, while the second and third floors will have shops and cultural venues.

Besides being home to a World Heritage site and some 1.1 million residents, it is also known as the “city of filial piety.”King Jeongjo, who reigned during the Joseon Dynasty from 1777 to 1800 as the 22nd king, wanted to build a “utopian city” to remember his ill-fated father Prince Sado –- who was victimized in faction struggles in 1762 -- by constructing a fortress around his father’s tomb at Haenggung Palace. Built at a height of 5 to 8 meters height and 5,744 meters in circumference, the site was designated as a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 1997.According to Suwon Mayor Yeom Tae-young, along with its scientific and dedicated construction, Hwaseong Fortress goes beyond just being a military facility.Suwon Mayor Yeom Tae-young “Although it was mainly built to protect the southern part of the palace, Hwaseong Fortress itself functioned as the main gate for residents and the marketplace where business among merchants prospered,” said Yeom.“Hwaseong Fortress, in fact, has a very scientific architecture,” he added. Designed and built by architect Jeong Yak-yong, who later become a renowned leader of the Silhak movement, the fortress was built in 1794 and was completed in 1796. Jeong incorporated traditional Korean designs with China’s contemporary building plans. “He constructed the wall with bricks by making use of pulleys and cranes, with a very accurate and developed building method, Hwaseong Fortress’ walls remain as intact as it was constructed over 200 years ago,” said Yeom.In order to spread awareness of the beauty of the fortress as well as the story behind historical figures such as Jeong Yak-yong and King Jeongjo, Suwon aims to enhance its reputation as a city of heritage and cultural tourism. To celebrate the 220th year since the fortress was completed, Suwon City has designated this year as the “Year of visiting Suwon.” The city has prepared a slew of cultural programs and festivals for local and foreign visitors. “We always thought the real beauty of Suwon has not been fully shown to visitors. I hope more visitors come to Suwon and enjoy every corner of the city. Also, it will be a good opportunity for foreign visitors to learn about Korea’s heritage site,” said Yeom. As part of the lineup of events, the famous Suwon Theatre Festival will celebrate its 20th anniversary with the likes of the Spanish performance Grupo Puja and the French play “Passage.” One of the most representative entertainment shows in town is the martial art performance by the city’s  “Muyea 24” team, which puts up a show daily at 11 a.m. in front of the Hwaseong Haenggung’s main gate.But the “real beauty” of Hwaseong Fortress unfolds at night, according to Yeom.“Imagine when the lights installed on the top of 5.7 kilometers of fortress wall are turned on at night,” said Yeom.“When we saw the shining fortress wall at night, it felt like all our efforts paid off after 20 years of installing it, just to show the nice night view of Hwaseong Fortress.”When the sun goes down, Suwon also turns into a city of food streets and traditional markets, including the popular Paldalmun Market, Jidong Market, Motgol Market and Youngdong Market, to name a few.One of the popular cuisines in Suwon is Wang Galbi, soy sauce marinated beef ribs, as well as crispy fried whole-chicken, which is cooked in a huge traditional iron pot.Another famous item in Suwon is Sundae, or Korean-style blood sausage, made with noodle, assorted vegetables and a spicy sauce. “I want to invite all to Suwon for this year’s party. I hope many can come and witness how the city evolved from a heritage city to one of festive vibe,” said Yeom.“We will show everything we have got and that we have prepared, right from maintaining the old fortress walls from decades ago to the current state of the local markets,” he added.By Kim Da-sol and Park","seoul suwon is the largest ,tourism to celebrate the 220th ,suwon is the largest metropolis ,30 kilometers south of seoul ,famous suwon theatre festival will","['Seoul', 'Suwon', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'World Heritage', 'Jeongjo', 'World Heritage', 'UNESCO', 'Suwon', 'Yeom Tae - young', 'Hwaseong Fortress', 'Suwon', 'Yeom Tae - young', 'Hwaseong Fortress', 'Yeom', 'Jeong Yak - yong', 'Silhak', 'Jeong', 'korean', 'China', ""Hwaseong Fortress '"", 'Yeom', 'Jeong Yak - yong', 'King Jeongjo', 'Suwon', 'Suwon City', 'Suwon', 'Suwon', 'Suwon', 'Korea', 'Yeom', 'spanish', 'Grupo Puja', 'french', 'Hwaseong Fortress', 'Yeom', 'Yeom', 'Hwaseong Fortress', 'Suwon', 'Jidong Market', 'Motgol Market', 'Youngdong Market', 'Suwon', 'Wang Galbi', 'Suwon', 'korean', 'Suwon', 'Yeom', 'Kim Da - sol']",9,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -1.07432199  0.71558774

Throughout these years, the two countries have maintained a relatively friendly and strong relationship. The presence of Tehran Street in Gangnam, Seoul, as well as Seoul Street in the north of Tehran are symbols and reminders of the long friendship between two countries. Iranian officials have always expressed positive views toward South Korea and supported the expansion of bilateral relations, underlining that such cooperation could help further the two countries friendly relations. Fortunately, we have had a number of official meetings recently, among them, visits by the South Korean minister of foreign affairs, and the minister of land, infrastructure and transport to Tehran in August and November 2015 respectively. Iran’s El Goli park in Tabriz /The Iranian EmbassyIt goes without saying that President Park Geun-hye’s state visit to Iran is a landmark event in the history of relations between the two countries. This event will open a new chapter in the Iran-Korea bilateral relationship and will provide ample opportunities for the enhancement of bilateral cooperation in cultural, economic, and historical fields.As far as trade relations between the two countries are concerned, both countries have attached great importance to continuous economic and business cooperation, even in the face of unjust extensive sanctions against Iran over past decade. Korean companies have a long record of presence and successful activity in the Iran market and have been working in many infrastructure and construction projects in Iran. They enjoy a very good reputation as reliable and confident partners, which in turn, is a valuable asset for their future activity in the Iranian market. Iran and Korea enjoy strong economic ties with bilateral trade volume standing at roughly $8.6 billion in 2014. This figure dropped to $6.1 billion in 2015. Korea can satisfy Iran’s needs in multiple areas including energy projects, power plants, the auto industry, the railway network, ICT and steel production plants. In return, Iran holding the world‘s fourth-largest proved crude oil reserves and the world’s second-largest natural gas reserves can be a sustainable supplier of energy for Korea. As we enter the post-sanctions era, the Iranian market is becoming a very competitive one and South Korean firms should prepare to take advantage of this opportunity.Iran and South Korea have had a number of official meetings to discuss bilateral trade and economic cooperation. On February 29, the Korea-Iran Joint Economic Commission was held in Tehran on the ministerial level. Simultaneously and alongside this commission, there was also a business forum in which a large number of businessmen from the private sector of both countries participated.","iran and korea enjoy strong ,korea enjoy strong economic ties ,market iran and korea enjoy ,friendship between two countries iranian ,korea established their diplomatic relationship","['Iran', 'Korea', 'Gangnam', 'Seoul', 'Tehran', 'iranian', 'South Korea', 'south korean', 'Tehran', 'Iran', 'El Goli', 'Tabriz', 'Park Geun', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'korean', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'iranian', 'Iran', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Iran', 'ICT', 'Iran', 'Korea', 'iranian', 'south korean', 'Iran', 'South Korea', 'the Korea', 'Iran Joint Economic Commission', 'Tehran']",13,"[ 0.          1.          4.         ... -0.86491382  0.56239754

""Although we live in a high-tech era with smartphones, many people are also moving to rural regions, dreaming of starting a new life.""The perception on returning to farms has also changed. While people previously migrated outside cities after facing financial issues, now more South Koreans are making the decision in the hopes of finding an environment-friendly life,"" Park added.Park said the development of technology also has lowered barriers in the agricultural industry, inviting more people to start new careers.The retire-to-farm movement can also be helpful in solving the chronic problems of South Korean farms, including the aging population, he added. Co-hosted by Yonhap News Agency and the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, the event will offer the latest updates related to the government's policy on supporting urban dwellers' return to farms, as well as details on farming and distribution know-how and successful cases of urban-to-rural resettlements.An increasing number of South Koreans have been moving to farms. According to the data compiled by Statistics Korea, the number of households heading from cities to rural areas came to 44,586 units in 2014, up 37.5 percent from a year earlier.Industry watchers said last year's figure is estimated at 50,000 units, although no detailed figures have been compiled so far. It marks a sharp rise from 4,067 units posted in 2010.South Korean retailers, including E-Mart and Lotte Mart, as well as tech IT firms, including LG Mtron Ltd., will also feature ""smart farm"" solutions, which aim to apply information and communications technology to the agricultural sector to beef up efficiency and productivity.Organizers said it has also prepared a special booth targeting those in their 30s and 40s, as people seeking to start new careers at farms are becoming younger over the recent years.Successful farmers who used to be urban dwellers will also share their experiences at the venue, the organizers said.Provincial governments in South Korea have been rolling out different incentives to host more retirees from cities.Gangwon Province, for example, plans to allocate 97 billion won  to help 500 newcomers start new agricultural businesses over the next five years. Another 3.9 billion won will also be handed out to help them settle down, the regional government said.Boeun, a town located in North Chungcheong Province, also provides up to 5 million won each to help new households purchase farming equipment.Provincial governments will operate booths to provide face-to-face consulting services to the visitors at the venue.","farm expo 2016 will continue ,friday kicked off an exposition ,help new households purchase farming ,farm expo 2016 will ,more retirees from cities gangwon","['Yonhap News Agency', ""South Korea 's"", 'Yangjae - dong', 'Seoul', 'Agency', 'Agricultural', 'Lee Dong - phil', 'South Koreans', 'Park', 'south korean', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'the Ministry of Agriculture , Food and Rural Affairs', 'South Koreans', 'Statistics Korea', 'korean', 'E - Mart', 'Lotte Mart', 'LG Mtron Ltd.', 'South Korea', 'Gangwon Province', 'North Chungcheong Province']",18,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.63428986  0.48721296

The U.S. side returned the remains of 15 South Korean soldiers.South Korea found the U.S. troops' remains in November 2015 in Yanggu, a mountainous region just below the eastern side of the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone, where a fierce battle took place during the bloody civil war. The remains of the 15 South Korean soldiers were excavated by the U.S. in the early 2000s inside North Korea and brought to the U.S. military's war dead excavation agency in Hawaii before they were identified as South Koreans and sent home earlier in the day.It was the second batch of South Korean soldiers' remains repatriated by the U.S. In 2012, the first set of remains of 12 South Korean war veterans, found also in North Korea, came home from Hawaii. Locally, South Korea has excavated a total of 10,315 Korean War veterans' remains so far in a war dead excavation project that was launched in 2000 before setting aside the remains of 10 of them as Americans. The Saturday ceremony marked the first time the allies have mutually exchanged the remains of the war dead on the same occasion. ""Well over a million civilians and service members lost their lives defending freedom and democracy here in the Korean Peninsula.Because of their ultimate sacrifice and the veterans' perseverance, the Republic of Korea has become a thriving democracy today with a prosperous economy,"" USFK Commander Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti said in a speech during the ceremony. ""Their sacrifice and opportunity forged its destiny and achieved its dream, and it's our sound duty to properly recognize their sacrifice and fulfill our commitment to return the remains for proper burial in their homeland,"" the general noted.Defense Minister Han Min-koo said, ""These deceased veterans have finally come home to be buried in the warm bosom of their homeland after staying buried in an unknown mountain valley half a century after the Korean War came to a halt."" Still, some 120,000 South Korean veterans and 8,000 U.S. soldiers remain unaccounted for after joining the war, the minister said, adding, ""The South Korean government will make utmost efforts to find the very last veteran lost in the Korean War.""","10 315 korean war veterans ,the military war dead excavation ,south korean soldiers were excavated ,315 korean war veterans remains ,military war dead excavation","['United Nations', 'Army', 'south korean', 'United States', ""the U.S. Forces Korea 's"", 'Yongsan', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'south korean', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Yanggu', 'Demilitarized Zone', 'south korean', 'U.S.', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'Hawaii', 'South Koreans', 'south korean', 'the U.S.', 'south korean', 'North Korea', 'Hawaii', 'South Korea', 'Americans', 'the Republic of Korea', 'Curtis Scaparrotti', 'Han Min - koo', 'south korean', 'U.S.', 'south korean']",19,[0.         1.         0.         ... 0.10491709 0.51848429 0.46098971]

Mangyongdae is the place where North Korea says its founding leader Kim Il-sung and the late grandfather of the current leader Kim Jong-un, was born.Kim Il-sung's birthday is April 15 and the marathon is one of many events staged to celebrate the key date. This year marked the third time that foreign amateurs have been allowed to take part in the event. However, the race saw an increase in amateur participation -- nearly 1,000 foreign amateurs took part, the marathon's organizers said.The Singaporean woman studied in South Korea previously and speaks Korean fluently. She is currently operating a Korean language institute in Singapore.During her trip to Pyongyang, she occasionally acted as an interpreter for other foreigners including her brother.She said the atmosphere in Pyongyang was far from any sense of crisis or insecurity although the marathon event was held under the severe international sanctions for the North's nuclear test in January and the long-range rocket launch the following month.She explained the landscape of Pyongyang was generally peaceful when she looked around some tourist spots such as Mansudae Hill and nearby parks and subway stations. ""The streets of Pyongyang were full of cherry and forsythia blossoms and people on the streets look relatively bright,"" she said.""At first I somewhat had a sense of fear as I had a negative image of North Korea which I had obtained from newspapers and media, but was able to adapt myself soon,"" she said.""Before I went to North Korea I was told about the prohibitions on what to do and what is not allowed in the country. In fact, individual action was impossible without North Korean guides, but nevertheless their control was not as tight as I first imagined,"" she said.Ong said she felt she came to a different world when she saw all the propaganda posters and mural paintings on the walls of subway stations in Pyongyang, which is quite different from commercial advertisements that are often seen in capitalistic countries. She said that North Korea was also different from other former communist bloc countries which had transformed themselves into capitalistic system in some areas. ""I felt North Korea is not like China and Russia,"" she said.","annual pyongyang marathon the streets ,participant in north korean marathon ,the mangyongdae prize international marathon ,this year annual pyongyang marathon ,annual pyongyang marathon the","['Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'North Korea', 'singaporean', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'Ong Wann', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'ong', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'Mangyongdae', 'North Korea', 'Kim Il - sing', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Kim Il - sung', 'singaporean', 'South Korea', 'korean', 'korean', 'Singapore', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'Mansudae Hill', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'Ong', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'China', 'Russia']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27204984  0.75255066

So the two heads of state sat down for an only slightly belated birthday lunch at the castle, west of London.Obama's wife, Michelle, flew in from Washington to attend the royal engagements. The queen's husband, Prince Philip, was on hand as well.The queen put a scarf over her head and came out in a light, drizzling rain to greet the president and first lady as their helicopter landed on the lush green lawn outside the castle. The couples shook hands warmly before hopping into a black Range Rover, driven by Philip, to head back to the castle. Obama sat in front with Philip, the queen and the first lady in the back seat. A few minutes later, the queen led the four into a sitting room with a roaring fire, and asked the president where he'd like to sit.  The four posed for pictures before the private lunch. The queen was dressed in a light blue suit; the first lady wore an Oscar de la Renta print dress and a black Narciso Rodriguez coat.Later, Obama planned to have dinner with Prince William, his wife Kate and brother Prince Harry at the younger royals' Kensington Palace home in central London. William is second in line to inherit the British throne after his father, Prince Charles.Obama was breaking up his royal holiday with a stop at 10 Downing St. for talks with Prime Minister David Cameron about the multinational campaign against the Islamic State group, as well as counterterrorism efforts, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, the global economy, Russia's stance toward Ukraine and other issues.Political issues in the United Kingdom and the U.S., including Britain's possible exit from the European Union, or Brexit, are on the agenda, along with the U.S. presidential campaign that will determine Obama's successor.Cameron is leading the campaign in favor of Britain's continued membership in the 28-nation EU, which Obama also supports. He wants Obama to speak out against severing ties, but voters will have the final say in a June 23 referendum. Cameron faces opposition from within his own Conservative government and widespread skepticism among voters about the benefits of staying in the EU. Backers of those who support Britain's exit, meanwhile, have accused Obama of hypocrisy and interference.In an opinion piece published online Thursday by the Daily Telegraph newspaper, Obama urges Britons to stay in the EU. He notes the decision will affect U.S. interests and says ""The U.S. and the world need your outsized influence to continue - including within Europe.""Another issue that could come up is Obama's criticism of Cameron in an interview published recently in The Atlantic magazine. In the article, Obama faulted Cameron and other European allies for shortcomings in their handling of Libya after the 2011 toppling of leader Moammar Gadhafi. Obama said Cameron had become ""distracted"" by other issues.Libya has since descended into chaos and become a haven for members of the Islamic State group.Obama's lunch with the queen is the latest in a series of engagements between the two families since he took office in 2009.""Each time, the president has come away with an even deeper personal affection for her,'' said Obama spokesman Josh Earnest. ""She is an important symbol of a country with whom the United States has a special relationship. But she also is a human being whose charisma and a sense of nobility and honor is something that I think people around the world are attracted to.""Obama described the queen as ""delightful"" following their first meeting in 2009. He also told an aide that she reminded him of his grandmother.That meeting is also where the queen and the much-taller Mrs. Obama showed how quickly they took a liking to each other by briefly standing arm in arm at a Buckingham Palace reception for world leaders attending an economic summit in London. The queen strayed from protocol by wrapping an arm around the first lady, who reciprocated.A palace spokesman at the time described the scene at the ladies' first meeting as a ""mutual and spontaneous display of affection.""The queen subsequently hosted Obama for a state visit in May 2011, during which the president and first lady slept at the palace. Obama and the queen also met in June 2014 during ceremonies marking the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy, France.Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, and William and Harry, have all visited Obama in the Oval Office.Harry, a military veteran who served in Afghanistan, joined Mrs. Obama for a White House event in 2013. In 2015, they met at a U.S. military base to highlight their shared interest in the needs of military families and wounded service members. She and daughters Malia and Sasha also sipped tea with Harry at Kensington Palace when the first lady stopped in London last year.","obama lunch with the queen ,90th birthday greetings to queen ,birthday but president barack obama ,state group obama lunch ,london obama wife michelle flew","['LONDON', 'Barack Obama', 'Elizabeth II', 'Britain', 'Obama', 'London', 'Obama', 'Michelle', 'Washington', 'Prince Philip', 'Range Rover', 'Philip', 'Philip', 'Prince William', 'Kate', 'Prince Harry', 'Kensington Palace', 'London', 'William', 'british', 'Prince Charles', 'Obama', '10 Downing St.', 'David Cameron', 'Islamic State', 'Afghanistan', 'Syria', 'Libya', 'Russia', 'Ukraine', 'the United Kingdom', 'U.S.', 'Britain', 'the European Union', 'Brexit', 'U.S.', 'Obama', 'Cameron', 'Britain', 'EU', 'Obama', 'Cameron', 'EU', 'Britain', 'Daily Telegraph', 'Britons', 'EU', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Obama', 'Cameron', 'Obama', 'Cameron', 'european', 'Libya', 'Moammar Gadhafi', 'Obama', 'Cameron', 'Libya', 'Islamic', 'State', 'Obama', 'Obama', 'Josh Earnest', 'the United States', 'Obama', 'London', 'Obama', 'Normandy', 'France', 'Prince Charles', 'Camilla', 'William', 'Harry', 'Obama', 'Harry', 'Afghanistan', 'Obama', 'White House', 'U.S.', 'Sasha', 'Harry', 'London']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.31590304  0.26155597

Designating April 20-26 as Climate Change Week, the Environment Ministry has annually promoted environment-related events ranging from campaigns for using public transportation to photo exhibitions, awareness classes and experts’ forums. These are held in several cities, including Busan, Daegu and Ulsan.  Activists dressed as traffic police and street cleaners with high occupational exposure to fine dust call for safer environment in an event held in Seoul to mark the Earth Day on April 22, 2015. YonhapThe largest event is Earth Hour, which will be held Friday to remind people of the importance of cutting carbon emissions. Citizens will be recommended to turn off all electric lights from 8:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. when electricity consumption is at its highest. The Earth Hour event is the annual signature event of global conservation group World Wide Fund for Nature. Earth Hour was also held nationwide ahead of Earth Day on March 19, drawing massive participation from the public and private sector. This Friday’s Earth Hour will be independently promoted by municipalities. Earth Day was started in 1970 by 20 million Americans, who took to the streets to protest against the uncontrolled impact of fossil-fuel-driven industrial development. The one-day demonstration soon spread to other communities across the U.S., leading the U.S. Congress to pass landmark environmental laws that ensured the community’s right-to-know provisions. They also allowed Americans to sue the government if it fails to carry out the law. About 50 years later, Earth Day has become an international day for countries to remind people of the value of the Earth and encourage communities to take action to save the planet.  This year’s Earth Day is historic, as the world leaders from at least 150 countries will gather at the United Nations headquarters in New York to officially sign the Paris Agreement -- a deal reached at the U.N. Climate Change Conference in December to limit global warming. More than 190 countries agreed to limit planetary temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius, which scientists consider to be the threshold for catastrophic climate change. The new deal will replace the Kyoto Protocol, which only required developed states to curb emissions. International calls have grown that developing countries should also take part in the carbon cut move in order to practically limit the temperature rise. Korea pledged last year to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 37 percent from the expected business-as-usual level by 2030. The plan comprises actual mitigations of 25.7 percent of greenhouse gas emissions and the purchase of global carbon credits equivalent to 11.3 percent.The Paris Agreement be will opened for a year for signing. It will take effect once at least 55 countries sign the accord. The emissions of those countries, however, must exceed 55 percent of the world’s total emissions. The Environment Ministry said it would promote its carbon cut measures at the U.N. headquarters meeting Friday, especially expanding the number of environmentally friendly vehicles and creating a carbon-free island, officials said.

Still, Chung said he is not in a position to fully enjoy the accolade, referring to the recent series of airport-related security problems that set off alarm bells.In January, two Chinese nationals snuck into the country without being noticed by immigration officials or picked up by the airport's security systems. Later in the same month, a Vietnamese transfer passenger forced his way through the gate of an unmanned automatic immigration checkpoint without being noticed.All the people that entered South Korea illegally were later arrested in the country and ordered to be deported.Chung said the airport is putting utmost efforts into blocking loopholes in its security system.Gimpo International Airport in western Seoul also topped the list of the airports handling passengers between 15 million and 25 million annually for a sixth consecutive year.

Security Council slapped its toughest sanctions yet on the North in March over its nuclear test and long-range rocket launch earlier this year. The North is banned from launching ballistic missiles under a series of relevant U.N. resolutions.North Korea is also ramping up efforts to prepare for the ruling party's first congress in over three decades in early May.The North's newspaper reported on its front page that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has been selected as a delegate for the military to the upcoming party congress.The current leader's election is ""an expression of absolute trust and intense loyalty by all party members and service personnel"" of the Korean People's Army, the Korean Central News Agency said in its English dispatch.","korea on thursday highlighted accomplishments ,festivals after designating his birthday ,celebrate the 104th birthday ,his birthday two day national ,pyongyang has celebrated the anniversary","['North Korea', 'Kim Il - sung', 'Kim', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'Musudan', 'Kim', 'the U.N.

Lavie, who is considered one of the founders of sleep medicine, has served as Technion president since 2009. Technion has played a major role in fostering the innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem in Israel since 1912. Lavie visited Seoul to deliver a plenary speech at the 2016 International Presidential Forum on Global Research Universities. International Presidential Form on Global Research Universities.“The government’s four systematic support programs have helped students check the value depth of their ideas. The public programs allow them to test their ideas and see if their proposals have commercial values,” he said. The Israeli government administers four specific programs -- Magnet, Magneton, Nofar and Kamin -- which provide support ranging from precompetitive research and development to applied research. All proposals are reviewed for technological feasibility, merit and risks by an independent group that consists of government officials, faculty and industry experts.To better encourage entrepreneurship, he said his school has opened multiple virtual multidisciplinary research centers, incubators and accelerators, which all together have become a quasi-R&D; center, along with various entrepreneurship courses and start-up MBA programs. “Along with support from the government, various factors such as the involvement of students as researchers, innovators and entrepreneurs, support of risk-taking research, multidisciplinary collaboration and institutional support of technology transfer served as ingredients of the school success,“ the president added.  Upon the active government’s support and the school’s efforts, more than 1,600 companies were established by some 1,300 graduates between 1995 and 2015, bringing $30 billion from acquisitions and mergers, drawing $6.8 billion of investment. Israel records the second-largest number of companies on Nasdaq, with two-thirds coming from Technion, according to the school.

Other reasons include the rise of divorces and elderly citizens left alone after the death of a spouse and young people who don't have a job stable enough to start a family.Except for the group who voluntarily chose to live alone to enjoy their single life with a monthly income that is well over 3.5 million won, most single-households are faced with the problems of ""poverty"" and ""social isolation,"" Byeon said.""The increase of one-person households is a phenomenon being experienced by advanced countries, too,"" she said.

They have been at the park since their arrival from the Chinese southwestern province of Sichuan on March 3. The bears are leased for 15 years as part of a research project on the endangered species conducted by both South Korea and China.   Two pandas spent more than a month getting acclimated to their new environment under the care of veterinarians from both countries before making a debut to a limited number of visitors selected through social networking services  and other drawing events.   Everland said the pandas will be displayed for only three hours a day and to a small number of selected visitors until April 20, as it decided to have a test operation of its ""Panda World."" The theme park with the zoo will officially open the place to the public on April 21.   Visitors said they were happy to see the pandas and were satisfied with how the animals were treated.   ""I used to like pandas and even went to Japan to see them,""said 39-year-old Ji Hye-eun. ""There is a lawn and they have enough space to move around, which is good for both the pandas and spectators.""   As part of its efforts to bring tourists to the region, Yongin on Thursday appointed the two pandas as its honorary ambassadors for tourism. The city government said that it will use panda characters in its major events to promote their campaigns and plans. It will give ""special meals"" to two-year-old female Ai Bao and three-year-old male Le Bao, rather than just bamboo, when the number of visitors to Everland increases by 100,000.   In 2014, President Park Geun-hye and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed during Xi's state visit to Seoul to lease the bears for joint research purposes. The animals are also considered to be a symbol of goodwill by Beijing for fostering bilateral relations, as China has a tradition of sending pandas to foreign countries as a sign of friendship.

We knew it was possible because we personally experienced success,"" Katherine Kim, CFO of 325Kamra, said in an interview with Yonhap News Agency. ""If we can reach a broader audience, we can help people make significant biological connections, meet biological family if the family is receptive to it.""Although the organization is open to all adoptees, its primary focus has been on helping biracial adoptees reconnect with their Korean mothers, many of whom worked in camp towns near U.S.military bases in Korea after the 1950-53 Korean War. The U.S. has maintained a troop presence here as a deterrence against North Korea because the conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, leaving the Koreas technically still at war.Kim said she was able to find family on her American father's side when her DNA matched with that of a first cousin, once removed.In the U.S., there are four databases where people can upload their DNA for matches with members who could be as close as one generation removed and as far as many generations apart.South Korea, however, only provides one-to-one testing between a suspected parent and a suspected child. If that test fails, they are left searching from scratch.Reuniting families is not the only aim of 325Kamra, according to its president, Sarah Savidakis. As adoptees get into their 40s and 50s, they often need to know their family's medical histories in order to address their own health issues.""I've had cancer, liver issues,"" she told Yonhap. ""My father's side -- they've had liver issues -- but  don't think it's related to what I have. It's very important for us, for our children.""Some estimates put the number of biracial adoptees from Korea at more than 4,000 between 1953 and 1965. Data from South Korea's health ministry suggests more than 7,000 mixed-race adoptees were sent abroad by the late 1960s, but that number includes disabled adoptees.","to test five koreans who ,test five koreans who have ,to test five koreans ,test five koreans who ,their korean mothers","['american', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Koreans', 'Katherine Kim', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'korean', 'u.s.military', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'North Korea', 'Koreas', 'Kim', 'american', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Sarah Savidakis', 'Yonhap', 'Korea', ""South Korea 's""]",5,"[ 0.          0.          3.         ... -0.59268856  0.39929184

A copy of the center's business cards showed a doctor named Pak Jae-hong serves as the managing director of the establishment. A small billboard was also set up on a road leading to the medical center, with the description ""Korean dispensary,"" according to the RFA.The radio report quoted a source saying that two people, one male doctor and one female nurse, were working there.The hospital is making utmost efforts to lure patients with its newspaper advertisements that promise to cure every kind of terminal disease, the report said. But in reality, the North Korea hospital is prescribing sham medicine and patients who have visited the center have complained about side effects, the report said, adding that it is causing a social problem in Tanzania. Amid such issues, Tanzania's health authorities have issued an order for illegal medical practices to cease operations, it said.A total of 13 North Korean hospitals are in operation in the East African country after the first one opened in 1991, the report also said. The international community, led by the United Nations Security Council, adopted a series of economic sanctions on the communist country after its nuclear test and a long-range rocket launch earlier this year, which were banned under UNSC resolutions on Pyongyang.","thursday maibong sukidor medical korean ,korea has recently opened hospital ,north korea hospital is prescribing ,north korea has recently opened ,of 13 north korean hospitals","['North Korea', 'Tanzania', 'Maibong Sukidor Medical', 'korean', 'east african', 'Dar es Salaam', 'Washington', 'Radio Free Asia', 'Pak Jae - hong', 'korean', 'North Korea', 'Tanzania', 'Tanzania', 'north korean', 'east african', 'the United Nations Security Council', 'UNSC', 'Pyongyang']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38794148  0.97096801

180,180,Concerns rise over nighttime opening of palace,"“I managed to get the last batch of tickets,” said 29-year-old Tina Hsing, a Chinese student here, standing in front of the main gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace in downtown Seoul after sunset.

She said she really did not want to miss the chance to experience Korea’s royal palaces under the moonlight.“I heard tickets  are sold out in minutes for domestic visitors, which makes me glad that I am a foreigner here,” said Hsing.Visitors take a stroll around Gyeongbokgung Palace during the nighttime opening on March 31. Kim Da-sol/The Korea HeraldTrue to what Hsing said, ticket openings to this year’s night opening of Gyeongbokgung Palace -- a total of 25,000 tickets -- hosted by the Cultural Heritage Administration never lasts for more than a day. A nighttime entrance ticket is sold at 3,000 won  and is only available at interpark.com, an online ticket seller, for locals.Due to its popularity, the number of ticket scalpers has also been increasing.The nighttime opening of Gyeongbokgung Palace started in 2011, with no limit on the number of visitors. It was opened for five days twice a year, before extending the after-hours operation to 120 days from March to June as its popularity grew.According to the CHA, the number of visitors varies depending on the weather. On a rainy day, around 1,700 people visit the palace at night, while the number is well above 2,100 on warmer nights.Security loopholesBut despite the soaring number of visitors each year, safety loopholes have become prevalent especially at night.A fire extinguisher is placed next to the building at Gyeongbokgung Palace. Kim Da-sol/The Korea HeraldThe CHA said there are no special measures taken to protect the centuries-old palace buildings except for checking the fire extinguishers, light bulbs and electricity lines on a daily basis. As of 2015, there are 510 fire extinguishers and 230 surveillance cameras installed across the 432,703-square-meter plot of Gyeongbokgung Palace.On one of the nights the palace was opened in the evening last month, a transparent box installed in front of the main entrance to collect banned items from visitors only contained two cigarette lighters. At the time, at least 300 visitors had passed the main gate in the past hour. Security staff said they did not have authority to search each individual’s bag.“Although most visitors do not hand in inflammables , there are CCTVs in every corner to check if anyone is smoking or starting a fire,” said a staff member standing next to the box.Unlike other famous tourist spots like Louvre Museum in Paris, Gyeongbokgung Palace does not require inspection of visitors’ belongings, nor do they have a scanning machine or metal detectors at the entrance.Following the 2015 deadly terror attack in Paris, the city immediately upped the number of security guards and detecting machines at museums and even at public shopping malls, to ensure the safety of visitors as well as security inside the buildings.Such preventive measures do not appear to apply in one of the most visited tourist spots in Korea, seven years after the No. 1 National Treasure Sungnyemun Gate in downtown Seoul was burned down in an arson attack by a local.Located at the heart of the capital city, Gyeongbokgung Palace was the first palace built at the beginning of King Taejo’s reign in 1395. Its name translates to “palace greatly blessed by heaven,” although it has had a traumatic history. The palace is still undergoing restoration, since 90 percent of the buildings were burned down during the Japanese invasion in 1592. Despite such history, the palace attracts hordes of local and foreign visitors day and night, as it is easily accessible by public transport.Short-staffedIn addition to the lack of safety equipment and regulations, the lacking number of security guards is seen as another loophole.“We are all hired by an outsourcing company through the Cultural Heritage Administration. We did receive the basic education on the palace map and security guide, as it is our first month here,” said 60-something man Ki Yong-do, wearing a bright orange vest with a “staff” nametag. “We have a designated zone to look around, keeping visitors away from the closed parts of the palace,” added Ki. But he said his main role is limited to that.The CHA said that 46 out of 53 part-time security staff have been hired just for this year’s night opening through online applications. The rest of the hired staff work at the ticket booth.To control the swelling number of visitors as well as security at night, it was inevitable to request an outsourcing company to hire part-time staff due to shortage of hands, as the number of areas opening to the public keeps increasing each year, authorities said. “From this year, we also opened the areas near five buildings behind the main Geunjeong Palace including a garden near Mount Amisan, while just two buildings were open to public until last year,” said an official at Gyeongbokgung Palace management team.More beautiful at daytimeUnlike European architecture mainly comprised of stone walls, Korea’s Gyeongbokgung Palace has wooden walls, delicately decorated with painting, wood, paper and tiles. Analysts say that’s why it is so beautiful, especially when seen in its natural surroundings without excessive lighting.“Korea’s unique painting and way of stacking roof tiles is something that cannot be redone over several years. That’s why it is taking over a decade to choose the right tree for restoration,” said an official at National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage. “It’s actually prettier during daytime, as the colors revive under the sun.”According to Bae Su-kyung from CHA’s facilities division, lighting up the palace was based on requests from visitors taking professional photographs.“As we are aware of the possible fire hazard from lighting bulbs near the building, we instead use indirect and minimum lighting to create the ambience, by finding the perfect angle of light,” she added.While some visitors constantly complain of the subdued ambience of the palace and the need for more lights inside, the authorities said they were not considering it for the time being, partly also due to high cost.Gyeongbokgung Palace management authorities also added that the most imminent nuisance for them is to fight off the ticket scalpers.“We requested the police to help us by stopping those scalpers. But we were told that there is no legal ground to sue or investigate them,” said Bang Gun-ho, an official at the Cultural Heritage Center.Most of the illegal ticket purchasing happens at online cafes where identities of sellers and purchasers are not revealed. “Every measure has been taken so far to reduce illegal ticket purchasing. But to be honest, we have kind of given up,” said Bang.By Kim Da-sol","downtown seoul after sunset she ,in downtown seoul after sunset ,old tina hsing chinese student ,downtown seoul after sunset ,seoul after sunset she","['Tina Hsing', 'chinese', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'Hsing', 'Kim Da - sol', 'the Korea HeraldTrue', 'Hsing', 'the Cultural Heritage Administration', 'Gyeongbokgung Palace', 'cha', 'Kim Da - sol', 'Korea', 'CHA', 'Louvre Museum', 'Paris', 'Gyeongbokgung Palace', 'Paris', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'japanese', 'the Cultural Heritage Administration', 'Ki Yong - do', 'Ki', 'cha', 'Geunjeong Palace', 'Gyeongbokgung Palace', 'european', 'Korea', 'National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage', 'Bae Su - kyung', 'CHA', 'Gyeongbokgung Palace', 'Bang Gun - ho', 'the Cultural Heritage Center', 'Bang', 'Kim Da - sol']",5,"[ 0.          2.          4.         ... -0.33553559  0.751311

The Korea Herald has made a list of recommended spots to visit.Mount NamsanIn mid-April, forsythia, azaleas and cherry blossoms make for a magnificent view as they blend with each other on the side of the mountain. Riding a cable car that ascends to the peak is a good way to view the springtime in Seoul. Close to N-tower, which sits at the top of the mountain, a traditional hanok restaurant Mokmyuysanbang offers Korean dishes such as bimbimbap and dumpling soup.Gaehwasan Mountain Cherry Blossom FestivalHosted by Gangseo-gu district office, this year’s cherry blossom festival on Mount Gaehwasan will be held on April 23. A variety of activities related to flowers, including writing a flower card, a flower concert, flower face painting will be put on for visitors. Yeouido Spring Flower FestivalOne of the most famous flower festivals in Seoul takes place for a week every April, when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom. Yunjung-ro is the street located behind the National Assembly Building, where more than a thousand cherry trees are lined up along a 1.5-kilometer stretch. This year’s festival will be open from April 4 to April 10.West Lake ParkWhen strolling down the paths along the lake, huge cherry trees by the water welcome visitors. Located by Gimpo International Airport, the water in the fountain at the lake trembles as the nearby airplanes take off, setting off the fountain’s automatic music function. Geumcheon-gu Cherry Blossom RoadOn a four-lane road in northeastern Seoul’s Geumcheon-gu, you can see a cornucopia of cherry blossom trees. Along the 3-kilometer-long road, drivers often feel they are driving through a flower tunnel. Seoul National CemeteryNot many casual passersby notice the road leading to the West gate of the Seoul National Cemetery. Its view is hidden by the flowers of weeping cherry trees. The weeping cherry trees signify “loyalty of people of national merit” in the language of flowers.Eungbongsan Mountain Forsythia FestivalThis year’s forsythia festival on Mount Eungbongsan will be held from April 1-3. Activities such as music concerts, bouldering and sketch contests have drawn hordes of visitors each year during the festival, when the entire mountain comes to life with yellow forsythia flowers.Seoul ForestSeoul Forest, Seoul’s main ecological park, is located near Ttukseom Island with 85,000 square meters of nature, including an insect garden and eco learning center. The area is frequently visited by families, especially in springtime.Seokchon LakeAlready crowded with visitors to the Lotte World theme park and its associated malls, the driveway along Seokchon Lake offers a magnificent sight during its cherry blossom festival in April, as the colorful trees create a beautiful scene. Children’s Grand ParkLocated in northwestern Seoul over 530,000 square meters of green space, Children’s Grand Park offers families a fun experience, with a zoo, botanical garden and flower park. Decades-old flower trees in the park are must-sees at which people line up to take photos.Jungnangcheon StreamOne of the best-known roads for spring flowers, Jungnangcheon Stream boasts various types of flowers such as roses, canola and Russian irises. Traveling along the stream by bike or car provides a relaxing view of flowers and the flowing water.Jungnang Camping ForestBefore it was made into a campsite, the area used to be a pear orchard and still has some trees. Fully equipped with a spa, public showers and toilets, a night at the spring park is a popular option among city-dwelling campers in spring and summer.Dream Forest ParkThe first thing you will notice in the park are the big cherry blossom trees that line the road. But what attracts even more visitors are the restaurants and picnic areas located inside the forest park, where couples and families can enjoy a romantic ambience under blossom-laden trees.Samcheong ParkLocated near a Hanok village and cafe area popular with tourists, Samcheong Park is usually quiet despite its location in the middle of the city. Bamboo, cherry blossoms and plum trees create a scenic view here, attracting locals as well as foreign visitors.

GAPADO ISLAND, Jeju Special Self-Governing Province -- Bundled up in padded coats and scarves, a group of visitors braved the cold, their hair flapping in the wind as they disembarked the ferry to Gapado Island.The name Gapado comes from the meaning “island of wind and waves,” and the island’s village head, 61-year-old Kim Dong-ok says there is a reason for that.“There’s an old saying that goes ‘wind  is strong enough to bend a cow’s horn,’” he said, greeting the group of journalists last Saturday.But the wind might also be bending the fortunes of this island, which has seen its population dwindling in recent years, in the form of green energy.Korea’s second-most southern island, Gapado is just a 15-minute ferry ride from Moseulpo port on Jejudo Island. As of last year, a little more than 240 residents lived here. Over the last two decades, the number went down by 800. “To fight the declining population here, we came up with something called the ‘Gapado Project,’” Kim said.Unlike nearby Udo Island or Marado Island, Gapado Island had not so been lucky with the number of guests because of its smaller significance as a tourist destination. So in 2009, the residents started its Carbon Free Island plan with the help of Jeju Special Self-Governing Province. Residents started off by replacing electricity poles with underground cables and installed two wind generators and solar panels on the roofs of houses.After four years of renovation and some 11.9 billion won  of investment, villagers could better see the clear skies with the highest utility installation being the island’s solitary 2-meter-high telephone pole. For now, 70 percent of the energy that the community needs comes from the two wind generators located at the center of the town. One in 4 houses is also installed with 3-kilowatt solar power generating panels. It takes an average of 20 million won to 30 million won a year to operate, maintain and repair each wind generator.Solar power generating panels are installed on the roof of a resident's house on Gapado Island. Thanks to the collaboration between the residents and the provincial office, the number of visitors reached 94,000 last year, marking a 36 percent increase from 69,000 in 2011. Crowds of visitors flock to see the beautiful sea and the fields of green barley without the visual interruption of utility poles and equipment.According to the villagers, the move brought more than just an increase in visitor numbers.Installing solar panels on the roofs was expensive in the beginning –- a total of 12 million won each -- with 90 percent of the cost paid by the district office. But once installed, the monthly power bill was cut by half. As of March 2016, 11 more families in the village have applied to install solar panels on their roofs.“Ever since we changed our main power source from diesel to renewable energy, a monthly electricity bill is just around 7,000 won . It used to be over 20,000 won,” Kim said.What happens when the cloudy weather hampers solar panels and wind generation? A three-story building located near the wind generators called the Microgrid Center, furnished with devices and remote-control computing systems from Korea Electric Power Corp., activates in response to such changes in supply and demand.“The Microgrid Center is where we keep the energy storage system. It is like a giant battery pack that works when the main device is low on power,” said Lee Young-suk who manages the center. Lee Young-suk, manager at Gapado Island’s Microgrid Center, points the screen of the center’s remote-controlled computing systems. Kim Da-sol/The Korea Herald“We can only store 1 megawatt-hour at the current storage system here. But after we expand the room for the storage in June, we will be able to run the island 100 percent by wind and solar energy, even on cloudy days,” said Lee.“Then we will not need diesel anymore. Diesel will soon be an optional energy for us.“Maybe in 15 years, we will be able to export our stored renewable energy to other countries, like to Southeast Asian countries,” Lee added. Transforming the area into a place where eco-friendly energy replaces fossil fuels has actually been Jeju Gov. Won Hee-ryong’s longtime dream.“Jejudo Island is the only place that can make the 100 percent carbon-free dream come true. Gapado Island is a test bed , also to incorporate more electric cars here,” Won told the reporters during a press conference in Jeju on Friday. “The Environment Ministry and the district office here are putting the fullest effort to see what a carbon-free island would look like. We are providing subsidies to residents so they can enjoy the full benefit.”As of 2015, 40 percent of South Korea’s eco-friendly electric cars run in Jeju Province, a total of 2,366 units. The Environment Ministry announced it would seek to get 4,333 more electric cars on the roads by the end of 2016.Won added that electric cars, one day, would become ordinary daily devices just like televisions or freezers at home.“We will also build more smart charging stations around downtown areas and by the main tourist spots to increase the distribution rate among local residents as well as tourists to build fundamental carbon-free infrastructure here,” said Won.“You can take a short break just like at highway food stalls while you wait to get your car fully charged.”So far, there are 49 charging stations that provide 20-minute quick charging for cars in Jeju, while there are 95 in Seoul and about 450 more across the country. There are three electric car charging stations on Gapado Island, with four electric cars and five electric motorbikes provided for use by residents and tourists in a similar way to Seoul’s Ddaleungee bike-sharing program. Villagers have agreed to get rid of the remaining nine diesel vehicles on the island and use electric buses instead by the end of this year. Jejudo Island’s idea of creating a Carbon Free Island gained attention at the recent United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Paris in November.“ by replacing its entire fleet of cars with electric vehicles, meeting 100 percent of its energy needs through renewable energy sources,” said President Park Geun-hye said at the conference.Won is now looking beyond those goals for Gapado.“Beyond our goal, beyond those concrete numbers, we are seeing this as a project to make an island of nature. The entire Island will become the nature museum, in a blend with art-like nature and eco-friendly lifestyle, like Naoshima Island in Japan.”By Kim Da-sol","green barley fields on saturday ,wind generators overlook green barley ,barley fields on saturday gapado ,barley fields on saturday ,generators overlook green barley fields","['GAPADO ISLAND', 'Jeju Special Self - Governing Province -- bundle', 'Gapado', 'Kim Dong - ok', 'Korea', 'Gapado', 'Moseulpo', 'Kim', 'Jeju Special Self - Governing Province', 'Kim', 'Korea Electric Power Corp.', 'Microgrid Center', 'Lee Young - suk', 'Lee Young - suk', 'Microgrid Center', 'Kim Da - sol', 'Lee', 'Diesel', 'southeast asian', 'Lee', 'Jeju', 'Won Hee - ryong ’s', 'Island', 'Gapado Island', 'Won', 'Jeju', 'the Environment Ministry', 'South Korea ’s', 'Jeju Province', 'the Environment Ministry', 'Won', 'Jeju', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'United Nations Conference on Climate Change', 'Paris', 'Park Geun', 'Won', 'Gapado', 'Island', 'Japan', 'Kim Da - sol']",0,"[ 0.          2.          1.         ... -0.64444107  0.05738255

I’m pretty sure that the AlphaGo match brought back the popularity of Go,” said the 65-year-old, who has taught Go for the past three decades. “This is definitely a good sign.” Renewed interest in the Go game is sweeping through South Korea. On Sunday, Korean Go champion Lee Se-dol achieved a historic first victory against Google’s artificial intelligence AlphaGo in the fourth of a five-game match. At a children’s Go competition held by the Korea Baduk Association on Sunday, the number of new participants rose to 20 students in just one day. This is double the daily average. Around 300 students join the competition regularly every month, the association said. The fad has also hit colleges as more individuals are expressing interest to join Go clubs.“Compared to the past, a lot more students are asking through the school’s online community how they can join the Go club. I’m sure the number of applications is much larger this semester than before,” said Park Hyo-jeong, who heads the Go club at Ewha Womans University. Go used to be a game for the elite in the past. It has been a common game for man in the street since the country’s liberation in 1945. While the number of Koreans who played Go reached 10 million in the 1990s, this number has dwindled over the years, Go industry sources said. According to a survey by Gallup Korea in 2013, only 25 percent of people here said they knew how to play Go and of this proportion, over half of their playing abilities were at the elementary level. “Go has been a game for all people regardless of class. The game has soothed people’s sadness and relieved stress from a long time ago. Since the game requires much time and patience, creating a boom in the game is not as easy as other games,” said KBA official Chung Dong-hwan. “But I can see that the whole country is into Go now.” Bookstores are benefitting from the growing interest in Go. Kyobo Book, the largest bookstore chain in Korea, saw Go book sales rise by 7 percent compared to last year. Online bookstore Aladdin, has also seen a jump in Go books sales by 50 percent on-year. Of the top five Go books sold in the first week of this month, four were written by Go champion Lee Se-dol. For some retailers, Go products are also flying off the shelves.

Among these customers, there were over 80 percent more customers in their 20s compared to the previous year, according to Auction officials. “Not only Koreans are interested in Go, but also people from other countries.

In 2006, with the help of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, the community transformed itself through what they called the “Naksan Project.” A total of 68 artists gathered to paint walls and install sculptures. An ordinary village soon turned into a booming tourist spot. Despite its off-the-beaten-path location, the mural village has become overcrowded with local and foreign tourists, artsy cafes and stores. But the popularity of the village is not so welcomed by residents.“All those coffee shops prospered but they’re run by outsiders who come in to make money,” said a woman surnamed Koo, a resident of Ihwa-dong for 30 years.“To be honest, villagers here don’t see any advantages. Noise and trash are what’s left behind ever since our home became a mural village,” Koo added. Signs posted on a pole in Ihwa-dong read, “Do not enter the alley,” “Do not take pictures inside the alley. There are people living here.” There are about 10 mural villages in Seoul, each operated and supervised by the autonomous district office and its public design division. In response to residents’ complaints over privacy and littering, Jongno-gu has run the “Silent Campaign” since 2013, which aims to spread a quiet and nonintrusive sightseeing culture.“We hand out leaflets and put up posters to promote the campaign. At the tourist information center, we play animated videos to help visitors understand that the  village is also someone’s home,” said Lee Sun-min from Jongno-Gu’s tourism division.However, residents in the area say that their voice should be heard more and that such themed villages should not be established without regulations. “I don’t know what the district office is doing for us. No single trash bin is installed in our village. Newly painted stairs and walls actually do not provide us a better quality of life,” said Yoo, 78, who runs a corner shop in Ihwa Mural Village.A resident walks into his home where the wall is painted with a mural in Ihwa-dong. “I wake up early at 5 a.m. in the morning to clean up the street. All I ask is for visitors not to leave their trash on the fence or in between windows,” Yoo added.“Or maybe, residents  will have to ask authorities to erase the murals,” she said. In 2010, a popular local TV show “One Day Two Nights” featured a mural of two white angel wings in the village. After the show aired, the house with the mural of angel wings was inundated by visitors which eventually led to the resident removing the artwork.By Kim Da-sol [한글판]관광객들이 버린 쓰레기는 주민들 몫? 구청은 시종일관 “쓰레기통 추가 설치 없다”‘이화동 달동네’라는 이름이 더 익숙했던 이화벽화마을 주민들에게 지난 10년간 많은 변화가 생겼다.줄지어 마을 곳곳에서 사진을 찍는 관광객들이 평일에도 넘쳐났고, 골목 어귀마다 카페와 먹을거리를 파는 가게들이 들어섰다. 하지만, 그 중 가장 큰 변화는 바로 사라진 공용 쓰레기통과 관광객들이 집 앞, 창틀 사이, 담벼락 위에 놓고 간 쓰레기들이었다. 실제로 기자가 14일 낮 찾아가 본 이화벽화마을에는 테이크아웃용 플라스틱 컵, 종이컵, 휴지, 대학로에서 받아온 팸플릿 등 온갖 쓰레기들이 “쓰레기통 없는 마을” 곳곳에 버려져 있었다.주민들은 언제부턴가 골목 군데군데 있던 공용 쓰레기통이 사라진 이유를 모르겠다며 불편함을 호소했다. 마을 초입에서 슈퍼를 운영하고 유 모 씨는 더는 동네 곳곳에 쓰레기가 쌓이는 것을 볼 수 없다며 직접 종이박스를 두어 관광객들이 플라스틱 컵이나 쓰레기를 버릴 수 있는 간이 쓰레기통을 가게 앞에 놓기도 하였다.하지만, 유 모 씨에게 돌아온 것은 16만 8천 원의 벌금을 부과한 종로구청의 통지서였다. 이에 종로구청 관계자는 “이는 쓰레기 무단 투기를 줄이려는 구의 방침”이라며 “도시 비우기 사업의 일환으로 꼭 필요한 데가 아니면 쓰레기통을 없앨 것”이라고 말했다. 서울시 자료에 따르면 종로구에 설치된 가로휴지통의 수는 매년 감소하는 추세다. 2014년 자료에 따르면 관광객 인구 수가 높은 종로구에는 총 129개의 공용 쓰레기통이 설치되어 있다. 이는 공용 쓰레기통 1개를 구민 1,282명이 사용하는 셈이다. 최근 약 900여 개의 쓰레기통을 추가로 설치한 강남구와 비교했을 때, 구민 671명당 1개의 쓰레기통을 사용하는 강남구의 약 두 배 정도 되는 숫자이다. 종로구 관계자는 이화벽화마을이 종로구의 유명 관광지 중 한 곳으로 수많은 관광객을 맞이하고 있음에도 “무단 투기를 막고자 추가 쓰레기통 설치에 대한 계획은 없다”라고 일관했다.코리아 헤럴드/김다솔 기자","10 mural villages in seoul ,2010 popular local tv show ,mural villages in seoul each ,매년 감소하는 추세다 2014년 자료에 ,mural villages in seoul","['Naksan Park', 'Seoul', 'the Ministry of Culture and Tourism', 'Koo', 'Ihwa', 'Koo', 'sign', 'Ihwa', 'Seoul', 'Jongno - gu', 'Lee Sun - min', 'Jongno - Gu ’s', 'Yoo', 'Ihwa Mural Village', 'Ihwa - dong', 'Yoo', 'Kim Da - sol', '없다”라고']",5,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.20779142  0.36546111

Due to constantly rising temperatures worldwide caused by global warming, South Korea’s local governments voiced concerns that National Arbor Day should be held earlier in a more suitable tree-planting season.Currently, Arbor Day falls on April 5, when nationwide tree-planting campaigns and events kick off.The Korea Forest Service, which has been hosting Arbor Day over the past 70 years, said changing the date would be inappropriate due to its historical significance.The idea of Arbor Day was first introduced in 1946 to honor the date when Silla Kingdom’s King Munmu planted a tree to celebrate the unification of the three Kingdoms of Korea in 676.On the same date in 1493, Joseon era King Sung-jong kick-started the agricultural industry in Korea, encouraging farming to the people.However, because of global warming, city representatives say tree planting should take place earlier.Jeju Special Self-Governing Province already held its tree-planting event on Feb. 15. Suwon and seven other cities in Gyeonggi Province will hold tree-planting events later this month, at least 10 days earlier than the designated Arbor Day. “We have been holding citywide tree-planting events in March  for the past seven or eight years,” said Choi Jae-gun, an official from Suwon City’s park planning department. “Because we decided to plant more trees in parks and boulevards, April is too late. Trees already develop roots around March, since temperatures in downtown areas are warmer than in mountainous regions,” he added.According to the National Institute of Forest Service, 6.5 degrees Celsius is the most suitable temperature for planting trees. But Korea is seeing temperatures rise higher every year due to global warming.This is not the first time the government has tried to change the date. In 2009, then-President Roh Moo-hyun urged moving Arbor Day earlier for the better growth of trees. However, his Cabinet opposed the decision, opting to keep the date for its historical significance.By Kim Da-sol","april when nationwide tree planting ,year due to global warming ,tree planting event on feb ,celebrate arbor day in 2015 ,tree planting events in march","['Park Geun', 'South Korea ’s', 'National Arbor Day', 'the Korea Forest Service', 'Silla Kingdom ’s', 'Korea', 'Joseon', 'King Sung - jong', 'Korea', 'Jeju Special Self - Governing Province', 'Suwon', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Choi Jae - gun', 'Suwon City ’s', 'the National Institute of Forest Service', 'Korea', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Cabinet', 'Kim Da - sol']",18,"[ 0.          0.          3.         ... -0.59048551  0.71532565

The city also plans to build more bus parking lots to drop off visitors.Seoul’s northeastern district Seongbuk-gu’s Seongbuk-ro, home to galleries such as Gansong Art Museum and historical sites including monk Manhae Han Yong-wun’s house, Simwujang, will be given a much wider sidewalk. The city government said it would rebuild the six-lane-road into a two-lane road, expanding walking space for pedestrians.Shin Yong-mok, the director of City Transportation Headquarters, said in a statement that, “While Seoul used to focus on constructing the metropolitan downtown area, it is now transforming into a pedestrian-friendly city that can attract local residents and visitors.”By Kim Da-sol","three new streets in seoul ,new streets in seoul ,new streets in seoul as ,seoul metropolitan government said wednesday ,has designated three new streets","['the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Seoul', 'Majo - ro', 'Hanyang University', 'Seongdong - gu', 'Seokchonhosu', 'Songpa', 'Shinchon ’s Yonse - ro', 'Seoul City', 'Seongdong - gu', 'Hanyang University', 'Seokchonhosu', 'Songpa', 'Lotte World Shopping Mall', 'City Transportation Headquarters', 'Seoul', 'Gansong Art Museum', 'Simwujang', 'Shin Yong - mok', 'City Transportation Headquarters', 'Seoul', 'Kim Da - sol']",4,"[ 0.          3.          0.         ... -0.30860752  0.43768343

Seoul Metropolitan Government said Wednesday it will expand its stray cat neutering project such as by providing subsidies of up to 75 million won  per civic organization which carries out the “Trap-Neuter-Return” project. The TNR is a project that captures and sterilizes free-roaming cats to control their numbers. The TNR costs about 130,000 won per surgery, which has added burden to the budgets of civic groups.  As of this year, about 250,000 cats are estimated to live on the street, with only about 11 percent neutered.Stray cats can be easily exposed to various viruses or diseases such as herpes virus or feline panleukopenia. As public complaints escalated over stray cats, the city has taken various measures to reduce their numbers. Starting from November last year, the city has run dozens of cat feeding spots in four regions to attract and capture animals for the TNR. It is considering expanding feeding places across the city.As of January, about 50 percent of stray cats in the feeding spots have been neutered. The city is seeking to raise the neutering rate by 70 percent by June, the authorities said. With 750 million won of budget, the city aims to neuter about 8,000 stray cat this year with the help of civic participation. The city neuters about 6,000 stray cats per year, officials said.The city also vowed to quarterly hold TNR Days on which veterinarians conduct on-site TNR for 50 cats in a day. To better attract the stray cats, the city will work with those who regularly feed the animals and are familiar with them. “To seek the harmonious coexistence of people and animals, the number of stray cats must be cut, and neutering is the most effective measure to do so,” said Kim Chang-bo who is in charge of the public health affairs at Seoul City. Animal rights activists, however, have expressed skepticism over the project’s effectiveness, citing the characteristics of cats. “Since cats are colony animals, the surgery is not effective unless 70 percent of each colony cats are captured and neutered at one go,” said Park So-yeon, the president of civic group Coexistence of Animal Rights on Earth, told The Korea Herald. “After neutering, it is also important to return the neutered cats to their original colonies and not to random ones. If not, the un-neutered cats are likely attack the neutered cats, which have elevated aggression levels, causing them to run away from colonies. This will only lead to inflow of new stray cats.”Meanwhile, organizations interested in the city’s neutering subsidies should submit applications from March 17-18 at http://ssd.wooribank.com/seoul.

The INU said it aims to offer students what it called “integrated globalization” education. Participants of the inaugural ceremony of the College of Law, Commerce and Public Affairs of Incheon National University pose for a group photo on the school campus in Songdo, Incheon on Tuesday. The idea for the college began in 2014, after the Education Ministry selected the INU for its University for Creative Korea project. The government-subsidy CK project is centered on aiding universities across countries to develop their specialties, which in INU’s case, is global education.Since then, the university has commenced creating a cross-discipline education program it calls the “Global Excellence Program,” with 20 professors from departments of law, economics, international trade, political science and international studies, as well as public administration. In keeping with the Park Geun-hye administration’s education policy to foster individuals with skills custom fit to meet demands of society, its programs have stressed coordination of the university with corporations. It said it benchmarked Hanze University of Applied Sciences, Groningen and Windesheim University of Applied Sciences in Netherlands in designing programs that foster graduates with cross-discipline knowledge.English and creative writing are included, along with respective “integrated” majors of each student, who will be given opportunities to go abroad for an exchange student or internship program. “Through launching the College of Law, Commerce and Public Affairs,  will foster talent that will roam in international workplaces,” said the university’s president Choi Sung-eul.Lee Chan-keun, a professor from INU’s division of international trade who also heads the GEP, said INU will cooperate with universities from the Netherlands, Germany, the U.S., China and Indonesia.INU said that launching the new college is in keeping with the government policy to propel Songdo International City -- where the university is based -- as the hub of its “global knowledge service.” Knowledge services refer to providing content-based -- for example data or information -- organizational outputs to meet external user wants or needs.Songdo International City, based in Incheon Free Economic Zone, has become home to industries related to information technology and biotechnology, along with education and medicine.

210,210,Drills to map out endgame scenario for Pyongyang,"The Korea-U.S. joint Key Resolve drill in 2015 (Yonhap)Next month’s joint military drills by South Korea and the United States will simulate an endgame scenario for North Korea that has the military recover the entire territory of the peninsula after the collapse of the Kim Jong-un regime, a military official said Thursday.The relatively rare simulation -- military operations are usually focused on hitting the North...","The Korea-U.S. joint Key Resolve drill in 2015 Next month’s joint military drills by South Korea and the United States will simulate an endgame scenario for North Korea that has the military recover the entire territory of the peninsula after the collapse of the Kim Jong-un regime, a military official said Thursday.The relatively rare simulation -- military operations are usually focused on hitting the North Korean leadership in Pyongyang -- coincided with Defense Minister Han Min-koo saying that the annual war games would be “the biggest yet,” in line with President Park Geun-hye’s hard-line policy toward North Korea.Seoul and Washington are slated to carry out annual Key Resolve and Eagle Foal drills from March 7 to April 30. Key Resolve, a computer-simulation exercise, is conducted for two weeks.According to the official speaking on anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, the war game is a multiple-stage drill that simulates war breaking out, military operations surrounding the North Korean capital of Pyongyang and operations that take place in the later stages of the war.“This year’s operations will involve recovering key facilities that are located deep within North Korea, all the way near its northern borders,” the official said. This means that the war game scenarios will simulate the military taking over the entire peninsula, beyond the North Korean capital.The Koreas -- technically still at war, as the 1950-53 Korean War was ended by an armistice, not a treaty -- have been baring teeth at each other since Pyongyang’s recent nuclear testing and rocket launch. But the official said that the scenario was not affected in any way by recent North Korea provocations, stressing that it was already agreed upon last year. He added that Key Resolve had been conducted under the same scenario before.He explained that the biggest elements of North Korean threat are its leadership under Kim Jong-un and its weapons of mass destruction, which means it is important to neutralize related facilities north of Pyongyang.The North’s main nuclear complex is located in Yongbyon, in the northwest corner of the country.“The scenario will include the special operations forces being deployed to border areas adjacent to China and Russia,” the official explained. The troops will attempt to keep the Chinese and Russian military in check, while trying to avoid altercations, he said. In light of the standoff with the North, President Park on Tuesday said that the North must realize that its nuclear programs will lead to its downfall. Washington, on its part, showed off strength and its alliance with Seoul by deploying its strategic assets here, including F-22 Raptor stealth jets. Military officials have stated that this year’s drills will be “a strong warning to the Kim Jong-un regime,” which will show that the allies have the capacity to neutralize North Korean threats. According to Defense Minister Han, 290,000 of South Korean military personnel will take part, which is about 1.5 times more than usual. Around 15,000 soldiers from the U.S., including the Combat Aviation Brigade and Marine Expeditionary Brigade, will participate, which is also double the annual average.This year’s drills will also include the new Operation Plan 5015, which reportedly encompasses plans for preemptive strikes against key facilities in North Korea, such as missile launch sites. It is the first time OPLAN 5015 is being applied in the annual drills since formally being approved last year. The allies will also enhance surveillance against potential provocations from Pyongyang during the drills.By Yoon Min-sik","next month joint military drills ,key resolve drill in 2015 ,north president park on tuesday ,resolve drill in 2015 next ,the annual war games","['Korea', 'U.S.', 'Key Resolve', 'South Korea', 'the United States', 'North Korea', 'Kim Jong - un', 'north korean', 'Pyongyang', 'Defense', 'Han Min - koo', 'Park Geun', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Key Resolve', 'Eagle Foal', 'Key Resolve', 'north korean', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'Koreas', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'Key Resolve', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Pyongyang', 'North ’s', 'Yongbyon', 'China', 'Russia', 'chinese', 'russian', 'Park', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'Kim Jong - un', 'north korean', 'Defense', 'Han', 'south korean', 'U.S.', 'the Combat Aviation Brigade', 'Marine Expeditionary Brigade', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Yoon Min - sik']",3,"[ 0.          2.          1.         ... -0.3296248   0.5197711

KAI, South Korea's sole aircraft manufacturer that makes KT-1 basic and T-50 advanced trainers, as well as Surion utility helicopter, is taking part in the six-day event that ends on Sunday.The air show at the Changi Exhibition Center is Asia's largest, with some 1,000 companies from 40 countries showing off their products to prospective buyers from around the world this year. KAI, along with four other South Korean aerospace companies, opened a dedicated exhibition booth.Based in Sacheon, 437 kilometers southeast of Seoul, KAI said its CEO Ha Sung-yong met with Orlando Carvalho, the executive vice president of aeronautics at Lockheed Martin Corp. on Tuesday, pledging to work closely together to win the U.S. Air Force's T-X program. The program, which aims to procure jet trainers for the United States military, could lead to some 1,000 aircraft being built worth 50 trillion won . This includes the initial batch of 350 planes, as well as aggressor aircraft that will be used to simulate enemy fighters. The aggressor fighters are used to train front-line fighter pilots.KAI said the formal announcement for bidding is expected to be made late this year, with the final winner to be selected in the second half of 2017.KAI, which built the T-50 supersonic jet in cooperation with Lockheed, said winning the T-X order could allow the company to effectively control the global jet trainer market for the time being. The company said that it is focused on the T-50 but is pitching for additional sales of its KT-1 propeller driven trainer and wants to sign an agreement to sell its Surion chopper that has yet to win an export deal.   While exports are a key consideration, it is also forging closer ties with foreign partners for its Korean Fighter Experimental light civil helicopter and light armed helicopter programs, KAI said.The KF-X is Seoul's plan to replace its aging fleet of F-4 and F-5 jets, while helicopter projects are designed to give the company greater presence in the world's aerospace market.KAI, meanwhile, said the South Korea's Air Force's Black Eagles acrobatic team flying eight T-50Bs received considerable attention from potential buyers. The T-50Bs are modified versions of the stock T-50 and have been used to highlight the jet's flying capabilities.","aerospace companies opened dedicated exhibition ,to win new aircraft export ,at this year singapore airshow ,martin corp on tuesday pledging ,win new aircraft export orders","['Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd.', 'Singapore Airshow', 'KAI', ""South Korea 's"", 'KAI', 'south korean', 'Sacheon', 'Seoul', 'KAI', 'Ha Sung - yong', 'Orlando Carvalho', 'Lockheed Martin Corp.', ""the U.S. Air Force 's"", 'the United States', 'KAI', 'Lockheed', 'Surion', 'Korean Fighter Experimental', 'KAI', 'Seoul', 'KAI', ""South Korea 's"", ""Air Force 's"", 'Black Eagles']",18,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.37081566  0.53959996

The public contribution fee will go to improving the transportation infrastructure to reduce traffic congestion around the area, improving water quality and building public sports facilities, the company said. The top two floors of the main tower will have an observatory that will be open to the public, it added. A large public plaza will also be built for performances, public events and fairs.The city said the Global Business Center will serve as a center point of the “MICE industry cluster” that the city has been pushing to establish in Gangnam.

According to a population outlook for 2033 released by the Seoul government on Tuesday, the number of aged people in the capital city will reach 2.39 million in 2033, up from 1.08 million in 2013.The report said that the city's senior population will break the 20-percent line in 2024, leaving a decrease in the number of economically active people. This will also naturally increase the burden for younger generations to support their senior dependents.In 2013, Seoul's population type was classified as a ""water pot"" in which the middle aged group formed the largest portion of the population. In 2033, the type will be transformed into an inverted pyramid, where there are more senior citizens than young people.According to the outlook, the average age in Seoul will be 48.6 years old in 2033, 9.6 years up from 39 in 2013.The number of economically active people aged from 15 to 64 in 2033 will hit 63.6 percent of the population, with 6.02 million, down from 76.4 percent with 7.58 million in 2013, a decrease of 1.56 million over 20 years. During the same period, the number of people older than 65 years will increase to 2.39 million from 1.08 million in 2013, leaving the younger and middle aged groups heavily burdened with supporting them.This will also cause generational conflict to deepen among the age groups, the city's population outlook said.The number of advanced citizens subject to receive sustenance expenses per every 100 people will rise to 57.2 people in 2033 from 30.9 in 2013.The number of schooling population aged six to 21 years old is expected to fall to 1.14 million in 2033 from 1.63 million in 2013, the report said.It said the total population of Seoul is predicted to be 9.46 million in 2033, and probably will break the 9-million line soon after.","the seoul government on tuesday ,reach 39 million in 2033 ,senior dependents in 2013 seoul ,in 2033 the seoul metropolitan ,seoul government on tuesday","['Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Seoul']",4,"[ 0.          5.          0.         ... -0.86059356  0.29691607

YonhapUnder the pledge, the Seoul Metropolitan Government will arrange for conglomerates to discuss with local small businesses measures that will allow both to thrive alongside one another, before they plan to construct shopping malls or super supermarkets -- SSM, or chain stores operated by large retailers. Before companies acquire mall construction permit from authorities, the city will assess the mall’s potential impact on neighboring small markets and businesses, and map out possible measures to reduce damage to sales, officials said. Currently, the potential impact assessment is autonomously conducted by large businesses that push for SSMs or shopping malls. The conglomerates are allowed to submit the assessment document one month before they register for the malls. “The deadline for the impact assessment does not allow both parties to negotiate fully since it is carried out after the entire construction is completed,” Seoul officials said. The city is currently conducting a commercial influence assessment of Lotte Shopping Mall in the Digital Media Center district in northwest Seoul before its construction proposal is submitted to the city’s construction committee. In a bid to curb unfair trade practices between franchise headquarters and chain stores, the city also vowed to introduce a fair trade certificate system later this year. The franchise companies will be graded in three parts -- fairness, profitability and stability -- to motivate companies to pursue fair trade. The city also said it would enact an “economic democratization” ordinance in May. The new ordinance will allow the city to form a new team that is officially in charge of handling economic democratization measures. It will also release an “economic democratization index” starting from next year to evaluate the changes in the daily life of citizens.

The satellite North Korea launched into space earlier this week has achieved orbit, but whether it is operating normally has not been verified, the Defense Ministry said Tuesday.On Sunday, the North launched a rocket carrying the Kwangmyongsong-4 satellite, but the outside world viewed it as a cover for testing the country's intercontinental ballistic missile technology.The North Korean rocket was the same shape as the Unha-3 rocket the communist country launched in December 2012, a ministry official said in an analysis of the recent North Korean test.""The proportion of the long-range missile's diameter and length is 2.4 to 30, the same ,"" he said.Whereas the satellite the North sent into orbit in 2012 weighed about 100 kilograms, the one launched this time was heavier, the official said.Given the identical size and trajectory as well as the similar payloads, the latest rocket appears to be of the same specification as the rocket launched four years ago, he noted, adding that there has been ""little technical progress"" in the missile development.Currently, the North is presumed to be in possession of a long-range missile with a maximum range of 12,000 kilometers with the capacity to carry a payload weighing about 250 kg, he said.The latest addition of one more successful test may have bolstered the ""stability"" of the missile and ""credibility"" of the missile's components, according to the official.In the initial analysis of the recent North Korean launch, the ministry also concluded that the three-stage rocket successfully separated all of its three stages before putting the satellite into orbit.After the rocket lifted off at the Dongchang-ri launch site in the northwest Sunday morning, South Korea's Aegis destroyer detected the rocket shedding its first stage in the Yellow Sea and the pairing in waters southwest of Jeju Island.But the South Korean radar lost track of the rocket right after the pairing separation stage.The official said the second stage may have fallen in waters east of the Philippine island of Luzon, citing the fresh result of a simulation analysis.""The locations where the first, second stages and the pairing landed are the same as those of Unha-3,"" another official said.Despite the recent test, North Korea has not achieved the critical ""re-entry"" technology needed to bring a ballistic missile that was fired into space back into the atmosphere, he said.Now the North Korean satellite is orbiting and passing above South Korea four times a day.But it has yet to be verified whether the satellite is sending signals properly, the official said, suggesting the latest North Korean launch was a long-range missile test disguised in a peaceful space vehicle launch.Currently, the satellite and the third stage are rotating in their orbits, but the third stage will soon lose its orbit and burn up, he said, adding that whether the satellite will keep its orbit should also be verified down the road.","satellite launch held on monday ,payloads the latest rocket ,monday the satellite north korea ,sunday the north launched rocket ,the latest north korean launch","['North Koreans', 'Kim Il - sing', 'North Korea', 'the Defense Ministry', 'Kwangmyongsong-4', 'north korean', 'unha-3', 'communist', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'Dongchang', ""South Korea 's"", 'south korean', 'philippine', 'unha-3', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'South Korea', 'north korean']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28709158  0.38655192

Seongnam, some 20 kilometers away from Seoul, has drawn attention among other cities and provinces nationwide in recent months as the mayor pushed for several policy experiments such as the universal basic income for the young. In a New Year’s address, Mayor Lee, the second-term mayor of Seongnam, expressed his determination to set the city as an example for other municipalities to benchmark against. “For the past year, Seongnam proved that a city is able to stabilize its finances by eradicating corruption, reducing waste of budget and imposing taxes more fairly,” Lee said in the speech. Lee has normalized the debt-stricken city since he took office as the mayor of Seongnam in 2010, paying down the debt of 730 billion won  through budget cutbacks. In 2014, Seongnam was evaluated as the most financially independent city in the nation. “With the finances, the city was able to implement the nation’s highest-quality welfare programs,” Lee said. “Seongnam is more just a city, setting itself as an example and standard for the rest of 226 cities in Korea to follow.” Seongnam, which has a population of nearly 1 million, has expanded welfare for every citizen through three key programs -- Youth Dividends, free school uniforms and post-pregnancy care system.Applicants line up to benefit from the city’s Youth Dividends. Seongnam became the first city in the nation to carry out a policy, named Youth Dividends, to financially support young adults who need living expenses and job training fees amid high unemployment. The jobless rate among young people between 15 and 29 years old stood at 9.2 percent nationwide last year, much higher than the 3.6 percent unemployment rate for the country as a whole, according to government data.Under the scheme, the municipality offers gift vouchers worth 500,000 won each year to Seongnam residents aged 24 who have lived in the city for at least three years. The vouchers can only be used in stores, restaurants, gas stations and parking lots in Seongnam, which the mayor said would boost the local economy. Inspired by the idea of an unconditional basic income that is increasingly being discussed in Europe, the city allocated a total of 11.3 billion won for Youth Dividends. A basic income is an income unconditionally granted to all on an individual basis, without conditions or work requirements.  Nearly 90 percent of the young residing in the city took the vouchers within a week.Some 26 associations of merchants based in Seongnam also welcomed the welfare program promoting the use of vouchers, which they said spurred spending in the city. Thanks to Youth Dividends, spending through the vouchers is expected to reach 22 billion won, up 65 percent from a year earlier. Kang Nam-hoon, an economics professor and pioneer of the basic income movement in South Korea at Hanshin University, said in his report that the implementation of Seongnam’s welfare programs would create 207 jobs, spark 19.2 billion won in production a year and add additional value of 11.3 billion won.Aside from the policy, the city government decided to offer free school uniforms to 8,900 students entering middle school this year, allocating 2.5 billion won for the program. The city granted the students 150,000 won this year, but it plans to offer school uniforms made by the city’s clothing cooperative instead of money starting from next year.  Students and parents wait in line to accept free-of-charge school uniforms provided by the city. As part of its efforts to help mothers with postnatal care, Seongnam provided them with subsidies worth 250,000 won in vouchers, marking it as the first of its kind among municipalities in the nation. As of Jan. 27, 66.5 percent of the mothers had picked up the subsidies at community service centers.But the Seongnam-initiated welfare programs have been consistently objected to by the central government and the ruling party, claiming they were a waste of tax money and politically motivated. The central government revised the Local Subsidy Act to slash the budget for Seongnam City last December to put the brakes on the municipality’s welfare programs. The ministry has even filed a petition with the Supreme Court in a bid to suspend the program. In response, Seongman Metropolitan Government filed a petition with the Constitutional Court. Mayor Lee said the central government’s action not only violates local autonomy, but interferes with the municipality’s policies to enhance their citizens’ welfare within budgetary capacity. The city also stepped up measures to reinforce safety, medical security and education for its citizens. Last year, a patrol team composed of 54 Seongnam citizens was launched to enhance the security of their neighborhoods. The tasks included patrolling the city, taking women and children home safely, securing parcels and delivering them, fixing houses for the marginalized and taking patients to hospitals.  Seongnam's citizen patrol, launched in July last year, helps residents safely get home during nighttime, surveys isolated areas and around schools and helps with daily chores upon request. The city put in 15.9 billion won to help schools provide their students with eco-friendly free lunches, help university students pay for their college loans and offer educational assistance for children from less privileged homes.  Seongnam Mayor Lee Jae-myeong poses with the first family that benefited from the city’s free postnatal care program. Seongnam is also eyeing an expansion of inter-Korean exchanges and protection of labor rights. The mayor vowed to find more ways to bolster humanitarian, cultural and industrial exchanges between the two Koreas through a newly established committee. He also said that he would help laborers in the city organize themselves to improve their negotiating power. To make welfare programs gain even more momentum, Lee called on Seongnam citizens to participate in politics and take more interest in society in his New Year’s speech. “Rights are guaranteed to people who ask for them and act on them,” Lee said. “Representative democracy can only be run in a good manner when citizens participate.”By Ock Hyun-ju  and Park Joung-kyu","mayor lee jae myeong facebook ,july last year helps residents ,second term mayor of seongnam ,free lunches help university students ,new year address mayor lee","['Seongnam Mayor', ""Lee Jae - myeong 's"", 'South Korea', 'Seongnam', 'Seongnam', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Seoul', 'Lee', 'Seongnam', 'Seongnam', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Seongnam', 'Seongnam', 'Lee', 'Seongnam', 'Korea', 'Youth Dividends', 'Seongnam', 'Seongnam', 'Kang Nam - hoon', 'South Korea', 'Hanshin University', 'Seongnam ’s', 'Seongnam', 'Seongnam', 'Subsidy Act', 'Seongnam City', 'the Supreme Court', 'Seongman Metropolitan Government', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Lee', 'Seongnam', 'Seongnam', 'Seongnam Mayor', 'Lee Jae - myeong', 'Seongnam', 'inter - korean', 'Koreas', 'Lee', 'Seongnam', 'Lee', 'Ock Hyun - ju', 'Park Joung - kyu']",7,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -0.36647537  0.75278687

On the 1-kilometer-long section of the decades-old overpass, 17 pedestrian ways will be linked to seven regions around the overpass -- including Seoul Station, Namdaemun Market, Hoehyeon Station and other neighboring buildings.  An image of the envisioned overpass at Seoul Station Along with 20 diverse public spaces, such as libraries and performance stages, four balconies will be constructed to allow visitors to enjoy the city view. Underfoot views will also be available through transparent glass floors at three spots. Over 180 types of trees will be planted on the overpass. The new park will be accessible from the ground through elevators, escalators, stairs and bridges. To ensure public safety, the city will strengthen the floor plates with earthquake-proof materials and install 1.4-to 3-meter-high fences around the overpass. “ will not only restore the overpass, but also become a catalyst for revival and regeneration of neighboring regions through the high number of visitors,” Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon said. In 2012, Park pledged to transform the old overpass into a pedestrian park with an aim to boost neighboring markets and preserve the decades-old historic heritage. The project, however, has faced resistance from local merchants nearby who feared sales damage, and from police citing traffic problems.By Lee Hyun-jeong","themed seoul arboretum in may ,seoul arboretum in may ,seoul arboretum in may last ,the overpass the new park ,the envisioned overpass at seoul","['Seoul City', 'Korea', 'New York ’s', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'dutch', 'Winy Mass ’s', 'Seoul Station , Namdaemun Market , Hoehyeon Station', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Park', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",13,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -0.38578245  0.42267489

IVECA is a nonprofit organization in special consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council and associated with the U.N. Department of Public Information. She added that “global citizenship education” enables students to develop skills and bring creative solutions to global problems by facilitating mutual understanding of cultures and cultivating a sense of coexistence.IVECA’s international virtual schooling program, for instance, connects classrooms around the world via technology between two partner schools from different cultures.Its global citizenship education is twofold: asynchronous learning and a live class. Through this, students from partner schools in different countries research on same topics and share their assignments on the organization’s online platform. After studying two or three topics through asynchronous interaction, the students get to participate in virtual face-to-face communication through a 50-minute live class at the end of the semester. Jung said there were some difficulties in providing the virtual schooling program to some of the underdeveloped parts of other countries, and she is trying to get support from the U.N. and other relevant organizations in expanding her program and ideas. During a student presentation at the IVECA meeting, Kim Soo-yeon shared her own experience of participating in the program’s learning opportunities.As the best part of her experience, Kim said she was thrilled to learn about the outside world via technology while just sitting in a classroom. She participated in IVECA activities for two years at Jeon-min High School in Daejeon, before becoming a college freshman this year.","forum in seoul last week ,global citizenship education enables students ,international prosperity 21st century learning ,daejeon before becoming college freshman ,annual meeting of iveca korea","['Seoul', 'Jung Eun - hee', 'IVECA International Virtual Schooling', 'IVECA - Korea', 'iveca', 'the United Nations Economic and Social Council', 'the U.N.

This could potentially lead to the rocket exploding as it tries to lift off from the launch pad.""Tests conducted last week have led to satisfactory results,"" the scientist said. He hinted that after conducting related tests from October onwards, KARI engineers were able to iron out a lot of the problems.""Technically, we are on the right course,"" the former head of the Naro-1 rocket research and development team said.The 47.2 meter-long three-stage KSLV-2 rocket is to be South Korea's first locally designed and built space vehicle. It will be used to place unmanned satellites into the Earth's orbit and other commercial purposes.The Naro-1 rocket was only partially made in the country, since the first stage was brought in from Russia. Local scientists and engineers built the second stage rocket and the satellite.Related to next year's test launch, other KARI officials said that of the three stages, only the second and third will actually be tested. The KSLV-2's first stage is made up of four individual 75 ton thrust engines, with the second stage being a single 75 ton unit and the third a 7 ton rocket.""The goal for the 2016 test is to see if the 75 ton engine works according to design,"" an official said. He added that the success rate for a country launching its first rocket stands at 33-34 percent, while even for established space rocket builders the success rate only stands at 93 percent for any launch.KARI then said that because it is conducting ground tests, one actual flight test of the rocket should be sufficient to see if all systems work when they are put under real launch stress and conditions.It then said at present, only one launch is planned under the 2015-2018 timetable, although if the launch fails, it may have to contemplate another test launch.""Rocket launches are very costly in terms of materials and human resources,"" the state-run institute said.On the country's plans to send a unmanned probe to the moon, KARI said that the program involves a locally built probe being sent to the Moon on a foreign-made rocket in 2018. It said the moon mission and the KSLV-2 are not linked at present.For a South Korean rocket to send a probe to the Moon, it must be much larger, and may have to be a four-stage rocket, since three stages are just not powerful enough the propel a probe all the way to the Moon.","space rocket in late 2016 ,contemplate another test launch rocket ,its next generation space rocket ,generation space rocket in late ,next generation space rocket in","['South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Korea Aerospace Research Institute', 'Cho Gwang - rae', 'the Korea Space Launch', 'South Korea', 'KARI', ""South Korea 's"", 'Russia', 'KARI', 'KARI', 'KARI', 'Moon', 'south korean', 'Moon']",2,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.33575404  0.36707637

Two separate avenues were named after Seoul and Teheran in each other's capital in 1977 in a sign of mutual friendship. ""Teheran-ro"" was named in a business district in southern Seoul.After years of lull in their relations, the two cities began to restore friendly, cooperative ties from 2014 when signs of easing sanctions on the Middle East country emerged.In April 2014, a senior transportation-related official from Teheran visited Seoul to sound out the possibility of increasing exchanges between the two cities at various levels.A city official said the Seoul metropolitan administration will seek ways to make inroads into other cities in the Middle East on the basis of its close relationship with the Iranian capital.Seoul city has sisterhood relationships with 23 cities around the globe. It also has ""friendly relationships"" with 28 other cities in the world. Teheran has a population of 8.2 million in an area of 1,274 square kilometers, a size 2.1 times larger than Seoul.Teheran officials have special interests in Seoul's mass transportation system as the Iranian capital suffers from severe air contamination from vehicle exhaust fumes and industrial environmental pollution.","an invitation for seoul mayor ,iranian government move to improve ,teheran recently visited seoul city ,invitation for seoul mayor ,seoul metropolitan government will push","['Seoul', 'iranian', 'Teheran', 'Seoul', 'iranian', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Teheran', 'Seoul City Hall', 'Mohammad Khodadadi', 'Seoul City Hall', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Park', 'AMP', 'Teheran', 'Park', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Teheran', 'Seoul', 'Teheran', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'iranian', 'Seoul', 'Teheran', 'Seoul', 'teheran', 'Seoul', 'iranian']",2,"[ 0.         12.          0.         ... -0.80006635  0.59967297

Under the plan, it will make the conditions in the tanks similar to the wild by installing artificial rocks and marine plants. It will invest in developing a program to study dolphins’ behavior and help them live as they do in the wild. Dolphin shows, in which spectators can feed the marine mammals, will be reduced in frequency from four times a day to three. It also promised to raise the number of dolphin trainers and enhance the animals’ medical check-ups.But the district office refused to shut down the life experience museum, citing its role in educating children about the environment and promoting Jangsengpo, the heartland of Korea’s whaling industry.Animal rights groups on Friday held a press conference in central Seoul, taking a swipe at the district office for offering “insufficient” solutions to the problem. “Dolphins, which move about 160 km a day, are not animals that can be artificially trained and fed in small tanks. No matter how much the conditions of the tanks are improved, the dolphins cannot help but die young due to physical and mental stress,” the Korea Animal Welfare Association said in a statement. “Hundreds of dolphins are cruelly slaughtered in the blood-covered sea to be sold to Korea. The district office should drop its bid to import more dolphins and make it clear that it will permanently stop importing dolphins from Japan,” it added. The dolphins imported from Japan come from the town of Taiji, Wakayama, notorious for the fishermen’s cruel methods of hunting whales. They allegedly pound on metal poles to disorient dolphins and herd them into shallow water to be killed. An estimated 2,000 dolphins are killed each year, according to animal rights groups. The district office’s plan came after three environmental groups including Korea Animals Welfare Association and Hot Pink Dolphins filed a complaint with the prosecution against three officials respectively from the district office, whale museum and state-run city management organization for covering up the deaths of two dolphins inside the aquarium last year. “Big Dolphins, which are on the brink of extinction, are monitored by the Ministry of Environment. The accused obstructed justice by not properly being aware of the dolphins’ death and problems of the facilities,” they said. They also denied the deaths of dolphins to the local media fearing a public backlash, the groups said. Two dolphins imported from Japan died in 2010 and 2012, respectively. In 2014, a dolphin calf died 65 hours after birth. Last year, a young dolphin died of pneumonia on June 6, days after birth, and a male dolphin died of blood poisoning in August after it scuffled with a fellow dolphin.

Participants of ASEAN-Korea Center’s homestay program pose for a group photo. Yoon Min-sik/The Korea HeraldThe 20 students -- majoring in tourism or Asian studies at seven universities located in Seoul and Busan -- are participants in an eight-day pilot homestay program for university students jointly organized by the ASEAN-Korea Center and the Ministry of Tourism and Culture in Malaysia that ran from Dec. 28-Jan. 5. “The experience starts from the moment you get off the bus,” said Muhamad Daud Muhamad Arif, the head of the culture and tourism unit at the ASEAN-Korea Center.A country of rich culture, unique traditions and beautiful scenery, Malaysia tallied 27.4 million tourists in 2014 and the United Nations World Tourism Organization listed it as the 10th most visited country in 2012.But Daud, a native of Malaysia himself, says the program offers more than just tourism. “It’s not about the accommodations or the programs; it’s about what you experience during the time here,” he pointed out.AKC secretary general Kim Young-sun said the objective of the program is to provide a stage for Korean students to interact with “sustainable community-based tourism” products in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Community-based tourism refers to tourism experiences developed to promote tourism and the industries of local communities.  Kim Young-sun, secretary general of the ASEAN-Korea Center, speaks during a launch event for the homestay program in Selangor, Malaysia. Yoon Min-sik/The Korea HeraldKim said one of the biggest hurdles in the establishment of the ASEAN community is the gap between the development of regions, which is why Malaysia and the AKC devised the program to propel the growth of regional industries and tourism.“I strongly believe that this ASEAN Homestay Program would be an excellent platform to complement the vision of ASEAN by promoting the bloc’s cultural awareness and reinforcing the understanding of Korean students of its unique cultural identity,” he said.According to Kim, Malaysia’s strong homestay programs motivated officials to choose it as the partner for the pilot program. There are a total of 181 homestays in Malaysia at more than 3,600 houses, receiving nearly 300,000 tourists from inside and outside the country.Datuk Mas Ermieyati Samsudin, Malaysian tourism and culture deputy minister, said the homestay segment currently contributes roughly 1 percent to overall tourism revenue in the country. If the program goes well, the AKC plans to expand the joint homestay project to all ASEAN countries. Kim, a career diplomat and previously Seoul’s envoy to Indonesia, stressed that understanding another country’s culture, history and social norms is crucial to truly comprehending that country. “If we look at foreign cultures based only on our own perspective, the relationship cannot be beneficial to either sides. By participating in activities, respecting the other culture, students will have a chance to become a ‘truly global’ citizen,” he said. Understanding of foreign culture is not confined solely to Korean students. On the second day of the trip, students had a chance to mingle with freshmen from Universiti Kuala Lumpur and share their common passions for various subjects, including the increasingly popular K-pop.Students from the two countries also jointly planted trees, tapped rubber from trees, fished and even dressed up for a traditional Malay wedding ceremony, in which two students from each side partook in a mock ceremony. A participating student of the homestay program is cooking a traditional Malaysian dish at her host family‘s house. Yoon Min-sik/The Korea Herald According to the AKC, the program aims to give students a better understanding of community-based tourism through hands-on experiences related to local culture, environment conservation and sustainable tourism policy development.Students said the most impressive aspect of the program was staying with locals. “When I went to study in the U.S., I was assigned to a dorm with Korean students, and I couldn’t befriend Americans if I didn’t really try. But here, I get a chance to be close to locals because I share a house with them,” said Choi Eun-ji, a 23-year-old attending Dongseo University. Host families are one of the most important aspects of the homestay programs, and Arshad Mustapa -- the state director of the ministry of tourism and culture, Selangor office -- said he pays special attention to who hosts the foreign guests.""We make sure that the family is free from any sickness and that they have modern facilities, clean water, adequate power supply, hygiene and no insect infestation around the houses,” he said. The host families are also subject to regular inspections every six months, and they receive foreign language classes to acquire basic communicative capacity.Shin Hyung-seok, a 19-year-old from Sejong University, said the homestay program was a step up from his backpacking trip in Malaysia this summer, mainly because it showed them an authentic experience of what it was like to live among people of a different culture.“Back then, they sold beer everywhere I went. So I didn’t really get a feel that it was a largely Islamic country,” he said. Alcohol is prohibited in the Islamic religion.“But here, in addition to no beer, I see people being careful about even shaking hands with women. That had me think, ‘this is the real Malaysia,’” he said.As part of the program, participants are given assignments to develop novel ideas to enhance the tourist experience based on their time there. In addition, they are required to post photos and videos on their social media accounts, with the most outstanding candidate receiving a certificate and an opportunity for a short-term attachment at the AKC. Participants visit a bee farm during the ASEAN-Korea Center’s homestay program in the state of Selangor, Malaysia. The program also divulged some points of improvement. Jeong Min-ji of Kyung Hee University said the program should offer even more activities to offer more chances to experience legitimate Malaysian life.Jung’s schoolmate Jeon Hee-won agreed, saying her most memorable time was at homes with locals.“When we were at home, we cooked local food and talked with our host families,” she said. Jeon also expressed her hope that the program would offer more chances that would get Korean students to better understand and become close friends with their Malaysian counterparts, rather than simply participating in arranged activities together. By Yoon Min-sik","korea heraldthe 20 students majoring ,20 students majoring in tourism ,the korea heraldthe 20 students ,korea heraldthe 20 students ,dorm with korean students","['BANGHURIS', 'Malaysia', 'Selangor', 'Malaysia', 'korean', 'Koreans', 'ASEAN - Korea Center ’s', 'Yoon Min - sik', 'Korea', 'asian', 'Seoul', 'Busan', 'ASEAN', 'the Ministry of Tourism and Culture', 'Malaysia', 'Muhamad Daud Muhamad Arif', 'ASEAN', 'Malaysia', 'the United Nations World Tourism Organization', 'Daud', 'Malaysia', 'AKC', 'Kim Young - sun', 'korean', 'the Association of Southeast Asian Nations', 'Kim Young - sun', 'ASEAN', 'Korea Center', 'Selangor', 'Malaysia', 'Yoon Min - sik', 'Korea', 'HeraldKim', 'ASEAN', 'Malaysia', 'AKC', 'this ASEAN Homestay Program', 'ASEAN', 'korean', 'Kim', 'Malaysia', 'Malaysia', 'Datuk Mas', 'Samsudin', 'malaysian', 'AKC', 'ASEAN', 'Kim', 'Seoul', 'Indonesia', 'korean', 'Universiti', 'Kuala Lumpur', 'malay', 'malaysian', 'Yoon Min - sik', 'AKC', 'U.S.', 'korean', 'Americans', 'Choi Eun - ji', 'Dongseo University', 'Arshad Mustapa', 'Selangor', 'Shin Hyung - seok', 'Sejong University', 'Malaysia', 'islamic', 'islamic', 'Malaysia', 'AKC', 'ASEAN', 'Selangor', 'Malaysia', 'Jeong Min - ji', 'Kyung Hee University', 'malaysian', 'Jung', 'Jeon Hee - won', 'korean', 'malaysian', 'Yoon Min - sik']",15,"[ 0.          2.          2.         ... -0.10409864  0.77229083

The Seoul Metropolitan Government said it would change the existing in-train wireless broadband, or Wi-Bro, system to high-speed Wi-Fi. Currently, the free Internet access in trains has been provided only through wireless broadband by telecommunications business operators since 2011. The speed of the Wi-bro service has often been limited or slow when many passengers use it at the same time.The new Internet system will be first constructed in subway lines No. 4 and No. 8 in January next year on a trial basis, then expanded to all routes from October 2017. At platforms, the city has separately provided free high speed Internet access with speeds of over 150 megabits per second. According to the city’s survey in August last year, about 87 percent of subway passengers responded that they used smartphones in trains. Free Wi-Fi was selected as one of the top services they looked for on the subway. The construction of the new Wi-Fi system will be carried out upon private investment chosen by public bidding. The city is also considering installing wireless relay devices around subway stations so that the free Wi-Fi has a greater range, they added.By Lee Hyun-jeong","smartphones in trains free wi ,used smartphones in trains free ,smartphones in trains free ,existing in train wireless broadband ,the new internet system will","['Seoul City', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68039972  0.29639459

Last March debate erupted when U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Martin Dempsey sought cooperation from South Korea in building the IAMD to be joined by Japan during his visit to Seoul. In his meeting with Defense Minister Han Min-koo, the top U.S. military officer brought attention to the issue by noting he had “productive” conversations with top South Korean military officers on the progress in building the system. Analysts said the missile defense issue could escalate the Sino-U.S. rivalry, which would, after all, hurt Seoul’s ongoing efforts to keep friendly ties with Beijing.Observers also raised the possibility that the U.S. may also move to persuade the South to install an advanced missile defense asset, called the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, on the peninsula on the grounds that the asset is necessary to fend off Pyongyang’s missile attacks.South Korea still remains indecisive on the issue of allowing the U.S. to deploy a THAAD battery on its soil. China has opposed the THAAD deployment, which it suspects is aimed at undermining its strategic missile capability, in addition to deterring threats from North Korea.

She has so far preferred a thin woolen overcoat or a light jacket. “A heavy padded coat with muffler and gloves do not seem to be necessary this winter. I purchased a high-end goose down parka in October last year, but I only wore it once or twice,” said Kim. Unlike previous years, the winter temperature has remained unusually warm this season. The spring flower forsythia has prematurely come into bloom Monday at a public park in Ulsan amid the warm winter temperatures. On Sunday, the highest temperature of southern city Busan reached nearly 17 degrees Celsius, and Jejudo Island marked 8.5 degrees Celsius. Seoul also saw highs of 11 degrees Celsius -- 10 degrees higher than the typical average of 1.7 degrees Celsius -- the Korea Meteorological Administration said. The average temperature of December last year recorded 3.5 degrees Celsius, which is 2 degrees higher on-year. This is the highest winter average temperature since 1973, the KMA added. The average temperature of November was 10.1 degrees Celsius, which was also 2.6 degrees higher on-year. The unusually warm winter temperatures are suspected to be the impact of the “Super El Nino.” A prolonged warming in the Pacific Ocean surface temperature of about 0.5 degrees Celsius is referred to as “El Nino,” while an ocean surface temperature rise over 2.5 degrees Celsius is called “Super El Nino.” “The weather usually gets colder as the continental high in the North expands while the North Pacific high weakens. The influence of the North Pacific high, however, still remains, due mainly to El Nino raising the temperature,” KMA officials said. The El Nino effect this season is the strongest since the 1997-98 season. It is expected to continue into spring, they added. The unusually high temperatures this winter have gradually affected public life and companies.Sales of winter clothes, such as padded coats or outdoor jackets, have seen a sharp drop. At Lotte Department Store, sales of outdoor jackets have dropped by 5.3 percent, while those of fur coats have plummeted by 8.6 percent. Shinsegae Department Store has seen a similar pattern, as sales of outdoor clothes have fallen by 9.6 percent and winter accessories including gloves and scarves have declined by 9.3 percent. The warm temperature also affected the agriculture sector. Sangju in North Gyeongsang Province, where dried persimmons are widely grown, saw production of the fruit total only about 7,000 tons -- 60 percent of the previous season. As a result, losses are estimated to top 43 billion won , the city said. Annual ice-related events have also been either called off or postponed. Inje Icefish Festival and Hongcheongang Ggong Ggong Festival in Gangwon Province were canceled due to public safety concerns, the cities said. Inje had canceled the event last year, too. In order to guarantee the safety of visitors, the thickness of the ice must be at least over 20 centimeters. Right now it is around 5 to 10 centimeters, they said. The Yeongdong International Ice Climbing Competition slated for Jan. 23-24 in North Chungcheong Province is also likely to be postponed. Similar events in Gapyeong, Gyeonggi Province, and Chengju, in North Chungcheong Province, have also been canceled.While the El Nino effect will likely continue, the weather is expected to return to average temperature levels from Tuesday, with lows of minus 12 to 4 degrees Celsius anticipated across the country, the weather agency said.

The last such meeting took place in Seoul in January 2015.Lee Tae-ho, South Korea's deputy foreign minister for economic affairs, will represent Seoul, while his counterpart will be Yasumasa Nagamine, Tokyo's deputy foreign minister for economic affairs.In these meetings, the two countries have discussed economic issues of mutual concern, such as trade, investment and cooperation in private sectors.Bilateral ties are at a critical moment, as both sides recently struck a deal on resolving the issue of Korean women forced into sexual slavery for Japanese troops during World War II.Japan could renew its calls on South Korea to resume its imports of Japanese fishery goods. Since September 2013, South Korea has banned imports of all fishery products from eight Japanese prefectures near the site of a nuclear accident in Fukushima. Upon Japan's request, the World Trade Organization  has set up a special panel to look into the ban.Japan may also take issues with compensation lawsuits filed by South Korean victims of forced labor during Japan's colonial rule of Korea from 1910-1945.At the economic talks, however, the two countries are unlikely to reach any sort of conclusion in such legal matters, the South Korean government source said.""The meeting will be more about reviewing and discussing our overall economic situations, and not so much about negotiating pending issues,"" the source said.
