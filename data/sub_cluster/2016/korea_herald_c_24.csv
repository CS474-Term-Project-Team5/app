Each was asked to estimate the likelihood and impact on US interests of each of the contingencies, it said.It was believed to be the first time that a North Korea crisis has topped the annual list of international concerns for New Year, though the issue has been classified as a Tier 1 international concern in previous surveys.""Donald J. Trump assumes office at a particularly turbulent time. It may not be long before his administration is tested by a serious foreign crisis,"" CFR said in the report. ""The new administration must decide how active it wants to be in managing the risks a more turbulent world poses to US interests.""Most American experts agree that North Korea will be one of the biggest problems facing the Trump administration as the communist nation stepped up its development of a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the continental US.Outgoing President Barack Obama also reportedly warned Trump of the dangers the North poses to the US when the two met at the White House last month.During the election campaign, Trump said he would pressure China to exercise its influence over North Korea as the main food and energy provider to rein in the regime in Pyongyang, saying the North is basically China's problem to fix.But he also expressed a willingness to hold direct talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un over ""hamburgers,"" a remark seen as aimed at underscoring the point he's a great negotiator. However, the remark invited huge criticism that such a meeting would only bolster the North's dictator.","severe crisis in north korea ,crisis involving north korea ranked ,obama also reportedly warned trump ,north korea crisis has topped ,terrorist attack on the us","['North Korea', 'the United States', 'a Council on Foreign Relations', 'Preventive Priorities Survey', 'North Korea', 'Russia', 'NATO', 'US', 'US', 'CFR', 'US', 'US', 'North Korea', 'J.

Females in South Korea are predicted to reach 25.56 million in 2045, compared with 25.49 million males.South Korea is also expected to go through rapid population aging. The number of people aged 65 and older will likely come to 18.18 million in 30 years, up 2.9 times from the 6.54 million last year.

The OECD announced the results of its 2015 Program for International Student Assessment , which surveyed about 540,000 15-year-olds in 72 different countries, including 35 member nations of the OECD. South Korea ranked “first-fourth” in math by earning 517 points, “third-eighth” in reading with 524 points and “fifth-eighth” in science with 516 points among the OECD member states.Including non-OECD members such as Singapore, Hong Kong and China, South Korea’s rankings dropped further. South Korea stood at “fourth-ninth” in reading, “sixth-ninth” in math and “ninth-14th” in science.The PISA results are described in scopes such as “first-fourth” and “third-eighth” to present upper and lower bound estimates of each country when the score differences are not significant. In the 2012 PISA result, the OECD ranked South Korea at the top in math with 554 points, put it first or second place in literacy with 536 points and between second and fourth in science with 538 points among its member countries.  South Korean students study in the classroom.Despite the fall in the PISA results, South Korean students showed stronger academic ability in every subject than the OECD average. The average of the OECD in the 2015 PISA results was 493 points in reading, 490 in math and 493 in science. PISA is an international assessment that evaluates 15-year-old students on their proficiency in science, reading and math every three years since 2000. In South Korea, 5,749 students attending 145 high schools and 23 middle schools took part in the program. By gender, South Korean girls outshone boys in every subject. The proportion of students showing poor performance increased in every subject last year, from 7.6 percent to 13.6 percent in reading, from 9.1 percent to 15.4 percent in math and from 6.7 percent to 14.4 percent in science, compared to 2012. The survey found that South Korean students are slightly more motivated to study science and interested in the subject in 2015 than in 2012, though they are less enthusiastic about their study than the OECD average. “As the PISA results showed a fall in academic ability, the state and provincial education offices should improve the system to support those lacking basic academic skills,” said the Education Ministry. “As Korean students lack an interest in science compared to the OECD average, there needs to policy efforts to make courses more fun and interesting.” By Ock Hyun-ju","ranked first fourth in math ,south korean girls outshone boys ,in south korea 749 students ,south korea ranked first fourth ,korea ranked first fourth in","['South Korea ’s', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'OECD', 'OECD', 'OECD', 'South Korea', 'OECD', 'Singapore', 'Hong Kong', 'China', 'South Korea ’s', 'South Korea', 'PISA', 'PISA', 'OECD', 'South Korea', 'south korean', 'PISA', 'south korean', 'OECD', 'OECD', 'PISA', 'PISA', 'South Korea', 'south korean', 'south korean', 'OECD', 'PISA', 'the Education Ministry', 'korean', 'OECD', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62250167  0.69054312

The report team said the overall poverty rate among single-member households in Korea consistently went up from 2006 to 2014, while the absolute and relative poverty rate both took a downward turn in 2015.The research team added that government’s policy measures should be more focused on dealing poverty issues targeting elders who live alone.“The trend  shows more elders are depending on government policies and welfare programs, while such programs should be redesigned to embrace elderly who live alone in poverty,” the research team said.OECD data in 2015 showed that South Korea’s elderly poverty rate was the highest among 34 OECD member countries, as the poverty rate among senior citizens aged 65 or older was 48.6 percent in 2011.Beyond that, South Korea had one of the lowest net pension replacement rates.

The pangovernmental comprehensive framework, approved by the Cabinet, aims to achieve the country’s goal of cutting carbon emissions by 37 percent, or 315 million metric tons, based on business-as-usual levels. Seoul introduced its voluntary reduction target during a UN climate conference in Paris last December. “The action plans were formulated in a way that helps to shift the reduction-focused responses to climate change to a fresh paradigm centering on the market and technology ... and strengthen the private sector’s role and promote the acceptability of the policy,” the intra-agency statement said. Under the plan, the government aims to slash 219 million metric tons, or nearly 70 percent of the total reduction goal, from eight areas such as power production, industry and buildings, setting the sectoral target at 25.7 percent below projected levels. The largest slice would come from electricity generation with 64.5 million metric tons, followed by industry with 56.4 million metric tons, buildings with 35.8 million metric tons and new energy sectors including electric vehicles and energy storage with 282 million metric tons. Seoul also looks to curb 96 million metric tons through international market mechanisms in line with the Paris climate agreement. It would devise a more detailed blueprint by 2020, saying the overseas reduction plan requires additional global discussions such as on carbon credit trading and funding sources. Yet mindful of the industry’s unabated jitters over what it calls a side effect on the business environment, the government left room for a future revision, saying it would “adjust and complement” its plans according to the “fast-changing economic conditions” at home and abroad and global climate policy trends. To ensure a transparent implementation and inclusiveness, the Prime Minister’s Office will take over control from the Environment Ministry to oversee the issue and carry out inspections every five years through a public-private partnership. As part of efforts to pare the country’s reliance on fossil fuel, the government is seeking to boost incentives for renewable energy and cleaner power plant projects. It intends to raise the share of renewable sources in its portfolio to 7 percent from the existing 6 percent by 2020.  The plan called a cap-and-trade system “key” to meeting the 2030 goal, which it said would expedite industry innovation and environmentally friendly investment while helping to integrate into the future global carbon market. It pledged to expand funding in the development of 10 climate technologies including solar and fuel cells and conversion of waste gas, while doubling investment in clean energy research to 1.12 trillion won  by 202. Korea is the world’s seventh-largest polluter, with its carbon output in 2013 reaching 572 million metric tons, according to the International Energy Agency. The country’s emissions marked the fastest growth since 1990 among the members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

The bipartisan panel of lawmakers probing the case said Monday they were notified by Choi Soon-sil’s attorney that she would not testify before lawmakers at a hearing scheduled to take place Wednesday. Choi is one of the most important witnesses in the ongoing parliamentary investigation.  Choi Soon-sil arrives at a Seoul court on Nov. 3 to attend a hearing to review the legality of her detention The 60-year-old longtime friend of Park cited health issues and the prosecutorial investigation she is undergoing as reasons for her absence. Currently under arrest, she faces a trial for her involvement in the scandal, as she is accused of manipulating government affairs through her ties to the president. Choi’s elder sister Choi Soon-deuk and niece Jang Si-ho also told lawmakers they are too ill to attend the session. The two have been charged with using their ties with Choi to amass personal wealth illegally. The panel said that if the Chois continue to avoid inquiry, they would request the court issue an order to force their attendance. By law, those who refuse to obey such an order can be sent to prison or face fines. But there is no measure to enforce their attendance if the witnesses choose to risk punishment.By Yeo Jun-suk","south korea worst political crisis ,wednesday dealing blow to lawmakers ,of south korea worst political ,south korea worst political ,korea worst political crisis in","['Park Geun', 'Choi Soon - sil ’s', 'Choi', 'Choi soon - sil', 'Seoul', 'Park', 'Choi ’s', 'Choi soon - deuk', 'Jang Si - ho', 'Choi', 'Chois', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63995868  0.49674499

Among the notable changes concerning defection in recent years was why they chose to escape.The No. 1 reason for defection in 2001 was “financial difficulties and hunger” at 66.7 percent, but that figure plunged to 12 percent this year, according to a survey by the ministry-affiliated resettlement support center Korea Hana Foundation. Instead the top spot was taken by “longing for freedom,” which jumped from 9.6 percent to 34.8 percent during the same period. Numbers indicate that there are more defections motivated by the will to improve the quality of life rather than to ensure one’s survival, with 55.9 percent saying that their income in the North was “enough.” The figure in 2001 was 19.4 percent.The number of politically motivated defections also jumped during the period from 6.2 percent to 17.5 percent.Data from the KHF showed that more members of the “elite group” -- consisting of doctors, teachers or researchers -- are fleeing the North. The elites accounted for 2.5 percent of the defectors who arrived here five to 10 years ago, but this rose to 5 percent among those who arrived more recently, one to three years ago.This year was marked by a series of North Korean elites fleeing the country, namely a director-general level official at the North’s spy agency, a colonel-level officer at the military intelligence organization and London-based diplomat Thae Yong-ho.The ministry said it is working with related organizations for a comprehensive measure to support former North Koreans settling in the South. This is expected to include increased job opportunities, academic support for younger generation and overall social participation.Compared to 2007, the employment rate for defectors jumped this year from 36.9 percent to 54.6 percent, the ministry said.

From January through October, 1,154 people have successfully escaped the repressive regime and sought a new life in the South.""As of late October, there are 29,948 former North Koreans in the South so the 30,000 mark should be reach around Nov. 15-16,"" an official said.He said Seoul plans to mark the occasion with a new resettlement policy that will better help escapees integrate into South Korean society.The new plan aims to facilitate greater social participation of North Korea defectors, help them find jobs and concentrate on helping youngsters assimilate into schools and their studies.Official data, meanwhile, showed that 2016 marked the first year since North Korean leader Kim Jong-un took power in late 2011 that the number of defectors increased noticeably.In 2011, 2,706 North Korean arrived in the South, but this number dropped to 1,502 the following year, and stayed almost flat at 1,514 in 2013, and dipped to 1,397 and 1,276 in the two following years respectively. The drop had been attributed to tighter border control along the North Korea-China frontier which is not heavily guarded.Official source attributed this year's increase to the ""reign of terror"" perpetrated by Kim and tighter international sanctions that is forcing North Korean workers living abroad to repatriate more money. The North Korean leader has purged many leading figures from positions of power and has resorted to terror tactics like public executions to enforce his rule.Besides such developments, many North Korean elites are opting to defect for the sake of their children's future as well as getting away from political oppression.Reflecting this, polls conducted by the unification ministry on defectors showed less people escaping the country because they were starving or for economic reasons.Before 2001, 66.7 percent of those that left the country said they were trying to get away from hunger, but this decreased to 57.9 percent in 2002-2005 period and dropped to just 12.1 percent from 2014 to this year.In contrast, those that cited freedom and discontent over North Korean politics reach 87.8 percent in the 2014-16 period from 33.3 percent before 2001 and 42.1 percent in the 2002-2005 period.","2011 706 north korean arrived ,defectors increased noticeably in 2011 ,29 948 former north koreans ,21 percent spike in defectors ,first year since north korean","['north korean', 'South Korea', 'north korean', 'North Koreans', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'north Korean', 'North Korea', 'China', 'Kim', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'north korean']",3,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.54201812  0.21121192

Na has so far attracted 113 million viewers on AfreecaTV since 2011, emerging as one of the most sought-after streamers here. He also has 1.3 million YouTube subscribers. Na Dong-hyun, who uses the alias “Great Library” on YouTube AfreecaTV, launched in 2005, relied heavily on influential streamers like Na to gain a growth momentum and seek profits in the fledgling streaming market. Their relations were, at least initially, amicable, as they needed each other to boost traffic and strengthen their brand. As top-rated streamers can make bigger profits on the strength of their fans and corporate sponsors, they begin to question the cut in profit they pay to AfreecaTV. As the streaming industry expanded, their relationship started to show signs of strain.The bubbling conflict exploded on Oct. 14 when AfreecaTV suspended Na’s broadcast channel for seven days, a punishment for conducting for-profit activities with a corporate advertiser without getting permission. About a week earlier, Na co-hosted a live broadcast via AfreecaTV with his wife Lee Umi, another well-known streamer known as Yum-Dang to advertise a mobile game called “Acheron.” The broadcast also featured well-known Japanese gravure idol Ai Shinozaki, who has been recruited as the main model for the game. Na Dong-hyun , Yum-Dang  and Japanese gravure idol Ai Shinozaki on AfreecaTVNa and Lee did not get permission from AfreecaTV for the commercial broadcast, which resulted in the suspension. What angered Na was not a procedure for getting prior permission but the profit-sharing scheme that he views as unfairly favoring AfreecaTV. “I don’t get their logic. I did the commercial, but somehow they tell me to share the revenue,” Na said on his YouTube channel last Friday. “That is why I’ve decided to move to YouTube. They don’t charge me for airing a commercial broadcast.”  A screenshot of Na on his YouTube channel on FridayNa claimed that AfreecaTV charges partner streamers up to 10 million won  per each sponsored broadcast, and his agency, CJ E&M;, an entertainment arm of CJ Group, has covered the fees. AfreecaTV confirmed that there is indeed a profit-sharing plan, but refused to reveal how much streamers pay. Lee Dae-woo, PR manager at AfreeaTV, told The Korea Herald that the company is following the rules: “Whether it is for commercial broadcast or new content, we are working closely with streamers to make sure their content abides by guidelines from the Korea Communications Commission.”In addition to corporate sponsorship, AfreecaTV offers another tool through which streamers make money with their videos: “star balloon,” a digital coin that viewers can buy and give to streamers as a gift. When streamers exchange the cyber money for real cash, AfreecaTV takes a cut of 30 to 40 percent, depending on their popularity. There are only a small group of star streamers who earn a huge amount of money, so average streamers tend to search for alternative source of income with their videos. A screenshot of Na streaming online game plays on AfreecaTV YouTube offers such an alternative. Initially, the US video site was used as a free storage of video files after AfreecaTV streamers wrapped up their broadcast. On top of that, whenever their past videos are watched, they can get ad money from YouTube, which is not much.A turning point came in August last year when YouTube kicked off Gaming, a new livestreaming channel. The service offers an alternate platform that could replace AfreecaTV, so Na seems to have made up his mind when he clashed with his longtime platform partner. Moreover, other IT giants like Facebook and Twitter have also joined the streaming fray, allowing their users to stream content directly on their platforms. A YouTube video that features Na playing Minecraft “Great Library’s decision to move to YouTube may not be an isolated event,” an industry expert said. “Now with more platform options available, popular streamers here will see more incentives to look for a new place to maximize profits.” Foreign streaming platforms such as YouTube and Twitch, however, are latecomers on the Korean market where AfreecaTV remains the dominant player. Their status might change if more top Korean streamers take cue from Na’s decision in search of better profit-sharing deals.

And the deficit has been widening at such an alarming pace that environmentalists both here and overseas call for immediate attention to the issue. Calculated by the Global Footprint Network, a country’s ecological balance shows how much natural resources a country has and how much it uses. The supply is measured by biocapacity, which is the capacity of a given biologically productive area to generate a supply of renewable resources and to absorb its spillover waste. Consumption is assessed in terms of ecological footprint, which is the amount of land required to sustain a person’s use of natural resources.  “ 1960s, Korea’s ecological footprint grew to exceed its biocapacity as Koreans demanded more from nature than our ecosystems could provide. Korea has run an ecological deficit ever since,” writes Global Footprint Network in its report “Korea Ecological Footprint Report 2016,” jointly published by GFN and the World Wide Fund for Nature, Korea. Globally, humanity’s overall demands on biocapacity outstrips global supply by 64 percent. In Asia-Pacific, the demands placed on biocapacity now exceed the region’s supply by 150 percent. Korea demands eight times more from nature than the ecosystems within its borders can sustainably provide. Simply put, humanity currently uses renewable resources equivalent to 1.6 planets, Simon Yoon, CEO of WWF-Korea said in a June report. For Korean citizens, this amounts to 3.3 planets. Korea’s vast environmental imbalance stems largely from its carbon emissions, the report said. Carbon emissions are the greatest demand that humans put on nature. South Korea is now the world’s eighth-largest contributor in terms of the world’s total carbon footprint -- the amount of carbon or greenhouse gases emitted by activities or organizations in the country -- accounting for 1.7 percent of the global footprint, although its population makes up only 0.7 percent of the global human population.The country’s carbon footprint now comprises 73 percent of the country’s ecological footprint, larger than the world’s average of 60 percent. In 1961, when the data began to be collected, it made up 29 percent of the country’s total footprint.Theoretically, a country can run a biocapacity deficit, as long as it can access extra resources and ecosystem services from elsewhere. But the problem is more countries around the globe are becoming biocapacity importers, leading to increased competition for constrained resources. Among them are Korea’s key trade partners and global powers -- the United States, Russia and China.  Climate change Climate change compounds the challenges of growing ecological constraints and puts our ecological and economic wealth at risk.For instance, the rise in sea levels is an impact of climate change in South Korea.According to the Environment Ministry last year, the southern island of Jeju saw a rise in sea level at a rate that was three times higher than the global average. Ocean temperatures near the Korean Peninsula are also increasing rapidly. The country also experienced an unprecedented heat wave this year, which continued for a record-breaking 24 days, with the temperature reaching up to 37 degree Celsius in Seoul and the lowest amount of rainfall since 1973.With such temperature ups and downs, climate change can have a domino effects on agricultural crop yields, ecosystems, public health and other areas of Korean society, experts say. Daily consumption decisions made by individuals can make a difference on Korea’s ecological footprint, experts say. According to the report by GFN and WWF, about 70 percent of Korea’s ecological footprint comes from the industries of infrastructure , food  and mobility . As a whole, Korea has much to benefit from phasing out fossil fuels and transitioning to renewable energy.    “Our country, which produces not a single drop of oil, has nothing to lose and much to gain from the shift from coal, oil and gas to non-fossil energy,” said Dr. Lee Hoe-sung, chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.“Businesses that regard such a shift as just costs need to see it from a far longer term perspective,” he added.As part of a historic agreement in Paris late last year, Korea pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 37 percent from the business-as-usual level by 2030 across all economic sectors including energy, industrial processes and product use, agriculture and waste. Separately, before the Paris agreement, Korea set a goal for new and renewable energy to supply 11 percent of primary energy by 2035, according to the fourth New and Renewable Energy Master Plan of the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy in 2014.The government needs to reduce the amount of fossil fuels needed, experts added. As of 2014, fossil fuels accounted for 39 percent of South Korea’s total power sources. The South Korean government also recently announced that it would built 20 more coal-fired power plants by 2022.By Kim Da-sol","korea vast environmental imbalance stems ,korea vast environmental imbalance ,planets korea vast environmental imbalance ,vast environmental imbalance stems largely ,on biocapacity outstrips global supply","['South Korea ’s', 'the Global Footprint Network', 'Korea ’s', 'Koreans', 'Korea', 'Global Footprint Network', 'GFN', 'the World Wide Fund for Nature', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Simon Yoon', 'korean', 'Korea', 'South Korea', 'Korea ’s', 'the United States', 'Russia', 'China', 'South Korea', 'the Environment Ministry', 'Jeju', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'Korea', 'GFN', 'WWF', 'Korea ’s', 'Korea', 'Lee Hoe - sung', 'the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change', 'Paris', 'Korea', 'Paris', 'Korea', 'the Ministry of Trade , Industry and Energy', 'South Korea ’s', 'south korean', 'Kim Da - sol']",0,[ 0.         1.         0.        ... -0.4257752  0.6391055 -0.1202286]

Under a system called “dolgyeokdae,” or “storm troopers,” authorities recruit orphans and other underprivileged youngsters in particular and force them to labor up to midnight, while offering monthly wages the equivalent of a few bowls of noodles, it said. “I was not paid at all during my days at a first dolgyeokdae, and in the second one, I was made to carry some 75 kilograms of bricks all the way to the 20th floor every day, but with my pay I could only afford two candies or two packs of sweet potatoes,” said Park Kyung-ho, who defected in 2009 after working for three years at a state-run construction site. “My goal was to enter the Workers’ Party because I thought people like me, with a poor background, had to battle my way, so I worked really hard. But when I told a party executive about that, he said in a sorry voice it would be unlikely given my parents’ records. So I escaped, frustrated.” The report said the members of the groups, many of whom are children, are required to follow military-like disciplines for about 10 years. In addition to harsh labor, beatings and hunger prevail there, as well as injuries and deaths due to the lack of proper equipment. The stripped salaries are estimated to total 7.5 trillion North Korean won, about $975 million annually. The report came amid growing calls for countries around the world to no longer accept North Korean workers who are also known to live in harsh conditions and who are used as a cash cow to fund leader Kim Jong-un’s nuclear and missile programs. In its watershed survey released in February 2014, the UN Commission of inquiry pointed to slavery-like practices at some prison camps. “What happens to the overseas workers happens because it also happens inside North Korea. The suffering people in North Korea also deserve the attention we pay to the overseas workers,” said Kwon Eun-kyoung, director of the civic group. “We plan to translate the paper into English and submit it to the UN special rapporteur and other UN mechanisms, as well as UN representatives of especially Security Council member countries.”Ahn Youn-kyo, head of the UN’s human rights office in Seoul, said: “We will look into the report in detail later on, but in the dolgyeokdae system there are sources of rights violations given the discrimination and violence that occur there.” “North Korea, too, as a UN member and signatory of four related conventions including on children’s rights and discrimination against women, is obliged to abide by them and protect its people.”By Shin Hyon-hee","storm troopers authorities recruit orphans ,korean won about 975 million ,the north korean regime plunders ,975 million annually the report ,north korean won about 975","['north korean', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'Park Kyung - ho', 'the Workers ’ Party', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'the UN Commission', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'Kwon Eun - kyoung', 'UN', 'UN', 'UN', 'Security Council', 'Youn', 'UN', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'UN', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",16,"[ 4.          0.          0.         ... -0.26704174  0.17327358

He then cited insiders reporting from the reclusive country that said while rice is not plentiful, shipments are arriving in stricken areas, which is lowering prices.Besides food prices, the media outlet said that North Korean authorities tried to give precedence in regards to rations to people who lost their homes due to the floods but because so many people lined up to get free food, it was forced to reconsider the practice.According to some estimates, the floods caused by heavy rains accompanied by Typhoon Lionrock left more than 500 people dead or missing, and more than 140,000 others homeless.","rains and floods disrupted food ,corn trading for 300 won ,after torrential rains and floods ,floods disrupted food supplies reaching ,floods caused by heavy rains","['North Korea', 'japanese', 'Asia Press', 'Musan', 'North Hamgyong Province', 'north korean', 'North Korea', 'Jiro Ishimaru', 'Osaka', 'Japan', 'Asia Press', 'RFA', 'north korean', 'Typhoon Lionrock']",12,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.47154996 -0.22767204

The report by Byeon Mi-ri, chief of the Global Future Research Center under the Seoul Institute, also showed that households consisting of one or two people will account for 62 percent of Seoul’s 4.1 million total households by then.  Byeon attributed the decrease in population to high living costs, along with the general trend that involves gradually less people living in the country’s most populous city. As of 2016, about 10.26 million people live in Seoul. But the figure has consistently declined since topping 11 million in 1992.Most of those who left the city are expected to settle down in the so-called capital region of Gyeonggi Province and Incheon, Byeon noted.During the time, Seoul is likely to see a gradual decrease in the working age population , coupled with a continued increase in the senior population made up of those 65 and over.The 15-64 group will drop from 7.5 million to 5.45 million, along with the major consumer group  shrinking from 800,000 to 642,000. This will likely fuel the economic slump, the report noted.The birth rate is also set to decrease, with women of childbearing age falling to 960,000 from the current 1.5 million. But the average life expectancy will be 85.1 for men and 90.7 for women. The average life expectancy for those living in Seoul as of 2014, according to state-run Seoul Statistics, was tallied at 78.99 for men and 85.48 for women.Between the rising life expectancy and falling birth rate, the median age will be set at 52 instead of the current 39. Byeon’s report said the change in demographic will likely spur changes in the lifestyles of Seoulites, with “Social Tribe,” “Nomadingle,” “Me Gray Senior” and “Passive Silver” being the key words of 2040 Seoul.“Social Tribe” refers to those who seek to solve their problems by actively sharing information within the online community via social networking service. “Nomadingle” -- a combination of nomad and single -- are those not constrained by social norms.“Me Gray Senior” refers to the wealthy aged population who actively partakes in social activities, with the flip side of this being the “Passive Silver” group who commit their lives to supporting their family and end up with limited financial means and roles within society. The report was based on data from Statistics Korea and the Seoul Metropolitan Government. It is to be presented at the institute’s seminar on the theme of the city’s future, to be held Tuesday at the Seoul City Hall.By Yoon Min-sik","declined since topping 11 million ,group will drop from million ,consumer group shrinking from 800 ,the economic slump the report ,tuesday at the seoul city","['South Korea ’s', 'Byeon Mi - ri', 'the Global Future Research Center', 'the Seoul Institute', 'Seoul', 'Byeon', 'Seoul', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Incheon', 'Byeon', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Seoul Statistics', 'Byeon ’s', 'Nomadingle', 'Seoul', 'Nomadingle', 'Statistics Korea', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Yoon Min - sik']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52716267  0.44729295

Another 32 percent will be made up of two-member households, she predicted.The increase in such households can be attributed to the growth in women's economic activities and the change in views about marriage, which is already leading to many people opting to stay single or marry at a later age, experts say. Other reasons include the rise of divorces and elderly citizens left alone after the death of a spouse, and young people who don't have a job stable enough to start a family.According to the report, based on data from Statistics Korea and the Seoul Metropolitan Government, the Seoul population will shrink to 9.16 million by 2040 from the current 10 million, due to the decrease in the overall birthrate and high housing-related fees.The working age population, between 15 and 64, will also decrease to 5.45 million from the current 7.5 million, it said.Such a development can lead to a possible slowdown of economic growth.South Korea's life expectancy, meanwhile, is expected to increase to 85.1 years for men and 90.7 years for women by 2040.The country's life expectancy came to 81 years as of end-2013, up 8.6 years from 72.5 years in 1990, according to government data.The details of the report will be released at the institute's seminar on the future of the capital city to be held at city hall Tuesday.","seoul total population by 2040 ,million households another 32 percent ,women by 2040 the country ,seoul institute said 30 percent ,years for women by 2040","['household', 'Seoul', 'the Global Future Research Center', 'the Seoul Institute', 'Statistics Korea', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Seoul', ""South Korea 's""]",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.86410046  0.5342021

The ratio of female workers who received wages below two thirds the national average reached 37.8 percent in 2014, the highest among 22 OECD members checked and 6.8 percentage points more than No. 2 Ireland's number of 31 percent.The figure has steadily fallen from 45.8 percent in 2000 to below 40 percent, but it is still higher than the ratio of underpaid Korean working men at 15.4 percent. The figure for men is 11th among the 22 OECD members reviewed, data showed. The concentration of women in low-paying jobs was above that of major economies including the United States, Great Britain, Germany and Japan, which all remained below the 30 percent mark, the OECD report showed.The gender pay gap was largely attributable to the comparably larger number of qualified women leaving their jobs for child care who later have difficulties in finding higher-paying employment. Experts say the public and private sectors should make concerted efforts to utilize highly educated women and help them retain their jobs by expanding childcare programs.  ""The short-term employment support measures have their own limits,"" Jung Sung-mi, a researcher at the Korea Labor Institute, said.

This development has raised speculation in the South that conditions in the North may be becoming unstable and that the reason behind the defections is changing.Official data showed that while only 19 percent of defectors who escaped before 2001 referred to themselves as having above average incomes when they lived in the North, this shot up to 55.9 percent after 2014.""Compared with the past, the number of North Korean defectors seeking more opportunities and better lives for themselves in South Korea has increased,"" a government official said.Seoul has said the North Korean government's strong pressuring of its overseas workers and diplomats to send more money to the North is one reason more people who are socially well off are defecting. Tougher international sanctions have cut off many of the regime's traditional sources of hard currency. In April, a group of 13 North Koreans working at a restaurant in the Chinese eastern city of Ningbo defected to South Korea en masse.

According to statistics released annually by the Education Ministry in August, the number of students in nationwide preschool, elementary, middle and high schools reached 6.63 million as of April 1, down 2.7 percent from the previous year. The number of middle school students saw the biggest drop of 8.1 percent, compared to a 1.5 percent decrease for elementary school students and a 2 percent fall for high school students. The number of preschoolers increased by 3.2 percent.  Average class sizes also became smaller.  The number of students per class was 22.4 for elementary schools, 27.4 for middle schools and 29.3 for high schools, statistics showed. The student-to-teacher ratio also dwindled, with one teacher in charge of 14.6 elementary school students, 13.3 middle school students and 12.9 high school students. The number of teachers stood at 491,152, a 0.3 percent rise from a year earlier. Their average age was 40.6 years and 70 percent of them were women. Nearly 10 percent of them were not on a regular payroll at schools. Despite the overall fall in students, the number of those from multicultural backgrounds jumped by 20.2 percent from the year before, standing at 99,186 and accounting for 1.7 percent of the total number of students. Students of Vietnamese descent made up the biggest portion at 24.2 percent, followed by Chinese at 21.3 percent, Japanese at 13 percent, Filipino at 12.6 and ethnic Korean-Chinese at 12.4 percent. Nearly 80 percent of them were born in Korea. The number of foreign students also continued to rise, reaching 104,262 in 2016. Among them, 60.5 percent were studying for a degree in Korea. The biggest portion of foreign students were from China, 61.7 percent, followed by Vietnam at 5.5 percent, Mongolia at 3.6 percent, the US at 2.5 percent and Japan at 2.5 percent. Students celebrate their graduation at Seoul National University in Seoul on Monday. About 3.5 million high school graduates, or 69.8 percent of students, entered universities this year, down 2.7 percent from last year. The university entrance rate has declined gradually from 75.4 percent in 2010. Nearly 34 percent of high school students in Korea got a job soon after graduation without pursuing higher education. “Now, there are 120,960 fewer first-year middle school students than first-year high school students. If universities maintain the current admission quota, they will likely have trouble recruiting students,” said an official from the Education Ministry. The Education Ministry has pushed universities to reduce student admission quotas as part of restructuring efforts amid the falling birthrate.

The index has a total of four categories, including economic participation and opportunity, education and health and survival. South Korea’s rank in women’s economic participation and opportunity dropped significantly since 2006, the year the index was first published, according to the report. In 2006, South Korea ranked in the 96th place in the specific category, belonging to the lowest 17 percent. Last year, the country ranked at an even lower place, 125th, belonging to the lowest 14 percent.123rfSouth Korea was also placed at the bottom -- along with Japan and Turkey – among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries in this year’s “glass-ceiling index” compiled and published by the British weekly the Economist. The index was created after combining data on women’s higher education, labor force population, maternity rights and representation in leadership roles, among others.“In South Korea the favorable parental-leave system is mainly a response to its aging populations and shrinking labor force; but in other aspects it is far behind the Nordic countries, whose commitment to sexual equality goes back a long way,” the paper wrote. A 2014 report from the International Monetary Fund found that the wide gender wage gap in South Korea is linked to the country’s employment market that often offers little job security. “These indexes show that little is being done to tackle gender disparity in South Korea,” wrote researcher Park Geum-ryeong in the report. “Among many other things, Korea should come up with its own gender index that is conscious of the country’s unique social and cultural climate that affects the lives of women, such as social pressure on child care and domestic chores.”By Claire Lee","gender gap report released annually ,lowest 14 percent 123rfsouth korea ,index on gender equality last ,on gender equality last year ,weekly the economist the index","['South Korea', 'Gender Gap Report', 'the World Economic Forum', 'the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs', 'the World Economic Forum', 'South Korea', 'South Korea ’s', 'South Korea', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Turkey', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'british', 'South Korea', 'nordic', 'the International Monetary Fund', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'Park Geum - ryeong', 'Korea', 'Claire Lee']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51849365  0.85295331

According to the report released by the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office on drug use, the number of people arrested for drug-related crimes stood at 11,916 in 2015, up 19.4 percent from the previous year. The figure has been rising gradually. It was 9,174 in 2011, 9,255 in 2012, 9,764 in 2013 and 9,984 in 2014. From January to June this year, the number of drug offenders was 6,876, up 33 percent from the same period the year before. At this rate, the number will reach 15,000 this year, said the report. Given the country’s 51.6 million population, this would mean that South Korea can no longer be considered a drug-free nation, as the United Nations grants this status only to countries with 20 or less drug offenders out of every 100,000 people. The prosecution seized some 82.5 kilograms of drugs in 2015, up from 72.6 kilograms in 2014. The proportion of women arrested for drug-related crimes is also on the rise, accounting for 19.9 percent of total offenders in the first half of this year. Women made up 19.1 percent of offenders last year, according to the report. A sniffer dog goes through parcels at the express cargo terminal at Incheon Main Customs. Teenagers’ drug use was also higher and the prosecution said this was because Korean students might be more exposed to drugs through international exchange programs. Some 128 adolescents aged 19 or younger were caught last year, up 25.5 percent from the previous year. The growth in the number of drug offenders is attributed to increased exposure and access to drugs through the internet and social media, the report pointed out. In association with social media, 15.97 kilograms, or 20 percent, of the seized drugs were traded via express parcel or international post. During a massive crackdown on drug dealings in June last year, some 100 people, including a doctor and teacher, were nabbed selling and buying drugs via social media. The most common drugs trafficked into the country was methamphetamine at 56.6 kilograms, followed by marijuana at 24 kilograms, according to the report, with a notable increase in transactions of propofol and zolpidem.Overseas suppliers of drugs have also grown including those from China, Japan, Mexico and Southeastern Asian countries such as Cambodia, Thailand and the Philippines, the prosecution said. The prosecution tightened its clampdown on drug trafficking in partnership with the police in April. It closed down 202 websites from June 2014 to this month and ordered the deletion of some 1,377 postings related to drug transactions. It plans to adopt a program later this year that can automatically detect drug-related posts online to help their investigation.

Up until 2014, the biggest number of such children were either children of unwed mothers or those with divorced parents. According to the study jointly complied by the Welfare Ministry and the National Foster Care Center, a total of 4,503 children were separated from their parents and placed under government protection last year. The largest proportion of them, 25 percent, were those who had been physically or emotionally abused at homes, while 23.7 percent were those from broken homes. Meanwhile, 20 percent were children of unwed, single mothers. Members of an anti-child abuse organization stage a protest on Aug. 10, calling for strict punishment on parents of Shin Won-young, a seven-year-old who died in February after being severely abused and neglected by his father and stepmother. The stepmother was sentenced to 20 years in jail, while the child’s father was sentenced to 15 years behind bars. Only 6.68 percent were orphans who lost both parents, while 0.57 percent were children who got lost.South Korea has seen a number of high-profile child abuse cases this year, including the case of Shin Won-young, a 7-year-old child who had allegedly been locked up and beaten for three months by his stepmother before his death in February. To tackle child abuse, the Gender Ministry has been offering and encouraging Koreans to attend classes on child care and parenting. As of this year, about 80 percent of all reported child abusers are the victims’ parents.The report by the Welfare Ministry also showed that the number of abused children in government foster care increased from 2008-2015, from 891 to 1,094. Among the 4,503 children who were separated from their parents last year, 2,682 of them were admitted to shelters or children’s institutions, while 1,821 of them were either adopted or placed with their grandparents, relatives or temporary foster parents. The report also showed that children of unwed mothers who have been placed at shelters decreased significantly from 2008-2015, from 2,349 to 930. Last year, the Child Support Agency was established after a government study showed that 83 percent of all single parents in Korea never received any child support payments from their ex-spouses or ex-romantic partners as of 2012. Almost 80 percent of all Korean single parents are women, while about 90 percent of Korean adoptees are born to unwed mothers who have few resources to raise their children alone and are vulnerable to social stigmatization.

According to a report submitted by the Korea Institute of Curriculum and Evaluation at the request of Rep. Ahn Min-suk of The Minjoo Party of Korea, 136,900 high school graduates last year sat the College Scholastic Ability Test, also known as Suneung. The figure accounted for 21.56 percent of the total test applicants, up from 19.61 percent in 2013. High school seniors students study for the state-administered College Scholastic Ability Test, which is slated for November. YonhapSince 1993, South Korean students have taken a standardized college entrance exam every November, a process including a CSAT, interviews and essays. CSAT grades are seen as the most decisive factor in who enters top-tier universities, which has led a number of Korean students to sit the annual exam multiple times to get a higher score. Rep. Ahn, member of the parliamentary Education, Culture and Sports Committee, pointed to a lack of careers education as the reason behind the increase in the number of those who apply to repeat the CSAT exam while being fully enrolled at universities. According to the report, 17.2 percent of 294,855 new students at 153 universities in the 2014 school year dropped out or took a year of absence. “It is estimated that the growth in the number of  graduates who took the CSAT again happened because they did not enter the college they wanted,” the lawmaker said. “But it is also because they lacked education on their future career during high school years, chose a major without thinking about it much and decided to take the CSAT again .” By Ock Hyun-ju","855 new students at 153 ,school graduates last year sat ,2013 high school seniors students ,136 900 high school graduates ,new students at 153 universities","['South Korea ’s', 'the Korea Institute of Curriculum and Evaluation', 'Ahn Min - suk', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'the College Scholastic Ability Test', 'Suneung', 'College Scholastic Ability Test', 'south korean', 'CSAT', 'csat', 'korean', 'Ahn', 'Education', 'Culture and Sports Committee', 'CSAT', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",12,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.81873202  0.12130584

As of Aug. 15, 16 Koreans have died of heat-related causes, such as heat stroke. In 2012, 15 people died of heat-released diseases. The number was 14 in 2013 and one in 2014. Last year, 11 lives were lost to heat-related illnesses.YonhapThirteen out of the 16 deaths this year were reported since the last week of July. Heat wave warnings have been issued by the Korea Meteorological Administration in Seoul for 11 consecutive days since July 31. The warning is issued when the daytime high hits 33 degrees Celsius and continues for at least two days. As of Aug. 15, 1,800 individuals had suffered heat-related diseases, which is 1.7 times higher than the total number of patients treated for the condition last year and 3.2 times higher than the number treated in 2014.Among all patients reported this year, the highest proportion of them, 26.8 percent, were those aged 65 or above. In addition, 21.2 percent of the patients developed heat-related diseases while staying indoors, and 28.1 percent developed them between 6 p.m. to 10 a.m. the next day. Lack of air conditioning and the so-called “tropical night” phenomenon -- defined by nighttime low temperatures staying above 25 degrees Celsius -- are considered some reasons behind the statistics. This year also saw the highest number of ozone warnings being issued -- 202 times as of August -- since the alert was introduced here in 1995. Ozone, a gas found in air pollution, is known to cause breathing attacks, indigestion and nausea in many people, especially children and seniors. In general, hot and sunny weather conditions increase the likelihood of high ozone concentrations. To avoid heat-related illnesses, the KCDC advised drinking plenty of fluids and wearing loose-fitting, lightweight clothing. When one cannot avoid staying outdoors in the hot weather, it is important to rest frequently in a cool spot and drink enough water, it added. The agency also stressed that heatstroke is a serious medical emergency and can be life-threatening. “If you see someone who has lost consciousness after being outdoors in hot weather, make sure you call 119 -- the Korean version of 911 -- and seek emergency and professional help,” health authorities said in a statement.

The FKI did not provide the exact ratio of those married to unmarried.Those married currently had an average 1.5 children, while single female workers said they planned to have an average 1.1 children.South Korea's low birthrate has long been a serious problem, especially when its overall population is aging at one of the fastest rates in the world.An earlier report from the FKI showed the ratio of people aged65 years or more is expected to reach 35.15 percent of the total population in 2050, meaning those able to work may be outnumbered by those too old or too young to work.South Korea's birthrate came to a little over 1.2 percent in 2015, the lowest among all members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.To tackle the problem, the central and regional governments have been offering various incentives to newlyweds and those who give birth, ranging from food stamps and tax breaks to payments of up to 5 million won  in cash for a fifth child.Those surveyed, however, said such incentives were neither adequate nor realistic.Nearly 7 out of every 10 people surveyed said the support measures were unrealistic, while only 5.4 percent said they were happy with the government measures.Fear of losing one's job or career apparently played a role in forcing people to postpone or even give up having children, the survey showed.Nearly half, or 47.8 percent of those surveyed, said government support must focus more on issues related to employment of those who give birth, while 42.2 percent of the total also noted a need to promote a work culture that encourages mothers to take childcare leave.","industries 38 percent of unmarried ,percent of unmarried female workers ,38 percent of unmarried female ,500 married and single females ,10 single female workers","['the Federation of Korean Industries', 'FKI', ""South Korea 's"", 'fki', ""South Korea 's"", 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38757825  0.27777645

The North earns about 82 billion won  annually from the sale of the fishing rights to its biggest ally in its coastal waters. All earnings have been funneled to prop up Kim Jong-un's leadership, according to the sources. ""It has been confirmed that Pyongyang has rolled up its sleeves to earn foreign currency by selling the fishing rights in its waters to China. Our analysis shows it has sold the rights above the Northern Limit Line  in the East Sea,"" an intelligence source said. It is widely known that the North has sold fishing rights to China in its waters above the NLL in the Yellow Sea, but this is the first confirmation that the communist state has sold fishing licenses in the East Sea. ""North Korea is selling fishing licenses through an intermediary trade agency,"" the source said. ""But it looks like North Korea plans to manage fishing rights sales directly in the future.""In 2004, Pyongyang and Beijing signed a deal to allow Chinese vessels to catch fish in the East Sea well above the NLL, but the allowed fishing areas didn't include the waters near the inter-Korean sea demarcation line, a government source said. He pointed out that given 900-1,000 Chinese vessels have recently been spotted fishing near the northern side of the sea demarcation line, it is confirmed that China has bought more fishing areas from the North.The sources said some 2,500 Chinese fishing boats are estimated to be fishing in the East Sea and the Yellow Sea waters.  North Korea's earnings from fishing right sales are more than double what the National Intelligence Service reported to the National Assembly's Intelligence Committee last month. The NIS then said North Korea sold $30 million worth of fishing rights in the Yellow Sea to more than 1,500 Chinese vessels.","china has bought more fishing ,30 million worth of fishing ,north korea earnings from fishing ,million worth of fishing rights ,million worth of fishing","['North Korea', 'China', ""Kim Jong - un 's"", 'Pyongyang', 'China', 'China', 'NLL', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Beijing', 'chinese', 'NLL', 'inter - korean', 'chinese', 'China', 'chinese', ""North Korea 's"", 'the National Intelligence Service', ""the National Assembly 's"", 'Intelligence Committee', 'NIS', 'North Korea', 'chinese']",7,"[ 5.          0.          0.         ... -0.71146768  0.17778508

They also give bribes to security officials.","convenience stores north korean female ,started with 20 000 chinese ,24 hour convenience stores have ,of convenience stores north korean ,the chinese trader the stores","['South Korea', 'North Korea', 'China', 'chinese', 'Radio Free Asia', 'Musan', 'Hoeryong', 'North Hamgyong Province', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'RFA', 'Rason', 'Hamhung', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'South Korea', 'Musan County', 'north korean']",0,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -1.04884899  0.55350393

More than 78 percent of groundwater generated daily was directly dumped into rivers, while the rest was sent to sewage disposal plants.The city government said that about one quarter of the groundwater generated every day was sent to rivers due to “environmental reasons,” as it is not adequate to be filtered for potable use. However, the report argued that Seoul’s groundwater was found to be of similar quality as tap water based on the current water analysis system.The report added that groundwater has a stable temperature of 14 to 19 degrees Celsius throughout the seasons, which means it can serve as a resource for air conditioning and heating systems in buildings. YonhapCurrently, just two subway stations in Seoul are using groundwater in air conditioning or heating systems. Subway line No. 4 Gireum Station is reported to have saved at least 61 million won  annually since it started running its air conditioning system with groundwater in June 2014.At some 20 subway stations at least 1,000 cubic meters of groundwater can be found at each daily. Reusing the resource could save up to 13 billion won in total, the report added.  In other developed countries, underground water is used for various purposes. Since the 1990s, the U.S. has been reusing groundwater to operate over 350,000 air conditioning and heating systems inside buildings. Japan has likewise seen energy costs savings of over 40 percent in public hospitals and city halls.According to the Groundwater Act enacted here in 2013, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport encourages places that release over 300 cubic meters of groundwater to utilize it in air conditioning or heating systems to boost “public welfare and the growth of the national economy.”By Kim Da-sol","subway stations is wasted daily ,the groundwater generated every day ,quarter of the groundwater generated ,253 subway stations is wasted ,40 percent in public hospitals","['Seoul', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government ’s', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'the Ministry of Land , Infrastructure and Transport', 'Kim Da - sol']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48367169  0.29081011

About 47 million people, or 92 percent of the population, are Internet users, indicating the nation’s inseparable relationship with their digital space.In an ever so connected society, words spread faster than ever before. So do the malicious comments.In an effort to fight online negativity, professor Min Byoung-chul has been pioneering a campaign for peace on the Internet, fighting online bullying and hateful comments since 2007.The movement, called Sunfull, has now taken roots and wide recognition in Korea, joined by 6,000 elementary, middle and high schools and civic groups. The name originates from “sun,” a Korean word meaning good, and “full,” referring to the word for “reply.”Min Byoung-chul, chairman and founder of the Sunfull Movement Now, Min is moving to spread the movement to other countries, including the U.S. and Japan, with the focus now being China, Korea’s neighbor crucial in cooperation both online and offline. And his efforts have already started to pay off. In 2014, Korean netizens sent a book of condolences to families of victims of the Sichuan earthquake that hit China in 2013. Likewise, Chinese netizens left words of comfort on a memorial website for the dead and missing students from the Sewol ferry accident in 2014.“I believed that the launch of this movement was even possible to contribute to enhancing Korea-China relations,” said Min, chairman and founder of the Sunfull Movement in an interview with The Korea Herald.“A single slanderous comment on the Internet may hurt someone’s feelings or even possibly cause international conflict,” he added.In the same vein, in May last year, Min brought together 3,000 young people from Korea, Japan and China in an aim to build multinational friendship and peace. Participants were also invited to a ceremony to showcase their campaign for peaceful Internet comments, which took place at Gwanghwamun Square in downtown Seoul.“I wish to host more of such events in hopes that the it will foster friendship among the young people of Korea, Japan and China, and allow them to commit themselves to staying away from negative online culture,” said Min.Min lectured at Beijing Language and Culture University in 2014 as a visiting professor to introduce China’s younger generation to positive online culture. He also held a cyber debate via a channel of China’s biggest social media portal Weibo. Min moreover ranked No. 17 on Weibo’s list of people of the year in January for his work for the public welfare in China.“It is just the beginning of my quest to urge youths around the globe to pledge an end to posting negative Internet comments and to send each other peaceful messages,” he added.He stressed that by doing so, the younger generation, the future of society, will acquire positive online habits that can strengthen and build students’ characters.“As studies find, the earlier you start character education, the greater the influence it will have on the child. That’s why it is important to teach young people how to relate to others and put themselves in others’ shoes.“Such personality training can become one’s life habit,” said Min.Min also stressed the need for establishment of regulations to fight slanderous commenting. “Just like when a penalty is given to punish those who violate traffic regulations, there must be a collective effort to control groundless malicious comments,” Min said, arguing for stronger legal action against reckless online negativity. Currently, malicious comments online are punishable under the Act on Promotion of Information and Communications Network Utilization and Information Protection for spreading false facts or defamation. One can receive up to three years imprisonment or a fine of 30 million won . Most cases end up with a monetary penalty.“And by doing so clean online culture will settle here and spread to other countries as a good example.”By Kim Da-sol","world fastest average internet connection ,the world fastest average internet ,world fastest average internet ,fastest average internet connection speed ,fastest average internet connection","['South Korea', 'Min Byoung', 'Korea', 'korean', 'the Sunfull Movement now', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'China', 'Korea', 'korean', 'netizen', 'Sichuan', 'China', 'chinese', 'Korea', 'the Sunfull Movement', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'China', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'Weibo', 'Weibo', 'China', 'Kim Da - sol']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.11689854  0.46926159

Speaking to Yonhap News Agency on the sidelines of a meeting of heads of overseas diplomatic missions in Rome on Saturday, Yun Byung-se said the Maltese government has decided to take firm steps in relation to human rights abuse of migrant workers.""Valletta has stopped extending visas for North Korean workers and will not issue new ones,"" South Korea's top diplomat said.The development is noteworthy because Malta has maintained a close relationship with North Korea since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1971. There have been reports that the rights of North Korean workers in the country have been violated and the money these workers earned was being used to prop up the regime in Pyongyang that was slapped with the strongest sanctions yet by the United Nations Security Council earlier this year.The international body took strong action after the North conducted its fourth nuclear test in January and fired off a long range missile a month later. Yun Byung-se  poses for a photo with South Korean heads of overseas diplomatic missions of European Union countries at a meeting in Rome on July 30.Yun then said starting with Malta, European countries that still host North Korean workers, such as Poland, are taking similar actions to stop the flow of cash to the reclusive country.In addition, the minister said he conveyed to his Maltese counterpart a wish to ink an agreement that would permit working holiday arrangements and other ways to expand exchanges between the peoples of South Korea and Malta.""Although Malta is small, it is situated between Europe and Africa, and its position will grow when it assumes the rotating chairmanship of the European Union in the first half of next year,"" he stressed.The official then said he held talks with his Italian counterpart Paolo Gentiloni and agreed to expand cooperation in such areas as defense, the arms industry and creative economy areas. The two sides agreed to expand two-way commerce that hit $9 billion last year to over $10 billion.Yun said Seoul needs to strengthen ties with Italy due to the country's importance on the international stage and its large potential. He pointed out that with Britain's decision to leave the EU, Italy's role, along with that of Germany and France, will grow.Rome is set to become the chair of the Group of Seven meeting and a nonpermanent member of the UNSC next year.The minister, meanwhile, said at the meeting of South Korea's diplomatic missions in the EU that Seoul needs to take more steps to protect its people in Europe in the wake of terrorist attacks and work with European countries to enforce tighter sanctions against North Korea.On the matter of Choe Ryong-hae, vice chairman of North Korea's State Affairs Commission, making a stopover in Beijing on his way to Brazil for the opening ceremony of the Summer Olympic Games, Yun did not place much importance on it. ""The matter does need to be checked further, but Choe may have just stopped at the Chinese capital en route to Rio de Janeiro,"" Yun said.Around 30 North Korean athletes have been sent to Brazil to compete in wrestling, judo, marathon and six other sports at the Olympics scheduled to run from Aug. 5 to 21.China and North Korea seem to be trying to mend relations that have been frayed by Pyongyang's saber-rattling in recent years.At the recent ASEAN Regional Forum held in Laos, China showed its willingness to engage the North in dialogue as a way of showing its displeasure with Seoul and Washington for their joint decision to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system on the Korean Peninsula. Seoul and Washington have brushed aside dialogue proposals with the North by insisting the country make a firm commitment to denuclearization first.","valletta has stopped extending visas ,has stopped issuing work visas ,stopped issuing work visas to ,stopped issuing work visas ,workers valletta has stopped extending","['Malta', 'North Koreans', ""South Korea 's"", 'Yonhap News Agency', 'Rome', 'Yun Byung - se', 'maltese', 'north korean', ""South Korea 's"", 'Malta', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'Pyongyang', 'the United Nations Security Council', 'Yun Byung - se', 'south korean', 'European Union', 'Rome', 'Malta', 'european', 'north korean', 'Poland', 'maltese', 'South Korea', 'Malta', 'Malta', 'the European Union', 'italian', 'Paolo Gentiloni', 'Yun', 'Seoul', 'Italy', 'Britain', 'EU', 'Italy', 'Germany', 'France', 'Rome', 'Group of Seven', 'UNSC', ""South Korea 's"", 'EU', 'Seoul', 'european', 'North Korea', 'Choe Ryong - hae', ""North Korea 's"", 'State Affairs Commission', 'Beijing', 'Brazil', 'Choe', 'chinese', 'Rio de Janeiro', 'Yun', 'north korean', 'Brazil', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'ASEAN', 'Laos', 'China', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'Seoul', 'Washington']",18,"[ 4.          0.          0.         ... -0.68262792 -0.13272533

Considering the size of the foreign population grew by an annual average of 8 percent during the 2011-2015 period, the Justice Ministry expects the number to exceed 3 million and make up 5.82 percent of the population by 2021.  Foreigners -- some wearing traditional Korean clothing, others military uniforms -- take part in the 2016 Namdaemun Market Global Festival that opened at the market in downtown Seoul on May 26 for a three-day run. The festival gives visitors a chance to experience both traditional and modern Korean culture. Among the foreign population, 74 percent, or 1.48 million, had been staying in Korea for more than 90 days, the minimum number of days for them to be considered long-term residents. That was seven times higher than the 219,962 during the same period in 2000. By nationality, the majority came from China at 50.6 percent. That was followed by Americans at 7.8 percent, Vietnamese at 7.2 percent, Thais at 4.6 percent and Filipinos at 2.7 percent, the data showed.  Chinatown in Incheon The growth has been attributed to a rise in Chinese workers following the enforcement of the Visiting Employment System in 2007, open to ethnic Koreans in Russia and China, the ministry said. The number of Chinese in Korea soared from 58,984 in 2000 to 807,076 in 2016. The Employment Permit System, which invites workers from 13 countries in Southeast Asia to fill jobs mostly in manufacturing and construction, also contributed to the rise in the foreign population, the ministry commented.

According to data on the types of employment in 3,454 conglomerates involving 4.73 million workers, 38.7 percent of the Korean workers at large companies were either hired temporarily by the firms or indirectly through outsourcing firms. Of the irregular workers, 19.7 percent of the laborers were recruited through subcontractors or external human resources agencies and dispatched to conglomerates. Of those directly recruited by conglomerates, 23.7 percent were on temporary contracts. Companies bigger in size are more prone to “indirectly” hire workers, according to the survey. Companies with less than 500 employees had 14 percent of their workers hired through outsourcing firms, while those with more than 5,000 staff members had 26.6 percent on their irregular payroll. By industry, the construction sector generated the most irregular jobs at 44.5 percent, followed by the manufacturing sector -- especially in steel, metal and shipbuilding -- at 24.4 percent, the transportation sector at 22.7 percent, and the wholesale and retail industry at 22.6 percent. The employment data came amid growing concerns over job insecurity and poor working conditions for irregular workers who do mostly unwanted work left vacant by regular employees or the same kind of jobs as permanent workers for a lot less income. But the Korea Employers Federation lashed out at the scheme for “misleading the public” by giving the impression that temporary jobs are bad and those hiring workers through outsourced firms create low-quality jobs. Members of the Federation of Korea Trade Unions, one of the top two umbrella labor groups here, stage a rally on Thursday, demanding for the resignation of Employment and Labor Minister Lee Ki-kweon. YonhapThe plight of irregular workers came to public attention recently after a 19-year-old irregular employee, surnamed Kim, died while fixing a subway screen door on his own at Guui Station when he was supposed to have been working in a team of two. Labor unions see the death as a result of Seoul Metro’s cost-saving strategy that outsources safety-related jobs to subcontractors.The number of irregular employees nationwide stands at 6.15 million, making up 32 percent of the entire labor force.According to government data, the wage for irregular workers is 11,452 won  per hour or 65.5 percent of that of regular workers. Workers hired through outsourcing firms were paid 8,589 won, the least among irregular workers, compared to laborers on temporary position taking home 11,575 won. Also, irregular workers are more likely to be excluded from social safety nets. While 95 percent of the regular employees are under employment, health and occupational accident insurance schemes, only 67 percent of irregular workers have such social protection. The management bloc, however, believes that it should be given more flexibility to hire and fire workers to save production costs and outperform foreign competitors for Korea’s export-driven, manufacturing-focused economy.

This is due to introduction of new bituminous or soft coal-based and nuclear energy power plants as well as low oil prices, it said.While industrial demands for coal such as from steel manufacturers and cement plants will remain stagnant, the demands for power generation will rise. New bituminous coal power plants at a combined size of 6.7 gigawatts are to start being mobilized by the end of this year.In comparison, the demands for natural gas is expected to reduce by 6.4 percent this year, following last year’s decline by 8.7 percent. The institute said it was due to large-scale expansion of base-load power stations that use nuclear power or coal that are relatively cheaper to generate power from.The institute also said the report is based on government energy policies that were in place before the measures to cut back on fine dust were released.Such forecast runs counter to the government’s measures last month to decommission some of the coal-based power plants into environment-friendly ones such as by shutting down outdated coal power plants, in order to reduce fine dust that has surged as a serious cause of air pollution.The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy officials reportedly explained that mobilization of newly-built power plants is inevitable to meet the demand and that no details have yet been settled on suspending time-worn coal power plants.","new bituminous coal power plants ,thursday the korea energy economics ,will rise new bituminous coal ,rise new bituminous coal power ,down outdated coal power plants","['South Korea ’s', 'the Korea Energy Economics Institute', 'South Korea', 'the Ministry of Trade , Industry and Energy']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36615658  0.14400156

Undated photo shows the Kaesong Industrial Complex, a joint inter-Korean factory park in the North's border town of Kaesong. ""North Korea's private financing has now evolved into a market that has a supply-demand structure and even a remittance system,"" the report said.Underground bankers served mainly as money exchangers in the 1980s before expanding into loan sharking in the 1990s, and private lending and investment in the 2000s, it said, adding they have established a money remittance system in this decade.North Korea's underground banking further expanded after Pyongyang ordered state companies to raise funds needed for production on their own, while private money lenders are even credited with contributing to the recovery of its economy by investing in diverse industries and running companies, it said.The report also said the development of North Korea's underground banking into a market system has helped stabilize interest rates in the impoverished and reclusive country.Monthly interest on loans ranged from 13 percent to 15 percent in the 2000s, but the rate has fallen to the 5 to 10 percent range in the 2010s.""North Korea has no choice but to recognize the expansion of underground banking and is even pushing for measures to regularize foreign currency traded on the black market,"" the report said. ""The private financing market is expected to be more specialized down the road, which could serve as a catalyst for the market economy in the country, and its reform and opening.""North Korea has suffering from economic hardships, hit by international sanctions on the secretive country for its nuclear and missile ambitions.

CCTV argued that Chinese patients are typically charged from two to 10 times higher than locals, leading them to eventually stop visiting Seoul for cosmetic surgery.Lured by the beauty of Korean celebrities and in search of trendy and professional surgeons, a total of 36,224 foreigners received cosmetic surgeries in Korea in 2014. About 56 percent, or 20,480 of them, chose clinics in Gangnam, according to the Ministry of Health and Welfare.However, those clinics are seeing a downturn in patient numbers. The Ministry’s data showed the number of foreign patients was 12,000 in 2015, a fall of 40 percent from 2014.While many of the clinics attributed the shrinking number to the outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome last year, experts say the dwindling number of Chinese customers -- the biggest proportion of foreign patients -- is chiefly because of their falling satisfaction.“I deem the number of Chinese patients visiting Gangnam for cosmetic surgery to have dropped by as much as one-third,” a woman who wished to remain anonymous told The Korea Herald. She runs a pharmacy in a clinic-filled street in Apgujeong-dong in Gangnam and added that this trend has been taking place over the last two years.She pointed out that many of the tourists, who typically have trouble communicating in Korean, were often exposed to illegal brokers and were overcharged. A speaker talks during a forum hosted by the Korea Health Industry Development Institute and China Cosmetic Surgery Association in Shanghai, China on April 23. The forum was held to ease negative public sentiment among Chinese patients who often deal with problems such as illegal brokers, unqualified surgeons and excessive commissions. Yonhap“When a Chinese patient pays a commission fee to a broker, the operation cost would have to go down,” she said. “Because the operation cost is low, the surgery will be undertaken by an intern surgeon or even an unqualified doctor, which leads to frequent medical malpractice,” she added.Experts said that the industry’s lax regulations towards medical practitioners, such as lack of emergency training or proper equipment, have begun to affect Seoul’s reputation as a top medical tourism destination.A Chinese tourist was pronounced brain-dead last year during a cosmetic surgery operation. Such tragedies have prompted warnings of possible complications that can occur from such surgeries to be circulated online and via social media in China. Upon investigation, it was found that her surgeon did not have a proper medical license and the clinic had employed brokers to cajole foreign tourists to receive surgery at the clinic.“There is currently no regulation or standard that supervises and checks the status of facilities and equipment at private clinics,” Kwon Young-dae, a board-certified doctor who runs a cosmetic surgery clinic in Gangnam and director of public relations for the Korean Board of Plastic Surgeons, told The Korea Herald. He explained that for a cosmetic surgery clinic, a simple set of operating equipment, sterilizers and a surgery room would be sufficient to operate. Under the current Medical Service Act, nonspecialist or general doctors can open practice of any service with due facility and equipment. Up until 2007, general practitioners when opening their practice had to abide by a set of rules, specifying their area of service to differentiate them from specialists. The regulations, however, have since been eased.Kwon added that such a legal loophole has led to exaggerated advertisements and doctors trying to attract patients more through marketing than professionalism. Analysts see there are roughly 10,000 nonspecialist doctors in Korea performing plastic surgery, while board-certified plastic surgeons are much fewer, at around 2,000. After getting a medical degree, they must take training courses, do a one-year internship and four years of plastic surgery in order to receive the certification.Chinese patients are usually not aware if their doctors are board-certified or not. Faced with a myriad of issues that may compromise the health and safety of patients, the South Korean government vowed in April to take steps to support foreign patients to check what procedures they receive and how much they should pay. The government said that in doing so, it would target a million foreign patients and 2.9 trillion won  in medical revenues by 2020.The Ministry of Health and Welfare said it would allow foreign patients to reclaim 10 percent of value-added tax. The ministry also capped the commissions that agents can charge, in order to avoid illegal brokers affecting the fixed surgery cost.However, industry insiders say it will still be difficult to fully guarantee patients visit reliable clinics.“We cannot fully guarantee that all cosmetic clinics we are partnered with operate surgeries under certified doctors. It is actually difficult to monitor all of them,” said an official from the government-run Gangnam Medical Tour Center, which opened its doors in 2014 to connect foreign patients with the safest clinics in Seoul.“Monitoring brokerage agents is even more difficult, because they will appear anyway in different form,” she added.By Kim Da-sol","000 nonspecialist doctors in korea ,seoul for cosmetic surgery lured ,chinese tourist allegedly being overcharged ,chinese patients visiting gangnam for ,top medical tourism destination chinese","['Beijing ’s', 'China Central Television', 'Seoul', 'chinese', 'Gangnam', 'Seoul', 'CCTV', 'chinese', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Gangnam', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare', 'the Ministry ’s', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'Gangnam', 'the Korea Herald', 'Apgujeong - dong', 'Gangnam', 'Korean', 'the Korea Health Industry Development Institute', 'China Cosmetic Surgery Association', 'Shanghai', 'China', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'Seoul', 'chinese', 'China', 'Gangnam', 'the Korean Board of Plastic Surgeons', 'the Korea Herald', 'Kwon', 'Korea', 'chinese', 'south korean', '2020.The Ministry of Health and Welfare', 'Gangnam Medical Tour Center', 'Seoul', 'Kim Da - sol']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42619866  0.74838269

However, the figure for those aged 65 and older reached 30.6 percent for South Korea, trumping Japan's 21.7 percent.Japan's high senior employment rate was attributed to its well-established policy system to support job searches by the elderly.After introducing a law to tackle population aging in 1995, Tokyo started spending state funds on helping senior citizens land jobs in 1997, with the related budget growing at an annual average rate of 4.7 percent since.

Every year, some ...","More infertility treatments, including medical examinations, will be covered by national health insurance in Korea starting next year, as part of the government’s measures to boost the nation’s low fertility rate, the Health Ministry announced on Sunday.According to the ministry, the number of Korean couples who sought medical help for infertility increased from 178,000 in 2006 to 215,000 in 2015. Every year, some 200,000 Koreans are newly diagnosed with the condition, which is defined as not being able to become pregnant after a full year of trying.Starting next year, medical costs for infertility tests, such as semen analysis, hormone testing and biopsies, will be covered by the national health insurance. More treatments, such as fertility drugs for women with ovulation disorders and sedative drugs used during an egg retrieval procedure needed for intrauterine insemination or in vitro fertilization will be covered as well, the ministry said.As part of its demographic policies to tackle low birthrate, the South Korean government has been providing state allowances for Koreans with infertility since 2006. In 2010, the Health Ministry started giving subsidies for those who wish to receive an IUI -- a fertility treatment that involves placing sperm inside a woman’s uterus to facilitate fertilization -- and external fertilization procedures. To qualify for the subsidy, each couple has to earn 150 percent of the national average monthly income -- about 5.27 million won  -- or less. For the IUI, a couple can receive up to 500,000 won, which covers about half of the total cost, for up to three procedures. For eternal fertilization, a maximum of 3 million won is given to each couple, according to their household income, for up to four procedures. In general, a single IUI costs about 500,000 won, while a single extra fertilization procedure costs about 1.5 million won.From 2006-2015, a total of 100,993 newborns were born here to parents who received state support for their infertility treatments. The budget for the program also increased dramatically from 31.5 billion won in 2007 to 92.5 billion won this year.Still, a recent study has shown that many couples are struggling with infertility, especially those who have not been able to conceive even after three or four IUI or extra fertilization procedures. The study by Hwang Na-mi from the Korea Institute and Social Affairs found that 81.9 percent of the surveyed 1,063 Korean women who were being treated for infertility were extremely stressed because of the condition. Also, 59.6 percent of them said they felt socially isolated and depressed because of infertility.Another study by researcher Hwang, published in May, found that more than 75 percent of Koreans who received government subsidies for IUI in 2014 had unexplained infertility. The figure is strikingly high compared to the world average -- only about 30 percent of all men and women who get treated for infertility worldwide are diagnosed with unexplained infertility, according to the World Health Organization. The statistics may indicate that infertile Korean couples are not being properly tested -- by not being asked to undergo the required semen analysis or ovulation testing -- before receiving IUI or IVF, researcher Hwang explained.  The Health Ministry is also to introduce a three-day vacation for workers who are being treated for infertility, starting next year, officials said.By Claire Lee","000 koreans are newly diagnosed ,trying starting next year medical ,korean couples who sought medical ,surveyed 063 korean women who ,koreans are newly diagnosed with","['Korea', 'the Health Ministry', 'korean', 'Koreans', 'south korean', 'Koreans', 'the Health Ministry', 'IUI', 'IUI', 'IUI', 'IUI', 'Hwang Na - mi', 'the Korea Institute and Social Affairs', 'korean', 'Hwang', 'Koreans', 'IUI', 'the World Health Organization', 'korean', 'IUI', 'IVF', 'Hwang', 'the Health Ministry', 'Claire Lee']",11,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.650105    0.60540634

The report said that South Korea could see at least 1,109 early deaths per 1 million people in 2060 -- the only OECD member to exceed the 1,000 mark -- unless the country makes significant efforts to prevent air pollution.The premature death rate for Australia and New Zealand for the same year was projected to be only 95 early deaths per 1 million people, just 8.6 percent of South Korea’s figure. Other than South Korea, India and China was also predicted to see the biggest rises in mortality rates from air pollution, due to rising populations and exposure to emissions from factories and traffic.  An activist wearing a oxygen mask hold a performance calling for all-out measures to fight against air pollution in Seoul. The report also highlighted that increasing health costs and decreasing labor productivity will have the biggest impact on gross domestic product loss. Countries like China, Russia, India and Korea will be hit hardest by GDP losses, it added.Between 2001 and 2006, the concentration of coarse particulate matters  were 51 to 61 micrograms per cubic meter in Seoul. With the implementation of the air environment management plans for the metropolitan region since 2005, the concentration dropped to below 60 micrograms per cubic meter and further to 40 micrograms per cubic meter in 2014.Air has improved at a stagnant pace since then, with air quality remaining poor compared to other advanced nations. Experts say that the high density of fine dust in South Korea derives from its high population density and rapid industrialization, as well as the impact of geographical proximity with China. Major domestic culprits include emissions from vehicles and coal-fired power plants.Other causes also come from the meteorological characteristics of the country, such as precipitation being concentrated during summer, making it harder for fine dust to be washed out. Frequent formation of high atmospheric pressure also leads to air stagnation. Last May, when the OECD unveiled the 2016 Better Life Index, South Korea ranked last out of 38 OECD member countries. According to the report, South Korea’s average level of ultrafine dust particle concentration was at 29.1 micrograms per cubic meter, double the OECD average of 14.05 micrograms per cubic meter and triple the World Health Organization’s recommended level at 10 micrograms per cubic meter. “The number of lives cut short by air pollution is already terrible and the potential rise in the next few decades is terrifying,” said OECD Environment Director Simon Upton in the latest report.“If this is not motivation enough to act, this report shows there will also be a heavy economic cost to not taking action. We must prevent these projections from becoming reality,” he added.By Kim Da-sol","million premature deaths and economic ,109 early deaths per million ,economic consequences of trillion annually ,cause to million premature deaths ,korea will be hit hardest","['the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', '2060.South Korea', 'South Korea', 'OECD', 'Australia', 'New Zealand', 'South Korea ’s', 'South Korea', 'India', 'China', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Russia', 'India', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'China', 'OECD', 'Better Life Index', 'South Korea', 'OECD', 'South Korea ’s', 'OECD', 'the World Health Organization ’s', 'OECD Environment', 'Simon Upton', 'Kim Da - sol']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51264071  0.28817707

There have been a slew of reports from overseas that warned of worsening air pollution in Korea, with the latest being Yale University’s study released last Friday. It found that Korea ranked 173rd out of 180 countries in terms of air quality. One of the main culprits for the worsening air quality is particulate matter, otherwise known as fine dust. The small particles -- 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter -- can penetrate deep into the respiratory organs and blood vessel, causing serious illness such as lung cancer, stroke, heart diseases, and both chronic and acute respiratory diseases.But the origin of the toxic matter and the measures to prevent them remain debatable, leaving the general public mystified about how they should go about their daily lives. Here are some clarifications on some of the misperceptions toward fine dust. The sky in Seoul city is covered with fine dust. YonhapMost fine dust in South Korea comes from ChinaFalse. Certainly, yellow dust is mostly blown from the desert of Mongolia and Northern China, bringing with it some toxic particles picked up along the way. However, according to Greenpeace in 2015, 50 to 70 percent of the harmful dust came from South Korea’s coal power plants. A government study also supports the claim. The Comprehensive Plan for Fine Dust, an interagency study published in December 2013, found that only some 30 to 50 percent of the toxic material came from overseas.  Grilling mackerel indoors is worse than walking around in “very poor” air quality True. A 2016 report from the Environment Ministry said that grilling mackerel without proper ventilation can produce 2,290 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter, about 20 times greater in density than the level considered to be “very harmful,” which is 101 microgram per cubic meters. The World Health Organization said in its 2014 report that in addition to outdoor air pollution, indoor smoke is a serious health risk for some 3 billion people who cook and heat their homes with biomass fuels and coal.Depending on the cooking method, the level of the toxic material varies. Grilling is known to produce almost eight times more ultrafine dust then boiling, and more than three times the amount produced by frying. Health officials recommend that people keep windows open when grilling fish or other food. Diesel cars are more harmful than gasoline cars True. Diesel cars produce about 20 times more particulate matter and nitrogen oxide than cars powered by gasoline, according to the Environment Ministry, which has imposed a strict limit on the amount of gas being produced by diesel cars. However, some local media outlets have claimed that diesel and gasoline cars emit pretty much the same amount of toxic matter into the air. Citing a 2009 experiment conducted by the Korea Institute of Energy Research, they criticized the government for singling out diesel cars as the main cause of pollutants. But a KIE official has refuted the argument, saying that the result does not include the amount of nitrogen oxide that contributes to the creation of toxic particles. Working out is still good even in bad air as benefits outweigh risks False. Working out requires more use of the mouth for breathing than the nose, hence increasing the amount of fine dust that enters the body. According to a 2015 study from Intermountain Healthcare, people with heart disease face an increased risk of a serious heart attack during days with poor air quality, which refers to days with above 25 micrograms of fine particulate matter per cubic meter of airWearing masks can protect one from all harmful dustFalse. Some ultra-small harmful particles can still penetrate through average dust masks. Depending on the level of protection, masks designed specifically for fine dust are classified into three types and assigned different “KF” numbers – 80, 94 and 99. The number refers to the thickness of the masks. These masks are known to filter out more than 80 percent of the toxic dust.  But young kids, pregnant women and asthma patients should be careful not to choose masks that have higher protection levels. If the mask is too thick, they could have more trouble breathing. Authorities say that the KF 80 mask is sufficient enough for those who have weaker respiratory systems. If the sky is blue, we are safe from air pollutionFalse. Weather experts say that the blueness of the sky is determined by the size of the particulate matter. If the particles are less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, they prevent sunlight from reaching the ground, making the sky become unclear.  So we can have blue skies even when the air is peppered with dust – as long as they are not small enough to be dispersed by sunlight. For instance, the skies were clear during the final week of last April, but the authorities had issued warnings for the harmful dust, which mostly consisted of larger particles.  By Yeo Jun-suk","worsening air pollution in korea ,pollution indoor smoke is serious ,lung cancer stroke heart diseases ,diesel cars are more harmful ,serious heart attack during days","['South Korea', 'Korea', 'Yale University ’s', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'ChinaFalse', 'Greenpeace', 'South Korea ’s', 'the Environment Ministry', 'the World Health Organization', 'diesel', 'diesel', 'the Environment Ministry', 'the Korea Institute of Energy Research', 'KIE', 'Intermountain Healthcare', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33710656  0.29450405

It said such a development will seriously affect leader Kim Jong-un's so-called ""gift politics,"" which has been a tool to exercise control over North Korea's elites. Quoting the Swiss Watch Industry Association, RFA said North Korea bought a total of 87 watches in the first four months of 2016 worth $11,140.RFA said the North's halting of watch imports is a clear indication of the Swiss federal government's stern sanctions against Pyongyang. The reclusive country has unwaveringly pursued nuclear and missile programs despite warnings from the international community. The media forecast that the Swiss government's sanctions will squeeze the Pyongyang regime in other fields including finance. In early March, the U.N. Security Council adopted its toughest-ever sanctions, Resolution 2270, to punish the North's nuclear and missile tests in January and February, respectively. In response to the U.N.'s punitive action, the Swiss government in May placed 25 of its luxury items on the embargo list for the North. The items include caviar, wine, cigars, luxury wristwatches, ski and golf equipment and home appliances.As a consequence, RFA said, Kim is experiencing trouble giving gifts to loyalists. The leader is known for giving luxury items to his family members, senior officials of the party and the military to secure their allegiance. Kim's control is partly maintained by keeping the country's ruling class on his side.","reclusive country for its nuclear ,korea swiss watch imports fell ,government stern sanctions against pyongyang ,swiss federal government stern sanctions ,unable to import luxury watches","['North Korea', 'Switzerland', 'european', 'Radio Free Asia', ""North Korea 's"", 'swiss', ""Kim Jong - un 's"", ""North Korea 's"", 'the Swiss Watch Industry Association', 'RFA', 'North Korea', 'swiss', 'Pyongyang', 'swiss', 'Pyongyang', 'the U.N.

The item accounted for 40.2 percent of its overall exports, the data showed.Exports of clothing rose 5.5 percent on-year to $800 million, with its portion in the North's entire export rising to 29.7 percent from 24.1 percent in 2014.","imports also dropped 30 percent ,outbound shipments fell 15 percent ,trade volume sank 18 percent ,imports also dropped 30 ,last year narrowing 33 percent","[""North Korea 's"", 'south korean', 'Korea Trade - Investment Promotion Agency', 'China', 'KOTRA', 'North Korea', 'China', ""North Korea 's"", 'China', 'China', 'Russia', 'north korean', 'India', 'Thailand']",7,"[ 3.          0.          0.         ... -0.45888549  0.75407034

In Seoul, 6,925 domestic abuses cases were reported, a 52.4 percent rise from a year prior. As of May, police have been monitoring 12,000 families with previous reports of domestic violence. During the first five months of this year, police cracked down on 18,585 cases.The police said the surge in the number of domestic violence cases is a result of the creation of teams of investigators specializing in crimes against women and children. The teams were created last February in light of a series of brutal child abuse cases that led to the deaths of children in the hands of their abusive parents.According to a 2014 survey by the Korea Legal Aid Center for Family Relations on 93 domestic abusers, 82.4 percent of the offenders were men, while 17.2 percent were women. Most of the cases were violence between couples, with 69.9 percent of the physical abuse having been committed by men against women. Nearly 35 percent of the crimes occurred due to differences in their personalities, followed by intake of alcohol at 19.2 percent and mistrust between couples at 18 percent.A survey by the Gender Ministry has shown that the majority of domestic violence cases still tend to remain unreported. According to the poll on domestic violence conducted every three years, only 1.8 percent of abuse cases were reported to police in 2013. Police currently monitor families in danger of being exposed to domestic violence by dividing them into two groups.Group A are households in which the family member experienced at least two occasions of domestic violence within the past three years, or at least three reports to the police within the past year. They also include those that have been slapped with an injunction. Police have been paying such families a visit or calling them once a month.Group B are those who have suffered from domestic violence at least once within the past three years with at least two occasions of a family member reporting to police within the past year. The monitoring for Group B families is conducted once every two months.As of May, 4,294 Korean families  belong to Group A, and 7,940 families to Group B.By Ock Hyun-ju","violence soared dramatically on year ,2015 in seoul 925 domestic ,domestic violence soared dramatically on ,2013 police currently monitor families ,domestic violence soared dramatically","['South Koreans', 'the National Police Agency', 'South Gyeongsang Province', 'Seoul', 'the Korea Legal Aid Center for Family Relations', 'the Gender Ministry', 'Group', 'korean', 'Group A', 'Group', 'B.By Ock Hyun - ju']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.94955063  0.48402712

Meanwhile, 64 percent of day care centers in remote areas said the biggest concern they have is the lack of applicants who are fully qualified for the job.The study stressed that kindergartens and day care centers in remote regions need highly qualified and capable individuals as employees, as children being raised by their grandparents or foreign-born mothers often require specific needs and care. According to the study, 48.7 percent of all children at day care centers and kindergartens in remote regions were from double-income households, while 10.2 percent of them were born to foreign-born women married to South Korean nationals. However, statistics showed that teachers who work at day care centers in remote regions in general have a lower education level than those who work in cities. Currently, the minimum requirement to be a teacher at day care centers nationwide is a high school diploma. However, 34.7 percent of all day care teachers in cities had a degree from a four-year university program. Yet in the nation’s fishing and farming regions, only 24.1 percent of all day care center teachers had a university degree.The study also found that because of the shortage of employees, meals were prepared by the director of the institutions, not a certified cook, at 25.9 percent of all day care centers in remote areas. Also, 24.5 percent of the centers in such regions had uncertified cooks prepare meals and snacks for the children. To improve the situation, the think tank suggested making sure all kindergartens and day care centers nationwide have a certified cook to ensure food safety, as well as introducing measures to attract more qualified teachers to the nation’s remote regions. “Offering higher salary, as well as safe housing, can be one such measure,” researchers wrote in the report.By Claire Lee","44 percent of all kindergartens ,towns had trouble hiring teachers ,trouble hiring teachers while 38 ,fishing towns had trouble hiring ,hiring teachers while 38 percent","['South Korea ’s', 'the Korea Institute of Child Care and Education', 'south korean', 'Claire Lee']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23447619  0.72774148

We need global solidarity, commitment and investment to end the epidemic for good.”The top health official participated in this year’s High-Level Meeting on Ending AIDS, a two-day annual event held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York last week.The UNAIDS Fast-Track approach to end the AIDS epidemic has a set of time-bound targets. Of them is reducing the number of newly infected patients from 2.1 million in 2015 to fewer than 500,000 in 2020 and that of AIDS-related deaths from 1.1 million to fewer than 500,000 in the same time period.The commitment also includes eliminating HIV-related discrimination and to ultimately end the epidemic by 2030.According to UNAIDS, remarkable progress has been made in the response to HIV since the last U.N. general assembly meeting on the disease in 2011. As of 2015, 17 million people had access to antiretroviral drugs. During the same period, new HIV infections among children and AIDS-related deaths have been considerably reduced. However, the agency stressed that too many individuals, especially young women, intravenous drug users, sex workers, gay men and other men who have sex with men as well as transgender people are still excluded from such improvements. According to Jung’s speech, more than 2 million people were newly infected with HIV in 2014 alone, while 1.2 million people died from AIDS or AIDS-related diseases. A UNAIDS report also showed that more than 5,000 young women acquired HIV every week, the vast majority in southern Africa, while AIDS-related illnesses remain the leading cause of death among women of reproductive age globally. In South Korea, more than 90 percent of reported AIDS patients from 1985-2014 were male. This means female patients may not be seeking professional help or remain unaware of their HIV infection. Throughout the 2000s, studies by the National Human Rights Commission and Inha University showed that Korean AIDS patients struggled with fear of unemployment and social discrimination.Stigmatization against people with AIDS continues to prevail in South Korea. In March, a study showed that more than 95 percent of 5,627 surveyed South Koreans were against the Health Ministry’s decision last year to bar geriatric hospitals from rejecting AIDS patients -- claiming the newly introduced legislation is unsafe for the public and therefore needs to be abolished. “The AIDS epidemic today is more than ever characterized by stigma and discrimination,” said a UNAIDS report. “People living with HIV and the people most vulnerable to HIV, including, among others, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, people in detention, face high levels of stigma. Addressing stigma and discrimination in all aspects of life and society, including in health-care settings, is therefore essential for ending AIDS by 2030.”While a law revision in 2008 prohibited any discrimination against people with HIV in the workplace here, and the country has no HIV-specific travel restrictions solely based on HIV status since 2010, South Korea has yet to pass a comprehensive antidiscrimination law.  “We must raise public awareness on HIV/AIDS based on accurate information, thereby eliminating social prejudices and improving access to voluntary HIV testing and treatment,” Jung said in his speech in New York.By Claire Lee","the aids epidemic by 2030 ,recent meeting ending the hiv ,aids epidemic by 2030 stressing ,to end the aids epidemic ,aids two day annual event","['South Korea', 'Jung Ki - suck', 'Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'U.N.', 'the United Nations Headquarters', 'New York', 'the UNAIDS Fast - Track', 'UNAIDS', 'U.N.', 'Jung ’s', 'UNAIDS', 'South Korea', 'the National Human Rights Commission', 'Inha University', 'Korean', 'South Korea', 'South Koreans', 'the Health Ministry ’s', 'UNAIDS', 'South Korea', 'Jung', 'New York', 'Claire Lee']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4800413   0.44461706

Then the number gradually fell since Kim's inauguration, largely due to the North's economic recovery and brutal retaliation against the defectors.

According to the report published on Tuesday by monthly news magazine Shindonga, the 85-year-old former Army general said in the interview last month that it was “a ridiculous allegation” that he ordered the shooting against the protesters.“Who could have ordered the shooting against the people ? It is so ridiculous,” Chun was quoted as saying. Chun had been found guilty for staging a coup in 1979 and for the brutal repression of protests in May 1980. He was pardoned and freed in 1997. Former President Chun Doo-hwan He claimed that he was not in a position to order his soldiers to fire shooting during the uprising. “Back then, I was the commander of Security Command who cannot defy the president,” he said. Chun became president in 1980 through an indirect election controlled by the government. Former first lady Lee Soon-ja supported his claim. “Not over my dead body,” she was quoted as saying when asked whether she would acknowledge Chun’s responsibility. She added that Chun’s accountability for the May 18 uprising does not include involvement with shooting against the civilians. His aides played down the significance of the controversial interview. Min Jung-ki, the presidential adviser during Chun’s presidency, said in a statement that Chun’s answer was “unarranged” and that he would reveal his official position through his memoir scheduled to be published next month. His remark is likely to put a damper on the former president’s attempt to make peace with the victims of the May 18 massacre and liberal activists’ in Gwangju. Last week, Chun’s aides said the former president was seeking to visit the memorial of the May 18 uprising and pay respect to the victims. But the proposal was dismissed as a “dubious’ maneuver by the victims’ families and ceremony officials. They said that they would not allow the former president to visit the city unless he made an official apology to the People.

The EPI evaluates countries’ performance on high-priority environmental issues based on 20 indicators such as air quality, health impact, climate and energy. The results are announced at the World Economic Forum biannually.National air quality performance is rated based on household air quality, average exposure to fine particulate matter and exposure to nitrogen dioxide. Members of civic groups stage a rally calling for measures to curb fine dust in Seoul on Monday. YonhapIn terms of average exposure to fine particulate matter such as ultrafine dust, South Korea scored 33.5 out of 100, while China scored 2.26, taking the lowest slot.A report said that 1.3 billion people exposed to poor air quality lived in East Asian countries, with more than 50 percent of the populations in South Korea and China exposed to dangerous levels of fine dust. In India and Nepal, the percentage was around 75 percent.South Korea tumbled to 80th place for its overall EPI, with a score of 70.6, falling from 43th place in 2014.European nations dominated the top slots. Finland was the most environmentally sustainable country in the world, followed by Iceland, Sweden, Denmark and Slovenia. Spain, Portugal, Estonia, Malta and France were among the top 10 countries.

A total of 814 cars sold since November have been ordered to be recalled. The company should submit its recall plan within 45 days. According to the ministry, Nissan faked its emissions test results by using a defeat device that allows the vehicles’ emissions to be controlled by a company-manufactured emission reduction device. The ministry’s own experiment showed that Qashqai in fact discharged nearly 20 times more nitrogenous compound  than the ministry standard of 0.08 g/km.An Environment Ministry official demonstrates the exhaust gas recirculation system of Nissan’s Qashqai model during a press conference Monday. But the company denied the claim, saying “it had never used any device to manipulate the emissions results,” in an official statement released Monday. It also added that it would “fully cooperate with the ministry to resolve the issue.”The ministry is set to file a suit against Takehiko Kikuchi, head of Nissan Korea, and cancel the certification of Qashqai’s emissions results approved last year. The ministry’s action came after the government conducted a probe into 20 models of diesel cars here over the past five months, following German automaker Volkswagen’s emissions scandal last October. According to the ministry, BMW’s 520d was the only model that followed the ministry’s standard, with emissions of 0.07 g/km of nitrogen dioxide.Some other 17 makes of diesel cars, including Land Rover’s Range Rover Evoque, Volkwagen’s Golf, Ssangyong’s Tivoli, KIA’s Sportage and Audi’s A3 discharged from 1.6 to 10.8 times more nitrogen dioxide than the standard. Renault Samsung’s QM3 emitted about 17 times more nitrogenous compound than the standard, the highest level followed by Nissan’s Qashqai. An official from the company told The Korea Herald that it will voluntarily put effort to minimize the amount as low as five times of the ministry standard by the end of this year.According to the revised Clean Air Act, the amount of exhaust fumes discharged from a new vehicle model launched from September 2017 onward must be within 2.1 times the ministry standard. Related emissions laws will be strengthened by 2020, with an upper ceiling of 1.5 times the standard. Vehicles that do not meet the standard will be banned from sales, regardless of whether the carmaker rigged the emissions result or not. The ministry vowed to conduct probes on at least 100 diesel-engine vehicles annually through frequent inspections on emissions test results. Last year, Volkswagen was found to have faked the emission results of its diesel models, which led to an unprecedented recall in the country of at least 120,000 vehicles.

""But it is not moving yet to put them there again.""Last May through June, the North put the buoys around the NLL, a flashpoint where three bloody naval skirmishes took place in 1999, 2002 and 2009. The exact reason why the North deployed the buoys remains unknown. But military authorities believe the North that did not have a high-tech naval monitoring system might have used them to identify the NLL.But late last year, the North built a 20-meter-high steel tower on Ari Island, an uninhabited island adjacent to Yeonpyeong Island and put a high-performance monitoring device on the tower. It also deployed some 30 personnel in charge of operating a radar system there. The new monitoring equipment might be the reason why the North did not try to reinstall the buoys near the sea border, a military official said.""As the North has installed the new device that can keep close tabs on the movement along the NLL in the West Sea, it might have thought that there is no need to put the buoys again there,"" he said on condition of anonymity.In recent months, South Korean authorities have been reinforcing their monitoring activities near the border due to a spike in the number of North Korean and Chinese fishing boats catching crabs near the NLL. A daily average of around 380 boats including 140 North Korean vessels have been seen operating near the border, officials said.Military tensions have run high along the sea border as Pyongyang has persistently disputed the border on the grounds that it was drawn unilaterally by the then U.N.-led United Nations Command after the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.The North has demanded that the NLL should be redrawn further south.","north korea installed last year ,crabs near the nll daily ,deserted island some 12 kilometers ,north korea installed last ,recent months south korean authorities","['North Korea', 'inter - korean', 'south korean', 'Yeonpyeong', 'the Northern Limit Line', 'NLL', 'Ari Island', 'NLL', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'chinese', 'NLL', 'north korean', 'Pyongyang', 'United Nations Command', 'NLL']",12,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.60457134  0.50377977

Bihon, a neologism that signifies a person’s choice to remain unmarried, is often contrasted with a similar sounding word “mihon,” which merely states that a person is single without indicating his or her intentions.Daumsoft said that Koreans are increasingly viewing marriage as an option and not a requirement in life, amid the economic slump and rising unemployment rate.Along with the rise of “bihon,” words with negative connotations such as “stress” tripled in online conversations in 2015 compared to four years ago. Other such words were “economic burden,” “practicality” and “realistic.”Neologism such as “wedding-poor,” referring to people who feel financially pinched after spending a staggering sum of money on their wedding ceremony also rose in use.

It was also for such reason that the Saenuri Party, when the opposition division was reaching its climax, wishfully targeted sweeping at least 180 seats.But the revision has now become less plausible due to the Saenuri Party’s failure to safeguard its parliamentary lead, giving way to the opposition camp.The advancement bill is currently awaiting the decision of the Constitutional Court, which pledged to judge the issue before the current parliamentary term closes in late May.Regardless of the quorum revision, President Park Geun-hye and the ruling camp are desperate to push ahead with pending economic bills.“The government has propelled the service industry bill and labor reform bills, aiming to create jobs and economic growth, yet such efforts have been blocked by the parliament,” the president said in a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, adding pressure just a day before polling.The tug-of-war on economic bills is expected to increase further in the incoming parliament in light of worsening outlooks.The International Monetary Fund said Tuesday that it downscaled South Korea’s economic forecast by 0.2 percentage points to 2.7 percent, citing the slowdown in neighboring China’s economy. Also, the nation’s overall employment for those aged 25-54 stood at 75.9 percent last year, lower than the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development average, data showed.Another key challenge is the ever-increasing military threats from North Korea and tricky relations with world powers.While the parties are univocal in the need to sanction North Korea and strengthen the alliance with the U.S. following the North’s nuclear test and long-range rocket launch earlier this year, their stances differ on various inter-Korean, foreign affairs and defense issues.The opposition supports rapprochement in dealing with the reclusive regime, while the Saenuri Party underscores seclusion and pressure. Center-leaning People’s Party also supports resuming the suspended inter-Korean industrial park in Gaeseong.Some of the thorny issues are also expected to involve the anticipated deployment by the U.S. of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile system here. The plan is opposed by liberals who question its military efficacy and high cost, as well as the security dilemma it would pose such as in relations with China.

On the other hand, China's imports from North Korea contracted 10.8 percent to 3.83 billion yuan, he said. ""Major Chinese exports to North Korea are machinery, electronic goods, labor-intensive products and agricultural goods, while imports mainly are coal and iron ore,"" Huang said.The spokesman indicated that the trade increase should not be viewed as China circumventing the U.N. Security Council sanctions because the latest figure accounts for bilateral trade volume before the sanctions took effect.China immediately implemented the sanctions after it announced a list of banned trade goods with North Korea on April 5, the spokesman pointed out. ""The China-North Korea trade data for the first quarter has nothing to do with anti-North sanctions,"" the official said, also vowing to ""follow through with the U.N. sanctions resolution thoroughly."" Another official from China's State Council stressed any trade items that concern the public welfare or have no link to North Korea's nuclear weapons development are not subject to the sanctions. But the official refused to release the monthly trade figure for March, only saying that the monthly data is not available.In early March, the U.N. adopted the toughest sanctions it has ever slapped on North Korea as punishment for the communist country's defiant nuclear test in January and a long-range rocket launch in February.","china posted double digit growth ,sharp rise in china exports ,north korea contracted 10 percent ,korea and china posted double ,major chinese exports to north","['North Korea', 'China', ""the United Nations '"", 'Huang Songping', 'China', 'General Administration of Customs', 'China', 'North Korea', 'China', 'North Korea', 'chinese', 'North Korea', 'Huang', 'China', 'U.N.

However, the proportion of newborns who needed critical medical attention, including premature and low birth-weight babies, increased from 3.8 percent to 4.7 percent in the same time period.Low birth-weight babies are defined as infants weighing less than 2.5 kilograms at birth, while premature babies are those who are born 36 weeks or earlier.Some of the biggest causes of the increased preterm births here include more pregnancies after age 35 -- as more women are putting off marriage and childbearing -- depression during pregnancy as well as side effects of infertility treatments.The report pointed out that the medical cost that was spent to treat premature and low birth-weight newborns accounted for 42.9 percent of the total cost spent on all newborns in the country in 2014, which was 121.4 billion won . According to the World Health Organization, common causes of preterm births worldwide include multiple pregnancies, infections and chronic conditions such as diabetes. Meanwhile, a number of overseas researchers have found a relationship between depression and preterm births. In 2008, overseas research published in Human Reproduction, a European peer-reviewed scientific journal, showed depressed mothers-to-be are more likely than non-depressed women to have a preterm birth. Another overseas study, published in 2012 in the Iranian Journal of Nursing and Midwifery Research, also found that depressed pregnant women are more vulnerable to preterm labor. “Mental health counselors and programmers are suggested to have some educational programs about psychiatric health for midwives and the personnel who provide health care services for pregnant women,” Iranian researchers wrote in the paper. In order to prevent preterm births, South Korean health authorities recommend all pregnant women receive mental health checkups as well as see their obstetrician at least once a week from week 36 until the delivery. Preterm birth is among the top causes of death in infants worldwide. According to WHO, over 1 million infants die annually from premature birth complications. The agency has developed new guidelines with recommendations for improving outcomes of preterm births. “The guidelines include interventions provided to the mother -- for example, steroid injections before birth, antibiotics when her water breaks before the onset of labor and magnesium sulfate to prevent future neurological impairment of the child,” the agency said in a statement currently available on its website. By Claire Lee","million infants die annually from ,infants die annually from premature ,over million infants die annually ,million infants die annually ,preterm births south korean health","['South Korea', 'the Health Insurance Policy Research Institute', 'the National Health Insurance Corporation', 'Korea', 'the World Health Organization', 'european', 'the iranian Journal of Nursing and Midwifery Research', 'iranian', 'south korean', 'WHO', 'Claire Lee']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48649833  0.18956976

He declined to name the exact time of their arrival or which country they came from, citing possible diplomatic faux pas, protection of those related and possible further defections.“The employees said they learned about the reality of South Korea and the false nature of North Korean regime and its promotion via South Korean TV, drama, movies and the Internet, and recently decided to defect,” Jeong said in a media briefing at the Seoul government complex. Unification Ministry spokesman Jeong Joon-hee Related government bodies will question them after they have rest.Observers said the North is likely to respond to news of the latest defection -- the largest in size since nine defected together in March 2011 -- with more threats and provocation.According to Jeong, the defectors decided to escape after the U.N. imposed the sanctions as punitive action against its recent nuclear testing and long-range rocket launch. He added that this marks the first time workers at a foreign-based North Korean restaurant escaped the repressive Kim Jong-un regime. The government presumed that the defectors were middle class, based on the fact that there is heavy competition among North Koreans to be sent to work at oversees restaurants.“I understand that since the sanctions, other North Korean restaurants overseas are also experiencing difficulties. It was mentioned that these restaurants are under immense pressure from the North Korean government about their due payments in foreign currency,” he said. North Korea operates restaurants oversees for the purpose of acquiring foreign currency, but the number of customers -- majority of whom are South Koreans -- has dwindled considerably since the sanctions. Local media reported Thursday that three North Korean restaurants in Cambodia have shut down recently. Majority of the North Korean restaurants are based in Asia, namely China, Vietnam and Cambodia, The only North Korean restaurant in the Western Europe -- which was based in Amsterdam -- shut down last year. Jeong said the mass defection implies that the U.N.-led sanctions have significant impact on the North Korean economy. “Although we do not have official statistics, we believe that we can already see the effects of sanctions. Roodong Sinmun  has also mentioned ‘Arduous March’ of economic hardship, and this recent case makes me think that the sanctions are ‘hurting’ North Korea,” he said. The ministry urged North Korea not to harm the families of the 13 defectors, and vowed to work with the international society to ensure that this does not happen.By Yoon Min-sik","sanctions other north korean restaurants ,arrived in seoul on thursday ,thirteen north koreans working at ,korean restaurant escaped the repressive ,other north korean restaurants overseas","['North Koreans', 'South Korea', 'the Unification Ministry', 'the United Nations', 'Jeong Joon - hee', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'north korean', 'south korean tv', 'Jeong', 'Seoul', 'Unification Ministry', 'Jeong Joon - hee', 'Jeong', 'U.N.', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'North Koreans', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'North Korea', 'South Koreans', 'north korean', 'Cambodia', 'north korean', 'China', 'Vietnam', 'Cambodia', 'north korean', 'Amsterdam', 'Jeong', 'north korean', 'Roodong Sinmun', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'Yoon Min - sik']",18,"[ 4.          0.          0.         ... -0.32317817  0.47670946

On Monday, a team of 12 SNU researchers headed by professor Ye Sung-joon of the Graduate School of Convergence Science and Technology, submitted a project report that analyzed the number of joint international research initiatives conducted by SNU and its implications in global university rankings.The front gate of Seoul National University The SNU research team blamed the institute‘s comparatively low level of global cooperation as the main issue behind the low citation rate of theses written by SNU scholars. “In the top 10 percent of globally cited theses, SNU’s remained among the lowest ranks,” the team said, pointing out that universities with more joint international collaborations generally received more citations.It stressed SNU’s need to improve on certain markers of internationalization, “The university needs to take measures to proactively respond to global issues by expanding the number of foreign faculty members and students with growth potential.” The team’s research was done by compiling and studying dissertations published between 2010 and 2014 on “Scopus,” a global database for reference articles.According to the researchers, articles published by SNU in collaboration with overseas universities showed a consistent climb, from 1,848 in the year 2010 to 2,341 in 2014. In those five years, a total of 10,899 articles were published under joint efforts with foreign universities.Albeit laudable, however, SNU came in seventh on the list of eight institutions selected by the team as the world‘s best research-centered schools.University of Toronto took the crown, churning out 32,508 theses, nearly triple that of SNU’s in the same period.

The size of this group was larger than that of the employed in their 20s and 30s combined, which came to 9.37 million, accounting for 36.1 percent. The reversal is the first since the agency began tracking the data in 2000, when twice as many in the younger group  had jobs compared to the elderly  to account for 50.2 percent.The increased number of elderly in the job market has raised the average age of people in the job market from 41.1 in 2004 to 44.4 last year.Social trend watchers say the current situation was led by the baby boom generation, a segment of the population defined as people born between 1955 and 1963. This particular generation is larger than other age groups and is staying in the job market even after retirement to support themselves, while new corporate hires of the young have slowed from a protracted economic downturn, they say.The agency's tally showed that of 337,000 people hired last year, 172,000 were those aged 60 or over, the largest age bracket.The figure for those in their 20s stopped at 68,000 while that of those in their 30s fell by 38,000.The younger working group still dominated the job market in 2011 when it outnumbered the over-50 group by 1 million people.

Notably, the number of male sex abuse victims aged 19 or above, who visited the centers for support, increased significantly in the last two years, from 72 in 2014 to 120 last year.Also, a total of 464 men also sought help for domestic abuse at the centers. The proportion of male domestic abuse survivors who visited the centers also increased by 1.4 percent points from the year before, from 6.9 percent to 8.3 percent. “We don’t think of this as more men are being abused nowadays than in the past,” said Hong Mi-ga from the Gender Ministry. “We think male survivors have always existed. We think more survivors are realizing there is help available and that it’s okay to seek support.”Meanwhile, the number of male children sex abuse victims – those aged 13 or under – dropped last year from the year before, from 545 to 433.In total, 1,019 male survivors were treated at the centers nationwide in 2015. Still, they only accounted for 5 percent of all 20,218 sex abuse survivors who sought help at the centers. The Gender Ministry last year released a report on sex abuses cases against men for the first time. The report contained research by the National Human Rights Commission of Korea, which surveyed South Korean men who were sexually abused while serving their military duty, their perpetrators, as well as their witnesses. Majority or 74.7 percent of the surveyed survivors said they were abused for no apparent reason. Meanwhile, 72.9 percent of the perpetrators, as well as 76.8 percent of the witnesses, claimed the victims became subject to violence because they “looked or behaved in a feminine manner.”In 2014, a male army conscript surnamed Yoon died after six male colleagues allegedly hit him in the chest while he was eating which led him to choke on his food. According to the Military Human Rights center, Yoon had been constantly sexually assaulted by the bullies, on top of being physically and verbally abused on a daily basis. Some 470 military same-sex sexual abuse cases were reported in 2013, but only 39.5 percent ended with convictions, according to the organization. While such military same-sex sexual violence prevails, the Gender Ministry currently has no statistics on the gender ratio of Korean perpetrators who have sexually abused men. According to data from the National Police Agency, a total of 25,223 Koreans were arrested for sex abuse charges. Among them, only 1.7 percent were women.South Korean law currently does not acknowledge same-sex rape or any forms of sexual penetration other than vaginal as rape. Accordingly, same-sex rape is defined as “rape-like” by Korean law and carries lighter penalties. According to Gender Ministry’s report last year on male sex abuse victims, 41.6 percent of the survivors said they took no action after being abused. Among them, 42.8 percent said they did not do anything as they did not acknowledge the assault as a form of violence.Among survivors, 60 percent of them experienced sexual harassment, such as being touched inappropriately or being kissed or held in ways that caused discomfort, while 20 percent of them were raped by the abusers. The report also revealed that male survivors who had been abused by same-sex perpetrators often developed self-loathing and anxiety disorders. One of the survivors interviewed by the government researchers said he volunteered to join the Marine Corps after being sexually assaulted, to prove to himself that he is not “weak.” “I heard that the training at the Marine Corps is the toughest in the country,” he told researchers. Another survivor, who identifies himself as gay, developed feelings of guilt after surviving the abuse. “I thought I was punished because I was gay,” he told the researchers.By Claire Lee","in 2014 male army conscript ,sexual violence survivors increased dramatically ,20 218 sex abuse survivors ,six male colleagues allegedly hit ,gender ministry last year released","['south korean', 'Sunflower Centers', 'the Gender Ministry', 'the Gender Ministry', 'Sunflower Centers', 'Hong Mi - ga', 'the Gender Ministry', 'the Gender Ministry', 'the National Human Rights Commission', 'Korea', 'south korean', 'Yoon', 'the Military Human Rights', 'Yoon', 'the Gender Ministry', 'korean', 'the National Police Agency', 'Koreans', 'south korean', 'korean', 'Gender Ministry ’s', 'the Marine Corps', 'the Marine Corps', 'Claire Lee']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24097729  0.57764232

However excluding those not receiving private lessons, the actual amount spent per student rose to 355,000 won.The survey was based on interviews with 43,000 parents of elementary, middle and high school students enrolled across 1,244 schools nationwide. The budget for private education was mostly proportional to the age of the students, the data showed. The average for elementary school students inched up 0.1 percent on-year to 286,000 won, while that for middle and high school students rose 1.6 percent and 1.4 percent, to 397,000 won and 471,000 won respectively.Elementary school students were the most reliant on private education, with nearly 81 percent taking extracurricular lessons, followed by middle school students at 69.4 percent and high school students at 50.2 percent.

The number varied among different types of households, with the average reaching 2.00 for families where three generations lived together.

The remaining 4.4 percent answered they have no idea or did not respond to the question.Pyongyang expelled all 124 South Korean firms from the factory park in the North Korean border city of Gaeseong on Thursday, two days after Seoul announced its own decision to at least temporarily shut down the industrial complex.Opened in 2004 following the first Seoul-Pyongyang summit four years earlier, the Gaeseong factory park is the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation. With some 54,000 North Korean workers on payrolls before the shutdown, it has often been considered a cash cow for the impoverished North.Earlier Sunday, Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo, Seoul's point man on inter-Korean affairs, said in a television interview that North Korea would first have to display ""sincere willingness"" to assuage security concerns among South Koreans before any talk of normalizing Gaeseong's operations.Yonhap, the nation's key wire service, and state broadcaster KBS commissioned pollster Korea Research Center to conduct the survey Thursday and Friday, covering a wide range of current issues. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.Among other issues, 48.9 percent of the polled said they were in favor of hardline policies on North Korea, but nearly as many people -- 47.8 percent -- said they supported a more moderate approach.Of the 48.9 percent who backed tough North Korean policies, nearly 31 percent said more financial sanctions should be imposed, and 18 percent said South Korea should also consider taking military measures to remove North Korea's nuclear facilities.Of those who supported a more moderate approach, 40.1 percent said the two Koreas should resolve the tension through dialogue while 7.7 percent said Seoul should recognize Pyongyang's nuclear weapons possession.South Koreans weren't nearly as divided on the issue of the potential deployment of an advanced U.S. missile defense system, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, in the country.The poll showed that 67.1 percent were in favor of THAAD's presence in South Korea to better counter North Korean threats. On Feb. 7, Seoul and Washington agreed to begin negotiations for the THAAD deployment on South Korean soil, as part of measures to upgrade the two allies' missile defense posture.As for how to respond to the North's nuclear weapons threats, 52.5 percent of those polled said their country should develop its own nuclear weapons or consider redeploying U.S. tactical nuclear weapons to the country.

The suggestion marked a step back from Cho and other superintendent’s initial position of asking for a 5 percent increase. However, it was still met with a resounding “no” from the Education Ministry who reiterated that it was the local offices’ legal responsibility to fund the “Nuri” program.The ongoing tug-of-war over the Nuri program is just one issue in a spate of education-related controversies. Nuri situation at a standstillTwo meetings held last month between new Education Minister Lee Joon-sik and the heads of 17 education offices across the country yielded no meaningful results, as the two sides fervently refused to back down. As of Monday, Seoul, Gwangju, Incheon, Gyeonggi Province, Gangwon Province, South and North Jeolla Provinces, have refused to fully allocate budgets for the Nuri program. Saenuri Party members of the Gyeonggi provincial assembly on Thursday demand the provincial government to allocate budgets for the free childcare “Nuri” program in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province. / YonhapThe contentious point of the Nuri program, which subsidizes kindergarten and day care center fees for children aged 3 to 5, is the ambiguous nature of the related law. Korean law states that education offices are to support “education institutes,” which has generally been interpreted as facilities under supervision of the Education Ministry.The original version of the program launched in 2012 under the Lee Myung-bak administration targeted children aged 5 -- a year before they start school -- and mainly subsidized kindergarten fees. But the Park Geun-hye administration expanded the age group and local education offices began to refuse to pay for day care centers, which are under the purview of the Welfare Ministry. “The government plan to unify child care and child education is an important step, and I believe it is toward an ideal path,” said Cho Hi-yeon. He added, however, that it was impossible for education offices to fully subsidize the program due to financial limitations. The government pointed out that this year’s budget for education offices had increased by 1.8 trillion won to 41.2 trillion, and claimed that this would allow education offices to sufficiently cover the 4 trillion won cost of the program within their budgets. But the education offices said the increase was barely enough to cover the rise in employment costs and inflation.Although the government allocated 300 billion won extra for the Nuri program, education offices say this is not enough.In a 2014 report, the state-run Korea Educational Development Institute said that the central government should provide for the Nuri program as no additional budget has been given specifically by the Education Ministry for it. According to the education offices, their accumulated debt stands at 7.89 trillion won, more than one-third of their total budget. Vice Education Minister Lee Young said that as the number of students are decreasing, authorities need to take a cautious approach toward raising the budget. But the Seoul education office countered by saying that the ideal approach should be to provide higher quality education to fewer students with an increased budget, rather than reducing the funding as student numbers drop. The two sides dug their heels deeper as they engaged in a debate of who gave in first to increasing public demand to get the Nuri program back on its feet. Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn on Thursday visit a kindergarten in Jongno-gu, central Seoul. / YonhapFinance Minister Yoo Il-ho on Monday released a statement saying again that the responsibility of funding Nuri is on the education offices. “We  will provide the supplementary budget for offices which allocate budgets for Nuri ... If they continue to refuse, we will fix the law to ensure that it is done,” he said.The association of education superintendents said Monday that they will hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss countermeasures. College reform off to a shaky startLast month, the Education Ministry unveiled its plans for this year. Headlining the blueprint was its kickoff of the Program for Industry Needs-Matched Education, or PRIME project.The project, which is currently the largest government subsidy program for higher education institutions, will pump 600 billion won overall in financial support over the next three years for 19 universities to conduct reforms to expand the number of students in disciplines that are in high demand based on research.While the project says “industry needs,” in reality the project is moving in the direction of expanding departments related to engineering or medicine while downsizing humanities-related fields. A December report by the Labor Ministry forecast that the job mismatch will worsen over the next 10 years, with majors in social sciences, education and humanities from four-year universities exceeding demand by 438,000. But the report showed the engineering majors and medical students from universities would be in short supply by 255,000.The Education Ministry said that it would increase the number of students studying disciplines in short supply -- including engineering -- by 20,000 before 2020, while reducing the quota of those in excessive supply. Its plan did not include one to expand medical departments as this would require a sign off from the Welfare Ministry.“With the PRIME project, I will reinforce fields of study that are in high demand in the job market, hen solving the problem of job mismatch,” said Minister Lee at the meeting with heads of college presidents on Wednesday.He also emphasized the state-led college reform plans, which mandate colleges and universities to downsize by 160,000 in terms of student numbers by 2022. While the law mandating students to follow government reform is still pending in the National Assembly, the ministry can still cut subsidies for institutes that refuse to comply.Although neither the PRIME reforms nor the college downsizing are mandatory at the moment, universities say that government funding is crucial in their operations, particularly with the ministry restricting schools from raising tuition fees in line with the president’s “half-priced tuition” pledge. Vice Education Minister Lee Young / YonhapThe education minister told local media on Wednesday that he planned continue of keeping college tuition as low as possible.The Government’s emphasis on the PRIME project has had ripple effects. Konkuk University announced last month that it was merging departments to “improve competitiveness and to vitalize industry-linked education opportunities such as the PRIME project.”Dance majors from Busan-based Silla University on Monday denounced the school’s decision to shut down the dance department in order to conduct reforms for the PRIME project.Student bodies of nine universities in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province -- including Seoul National University, Kyung Hee University and Ewha Womans University -- jointly held a protest last month to denounce the project.“The Education Ministry is trying to pin the blame of youth unemployment on colleges and students. But we students are the ones being penalized by their misguided education policies,” they said. “Higher education institutes that have continued for decades face the threat of being restructured in just months for the sake of employment rates.”‘Secrecy’ accusations on history textbookOn Wednesday, Vice Education Minister Lee Young said that the authoring process for new history textbooks has already begun, without its authors or criteria being revealed to the public. These books are slated to be used in secondary education from next year's academic year.“There had been requests to reveal the criteria, but we felt that not disclosing  would be better for maintaining a stable environment for the authors,” he said. Lee said that both would be disclosed eventually, although he refused to specify when. The authorities’ refusal to reveal the authoring criteria to the public has revived the month-long debate about the ministry’s secrecy over the government-issued history textbook.The Park administration, after declaring the current privately-published books biased toward left-wing ideas and North Korea, announced last October it will take over the publishing rights. But there has been a nationwide dispute over whether the conservative president may attempt to whitewash controversial political figures, including her father, former President Park Chung-hee.In an attempt to address the public concern, then-Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea vowed to keep the publication process transparent. Despite Hwang’s pledge, the ministry has only revealed two of its 47 authors. One of them, Professor Emeritus Choi Mong-lyong from Seoul National University, resigned over a sexual harassment scandal.

Suicide has become the fourth most common cause of death here.  According to the report by the Health and Welfare Ministry, almost 90 percent of suicide victims had diagnosable psychiatric illnesses, such as depression, but only 15 percent of them had received medical treatment regularly before taking their own lives.  A sign that says “life line,” a phone counseling service for those who consider committing suicide by jumping into the Hangang River, is installed at Seoul’s Mapo Bridge. YonhapAlso, while only 25.1 percent of them had visited a psychiatrist at least once in the last 30 days of their lives, a higher proportion of them -- 25.6 percent -- visited a general physician or a traditional Korean doctor for symptoms such as indigestion or insomnia in the same period. One of the victims featured in the report, a man in his 40s, visited a general physician after experiencing loss of appetite and weight loss. The physician diagnosed his condition as chronic fatigue and did not advise him to seek help from a mental health professional. According to researchers of the report, it is likely that his condition may have been depression. He took his own life a few months later.Jeon Hong-jin, a psychiatrist at Samsung Medical Center in Seoul, said many studies have indicated that about 70 to 90 percent of all suicide victims worldwide have a psychiatric illness, including depression. What is unique in South Korea, he said, is the collective avoidance of psychiatric treatment which is deeply linked to the social stigma against people with mental illnesses. According to a report released by the National Evidence-based Healthcare Collaborating Agency last year, about 5.6 percent of the entire Korean population – about 2 million people – have suffered depression at least once. However, only 290,000 people sought medical help for the condition, as of last year, and an even smaller number of them, 150,000, chose to receive treatment regularly. “A lot of people are unaware of their mental condition because people avoid visiting psychiatric clinics. But  can be dangerous,” psychiatrist Jeon told The Korea Herald. “When someone with severe depression doesn’t know he is clinically depressed, it’s more likely that he would find his situation hopeless and take his own life. Being diagnosed can give a sense of control, because once you are diagnosed you can learn that there are treatment options available for you to get better.”The report also showed that 40 percent of the 121 victims were drunk when they committed suicide. Also, 25.6 percent had faced legal, professional and personal conflicts resulting from alcohol abuse. At the same time, 54 percent of the victims had family members who had alcohol abuse problems. “It can be concluded that alcohol abuse is very closely associated with suicide cases in South Korea and that drinking control is necessary as an intervention measure for suicide prevention,” the report said.South Korea is known for its culture of binge drinking. According to analysis by the global research firm Euromonitor International, South Koreans were the world’s biggest consumers of hard liquor as of 2014, drinking 11.2 shots per week on average.Many overseas studies have shown that social isolation is one of the most significant factors that contribute to a number of mental health conditions, including depression, addiction, hoarding and social anxiety. According to the OECD data last year, 28 percent of Koreans said they have no meaningful social support at all - not a single person they can rely on - in times of crisis. This rate was the highest among the OECD nations. “Human beings have a natural and innate need to bond, and when we are happy and healthy, we’ll bond and connect with each other,” said British journalist Johann Hari who has researched and written extensively on addiction of all kinds, during TED talk last year. “But if you can’t do that, because you are traumatized or isolated or beaten down by life, you will go with something that will give you some sense of relief .”According to the World Health Organization, alcohol consumption is a causal factor in more than 200 disease and injury conditions worldwide, including cancer, road traffic crashes, violence, and suicides. “Beyond health consequences, the harmful use of alcohol brings significant social and economic losses to individuals and society at large,” the WHO said in its factsheet on the harmful use of alcohol.The government report on suicide also found that 93.4 percent of victims exhibited some suicide warning signs, such as experiencing a change in sleeping and eating habits, but 81 percent of the victims’ family members did not consider these signs as anything to be alarmed about. By Claire Lee","south korea high suicide rate ,korea high suicide rate government ,korea high suicide rate ,121 suicide victims last year ,committed suicide also 25 percent","['South Korea ’s', 'South Korea', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'the Health and Welfare Ministry', 'Seoul', 'Mapo Bridge', 'korean', 'Jeon Hong - jin', 'Samsung Medical Center', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'the National Evidence', 'Healthcare Collaborating Agency', 'korean', 'Jeon', 'the Korea Herald', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'Euromonitor International', 'South Koreans', 'OECD', 'Koreans', 'OECD', 'british', 'Johann Hari', 'TED', 'the World Health Organization', 'who', 'Claire Lee']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4226605   0.60988241

General electric power used by the private sector rose 2.9 percent to 1,037 kWh, with demand from the industrial sector edging up 0.4 percent to 2,736 kWh. Power used by homes rose 1.8 percent, while those consumed by farms jumped 8.3 percent, vis-a-vis the year before.""The generally sluggish pace of economic growth, and overcapacity in the steel industry, which is a big user of electric power affected industrial demand to some extent, although this was offset by gains in chemicals, autos and general machinery,"" the ministry said.Demand for electricity from local steel mills dropped 5.3 percent to 462 kWh, while power used by carmakers and chemical companies rose 1.5 percent and 0.7 percent, each, compared to the previous year. Electricity consumed by the country's general machinery manufacturers shot up 5.3 percent.Besides power consumption, the ministry said sales at local department stores, large retail outlets and big supermarkets all contracted last year, with gains only being reported for convenience stores.Lower sales were due mainly to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome  outbreak that swept across the country from late May to early July, it said. This left 38 people dead and 187 people infected, and scared off people from crowded areas like shopping malls.Sales at the country's department stores were down 1.2 percent on-year, while large discount outlets like E-mart posted sales falling 2.1 percent. Large supermarket chains or super supermarkets also said sales were down 1.3 percent. In contrast, sales at convenience stores surged 26.5 percent, due to a spike in cigarette prices starting in January.The ministry also said that growth of the country's online shopping malls and discount outlets hurt department stores and large discount outlet sales.In the first 11 months of 2015, online shopping malls and discount outlets reported sales gains of 19.5 percent and 10 percent, respectively.For December, the latest data showed sales at large discount stores backtracking 5.1 percent on-year, while the corresponding numbers for department stores and SSMs were each down by 5.7 percent and 5 percent. Sales at convenience stores were up 20.3 percent on-year.The ministry attributed the drop to higher than expected winter temperatures which hurt demand for warm clothing and miscellaneous goods.","economy grew percent in 2015 ,fourth largest economy grew percent ,asia fourth largest economy grew ,stores surged 26 percent due ,kilowatt hour of power last","[""South Korea 's"", 'the Ministry of Trade , Industry and Energy', 'e - mart']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45145115  0.63297385

Many local budget carriers that started off with just a handful of aircraft have expanded their fleet sizes in recent years. Jeju Air, the country's No. 1 LCC, has 22 planes as of Dec. 31, 2015, while Jin Air, owned by Korean Air Lines Co., the country's top flag carrier, has 19 planes.Full-service airlines such as Korean Air and Asiana Airlines also had 159 and 84 planes each at the end of last year.The ministry, meanwhile, said that local operators have been urged to lower the average age of planes in service to enhance flight safety.Korean Air and Asiana have relatively young fleets, with the average age of planes standing at 9.43 years and 10.11 years. On the other hand, numbers for LCCs Air Busan and Eastar Jets stand at 14.49 years and 13.93 years each.Authorities said that with rise in air traffic demand, the total number of civilian planes registered in the country should exceed the 1,000 mark by 2019. It said with a steady increase in numbers, the government will tighten monitoring of safety rules and maintenance checks to prevent accidents from occurring.","south korea soared 10 percent ,korea soared 10 percent on ,asiana airlines also had 159 ,soared 10 percent on year ,korea soared 10 percent","['South Korea', 'the Ministry of Land , Infrastructure and Transport', 'Jeju Air', 'Jin Air', 'Korean Air Lines Co.', 'Korean Air', 'Asiana Airlines', 'Korean Air', 'Asiana', 'Eastar Jets']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38069403  0.94968528

The report, based on a survey of 2,889 people aged 65 and older across the country, measured poverty in seven categories: income, assets, residence, health, labor, social participation and social security net.According to the findings, the rates in all seven categories went down in 2013 from two years ago.The rate of income poverty among seniors was 52.8 percent as of 2013. Income poverty refers to a household whose income is less than 50 percent of the median income of all households.The rate for labor poverty was 27.4 percent while 47.2 percent were in social participation poverty. The social security net poverty rate was 8.2 percent.  Meanwhile, 17.4 percent of the people who suffered from poverty in multiple areas in 2011 were able to move into the non-poverty group in 2013. In other words, 82.6 percent remained in the multi-poverty group. Of the people in the non-poverty group in 2011, 39.1 percent fell into the poverty group for the first time in 2013 while 60.9 percent maintained the status of ""not poor."" The report said the relationship among the seven poverty categories was low except for that between income and residence. It said the impact of one area to other factors is low and that simply offering income support cannot resolve the various types of poverty.","poverty among seniors was 52 ,country measured poverty in seven ,labor poverty was 27 percent ,in 2011 39 percent fell ,67 percent of south koreans","['South Korea', 'the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs', 'South Koreans']",11,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.31951705  0.64401096

According to statistics released by Korea Disabled People’s Development Institute, the poverty rate, earning less than 50 percent of the nation’s median income, for the disabled’ families stands at 34.5 percent. The poverty rate for the total population is 16.3 percent. The figures mean that one out of three households with a disabled member are so poor that they cannot earn even half the median income in Korea. As of June 2014, the average income of disabled families was 2.23 million won, only 53.8 percent of that of the nation’s total households. The household income for the disabled has gradually risen since 2000, but the disabled households still felt more concerned about their finances than the rest of the population, according to the latest report. The disabled households additionally spent an average of 164,200 won to cover medical costs and pay their caregivers. They spent 40.2 percent of the money on medical fees, 15.6 percent on transport and the rest on purchasing assistance devices and so on. The households with a disabled member felt greater financial problems mainly because the disabled are not able to contribute to family income as they are mostly unemplyed. Only 39.6 percent of the disabled across the nation participated in economic activities as of 2014, according to the report. Only 37.0 percent of the total disabled population were employed, with 25.7 percent of them working in labor-intensive sector.

The money saved from this arrangement will make it possible to hire more young job seekers. The jobless rate among people between 15 through 29 reached a record high of 9.2 percent in 2015, the highest reading since 1999, and much higher than the 3.6 percent average for the country as a whole.All government-funded companies and agencies have adopted the payment system which gradually decrease the salaries of employees past a certain age. The ministry added it will also run a special program to offer consultation, training and job matching services to young people.It said it will make efforts to convince the parliament to pass a set of highly contested labor reform bills, which have been held off due to heightening political tensions.The government said the bills are designed to make South Korea's labor market more flexible and give more opportunity to young job seekers and revitalize the economy.Critics, on the other hand, argue that the laws will pave the way for companies to formally sack underperforming employees and amend employment rules more easily even without consent from workers.""South Korea is facing a rapid drop in an economically active population, mounting household debt and rigid labor market, which all hurt growth,"" the government warned.It claimed that unless there is an increase in productivity and a new growth engine is found soon, Asia's fourth largest economy may go into the kind of protracted, low growth cycle that is afflicting countries like Japan and Spain.","korea labor market more flexible ,policy plan released last week ,hire more young job seekers ,needed structural reforms this year ,south korea labor market more","['South Korea', ""South Korea 's"", 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Spain']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59317952  0.43031162

Travelers started to come back to Korea in September and their number rose 5 percent on-year in October thanks to shoppers who flocked to massive discount events held by retailers.The viral disease took the heaviest toll on the numbers of Chinese tourists, who canceled their flights and tour packages in the peak summer season. The total number of Chinese travelers to the nation declined 2.3 percent to 5.98 million last year, it said. Japanese travelers also decreased as the falling yen further dampened their travel sentiments, marking a 19.4 percent drop to 1.83 million. In contrast, more Koreans traveled abroad to take advantage of the cheaper airfares offered by low-cost carriers and extended holidays.

The figures were in stark contrast to the U.S. and Japan. In the same year, the elderly in the U.S. spent 81.57 percent and had an income of 71.75 percent of the general population, while the figures for Japanese seniors were 86.89 percent and 75.58 percent, respectively. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s “Pensions at a Glance 2015” showed that 49.5 percent of Korean seniors were below the poverty line -- marked at half the median household income.“There is a notable disparity between the incomes of elderly households and non-elderly households in Korea, which results in senior citizens spending their money mostly on items closely linked to their survival,” said Sung in her paper “Comparing Income and Expenditure of Seniors in Korea, the U.S. and Japan” published in the journal “Pension Forum” by the NPRI.According to Sung, Korean seniors spent only 5.2 percent of their income on leisure, compared to the 5.8 percent overall average. But American and Japanese seniors’ spending on leisure activities -- in proportion to their income -- increased from 5.9 percent to 6.2 percent and 9.9 percent to 10.1 percent, respectively, flashing warning signs for Korean seniors’ quality of life.Sung pointed out that the discrepancy derives from the country’s pension system. As of 2013, an average pensioner received about 16.31 percent of the average household income in Korea. But the Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance federal program in the U.S. offered 34.59 percent of the country’s average income, while Japan’s pensioners got 64.77 percent of the average income.The Police Science Institute recently predicted that the crime rate of the elderly is likely to surge this year, due to their high poverty rate.By Yoon Min-sik","korean seniors spent only percent ,49 percent of korean seniors ,high poverty rate of senior ,average korean income in 2014 ,warning signs for korean seniors","['korean', 'korean', 'Korean', 'Sung Hye - yeong', 'the National Pension Research Institute', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'japanese', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ’s', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Sung', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'korean', 'american', 'japanese', 'korean', 'Sung', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'the Police Science Institute', 'Yoon Min - sik']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67593139  0.24374059

According to “Pensions at a Glance 2015” by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, 49.5 percent of Koreans aged 65 or more are below the poverty line, by far the highest rate among OECD member states at more than quadruple the OECD average. The OECD defines the poverty line as half the median household income of the total population.“As poverty of the senior citizens persists, the ‘subsistence crime’ ― committed by the underprivileged for the sheer purpose of survival ― will continue to grow. There is also a high possibility that the increase in crimes will lead to more violent cases, such as sex crimes,” the officials said.The report pointed out that the surge in the crime rate was most notable among the age group of 61 or more last year. Criminal cases by the senior citizens accounted for 15.4 percent of the total population in 2014, marking a steep increase from 11.8 percent in 2011. In terms of the number of criminals, 150,902 seniors were convicted of crimes in 2014, according to the National Police Agency. This marked a 35.4 percent jump from 111,453 in 2011. The officials recommended that the elderly people should be given opportunities to participate in various government-funded programs, while the authorities should carry out campaigns to raise the awareness of the senior crimes. But the report forecast the number of crimes in 2016 to be around 1.79 million, down from 1.85 million in the year before.In addition, the PSI also predicted an increase in the number of crimes by foreigners, who account for 3.5 percent of the country’s 51.5 million population. Crimes committed by foreigners went up from 22,543 in 2010 to 30,684 in 2014, and slid to 28,114 as of September 2015. The number of foreigners had also increased by roughly 700,000 since 2009 to mark 1.82 million. The report pointed out that many foreign workers suffer from poor working conditions, being exempt from most welfare measures.It added that while the situation calls for a “custom-fit” policy to counter the increase in crimes by foreigners, a special caution is needed against possible rise of xenophobia and contempt against foreign cultures in general. A report by Kim Jung-hyu, a professor of American Studies at Keimyung University, extrapolated from his study of 800 immigrants in Korea that distortion, discrimination and mistreatment were among the biggest factors that pushed the foreigners to crime.Among other crimes expected to surge this year were cases related to online feuds, as demonstrated by multiple libel cases involving an ultraconservative website “Ilbe” last year, which included an Ilbe member’s defamation of victims from 2014’s fatal sinking of ferry Sewol. The PSI said that North Korea will likely attempt to sway public opinion during the general elections in April of this year, as it claimed that Pyongyang has schemed against certain parties and candidates in all major domestic elections It said Pyongyang’s cyberoperations team would attempt to spread false rumors and propaganda against the major government policies such as labor reform and the government monopolizing publication of history textbooks, which has received heavy criticism from the opposition, labor circles and education circles across the country.By Yoon Min-sik","korea high elderly poverty rate ,more crimes by underprivileged senior ,of criminals 150 902 seniors ,more last year criminal cases ,million population crimes committed","['the Police Science Institute', 'Korean National Police University', 'Korea', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'Koreans', 'OECD', 'OECD', 'OECD', 'the National Police Agency', 'PSI', 'Kim Jung - hyu', 'American Studies', 'Keimyung University', 'Korea', 'Ilbe', 'PSI', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'Yoon Min - sik']",11,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.41745234  0.1889272

This is an increase of about 55 percent on-year, the Seoul Metropolitan Government said. The investments in Seoul also made up 41.6 percent of the total $20 billion FDI in Korea. The previous highest foreign investment amount was $7.2 billion in 2005. The sharp rise in Chinese investments contributed to the record-breaking FDI, the city said. The total investment from China in 2015 was 22 times higher than the previous year. One of the common forms of investment was acquisition of local companies. The increase was mainly seen in the services sector including finance and insurance industries. Investments in the finance and insurance industry rose by 247 percent, and the rest of the services sector by 70 percent. In the meantime, investments in the manufacturing industry dropped by 39 percent, it added. FDI through mergers and acquisitions also skyrocketed by 174 percent, while greenfield investments only rose by 3.7 percent, the authorities said. Seoul City has been aggressively attracting foreign investors with investment briefings and roadshows abroad, including in China, the U.K., the U.S. and Singapore. It has been especially targeting the finance, bio and hospitality industries, they said. It also inked eight memorandums of understanding with organizations related to start-ups, information technology, finance and culture. It will make more efforts to draw FDI this year with a newly launched special task force and more investment briefings, officials said.

The total cost of 23.3 trillion won was equal to 45.8 percent of total medical costs covered by the national health insurance that year.Among the costs, the biggest portion, 39.1 percent, was spent on medical bills, 35.9 percent was lost future income due to early death and 13.9 percent was down to the loss of productivity, such as for lost workdays due to illness. The cost for the problematic lifestyle choices and health conditions has increased significantly in Korea since 2005, according to the report. Health risks cost the nation 13.5 trillion won in 2005, 17.6 trillion won in 2007, 20 trillion won in 2008 and 21.6 trillion won in 2011. Among the three health risks, the cost for obesity increased the most, by 222 percent from 2005 to 2013, while the cost for smoking increased by 162 percent and drinking 156 percent.The report also showed that 71.7 percent of the cost in 2013 was spent on those in their 40s to 60s. Only 3.2 percent of the cost was spent on those aged 20 or under.In terms of gender, a significantly bigger portion of the cost -- 17.2 trillion won -- was for Korean men.Early deaths were the biggest cost for drinking and smoking complications, accounting for 42.3 percent of drinking-related problems and 47.7 percent of smoking-related problems. The costs for medical bills for the two risks accounted for 25 percent for drinking and 34.1 percent for smoking. Yet for obesity, the cost from early deaths accounted for 13.5 percent, but the cost for medical bills accounted for 64.2 percent, which was significantly higher than the proportion for drinking and smoking. The report suggested that the Health Ministry come up with stricter measures to prevent excessive drinking, as the largest sum of money was spent for problems and damage resulting from alcohol consumption in 2013. Researchers also stressed the importance of preventing obesity to maintain the stability of the nation’s national health insurance system. Obesity has emerged as a major health threat in South Korea in recent years. According to a study released by NHIS last year, the number of obese Koreans -- those with a body mass index of 30 or above -- accounted for 4.2 percent of the population in 2012, up from 2.5 percent in 2002.One in 17 South Koreans will be obese in 2025, and some 7 trillion won would be needed to treat them medically if the current trend continues, the report said.Excessive alcohol intake is in fact considered as one of the key contributing factors for obesity, along with job-related stress and physical inactivity. In a 2014 report released by Euromonitor, a London-based market intelligence firm, Koreans were said to drink 13.7 shots of liquor per week on average. This makes them the heaviest drinkers in the world, beating Russians and Thais, according to the study. Among the three risks, South Korea has been making conscious and consistent efforts to curb smoking since 2014, including an 80 percent increase in cigarette prices that went into effect last year. By Claire Lee","obesity cost south korea 23 ,drinking cost korea trillion ,20 trillion won in 2008 ,obesity trillion won the total ,korea trillion won smoking trillion","['South Korea', 'the Health Insurance Policy Research Institute', 'Korea ’s National Health Insurance Service', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'korean', 'the Health Ministry', 'South Korea', 'NHIS', 'Koreans', 'South Koreans', 'Euromonitor', 'London', 'Koreans', 'Russians', 'Thais', 'South Korea', 'Claire Lee']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.445613    0.34093502
