Seongnam mayor Lee Jae-myung holds an interview with Yonhap News Agency in Seoul on Dec. 28.Ban and Moon currently leads opinion polls on next year's election, with Lee taking up the third spot.""One of the key criteria  is their achievement from previous public posts, and whether they abused the posts for personal interests. In that sense, Ban is different from me,"" Lee said during an interview with Yonhap News Agency.Lee said Ban took advantage of his post by sending a letter to Kim Jong-pil, a former prime minister and an iconic conservative figure, through a diplomatic bag.""We need someone who holds the willingness and courage to fiercely fight with the privileged class with corruption, and in that sense I am better ,"" Lee also said.Lee, however, said Moon, along with Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon, will join forces regardless of who wins.The mayor said it is ""unimaginable"" to cooperate with the planned New Conservative Party for Reform, which departed from the ruling Saenuri Party, adding it is also responsible for the influence-peddling scandal of President Park Geun-hye which rocked the country for past months.Lee also vowed to bring major changes to the policies implemented by Park.Concerning the Seoul-Tokyo deal reached last year on the sexual enslavement of Korean women during Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule, Lee said the agreement should be reviewed from the scratch, adding it holds no legal significance.South Korean and Japan reached a deal in December 2015, where Tokyo agreed to provide 1 billion yen  for the creation of a foundation aimed at supporting the victims, euphemistically called comfort women.Lee said South Korea should also withdraw the decision to deploy an advanced US missile defense system in the country, adding Seoul could become a victim of military conflict with Washington and Beijing.","presidential race on thursday ,next year presidential race ,for presidency seongnam mayor ,to run for presidency ,year presidential race on","['Seongnam', 'Lee Jae - myung', 'U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Lee', 'Democratic Party', 'Moon Jae - in']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.388138    0.43160716

Some 23.28 percent of respondents identified their political inclination as liberal, compared to 21.84 percent who called themselves conservative. The liberal lead had widened to 24.60 versus 19.96 by the second week of this month, the data showed. As of the third week of this month, the figure is back up for the conservative respondents, who were slightly ahead of the liberal respondents by 0.96 percentage point. “It is the first time that progressive voters have surpassed conservative minds,” said Kwon Soon-jeong, head of the survey analysis department at Realmeter. “After nine years of a conservative administration, a sense of fatigue seems to be widespread in the public, leading to a change in their ideological dispositions.” Choi Soon-sil The analysis looked into poll findings over 20 weeks starting from the second week of August. Before the turning point in November, more people identified themselves as conservative voters, at one point, the conservatives held a 6.6 percentage point lead over liberal voters. The difference slowly declined in September when suspicions started to arise over the president and her confidante Choi Soon-sil. Park is suspected of allowing her close friend Choi to meddle in state affairs and colluding with her to extort funds from conglomerates. Park was impeached by the National Assembly on Dec. 9, and her fate awaits a final decision by the Constitutional Court. The approval rating of political parties have also witnessed a shakeup. The ruling conservative Saenuri Party, which was once on top of the polls, has ceded its spot to the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea. As of Monday, the Democratic Party’s approval rating stands at 36.1 percent, as compared to the 19.2 percent of respondents who support Saenuri.Among them are voters who decided not to support any parties. Fifteen to 19 percent of voters said they did not lean toward a particular political party in the third week of October, but the number hit a record high of 24.1 percent in the first week of December. The shifting public sentiment is changing the nation’s political landscape. Parties are busy trying to win over wavering voters. Some 30 members of the ruling Saenuri Party left the party Tuesday, vowing to create a new conservative party that will seek for more liberal economic policies.

The Defense Ministry refuted the notion as a groundless suspicion. This newly raised allegation further kindled widespread speculation that President Park Geun-hye neglected her duty as state supervisor and was receiving cosmetic procedures on the day of the tragedy -- allegations the ongoing parliamentary probe committee and special investigators are still seeking to prove.A Facebook account named “Zaro -- Netizens’ investigation team” stirred the interest of the public and media as it released via YouTube a documentary eight hours and 49 minutes long, which it claimed to “contain the hidden, unbiased truth” behind the April 16, 2014 tragedy. A teaser image of ""Sewol X,"" a documentary film produced by a South Korean netizen and uploaded to YouTube. The anonymous online operator, said to be a man in his 40s, has been known for in-depth investigations into high-profile irregularity cases. The name “Zaro” came into the spotlight when the user came up with tangible evidence in 2013 that the nation’s spy agency had rigged online comments prior to the 2012 presidential election.“I refuted all four reasons the prosecution suggested as causing the Sewol ferry,” said the user Monday in a radio interview with CBS.“My only intention is to seek the truth, without taking sides with anybody or being swayed by any prejudice.”Prosecutors earlier announced the causes of the accident were overloaded freight, displacement of cargo, the staff’s lack of experience and the outdated facilities of the ship -- thus eschewing outside factors.The private investigator, however, claimed a misdirected submarine collided with the unfortunate ferry that day and the Navy attempted to conceal the truth for the sake of reputation.“The radar scope at Jindo’s vessel traffic service center caught sight of an orange object, which experts saw as a freight container ,” he said.But at the time, the ship was not tilted enough, so the unidentified object may have been neither a container nor any other structures on the scene, according to Zaro.He also pointed out that the sailing track of the sunken ferry did not match conventional tracks, pointing to an outside factor such as a submarine collision.“Several of the survivors testified to a crashing sound hitting on the vessel before it started tilting, and two of them were at the time located near the port, suggesting a physical shock on the outside of the underwater port,” Zaro said through his documentary clip.To back his submarine collision theory, the investigator quoted Kim Kwan-mook, a nanoscience professor at Ewha Womans University.The operator then added a hypothesis: the Navy may have concealed the submarine crash, so as to keep its safety record intact.The South Korean Navy, in the year following the ferry accident, established a new record of sailing 23 years without accident.“This unprecedented record and reputation leads to an economic effect of at least several trillions of won, and I couldn’t help but wonder if this was what delayed the rescue actions or what deterred the president from revealing further details of that day,” he said.Officials immediately denied the allegations, claiming there were no military operations or drills in the nearby waters on the day of the accident.“The waters were 37 meters deep on average and not suitable for submarine action,” said Defense Ministry spokesperson Moon Sang-gyun on Monday.But when requested to reveal the corresponding radar recordings, the official merely reserved his stance, saying he would “check whether the given records still exist.”Meanwhile, President Park Geun-hye and investigators remain gridlocked over Park’s actions during the seven hours during which she remained out of public sight on the day of the ferry’s sinking.The Constitutional Court, which is deliberating on Park‘s impeachment resolution, had demanded last week that the president submit a detailed timeline by Tuesday to answer the doubts.By Bae Hyun-jung","sinking the deadly sinking ,result of submarine crash ,sewol sinking the deadly ,submarine crash may ,submarine crash may have","['the Defense Ministry', 'Presid']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.25218606 -0.0081046

About 30 Saenuri members, including former Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon and Jeju Province Gov. Won Hee-ryong, neither of whom hold parliamentary seats, will join them in defecting from the Saenuri Party and launching the new conservative party, they said. Former Seoul Mayor Oh-Se-hoon  joins a meeting of the preparatory committee for a new conservative political party, which is being pushed by a separatist group of the governing Saenuri Party, at the National Assembly in Seoul on Monday. “We will officially leave the party at 10 a.m.  and will thoroughly discuss the new party’s policies and appoint the new chief,” Rep. Oh Shin-hwan, the spokesperson for the would-be defectors told reporters after the group’s meeting Monday morning. While the exact number has yet to be confirmed, some 30 members are expected to quit and register with the National Assembly as a new negotiating bloc on the same day. The group aims to launch a new party, tentatively called “New Conservative Party for Reform,” on Jan. 24.  The separatists are seeking to recruit UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who topped the latest poll of potential presidential candidates and whose term at the UN ends later this week. Ban is to return to Korea on Jan. 15, a person close to him said Monday. The division of the country’s ruling party came as the internal feud deepened between its two factions after the Dec. 9 impeachment of President Park Geun-hye.  The group of dissenters, united over their criticism of the president, faces a key challenge ahead, as member lawmakers carry differing views on the new party’s principal policies.Rep. Yoo Seong-min, a bigwig Saenuri rebel, has revealed several times via media outlets that he will pursue a “warm and righteous” conservative party, hinting at a possible shift in conservative policies. While he basically agrees with the Saenuri Party’s stance on national defense and the recent diplomatic deals made with the US and Japan, economy and welfare policies need some “bold reforms.”“I believe conservative parties should also care for the society’s bipolarization and inequality problems and need to come up with some bold policies for social change,” Rep. Yoo said during a radio interview Monday. “Reforms in taxation and the labor industry are crucial.”The Park administration agreed with the US over deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system and signed a military intelligence-sharing pact last month with Japan. The two controversial moves have been criticized by the liberal parties on their legitimacy, citing the “hasty” decision-making process. As some lawmakers are reportedly hesitating on whether to join the new party, Rep. Kim Moo-sung, formerly a chief of Saenuri Party, said nothing has been decided about the new party platform and that the new party is open to diversity in opinions. For the party’s interim chief position, Rep. Na Kyong-won and Rep. Joo Ho-young are viewed as strong candidates. Rep. Na, a fourth-term lawmaker had previously been recommended for the floor leader position of the Saenuri ruling party, but lost to Park loyalist Rep. Chung Woo-taik. The remaining Park loyalists in the ruling party vowed to restructure the Saenuri Party.“A shake-up in personnel and the party’s platform policies is urgent. I will make sure citizens’ opinions are reflected in our party reforms,” said In Myung-jin, who was recently designated the chief of the Saenuri Party’s emergency committee. Regarding the defections, he expressed disappointment, but said they should reunite one day, as they have spent years together sharing the same conservative values.

Ban, the frontrunner among presidential hopefuls, will reach out to a wide range of political forces rather than enter an existing party, namely the ruling Saenuri Party, he told reporters, asking not to be named. ""Rather than joining an existing party, he will engage in activities for another leap of the Republic of Korea based on his accumulated experiences,"" he said.He indicated Ban, whose term at the world body ends at the end of this month, may create his own political party. ""I believe the chance for him to join the Saenuri Party is very slim. Just as he stressed inclusive leadership, he will try to realize new politics with various political forces as the pillars of his project,"" he added. Ban overtook former opposition leader Moon to top presidential polls last week after hinting he would run in next year's presidential election. The associate also said Ban will aggressively deal with ground allegations against him from his rivals and media, referring to a news report that Ban received a total of US$230,000 in cash in 2005 and 2007 from a Korean businessmen convicted of bribery. He was serving as South Korea's foreign minister in 2005 and UN chief in 2007. The aide said the report by The Sisa Journal, a weekly magazine published in Seoul, is groundless and that Ban could take legal action against any false accusations. He dismissed some criticism that Ban lacks knowledge of domestic politics due to his nearly 10 years of living abroad. That will prove if he holds a debate with Moon, former head and potential flag-bearer of the main opposition Democratic Party, he said. He emphasized Ban's on-the-spot experience in various places across the world plagued by war and famine, which he said will help him exert leadership at the time of national crisis. Ban was slightly ahead of Moon in opinion polls last week after hinting at his candidacy. In a survey by Real Meter released Monday, Ban garnered an approval rating of 23.3 percent, up 2.8 percentage points on week.He was virtually neck-and-neck with Moon who earned 23.1 percent, down 0.6 percentage point.","next year presidential election ,frontrunner among presidential hopefuls ,year presidential election close ,presidential hopefuls will ,monday ban the frontrunner","['UN', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'South Korea', 'Ban', 'Saenuri Party']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.94027603  0.37385979

The main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, on the other hand, has stepped up its attacks against Ban’s presidential bid, casting the UN chief as an establishment politician without a blueprint for overhauling dysfunctional politics.“I think that Ban’s success was largely under the old-fashioned, established order. I doubt he would take the call for change seriously,” said Democratic Party’s former leader Rep. Moon Jae-in. A survey conducted by local pollster Realmeter showed Moon to be outrun by Ban in terms of approval rating for the 2017 race.The main opposition party’s criticism reflected the growing level of scrutiny faced by the 72-year-old career diplomat, who has recently become more vocal about his post-UN plans, but still remains ambiguous on his presidential bid.Supporters for UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon convene last Thursday at Sejong Center for the Performing Arts in Seoul. YonhapOn Friday, weekly magazine Sisa Journal reported that when Ban served as foreign minister in 2005 and UN chief in 2007, he received a kickback worth more than $230,000 from Park Yeon-cha, a businessman who had been arrested for giving illicit money to the late President Roh Moo-hyun. The Democratic Party urged prosecutors to investigate Ban, but the businessman Park and Ban’s aides denied the accusation, saying the report was an attempt to slander them. They also vowed to take legal action against the magazine. A day earlier, Stephane Dujarric, a spokesperson for the UN chief, said in a statement the report against Ban was “completely false and groundless” and that Ban will demand the media outlet issue an apology and drop the story. “Ban never met Park at that time and has never seen him since. During his tenure as a public official, Ban has never taken any bribes. It’s regrettable to see such a malignant report,” said officials working for Ban in a statement distributed to reporters Saturday. With less than a week left before Ban finishes his term at the UN, speculation has been rife about which political parties he would represent if he confirms his bid for the presidential election after his term ends Saturday.  Long considered a favorite for Park and her loyalists for the 2017 race, Ban has set himself apart from the pro-Park group since public outrage erupted over the corruption scandal tied to Park’s confidante Choi Soon-sil.Instead, Ban has drawn support from anti-Park Saenuri bigwigs, who have vowed to leave Saenuri this Tuesday and form a new conservative party in January. They had clashed with the pro-Park faction over control of the party after they joined the opposition parties in impeaching the president earlier this month. “If Ban comes to Korea, we will introduce him to our party and have him compete with other candidates by holding a fair primary,” former Saenuri Floor Leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min, a leading figure among Park’s dissenters, said when asked about whether the new party would work with Ban for the presidential election.

It marked Thae's first public appearance since his defection to South Korea in July.North Korea conducted two nuclear tests this year alone following those in 2006, 2009 and 2013. Seoul's spy agency has said that Pyongyang is ready to carry out a sixth nuclear test at any time.Thae's comments illustrated Pyongyang's commitment to keep advancing its nuclear programs in defiance of growing UN sanctions and pressure.Thae added that the North's leader Kim Jong-un wants his country to be recognized as a nuclear state, such as Pakistan or India, a status rejected by South Korea and the U.S.""After being recognized as a nuclear state, North Korea hopes to resolve pending issues through international dialogue,"" Thae said.The nuclear talks on ending North Korea's nuclear program were last held in 2008. There is no sign yet that the talks -- which involve the host China, South and North Korea, the US, Japan and Russia -- could resume anytime soon.He said that the North sees the prime time for getting the recognition in the early stages of the new US administration which means late 2017 or early 2018.South Korea is likely to hold a presidential election earlier than expected next year as parliament approved a motion on Dec. 9 to impeach Park over a corruption scandal. The Constitutional Court has up to six months to review whether to unseat or reinstate her.Park's single five-year term ends in February 2018 with the next presidential election originally slated for December 2017.Thae also said that North Korea hopes that Seoul may take a fresh approach toward Pyongyang under a new administration.""Pyongyang hopes that doubts about the effectiveness of sanctions against North Korea gain traction in a short period of time. It wants South Korea to seek a new inter-Korean policy,"" he was quoted as saying by a South Korean lawmaker.Thae, a former minister at the North Korean embassy in London, is one of the highest-ranking North Korean officials to come to the South.Thae began his resettlement process in South Korea earlier in the day, after a monthslong investigation by Seoul's spy agency into reasons for his defection was completed.He told lawmakers Monday that he fled to South Korea due to his disillusionment with the regimented regime, under which many are living like slaves.","korea presidential election next ,around korea presidential race ,korea presidential race ex ,south korea presidential election ,korea presidential race","['North Korea', ""South Korea 's"", 'north korean', 'Pyongyang', 'Thae Yong - ho', 'north korean', 'London', ""North Korea 's""]",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.75520623  0.33355948

But I think anyone can help out depending on their financial status,” said Song, who has been making a 5,000 won  monthly donation to children living in makeshift homes since his college days in 2009. Salvation Army volunteers appeal for donations at a kettle installed in Myeong-dong, a shopping and fashion district in Seoul. Once associated mainly with deep-pocketed big names, donating in Korea is evolving into a culture that all citizens can participate in. Some allocate part of their income to a cause via organizations such as UNICEF, Community Chest of Korea or Good Neighbors. “When I first came to Seoul, I saw the village of makeshift homes in Gangnam Province right next to the luxurious apartments. It was such a shock that I was prompted to help out,” said Song, who made his contributions via a volunteer group called Peace Camp. What individual citizens lack in personal wealth, they make up in numbers. As of last week, donations made by individuals to World Vision Korea for this year stood at around 159.2 billion won , while donations made by corporates reached about 16.9 billion won. According to the CCK, about 34.5 percent of the 471.4 billion won donation made last year was by individuals. One of the distinct advantages of small-scale donations by the public is that it is less inclined to be affected by outside factors, such as a recession or a nationwide scandal.A recent survey by the International Council for Nonprofit Managements showed that 70 percent of the respondents thought that the recent corruption scandal surrounding President Park Geun-hye and her confidante Choi Soon-sil had a negative impact on donations.“While we cannot definitively comment on the matter, the ongoing situation --- the economic slump -- is seen to be affecting the amount of overall donations,” said an official from the CCK. But while individuals’ donation to World Vision Korea took a relatively smaller hit -- about 3.6 percent compared to last year -- companies’ donations was logged at about 19.1 percent of last year. Accessibility is another factor that encourages people to participate, which owes its debt to technological advances. Many cases of donating in the digital age occur via smartphone apps, mobile crowdfunding and digital payments. The century-old Red Kettle of Salvation Army is recognized around the world as a symbol of charity, but people can now chip in digitally via a mobile application provided by Salvation Army Korea. Sometimes a financial transaction is not even required, as mobile apps like Big Walk allows users to convert their walks into funding. A 10 meter walk is translated into one Korean won; minuscule in one, massive in many.For those with a particular set of skills, even their talent can be an object of sharing. Around 2010, the word “talent donation” rose to popularity, subsequently growing into a fad adopted now by companies and individual citizens alike. While celebrities with big paychecks often make headlines with sizeable donations, their fan base can sometimes serve as a rallying point for raising funds for a cause.Fans of the actress Moon Geun-young donated 7 million won for the underprivileged in Malawi via Good Neighbors, which they raised after Moon did voluntary work in the African country.In June, the media reported that Lee Min-ho’s fans donated 11.8 million won to Holt Children’s Services to celebrate his birthday. Despite the increasing number of citizens sharing, reports indicate that donation among Koreans is still relatively low. A report released earlier this year by the Hyundai Research Institute shows that only 34.5 percent of Koreans donate, which was 25th among the 35 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.The report, however, did show that the amount of accumulated donation as of 2013 marked a consistent increase from 8.1 trillion won in 2006 to 10.3 trillion won.A study has hinted that in addition to helping others, donating may actually help the benefactor’s well-being, namely via the “warm fuzzy feeling” attested to by people who have pitched in for those less fortunate than themselves.According to a 2014 paper by the US-based National Bureau of Economic Research, emotional benefits of those who donated large sums outweighed the emotional costs, which the researchers said indicated that donation opportunities boost their well-being.

More than 980 expressed their approval or disapproval of state authorship.The opinion gathering will end Friday at midnight. The ministry plans to produce the final version of the textbooks by January.The Park Geun-hye government has pushed for the state-issued textbooks to fix what it called predominantly left-leaning content in existing private publications and to forge a ""common understanding"" of history. Opponents said the government should not dictate the way history is written and taught. Calls for cancellation swelled especially after Park was impeached on Dec. 9 over a massive political scandal.Some observers raise the possibility of delaying their use by one year.

The trial of Choi will kick off this week, with the Seoul Central District Court holding official preparations for her trial on Monday. Legal discussions between the prosecution and Choi’s lawyer -- who claimed that the charges were “not facts, but stories” -- is expected, but it is unclear if the accused will appear at the court.Rep. Kwon Sung-dong , head of a special parliamentary team for President Park Geun-hye's impeachment trial, presides over the first meeting of the team's nine lawmakers and about 20 legal professionals at the National Assembly in Seoul on Sunday. Choi, Park’s long-time friend, is suspected of using her relationship with Park to meddle in state affairs -- including having state projects allocated to people related to her -- and coerce local corporations into making donations to the Mir and K-Sports foundations, which authorities believe were used to channel funds to her.The investigation led by an independent counsel Park Young-soo is also to officially kick off this week. The team’s spokesman Lee Kyu-chul hinted the actual probe can start during the preparation period that ends on Tuesday.When asked if the team may summon its first witness this week, Lee said “there is a possibility.” He added that conglomerate chiefs -- that made donations to causes related to Choi -- can “of course be summoned if necessary.”Suspicions that the donations made by the companies are actually bribes for Park and Choi’s inner circles are considered to be key in the independent counsel’s investigations. President Park was impeached by the parliament on Dec. 9 for the scandal. In her first legal argument made to the Constitutional Court, which was revealed to the public Sunday, she claimed to have done nothing that deserves impeachment. She claimed to have no knowledge of Choi‘s alleged wrongdoings and said she may have consulted with Choi on a personal level, but never undermined the democratic value because it was her who made the final decisions regarding state affairs.Litigation process on Park’s former aide An Chong-bum -- suspected of working with Choi under the president’s orders -- and key figures in favoritism allegations Cha Eun-taek and Song Sung-gak are also to take place Monday.While not yet indicted, Park’s former aides Woo Byung-woo and Kim Ki-choon are suspected of knowingly condoning, or even helping Choi in her wrongdoings. Woo is expected to be the main feature in Thursday’s parliamentary hearing, as he has snubbed the National Assembly’s repeated subpoenas. The past four hearings have been disputed as “pointless,” with key witnesses like Woo, An, Choi, Choi’s family members, including daughter Chung Yoo-ra, all failing to show up.Woo in particular, has gone “missing” after the parliament formally summoned him, which roused suspicion that he is abusing a loop in the law that states a parliamentary summon on a person takes effect only after the cited person has received the documents.Woo last week told the National Assembly that he will appear before the lawmakers. Another person slated to make her first appearance is a medical officer surnamed Cho, currently in a training program in Texas, US. Cho was an officer stationed at Cheong Wa Dae during the 2014 sinking of the Sewol ferry, and her presence was requested by the lawmakers for questioning on what Park had been doing during the worst maritime disaster in Korean history.Park’s mysterious seven-hour absence from public has sparked suspicion that she was partaking in actions not related to the rescue operation. The Constitution states that the president is obliged to protect the lives and safety of the people during a national crisis.Repeat witnesses like Ko Young-tae, considered the closest confidant of Choi Soon-sil, will also be making an appearance. Ko touched off another controversy by telling local media last week that Saenuri lawmaker Lee Man-hee -- a Park loyalist -- had conspired with an official from the K-Sports Foundation to falsify testimonies at the hearing. According to Ko’s interview, which took place on Tuesday but was published Saturday, Rep. Lee told the official that he will ask him about Choi’s tablet PC -- a key piece of evidence in the scandal that held classified presidential and governmental documents. The official reportedly was instructed to say that he had seen Ko carry the tablet PC in question, supposedly to back Choi’s claim that the device is not hers.The actual conversation between the two had occurred as implied in the interview. Rep. Lee has denied the allegations. In a press conference Sunday, Lee claimed not to have personally contacted the official in question or instructed him to state a false testimony.He vowed to take legal actions against Ko and the media outlet that published the interview.

Here's a look at five ways the country that has now been ruled by three generations of Kim -- starting with grandfather Kim Il-sung -- has changed since the ascension of its 30-something ""respected marshal.""    THE MAN HIMSELFKim Jong-un is in some ways a lot more like his charismatic and gregarious, albeit brutal and megalomaniacal, grandfather than Kim Jong Il. He has gone out of his way to milk that resemblance, right down to adopting his trademark haircut from a seemingly bygone era. While his father almost never spoke in public, Kim Jong-un has done so on any number of occasions, including a four-hour address at his ruling party's congress in May. On the flip side, one of his most important moves to consolidate power -- the execution of his powerful uncle and the purges that ensued -- demonstrated both his personal independence and his willingness to employ the same kind of oppressive tools that were the hallmarks of both his father and grandfather. And, despite a short-lived friendship with former NBA bad boy Dennis Rodman, he has yet to travel abroad or meet a foreign head of state.  People bow to portraits of the late leaders, Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, at the Kim Il-sung Square in Pyongyang, North Korea, Saturday, to mark the fifth anniversary of Kim Jong-il's death. NUKES, MISSILES AND ROCKETSTurning North Korea into a nuclear power wasn't Kim Jong-un's idea -- it almost certainly originated with Kim Il-sung himself -- but it's defined his first five years. Of the five nuclear tests North Korea has conducted, three have been under his watch and two, including its most powerful to date and its first of what Pyongyang claims was an H-bomb, were this year. Kim Jong-un's North Korea has been sprinting to the finish line of a viable nuclear arsenal and the advanced missile technology needed to attack South Korea, Japan and the 50,000 US troops it hosts, the key US military outpost of Guam and the US mainland itself. At the same time, and some argue for largely the same reasons, the North under Kim has also joined the space race, putting satellites into orbit and aiming to reach the moon within the next decade.  SHIFTING PRIORITIESNorth Korea's main motto under Kim Jong Il was ""Military First."" Under Kim Jong-un, the focus is now on building more and better nukes and bolstering the national economy, in large part through developing science and technology. To suit his goals, Kim has shifted more power to the ruling party and to his Cabinet and put the nation on collective overtime with repeated ""loyalty campaigns.'' It remains to be seen how sustainable his two-pronged nukes-and-butter policy will be in the face of international sanctions and internal, systemic weaknesses. So far, it has been at least workable. The North is already a de-facto nuclear state and its economy, though fragile and no doubt underperforming, is showing small but persistent growth. FOSTERING MARKETS AND ENTREPRENUREURSProbably more out of pragmatic necessity than anything else, Kim Jong-un has allowed capitalist-style markets and entrepreneurialism to expand, invigorating the domestic economy and creating new revenue streams for the government, which profits by either taking a cut or by directly supporting such enterprises. Changes in farming policy that let individuals personally benefit from bigger harvests have boosted agricultural output. The relatively affluent capital of Pyongyang -- home to the North's most fortunate -- has seen a significant increase in everything from taxis to coffee shops and streets stalls. But the rise of the ""cash masters,'' an empowered middle class more open to capitalist ideals, or just more determined to acquire material wealth, could prove to be a problem for Kim down the road.     KEEPING THE MASSES ENTERTAINEDKim Jong-un has on several occasions vowed to make North Korea a ""more civilized'' nation. His signature development projects include an equestrian center and sprawling water park in Pyongyang and a luxury ski resort near the port city of Wonsan on the east coast. He has tried to give his regime something of a softer face through the all-female Moranbong Band, which sings its odes to him in a decidedly pop, and vaguely titillating, manner. Kim also generated a major national sensation by ordering a Disney-quality update to the ""Boy General'' anime series originally commissioned by his father. On another major front, Kim has made a big shift toward sports -- vowing North Korea will become a major international sports power -- presumably as a means of bolstering health and national pride and providing the masses with a relatively innocuous diversion from their daily lives.","years since north korean ,five years since north ,since north korean leader ,death of his father ,starting with grandfather kim","['AP', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Kim Jong - il', 'Kim', 'Kim Il - sung']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.555628    0.21299002

In particular, it is the third consecutive year for the General Assembly to adopt a resolution calling on the Security Council to refer the North's human rights situation to the ICC. This year's resolution blamed the North's ""leadership"" for human rights abuses, underlining the seriousness with which the international community views the situation.It is the first time a General Assembly resolution has mentioned the North's labor exports, which have become an increasingly important source of hard currency for Pyongyang amid concerns that the funds could be used for its nuclear and missile programs.About 50,000-60,000 North Koreans are believed to be toiling overseas, mainly in the mining, logging, textile and construction industries. The average wage was stated as $120 to $150 per month, but in most cases employing firms paid salaries directly to the North's government.","rights resolution next week ,assembly last month will ,next week the general ,next week that calls ,resolution next week","['the U.N.

Four-term lawmaker Rep. Chung Woo-taik and Rep. Lee Hyun-jae were elected as the floor leader and policy panel chief, respectively, beating their competitors from the anti-Park group, Reps. Na Kyung-won and Kim Se-yeon. Chung grabbed 62 votes against Na's 55.After the election Chung Woo-taik urged the party to end factional fighting and restore unity. ""I am confident we can create another conservative government if we remain united and seek harmony,"" he said.On Monday, Rep. Chung Jin-suk resigned as floor leader taking responsibility for the impeachment of Park last Friday over alleged corruption.Pundits said the victory of Park allies despite the impeachment may prompt their rivals to leave Saenuri in droves and establish their own party.The new floor leader is set to serve as an acting chief if party chairman Lee Jung-hyun and other members of the Supreme Council, mostly pro-Park figures, resign on Friday.Former Saenuri head and anti-Park leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung earlier expressed his willingness to found a new party. Former floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min also said he will ponder his future path, hinting at a possible defection from the party.Some pundits bet they may end up choosing to stay as their division would hurt conservatives' election prospects. The presidential election, originally slated for December, may take place earlier if the Constitutional Court finalizes Park's ouster.One of the challenges looming over the new Saenuri whip is its relationship with opposition parties. The opposition bloc has been delaying talks with Saenuri on normalizing state affairs, dismissing Park loyalists as their counterparts.""We cannot accept them as counterparts for discussion,"" the main opposition Democratic Party said in a statement after the election.""There will be no dialogue and exchanges,"" Rep. Ki Dong-min, the main opposition's spokesman, told Yonhap News Agency. ""It is Saenuri that gave up the chance to sit down for talks.""The splinter People's Party echoed the view, saying Saenuri failed to properly reflect the public's wishes. ""It is regrettable that we cannot congratulate Saenuri's new floor leader,"" said Rep. Lee Yong-ho, the party's spokesman.""Saenuri, which is just as responsible for the scandal as Park, is only clinging to its political survival rather than reaching out to the people.""","new floor leader friday ,floor leader friday result ,leader race south korea ,four term lawmaker rep ,saenuri floor leader race","[""South Korea 's"", 'Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Chung Woo', 'Lee Hyun - jae', 'anti - park', 'Na Kyung - won', 'Kim Se - yeon']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34593824  0.3402102

He downplayed concerns that South Korea backtracking on the plans would cause tension with the United States, which he said was the ""most important country'' for South Korea in face of nuclear-armed, rival North. ""The issue of whether or not to deploy THAAD should be pushed to the next government,'' Moon said in a news conference.""Reconsidering THAAD would have to be preceded with diplomatic efforts, including diplomatic efforts with the United States. I don't think that the reconsidering of THAAD would harm the South Korea-U.S. alliance,'' he said. Recent opinion polls have shown Moon as a presidential favorite amid the popular anger over conservative President Park Geun-hye, whose powers were suspended after lawmakers last week voted to impeach her over an explosive corruption scandal. South Korea's Constitutional Court has up to six months to decide whether Park should permanently step down. If Park is formally removed from office, the country would hold a presidential election within 60 days.Moon, who conceded the 2012 presidential race to Park, said he expected the court to rule on Park's impeachment sometime between late January and early March, setting up a presidential election around April or May. ""It would be a huge honor for me if I can take part in the next presidential election,'' Moon said. South Korean military officials in September picked a private golf course in the country's southeast as the site for THAAD, which was slated to be deployed by the end of next year. They originally chose a nearby artillery base in the rural farming town of Seongju as the site for the system, but changed locations following fierce protests from locals who expressed concern over potential health hazards they believe the system's powerful radar might cause.The plan to deploy THAAD in South Korea has angered not only North Korea but also China, which suspects that the system would allow U.S. radar to better track its missiles. Russia also opposes the deployment.Moon also argued that Seoul should put dialogue over sanctions in persuading Pyongyang to give up its nuclear ambitions. He rated the Park government's hard-line stance against North Korea as a ``complete failure'' because it ``didn't function in any way'' to prevent the North from expanding its nuclear weapons and missile programs. ""It has been confirmed that pressure and sanctions alone would not be enough to influence North Korea to give up on its nuclear weapons,'' said Moon, calling for a ""two-tack approach'' of sanctions and talk. ""We need strong punitive measures against North Korea's nuclear tests and missile launch tests, but the purpose of such strong pressure and sanctions should be bringing North Korea to the negotiation table for denuclearization.'' Moon, a former human rights lawyer and aide to late liberal President Roh Moo-hyun, also pledged to fight income inequality and push business reforms to curb excesses of ``chaebol,'' or family-owned conglomerates that dominate the country's economy, to create a level playing field for smaller companies. The opposition Democratic Party's primaries could shape into a showdown between Moon and Lee Jae-myung, the outspoken mayor of Seongnam city whose popularity rose rapidly in recent months amid rage over the Park scandal. The conservatives appear to be pinning their hopes on outgoing U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon after Park's scandal complicated politics for her Saenuri Party. In a visit to South Korea in May, Ban told reporters that he would ""think hard about what to do as a citizen'' after he returns home on Jan. 1, which was seen by the local media as a clear hint on a presidential bid.","south korean presidential contender ,korean presidential contender ,korean presidential contender said ,korean presidential hopeful casts ,korean presidential hopeful","['SEOUL', 'South Korea', 'AP', 'south korean', 'U.S.', 'north korean', 'Washington', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Terminal high - Altitude Area Defense']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44456971  0.47857791

Nearly 7 million cumulative participants. And President Park Geun-hye is impeached. Yet South Korean protesters say this is not the end of their fight. Braving the sub-zero temperatures, some 800,000 people bundled up in thick jackets and flocked the Gwanghwamun Square in central Seoul in their seventh Saturday rally, this time to celebrate Park’s impeachment.“It is a triumph of the people. We have fought hard to defend our democracy,” Kim Yool-gu, 47, told The Korea Herald. “But we are only halfway through until she steps down. It is only a beginning to root out corrupt political and economic systems.”South Koreans have taken to the streets and lit candles across the nation ever since a scandal broke out late October revealing how President Park’s friend Choi Soon-sil, who has neither an official government post nor policy background, had been meddling in state affairs and used her ties to the leader to extort money from conglomerates. The latest protest was the first since the parliament impeached Park on Friday for the scandal, with the approval of 234 lawmakers from the 300-seat National Assembly.Protesters let off fireworks to celebrate the parliamentary impeachment of President Park Geun-hye during a rally near the presidential palace of Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul on Saturday. Now, the fate of her presidency is left up to the Constitutional Court as it requires final approval from it, which could take up to 180 days.Many of the protesters vowed to hold up candles until Park is gone and those who assisted her in committing wrongdoings are held accountable. “I am happy, but it is not the end to making a society that can be ruled by the people. We need to take this as an opportunity to remove corrupt links between the prosecution, family-owned conglomerates and powerful politicians,” said Cho Jong-joo, who was giving out free coffee and tea at the square.Sixty-two-year-old Cho Min-koo came to the protest with his family. “The Constitutional Court should make a decision as quickly as possible to uphold the public calls,” he said. On Saturday evening, the boulevards surrounding Gwanghwamun Square turned into a festive outdoor concert venue, with citizens taking to the stage to make speeches and local singers performing. At the peak of the event, fireworks let off, participants hugged strangers next to them and waved candles.Many protesters said the outcome taught them the meaning of democracy.“I cannot believe that we made this impeachment happen. I am so touched and excited. I learned that I can change society if I participate,” said 18-year-old student Kwon So-yoon. “I am not even cold, because of the people around me.” Others demanded a thorough probe and stern punishment of Park, her friend Choi Soon-sil and ex-presidential aides such as Woo Byung-woo and Kim Ki-choon, who are also implicated in the scandal.“Park Geun-hye and her friends in the political and economic circles who assisted her to commit crimes should all be arrested and punished so that such corruption can never happen again,” said 21-year-old student Kim Na-jin. Earlier in the day, some 15,000 people, mostly in their 60s or older, from right-wing civic groups and President Park’s fan club staged a rally near the square, calling for the impeachment to be canceled. They carried banners reading, “Don’t cry. Don’t be sad. Be confident,” slamming the parliament for passing the impeachment motion.

Unscathed, Kim repeated he was sorry, could not remember or did not know. A master of ideological tension and media manipulation, the former prosecutor general, justice minister and three-term lawmaker had earned the nickname “the king of secretaries” while serving Park for about one year and a half until February 2015.  Kim Ki-choon, former chief of staff for President Park Geun-hye, arrives at the National Assembly in Seoul on Wednesday, as a witness in a parliamentary investigation. None of his predecessors, successors or any other senior aides at Cheong Wa Dae could beat Kim in reading the secluded president’s thoughts and wishes, sources say. Now critics are suggesting this was thanks to behind-the-scene discussions with Choi, whom Park relied deeply on for various state affairs, though he rejects the claim. Among the 14 witnesses attended, Kim drew most questions from both ruling and opposition lawmakers. But he refuted most of them or said he was not aware, apparently being watchful of an upcoming probe of an independent counsel that would designate him as a suspect. They argued Kim, then the chief of staff, had allowed or assisted Choi to interfere with high-level appointments at the Culture Ministry and the operations of the horseback riding sector in the run-up to the launch of two culture and sports foundations which effectively served as Choi’s slush funds. Kim said he does not know Choi and has no involvement in the issues. He also took flak for failing to grasp Park’s whereabouts for seven hours on the day of the Sewol ferry sinking in April 2014. The Hankyoreh daily reported Tuesday that the president spent 90 minutes doing her hair before visiting the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters, while more than 300 people, most of them high school students, were drowning inside the ship. Cheong Wa Dae on Wednesday acknowledged the visit of stylists that day but argued it took only 20 minutes. “I am extremely ashamed and sorry for letting this disaster happen because I failed to advise the president properly,” Kim said, when given time to comment on the seven missing hours.By Shin Hyon-hee","fends off onslaught president ,second public hearing wednesday ,secretaries fends off onslaught ,of secretaries fends off ,off onslaught president","['Park Geun - hye', 'Kim Ki - choon']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36492091  0.34170282

Park’s approval rating has risen to 10.5 percent, the latest Realmeter survey shows. According to the local pollster, Park’s weekly poll reading marked its first uptick in eight weeks, rising by 0.8 percentage point. Daily figures reveal a clear rebound over two days -- Nov. 29 when Park made her third national address and Dec. 2 when the ruling Saenuri Party’s adopted Park’s early departure in April as its official stance. Support of Park numbered 10.9 percent on the former date and 11.9 percent on the latter. “Park’s address and the Saenuri Party’s official adoption of Park’s early departure schedule seem to have consolidated support for the embattled president,” Realmeter explained. The increase came mainly from conservative regions such as Daegu, Busan and Chungcheong provinces and Park’s core support base of senior voters aged 60 or older.  The Saenuri Party, whose leadership has steadfastly stood behind Park despite the major scandal, also saw public support rebound. Its popularity was 17.8 percent, up 1.6 percent from a week earlier, behind the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea’s 32.5 percent. Among potential candidates for the next presidency, Moon Jae-in, the former Democratic Party leader, was still in the lead with 20.8 percent. The United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was in the second place at 18.9 percent.A firebrand politician and Seongnam Mayor Lee Jae-myung continued his upward streak to 14.7 percent, up 2.8 percent from the previous week. The survey, which was conducted on 2,528 adults between Nov. 28 and Dec. 2, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points with a confidence level of 95 percent.","pollster park weekly poll ,uptick in weeks president ,local pollster park weekly ,uptick in eight weeks ,park weekly poll reading","['Park Geun', 'Park ’s', 'Park ’s']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53985733  0.46352565

The historic vote is to take place Friday.The opposition bloc, which submitted the motion to impeach Park last Friday, on Sunday reassured the public of an all-out effort to secure as many votes from the ruling Saenuri Party as possible. Without at least 28 votes from the Saenuri Party, which President Park founded and represented in the presidential election, the bill won‘t clear the required two-thirds threshold in the 300-member parliament.“The  must now decide whether to be an accomplice to Park or stand on the side of the people. ... If the motion is not passed, the parliament will be the ones impeached by the people,” said Rep. Ki Dong-min, floor spokesman of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea.Minor opposition parties -- the People’s Party and Justice Party -- echoed the Democratic Party. Protesters hold torches, instead of candles, in a show of their heightened anger toward President Park Geun-hye during a rally in Gwanghwamun, central Seoul, Saturday. Saenuri’s nonmainstream faction decided Sunday afternoon to support the impeachment vote, reversing its position to call for Park’s resignation on April. It had requested Park to come up with a decision by 6 p.m. Wednesday.The Presidential Office of Cheong Wa Dae on Sunday continued its silence on the proposal, despite earlier reports that Park was mulling such a move.The nonmainstream group of Saenuri lawmakers -- former Park allies who have now turned critical of the president -- can make or break the impeachment. They had earlier vowed to join forces with the opposition to oust Park, but appeared to have changed their stance after the embattled president offered Tuesday to step down according to a schedule and legal process to be agreed by the parliament. After an emergency meeting on Sunday, they vowed to take part in the voting regardless of Park’s decision while adding that they will not meet the president even if she requests it.Park has been subject to a criminal investigation on allegations that she conspired with her civilian friend Choi Soon-sil and her former aides on series of wrongdoings such as abusing authority to raise funds for nonprofit organizations -- suspected of being a cover for embezzlement -- and leaking confidential documents. On Saturday, an estimated 2.3 million people took to the streets in a resounding “I don’t think so” to Park’s controversial offer. The largest protest ever snubbed expectations that the anti-Park sentiment would die out, including Saenuri Party Rep. Kim Jin-tae’s prediction that the “candlelight  will be blown out.”In addition to how, when the embattled leader will step down is another thorny issue in bipartisan negotiation. The opposition’s timeline has Park exiting Cheong Wa Dae around late January, assuming her impeachment in set in motion this month. Depending on how much time the Constitutional Court will take to deliberate, the next presidential election could take place as early as March.The election is considered a main motive behind the Saenuri Party’s calls for Park’s April resignation. Last week’s poll by Gallop Korea showed the ruling party’s support at 15 percent, less than half the 34 percent of its main rival Democratic Party and just one point ahead of the People’s Party.In addition, former Democratic Party leader Moon Jae-in has been a solid front-runner among all presidential hopefuls. According to local pollster Realmeter, he has led the race for the sixth week running with 20.7 percent.With the exception of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, all other possible candidates --such as Seongnam Mayor Lee Jae-myung and Ahn Cheol-soo of the People’s Party -- are from the opposition bloc. Observers are saying this is the unspoken reason behind the quarrel about the timing of Park’s resolution.This week will also host a parliamentary audit on the special governmental committee of the Choi Soon-sil scandal, starting Monday. One of the focuses of the hearing is the donations by local corporations to the Mir and K-Sports foundations.The donations are suspected of being bribes for Park and Choi’s inner circles. Testimonies at the hearing are expected to affect the public’s already ill feelings toward Park and possibly the prospect of the upcoming impeachment vote.By Yoon Min-sik","park immediate dismissal saturday ,impeached the largest protest ,immediate dismissal saturday but ,friday the opposition bloc ,immediate dismissal saturday","['the National Assembly', 'Park Geun - hye']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51325786  0.27505225

The ultimatum was issued during a meeting of the non-Park loyalists in the Saenuri Party that morning.  They said they will join the opposition in the impeachment vote on Dec. 9 should the president refuse to accept their demand.  The Saenuri dissenters rejected minor opposition parties' proposal to vote on the impeachment motion Monday. Instead, they offered to negotiate with the opposition to hammer out a bipartisan agreement by Wednesday to push for Park's voluntary resignation. Ruling and opposition parties remained divided over how to remove President Park Geun-hye from office due to an influence-peddling scandal. Park loyalists have suggested a voluntary resignation whereas the opposition prefer an impeachment. In the middle are the Saenuri lawmakers opposed to Park, who hold the key to determining the fate of the embattled leader.The opposition's plan to vote on the impeachment motion on Friday was delayed as the parties diverged in reaction to the president's announcement Tuesday that she would let parliament decide her fate as president.The splinter People's Party declined to hand in the impeachment motion to the parliament on Thursday, as Saenuri dissenters faltered after her speech. They called for more time get enough votes from the governing party.In order for the impeachment motion to pass, 200 lawmakers of the 300-seat National Assembly need to vote for it. The opposition and independent lawmakers are 28 seats short of the necessary two-thirds majority and therefore must persuade the non-Park faction in the ruling Saenuri Party to join forces as well.The Saenuri group supporting the impeachment said Friday it will continue talks with the opposition parties on the president's voluntary resignation.They earlier agreed with Park loyalists to push to let the president step down voluntarily by April and hold the presidential election in June.

The disgraced leader expressed her willingness Tuesday to give up the presidency, due to end in February 2018, if the National Assembly secures a “stable pathway” for its handover.At the heart of the discussions are the time frame of Park’s dismissal and the vote, as well as whether to let Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn take over reign or appoint someone else in that position. As a way out, the ruling Saenuri Party has floated afresh an amendment to the Constitution to be carried out in tandem with the ongoing impeachment campaign. Leaders of the ruling Saenuri Party, including Chairman Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, watch TV as President Park Geun-hye makes her third national address on the corruption scandal involving her confidante Choi Soon-sil. Floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk said the amendment could result in reducing Park’s term by seven to eight months while sating ever-growing demands to decentralize power away from the president. “Once complete, the constitutional amendment would make possible the president’s orderly, early resignation,” Chung told reporters after Park’s news conference. “We have to wrap up the lackluster debate on the constitutional amendment and move to the next stage.” He also reiterated calls for talks on the formation of a neutral Cabinet as a follow-up step to the impeachment vote. Some leading opposition politicians, including main opposition Democratic Party of Korea Chairwoman Rep. Choo Mi-ae, argue Hwang should not be made acting president and should also take responsibility for his failure to advise the president in the run-up to the Choi Soon-sil scandal. “If the impeachment motion is passed under the current circumstances, the prime minister will take over the job and then questions may arise as to whether his leadership would live up to the people’s will,” Chung said. “To minimize the administrative impasse, I will negotiate with the opposition on the issue of the creation of a neutral Cabinet.” But the opposition camp has rebuffed the idea, calling it an attempt to divert attention ahead of a looming vote on the impeachment motion. Some Saenuri members, such as Reps. Na Kyung-won and Ha Tae-keung, also warned the party leadership against distracting the discussions. “Now is not the time to talk about a constitutional amendment, but to concentrate on unseating the president,” the party’s former chair and leading presidential contender Moon Jae-in said in an interview with JTBC late Monday. “Whether it be an impeachment or the president’s resignation, an early presidential election is unavoidable, and what matters is when,” he said ahead of Park’s news conference Tuesday. Rep, Park Jie-won, interim chief and floor leader of the minor opposition People’s Party, also urged Saenuri lawmakers to focus on the impeachment initiative, which he said is the “right way to uphold the citizens’ will.” As part of efforts to prepare for uncertainties, the two opposition parties held a seminar Monday to explore ways to better steer a post-impeachment administration. Many participants have raised concerns about the lack of clear documents on the role of the acting president, including whether it includes personnel appointment power, which may lead to an administrative vacuum. “There are no specific rules on the authority and status of the acting president due to past imperfect lawmaking,” co-host Democratic Party Rep. Min Byung-doo said during the event, raising the need to enact related legislation. Among the hotly debated topics was whether the acting president would be able to appoint the successors to two constitutional justices who are slated to finish their terms in January and March. Once the Assembly approves the impeachment motion, the Constitutional Court is required to deliberate on it within 180 days of the submission.  Another co-host, People’s Party Rep. Kim Kwan-young, said the acting president should be given authority to name new judges, given the responsibility for state affairs and urgency of the issue.

The guideline compilation has drawn attention from the public, as it serves as a preview of the preliminary version of the government-written history textbook set to be revealed on Monday. The Education ministry said the ruling principle of the textbooks must ""reflect the latest academic theories in order to describe historical facts without errors and keep impartiality.""Regarding Korean Liberation Day on Aug. 15, 1945, the ministry said the textbooks will describe the day as ""the day of the foundation of the Republic of Korea."" This has been one of the most fiercely disputed parts of the state-authored textbooks, as many historians have claimed that the day should be called ""the establishment of the government of the ROK"" instead based on the reasoning that the country already existed in the form of the provisional government in Shanghai before the liberation day. The provisional government fought for Korean liberation against imperial Japan.Consequently, the dispute ultimately intensified over the question of who to credit as the true founder of the ROK, the provisional government or the first South Korean President Rhee Syng-man.The history textbooks for high schools will present the development of the foundation of the ROK in the aftermath of Korean Liberation Day.The state-authored textbooks will also detail the process of the state-led economic development plans and the resulting economic development. In the latter part, the textbooks will touch on the country's rise to become a global economic power in the present day.The Education Ministry said it stressed the exclusion of subjective evaluations by the authors in order to secure impartiality. The description of the current Park Geun-hye administration will be limited to its key political drives. The upcoming state-authored history books are planned to replace the current history textbooks that are published by eight private publishing companies and approved by the government for use. Primary schools already use a single set of state-authored history textbooks.The compilation of state-authored history textbooks has ignited nationwide protests from opponents who say it could lead to the glorification of former dictators of the country, including late President Park Chung-hee, the father of President Park Geun-hye.","history textbooks on friday ,government written history textbook ,textbooks the south korean ,textbooks on friday ,state authored history textbooks",['the south Korean Ministry of Education'],4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53454095  0.81511939

It hovered below the People's Party, which garnered 17.9 percent, becoming the third player in terms of public approval. The main opposition Democratic Party posted 33.4 percent, up 2.9 percentage points. The ruling party has been dogged by an internal feud among Park-loyalists and their opponents, sparked by the scandal surrounding Choi Soon-sil, who allegedly exerted power over state affairs and enjoyed various illegal benefits. On Wednesday, Rep. Kim Moo-sung, former head of Saenuri, announced he will push for Park's impeachment, which is widely seen as a catalyst to rally party members behind the suprapartisan campaign to unseat the president. Three opposition parties joined forces to seek a parliamentary impeachment of Park.Earlier this week, Gyeonggi Gov. Nam Kyung-pil and third-term lawmaker Kim Yong-tae announced their decision to leave Saenuri.Moon Jae-in, former head of the main opposition, stood as the most favored presidential contender for next year's race with 21.2 percent approval, up 0.8 percentage point from last week. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon followed with 17.4 percent, down 0.7 percent.The survey was conducted this week on 1,519 South Koreans, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.","confidante poll showed thursday ,going scandal involving president ,scandal south korea ruling ,survey amid park scandal ,week down percentage points","[""South Korea 's"", 'Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54780298  0.55543548

His angry impromptu remark drew cheers from participants. But his use of “miss” -- an English loan word with sexist connotations -- led many to question whether being an unmarried woman should be a point of criticism.A presenter from the candlelight vigil event issued an apology in the face of feminist groups’ complaints, reminding the public that, “We are all citizens with equal rights. We are angry about President Park because she manipulated society, not because she is a woman.”As South Koreans take to the streets every Saturday in large numbers to demand scandal-hit President Park Geun-hye resign, rallies in recent weeks were touted as paving the way for the expansion of peaceful protests. A protestor, who wanted to be identified as Lili, poses during an anti-government rally in central Seoul on Saturday. At the forefront of the anti-government protests were women, young people and families with children, who have not previously been seen as a major presence in anti-government protests. What brightened up the protests were performances, impromptu speeches and chanting by citizens to lampoon the embattled leader. Some called her “chicken head” to attack her intelligence or a “puppet” controlled by a shaman. But behind the festivities and peace were some uncomfortable remarks -- both online and offline -- that were criticized for disparaging women in general and discriminating against them. “I heard a middle-aged man calling Park Geun-hye a crazy bitch. I continued to hear gender-focused slurs at rallies for the past month,” Lee So-yeon, 23-year-old university student, told The Korea Herald. “At that point, I felt like the anger toward Park could translate into misogyny.”“The rally was neither peaceful nor safe,” she added. The feminist group Burning Femi Action told The Korea Herald that it had received 20 complaints from those who joined Saturday’s rally about gender-insensitive or sexually harassing remarks. Some of them were “You are pretty and speak well too” and “Even ajummas who cook and raise children at home are here.”“During rallies, women are often treated like people who are special and need to be protected,” said a feminist activist Mihyun. “But we are just pursuing our civic rights like men to raise our voice in the rally. I don’t know why women have to feel intimidated during rallies.” Some alleged that they were sexually harassed during the rally. Police said they had caught a man in his 50s, who was drunk, for allegedly groping a 20-something female protester’s breasts during a Nov. 12 rally. “A guy in his 40s groped my waist and buttocks while asking me to step aside and pretending to swing his arm. It was very unpleasant, but I got scared because I was alone,” said a 20-something twitter user. Some women said they did not participate in the rally because of what they saw as the blatant sexualization of the female participants. A student at Sookmyung Women’s University posted a statement titled “Why I didn’t go to a rally,” denouncing some of the male protesters for secretly filming women and commenting on their looks. She also took issue with the “rampant sexual harassment” at the events.With allegations over sexual harassment, gender-insensitive remarks and acts going viral online, some women are taking action to fight gender discrimination.“When people talk about Park Geun-hye‘s irregularities, they say it is because she is a woman,” said a 28-year-old protestor who wanted to be identified by Lili. “I believe, without using words of hatred, we can still call for the president’s resignation.”High school students hold a placard reading “Association of Korean Princesses“ during an anti-government rally in central Seoul on Saturday. An 18-year-old student held up a banner saying “Association of Korean Princesses” with two of her friends. ”People began to use the term ‘princess’ to ridicule President Park Geun-hye,” she said. ”The term ‘princess’ itself carries a misogynist message.” Lee Na-young, a sociology professor from Chung-Ang University, pointed out that derogatory remarks and behavior during the rally revealed the underlying sexism in society. “Misogyny might have been largely ignored before in society, but it came to the fore this year along with the young generation rising awareness of gender equality,” Lee said. “Addressing problems and discussing them in public will help to gradually curb prejudice about women in society.”By Ock Hyun-ju  Intern reporter Son Ji-hyoung contributed to this article.","misogyny sexism last saturday ,sexism last saturday middle ,sexism last saturday ,an anti government rally ,anger at park brings","['Park Geun', 'Miss Park']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.2051765   0.55631828

The ranking from the 2016 Rule of Law Index compiled by the World Justice Project  is an eight-notch drop from last year. The WJP, a U.S.-based independent group working to advance the rule of law globally, compiles the index every year by providing scores and rankings organized around eights factors, including constraints on government powers, absence of corruption, civil justice and criminal justice, through surveys of 1,000 respondents per country and local legal practitioners and academics. Scores range from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating strongest adherence to the rule of law. South Korea took up the post with 0.73, the lowest since 2014, when the country was ranked 14th out of 99 countries with 0.77, the index said. Last year, the country was 11th out of 102 with 0.79.  The country was rated relatively low in the factors of constraints on government powers, absence of corruption and open government, with their scores marking below 0.7, the report showed. For absence of corruption, in particular, the country was ranked 35th. On the other hand, South Korea earned high scores of over 0.8 for order and security, civil justice and criminal justice, according to the report. ""The 2016 index reflects that the country's judicial branch currently fails to receive a good reputation from the people in terms of trust,"" Hong Bok-ki, chairman of the Korea law Professors Association, said.

The move comes as the president, apparently determined to face her biggest crisis head-on, prepares for a legal battle that may determine the fate of her presidency. In a major humiliating blow to the scandal-ridden conservative leader, prosecutors on Sunday named her an accomplice to crimes allegedly committed by her now-infamous friend Choi Soon-sil and two former presidential secretaries. Park is accused of colluding with them to force large conglomerates to donate billons of won to two nonprofit foundations controlled by Choi. The investigators also suspect that Park pressured some of the firms to give contracts to companies run by Choi or Choi’s close associates. The president, through her attorney Yoo Yeong-ha, strongly rejected the allegations and openly pledged not to cooperate with the ongoing prosecutorial probe in the future. “The president will cooperate with an impartial probe led by an independent counsel,” Yoo said. As Park faces more scrutiny from the independent counsel and the parliament, the president is preparing to form a team of legal representatives.  The opposition lawmakers are moving to set in motion a campaign to impeach Park. Once the parliament passes the impeachment motion, it is the Constitutional Court that decides whether Park’s alleged misdeed warrants her removal. The Constitution states that a sitting president can be impeached when he or she is found to have violated the Constitution or law.

The prosecution has been calling for a face-to-face interview with Park before prosecuting Choi -- the deadline for which is Sunday -- to build grounds that the president had allowed or assisted her longtime civilian confidante in creating slush funds and meddling in state affairs. Yet Park’s lawyer Yoo Young-ha delayed the questioning, saying it was “physically impossible” and that he needed more time to prepare.  “Our position has been that the probe should be held no later than Friday, but given the lawyer’s remarks and the overall situation, this would not be possible,” an official of a special investigation team told reporters. The prosecution’s aim was to look into Park’s role in the scandal through the questioning and reflect it in an indictment against Choi and two former presidential secretaries who are also under arrest, An Chong-bum and Jeong Ho-seong, whom it seeks to prosecute this weekend alongside Choi. Even without the meeting, the team is capable of addressing Park’s alleged role to Choi’s indictment given the evidence it has secured so far. The official said it would make an “objective, reasonable decision” based on testimonies by the suspects and witnesses as well as materials seized during raids and from elsewhere.“We pushed for the interview to provide the president a chance to testify before defining criminal facts involving the arrested three suspects,” the prosecutor said. “ is a key witness regarding crimes committed by them, and she faces possibly problematic criminal charges herself.” The official’s first-ever mention of “criminal charges” may signal the possibility of the prosecution changing Park’s status from “witness” to “suspect” when the questioning takes place. The investigators are predicted to focus on whether Park was behind the fast launch of two culture and sports foundations with corporate donations totaling 77.4 billion won , over which Choi and An allegedly have peddled influence. Other allegations include the president instructing Jeong to pass confidential documents to Choi and facilitating her intervention in personnel management and other areas of state governance.Jeong was arrested on charges of leaking state secrets, while An faced charges of abuse of authority, interference with rights and attempted coercion. The Constitution exempts the president from being prosecuted, but Park has publicly said she would meet with the prosecutors, including those of an independent special prosecution to be organized by the National Assembly. But criticism is mounting as Park and Yoo seek to postpone the interview, with opposition lawmakers and legal experts branding it an “attempt to buy time” and shift defense logic after examining the to-be-unveiled indictments against the three suspects. By Shin Hyon-hee /","park before prosecuting choi ,prosecuting choi the deadline ,the prosecution friday ,the prosecution friday hinted ,week the prosecution friday","['Park Geun - hye', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Choi']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4292613   0.35725138

This was a rare confirmation of the president’s official schedule, considering the Blue House’s common practice of replying vaguely when asked about Park’s next moves or plans to reinstate state affairs.It also reiterated Foreign Affairs Minister Yun Byung-se’s statement made the previous day.“ will suffer losses, if it misses  for domestic reasons, especially since it was Japan that had set the date,” the minister said.The trilateral meeting, which kicked off in 2008, was once halted after a historical dispute which heated up the 2012 meeting in Beijing. Last year, the three Northeast Asian states gathered in Seoul to resume talks for the first time in three years.Park’s move to join this trilateral summit was a contrast to her nonparticipation in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit to be held in Peru this weekend. Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn is to attend the event as the presidential representative.The official reason behind the prime minister’s participation, according to the government, was that the state chief could not afford an overseas trip amid the escalating nuclear threats from North Korea and that the decision had been made in September -- before the Choi scandal broke out.It had therefore been speculated that Park would refrain from other external activities as well, including the Korea-China-Japan summit.Her approval ratings, which has remained in the record-low 5 percent range, further added credence to the speculation that the president would not show up at international occasions to meet with key counterparts.According to local pollster Gallup Korea on Friday, Park’s rating remains unchanged at 5 percent, with the disapproval rating standing at 90 percent.Despite the low ratings, she has apparently shifted her stance from passive to slowly gearing up to resume state affairs. In line with this move, Park also conferred certificates of appointment to new members of the secretariat and letters of credence to foreign ambassadors in the afternoon.Among the participants were the Presidential Chief of Staff Han Gwang-ok and Vice Foreign Minister Ahn Chong-ghee. The latter was tapped for the post Wednesday, amid the heightening tension over the prosecution’s pledge to question Park over her alleged connection to the Choi scandal.The afternoon’s event was the state chief’s first public appearance in front of the camera since her summit with Kazakhstani counterpart Nursultan Nazarbayev last Thursday.It was also her first official schedule since the record-breaking protest in central Seoul last Saturday, an occasion said to have gathered more than 1 million participants.One key point of concern is whether Park will chair a regular Cabinet meeting next Tuesday, in which case her political reinstatement signal would be finalized.Since Park’s last attendance on Oct. 11, the Cabinet meeting has so far been led by Prime Minister Hwang who, due to the APEC summit, will only return late on Tuesday evening.“Nothing has been decided yet and I will let you know, should there be any schedule ,” the spokesperson told reporters, refraining from confirmation yet leaving room for the possibility.If Park indeed chairs the meeting, her keynote address is likely to be taken as an effective address to the nation, following her two earlier public apologies over the state scandal.As for the reasons why the embattled president is seemingly taking the bull by the horns, despite the sluggish polls and growing pressure, political observers highlighted her reliance upon hidden strongholds, referred to as the “shy Park” group.There have been ongoing speculations that even amid the lowest-ever approving ratings Park may have unseen supporters who may eventually step out. This was reflected in remarks by Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, chief of the ruling Saenuri Party and a leading pro-president figure.“The ratings may be reeling under the current circumstances but may possibly recover, depending on the president’s efforts,” Lee said.By Bae Hyun-jung /","rally slated for saturday ,massive candlelight rally slated ,park moves to resume ,outcry over her delay ,slated for saturday park",['Park Geun - hye'],4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34820211  0.00834171

The Korea Craft and Design Foundation, a state-run organization located in Insa-dong, Seoul, had initially provided office and research space to craftsmen for a fee. Designed to help individual craftsmen and the industry, the foundation has exhibited traditional crafts like fans, wooden masks and folk dolls in the gallery. The Korea Craft and Design Foundation in Insa-dong, SeoulIn 2015, the foundation suddenly changed the policy on space for craftsmen and allowed a nation brand development team affiliated with the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism to use it for free, a person familiar with the deal told The Korea Herald.The team until recently worked with public relations firm Creative Arena, which is under suspicion of being controlled by Cha Eun-taek, a close associate of Choi Soon-sil. Choi, a longtime confidante of President Park, is at the center of a widening corruption and influence-peddling scandal. It remains unclear whether the nation brand development team has had any direct links with Cha or Choi. The Culture Ministry’s nation brand project came up with the “Creative Korea” slogan, which ironically sparked a heated controversy over alleged plagiarism. A Culture Ministry official told The Korea Herald that the decision to let the brand team use the office area for free was made in consideration of the public nature of the project. A local craftsman, however, claimed that artists were “completely excluded from the decision making” on the space of the foundation. “We have fallen victims to the government’s lack of attention to the industry,” he said.

But Cheong Wa Dae has so far shown little response to such moves, only claiming to have “embraced the public sentiment with a heavy heart.”So when the spokesman heralded an emergency press briefing Wednesday afternoon, the Blue House press room began speculating whether the president would at last reveal her stance on the probe. Some anticipated that the spokesman might reiterate the president’s earlier stance that she would neither admit to the given allegations, nor step down from power.But as soon as the keyword “Busan LCT” came out, groans emerged from a number of reporters, possibly out of disappointment or anger.Either way, the negative mood that swept across the press was no more than a reflection of the nation’s public sentiment -- resentment against the president’s continued lack of response. This sudden intervention in an ongoing investigation was made by a president who, since her last public apology, has been taking a backseat in state affairs.This is a president who, by putting off an imminent prosecutorial questioning, effectively contradicted her earlier pledge to “fully cooperate in the related investigation.”This is a president who, despite the escalating circumstantial evidence, has been refusing to explain her lack of action during the crucial seven hours following the sinking of the Sewol ferry which resulted in hundreds of deaths back in 2014.Cheong Wa Dae defensively claimed that the statement on the LCT probe was no more than a response to the burgeoning suspicions from the opposition circles.What is really required of the Blue House, however, is to answer to other doubts, the unanswered suspicions which gathered over 1 million citizens in protest last Saturday.By Bae Hyun-jung","her last public apology ,thorough and strict investigation ,public apology over ,reporter column park two ,last public apology over","['Park Geun', 'Park ’s']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.10924469  0.17339124

In a poll by Realmeter of 1,525 Koreans from Nov. 14 to 16, a mere 9.9 percent of respondents gave a positive view over Park’s state governance, marking a 1.6 percentage point drop from a week ago. The figure marks the first-ever single-digit approval rating from the Seoul-based pollster since its initial survey following the president’s swearing-in in February 2013. The announcement also followed other record-low grades -- 5 percent shown in a poll by Gallup Korea and 9.2 percent by the Naeil daily and the Opinion, both released early this month. Negative opinions on Park also hit a fresh high of 85.9 percent, up 2 percentage points from the same period. The latest survey’s margin of error is 2.5 percentage points.South Korean President Park Geun-hye Public sentiment toward Park apparently continues to sour despite two rounds of public apologies for the scandal, which further sparked criticism for her lack of sincerity and failure to come clean about her involvement. The ratings for the ruling Saenuri Party also remained in the 10s for a third straight time at 18.2 percent, outstripped on a daily basis for the first time on Monday by the minor opposition People’s Party. “The results reflect the president’s refusal to step down despite the 1 million-strong candlelight vigil last weekend,” Realmeter said on its blog. “The fall in Saenuri’s support came amid increasingly extreme internal strife over the fate of Park and party chair Rep. Lee Jung-hyun.”By region, the president’s approval ratings in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province -- her traditional political turf -- slightly rebounded to 19.8 percent. The Saenuri Party, too, saw its support plunge to an unprecedented 36.9 percent there. But the numbers for the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea also dropped by 1.5 percentage points to 30.5 percent, capping its recent upward trend. The People’s Party, for its part, managed to garner 17 percent, up 1.7 percentage points from the previous survey a week before. The minor opposition Justice Party also witnessed a 1.5 percentage point rise in its approval rating, reaching 7.7 percent. On the future of Park, 73.9 percent of respondents said Park should resign or be impeached by the parliament, up 13.5 percentage points. Among potential presidential contenders, Moon Jae-in, a former leader of the Democratic Party of Korea, topped the poll with 18.4 percent, despite a 1.4 percentage point drop. The ratings of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, another potential candidate, stood at 18.4 percent, up 1.2 percentage points. Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, the People’s Party‘s former head, soared 1.7 percentage points to 11.9 percent.By Shin Hyon-hee","latest poll showed thursday ,fall amid scandal president ,amid scandal president park ,showed thursday in poll ,free fall amid scandal","['Park Geun - hye', 'Koreans', 'Park ’s']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36698085  0.32197157

It concerns evidence that Choi was allowed to meddle in state affairs and misappropriate public funds. “If it can help wrap up the investigation on allegations related to the president, I will finish preparing for my defense as soon as possible and cooperate so that investigation on the president can take place next week,” said Park’s lawyer Yoo Yeong-ha.Earlier in the day, the prosecution had delivered a virtual ultimatum on calling in Park for an interview, saying it would be nearly impossible for them to question her over the weekend. “I think it will be physically difficult  during the weekend. If I were to compare it to a newspaper company, today is actually the deadline for stories. After tomorrow, it’s absolutely impossible to make changes,” said an official from the prosecution.President Park Geun-hye When asked if the indictment of Choi would have to take place without questioning Park, he answered “logically, there is a possibility that will be the case.”Under Korean law, the prosecution has to indict Choi by Sunday before her arrest warrant expires. This forced the prosecution to consider Friday as the absolute deadline for questioning Park.Prosecutors originally intended to do so on Wednesday, but Yoo said via a press conference Tuesday that it was impossible because his client needed “considerable time” to prepare.This sparked criticism from the opposition that Park was evading justice. However, Yoo denied this and said that he and his client simply needed more time.The official from the prosecution dismissed the possibility of conducting an interview with Park via written questionnaire, saying, “If we were to do it, it would have to be face-to-face.” He said that Choi would be indicted Sunday, when Park’s former aides An Chong-bum and Jeong Ho-seong are also “likely” to be indicted.An is accused of pressuring local conglomerates to raise money for the Mir and K-Sports foundations -- allegedly used to channel money to Choi -- while Jeong is suspected of leaking Park’s documents to Choi. Prosecutors are reportedly seeking to indict Jeong on charge of leaking secrets related to public service, but have said it would be difficult to accuse him of leaking presidential documents as most of them were incomplete or had not been registered in the Cheong Wa Dae database.Investigators did not rule out the possibility of interviewing Park after the indictment, but indicated the possibility of doing so was not high. It left the door open for revising charges on Choi later on, but also indicated that it was not probable.The prosecution has been closing in on the president, particularly on her aides accused of playing a part in the scandal that has shaken the country to its very core.It has requested an arrest warrant for Vice Culture Minister Kim Chong on charge of abusing authority. Kim is suspected of being involved in the establishment and operation of the K-Sports Foundation, while providing favors to it and Choi’s daughter Chung Yoo-ra.Cho Won-dong, senior economic secretary to Park from 2013 to 2014, appeared before the Seoul Central Prosecutors’ Office in southern Seoul for questioning. He was to face questions over allegations that he pressured food and entertainment conglomerate CJ Group to dismiss its vice chairwoman, Lee Mie-kyung.Cho said that he “did not know” what allegations he was facing, and said he felt “miserable for being here,” while the country’s economy was facing difficulties. The minutes of his conversation with CJ Group co-Chairman Sohn Kyung-sik showed that Cho urged the move in 2013, saying it was the will of the president. Lee did not resign from her post but left the country for the US and has not returned since.Lee at the time had been heading the entertainment section of the company, which produced content including the period piece “Gwanghae: the Man who Became the King ” and “The Attorney,” which reflected the life of late liberal former President Roh Moo-hyun. The films had been accused of having a left-leaning political bias.A former CJ executive told the JoongAng Daily newspaper that Lee had left for the US because she felt it was impossible to come back during the Park administration.Cha Eun-taek, a TV commercial director with links to Choi, has been involved in various CJ-related projects since Lee’s departure. This has fueled suspicion that pressure was put on the CJ leadership to benefit Cha.By Yoon Min-sik","her lawyer said thursday ,face prosecutors next week ,next week her lawyer ,prosecutors next week ,prosecutors next week her","['Park Geun', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Choi']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29354537  0.39006668

Starting this year, all test-takers must take a separate Korean history exam during the social and natural sciences test time. A test-taker arrives on police patrol bike. The test started at 8:30 a.m. with a plan to run through 5:40 p.m., including lunch and breaks, the ministry said. As in previous years, the government imposed various traffic control and anti-noise measures as part of its efforts to ensure that the test be executed without any problems. Subways and trains in the capital area extended their rush hour services by two hours to help all exam-takers arrive at the test sites on time. Bus operations were also expanded during the commuting time. The stock markets will open for trade one hour late, while government offices and enterprises in nearby areas also plan to open an hour later than usual to keep the roads clear for students on their way to the test centers, it said.Police said they will mobilize 14,000 officers to support the ministry running the exam, while offering to transport students in need of a ride by patrol cars or on the back of motorcycles. Test applicants were banned from having electronic devices, including mobile phones, digital cameras, MP3 players, electronic calculators and smartwatches, at their desks to prevent possible cheating, the ministry said. The applicants will be individually notified of their test results on Dec. 7, according to the ministry.","college entrance exam thursday ,000 high school seniors ,annual college entrance exam ,000 students take college ,entrance exam thursday","['South Korea', 'College Scholastic Ability Test']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41073242  0.3675665

We  said it was necessary to do it today. ... We plan to tell them that if we were to concede beyond the ‘Maginot Line’ , Friday would be possible,” a high-ranking official from Seoul Central Prosecutors’ Office said.Park is suspected of being directly involved in the scandal, which includes allegations that Choi had meddled in state affairs and siphoned off public funds.The official said that the prosecution remains unchanged on its position that Park will be probed not as a suspect, but as a key witness in the case. This makes it impossible for the investigators to forcibly question her, as it would not be permitted to take her into custody.If the president chooses not to comply with the prosecution’s questioning, it will be forced to reach a decision accordingly, he said.Suspicions that Park is directly involved in the Choi scandal have been further fueled in the past few days, with evidence uncovered from her former aides.An Chong-bum The prosecution’s investigation into former presidential secretary An Chong-bum reportedly found that he had received orders from Park about raising funds for the Mir Foundation and K-Sports Foundation. The two nonprofit organizations are suspected of being used as a cover to channel money to Choi.According to local media outlet Munhwa Ilbo, An’s notebook confiscated by the investigators showed that Park had given direct instructions about the foundations from day one, requesting regular updates on their progress. It even specified how a company effectively owned by TV commercial director Cha Eun-taek -- an associate of Choi -- should produce much of state-related advertisements.  Cha is currently being investigated on charges of using his relationship with Choi for illegal gains, such as pressuring another company to give up majority shares of an advertisement company.An has already testified to the prosecution that he was just following Park’s orders on the fundraising.Jeong Ho-seongLast week, the prosecution found text messages on a phone of another former presidential aide, Jeong Ho-seong, related to Park’s private meeting with the chiefs of seven of Korea’s largest corporations. Park is suspected of pressuring the company heads to donate to the foundations.The confiscated phone also showed that Park had given specific instructions about Choi, prosecutors said.According to the investigators, one of the messages showed Park asking if he had received confirmation from Choi. She had referred to Choi as “a teacher,” which in Korean is also used as a term of respect.A voice recording from Jeong’s phone also showed that Choi gave specific instructions on a variety of reports being sent to Cheong Wa Dae.Rep. Moon Jae-in, a former leader of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, said Wednesday that the prosecution should treat Park as a suspect if she continues to not cooperate with the investigation.“She was the one who promised . Complying with the investigation is the first step to uncovering the truth. If she were to flip-flop on that, who will believe her resolve to tell the truth?” he said.By Yoon Min-sik","wednesday that questioning president ,postponed after her lawyer ,by friday the prosecution ,at press conference tuesday ,friday the prosecution","['Park Geun', 'Park']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46087292  0.35810539

It marks the 12th straight year for the General Assembly to adopt a North Korean human rights resolution.In particular, it is the third consecutive year for the General Assembly to adopt a resolution calling on the Security Council to refer the North's human rights situation to the ICC. That underlines the seriousness with which the international community views the situation.This year's resolution blamed the North's ""leadership"" for human rights abuses. The Third Committee of the U.N. General Assembly holds a meeting to adopt a resolution on North Korea's human rights situation on Nov. 15. ""The General Assembly ... encourages the Security Council to ... take appropriate action to ensure accountability, including through consideration of referral of the situation in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the International Criminal Court and consideration of the further development of sanctions,"" the resolution said.The resolution also expresses ""very serious concern"" at ""the exploitation of workers sent abroad from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to work under conditions that reportedly amount to forced labor."" It is the first time a General Assembly resolution has mentioned the North's labor exports, which have become an increasingly important source of hard currency for Pyongyang amid concern that the funds could be used for its nuclear and missile programs.About 50,000-60,000 North Koreans are believed to be toiling overseas, mainly in the mining, logging, textile and construction industries. The average wage was stated as $120 to $150 per month, but in most cases employing firms paid salaries directly to the North's government.The North reportedly receives more than $100 million from this system per year.The 2014 General Assembly resolution is considered a watershed moment in international efforts to improve the North's human rights situation as it marked the first time for the Assembly to call for the North's referral to the ICC.That resolution led to the UN Security Council holding consultations on the issue for the first time later that year. In addition, a similar resolution was adopted last year and the Security Council also held discussions on the North's human rights situation for the second time.North Korea has long been labeled as one of the worst human rights violators. The communist regime does not tolerate dissent, holds hundreds of thousands of people in political prison camps and keeps tight control over outside information.But the North has bristled at such criticism, calling it a US-led attempt to topple its regime.After Tuesday's passage, Amb. Kim In-ryong, deputy chief of the North's mission to the UN, told a news conference that the country ""categorically rejects"" the resolution, claiming it has ""political purposes to defame and eliminate the DPRK as well as it is based on lies and fabricated information.""North Korean officials were also asked about the results of the US presidential election.""We don't care about who becomes US president,"" said Kim Yong-ho, a North Korean Foreign Ministry director in charge of human rights issues. ""The fundamental issue is whether the US has a political will to withdraw its hostile policy toward the DPRK.""Asked whether the North would allow the UN special rapporteur on North Korea's human rights situation, Tomas Ojea Quintana, to visit the country, Kim said Ojea Quintana is welcome to visit as a law professor from Buenos Aires, but his visit as special rapporteur won't be granted.South Korea welcomed the latest resolution on human rights in the North, calling it the ""toughest-ever"" one aimed at sending strong warnings to Pyongyang bent on missile and nuclear weapons while turning a blind eye to its people's livelihood. ""The government urges  to take detailed and practical measures immediately in accordance with the UN resolution to improve human rights conditions for its citizens,"" Seoul's foreign ministry said in a comment issued in the name of spokesman Cho June-hyuck.","assembly meeting next month ,meeting next month ,human rights resolution tuesday ,general assembly meeting next ,meeting next month as","['the Third Committee', 'the UN General Assembly', 'north korean', 'the International Criminal Court', 'Pyongyang', 'General Assembly']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.69476104  0.45764524

""If we are ready, we would, of course, respond to the request, but I was just appointed yesterday.""The attorney also expressed his preference for the prosecution carrying out the inquiry in written form, though saying ""if it is inevitable,"" a face-to-face questioning session will also be accepted. Yoo, in addition, said that the unprecedented probe into the sitting president must be carried out in a way that ""minimizes"" any impact on her official duties. He also cited a constitutional clause that stipulates the president is immune from prosecution except in cases of insurrection or treason.""The investigation or trial for the president, while he or she is still in office, could paralyze state affairs and divide public opinion,"" he said. ""Thus, there are minimal constitutional safeguards and an investigation into the president is inappropriate unless he or she is involved in certain serious crimes""  Earlier in the day, the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae announced Yoo, a former member of the standing committee of the National Human Rights Commission, as the president's legal representative.Park faces suspicions that she played some sort of role in pressuring major conglomerates into donating large sums of money to two nonprofit foundations, which legal experts say could constitute an abuse of authority.She is also suspected of allowing her confidante, Choi Soon-sil, to gain access to advance drafts of presidential speeches and documents, some of which reportedly include classified information. This suspicion raises the possibility of Park violating the law concerning the handling of presidential records or official secrets.Yoo's relations with the president date back to 2010 when he served as a legal advisor to Park, who was then a member of the Supreme Council of the Grand National Party, a precursor to the ruling Saenuri Party.After passing a bar exam in 1992, Yoo served as prosecutor for some seven years in district offices in Seoul, Changwon, Cheongju and Incheon. Since 2004, he has worked as an attorney.","attorney on tuesday called ,hye attorney on tuesday ,attorney on tuesday ,rejected the prosecution request ,day after his appointment","['Park Geun', 'Park', 'Yoo Yeong - ha', 'Park']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22364646  0.38945433

Choi was a former prosecutor himself, having served as chief of the Incheon District Prosecutors’ Office.“For now, the president will be questioned as a witness,” the official also said.“Though details such as the time and place  are yet to be discussed, the questioning will basically take place in a face-to-face format.”The Blue House, which had so far kept silence over the talks of prosecutorial questioning, replied this time.“ will be able to confirm its stance on the day after  at the earliest, due to consideration of the president’s schedule and the appointment of a legal representative,” the presidential spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk said in a text message distributed to reporters.The spokesperson’s remarks came shortly after news reports quoted the prosecution as pledging to question the president by Wednesday. The given timeline largely comes in line with the fact that the Choi’s detention period is set to expire on Nov. 20.The questioning, if it takes place, is to be the first time in South Korea’s history that a standing president has faced a prosecutorial probe.“I am ready to accept prosecutorial probe, even one by an independent counsel, if necessary,” Park vowed earlier in her address to the nation on Nov. 4, her second one since the Choi scandal broke out in late October.Speculations have risen that investigators, in recognition of the unique circumstances, may choose to meet Park in a place other than the prosecutors’ office or Cheong Wa Dae.Meanwhile, it yet remains unclear whether the embattled president will indeed defect from the ruling Saenuri Party, resign from her post or hand over all practical power to an incoming prime minister.“ agreed that we should humbly accept the people’s voice and take it gravely,” said a Cheong Wa Dae official, after an urgent senior presidential secretaries’ meeting chaired by Chief of Staff Han Gwang-ok in the morning.The meeting, which went on for an hour from 10 a.m., was originally scheduled for later in the afternoon but was moved forward following the nationwide candlelight vigil the previous night.But regarding more details of the forthcoming countermeasures, the Blue House continued to remain reserved.“We gathered the opinion of each  and are pondering various measures,” the official said.The presidential office’s worry, however, is that neither defection nor withdrawing to take a backseat in state affairs will appease the public.Despite Park’s actions so far -- including two public apologies, a shake-up of the Cabinet and of the presidential secretariat and her consent to let parliament appoint a prime minister -- her approval rating has remained in the record-low 5 percent range over the past two weeks.It was amid such lackluster responses from the president that an hours-long protesting rally was held in central Seoul and throughout the nation Saturday, gathering up to 1 million participants.

Despite the embattled president’s second apology last week, calls have continued to grow for Park to take responsibility for the state crisis. Some 1.1 million angry citizens took to the street Saturday. News agency Reuters reported that Gwanghwamun Square was flooded with citizens of all ages, ranging from “students to families including young couples pushing strollers and protesters in wheelchairs.” It said that the peaceful march “contrasted with the violence of some previous rallies dominated by militant unions and civic groups that clashed with police.”Students in school uniform hold banners demanding Park’s resignation.  Many foreign media outlets highlighted the peaceful atmosphere of Saturday’s well-organized rally, while analyzing how citizens taking to the street for three consecutive Saturdays would change the situation of the beleaguered president. American newspaper Washington Post said that Saturday’s protest was “no small feat in a country with a vibrant protest culture” and that it “increased the pressure on Park over a widening corruption and influence-peddling controversy.”“Although South Korea is no stranger to corruption scandals, this one has infuriated people who think that democracy has been circumvented and wonder whether the country was being run by a ‘shadow president’ with no experience.” Washington Post added that South Koreans are “angry that the institutions of government -- from the prosecutor’s office to the presidential Blue House itself -- not only did not intervene, but seemed to have helped Choi.”British broadcaster BBC’s Stephen Evans reported from the scene that “the protesters are more raucous than they were last week -- still peaceful but there’s more chanting than there was then.” Gyeongbokgung Station is crowded with protestors. The sound of citizens shouting was loud enough to reach the Blue House and the BBC said “if she  is at home there, the noise will be inescapable.”American broadcaster CNN’s reporter Paula Hancocks said Saturday’s uprising was “not expected to be big,” however, it turned out to be a massive rally with one simple message: President Park Geun-hye should voluntarily resign.She said that despite President Park’s second apology, public frustration lingers since “they feel they have been lied to and that their president has not told them the truth.”Public frustration and disillusion with this government have grown over the past few years, due partly to a number of scandals including the Sewol ferry sinking in 2014 when “collusion  was partly a cause for lack of measures to save more people,” she added.A protestor holds a placard that reads, “Target complete, Park Geun-hye Out!” Japan’s Asahi News Network said that Saturday’s protest came from frustration toward the Park administration. China’s government-run Xinhua News Agency said that Park has already lost trust and authority here. News agency AP reported that “there is also a possibility that prosecutors will eventually investigate Park, who in a televised apology last week said she would accept a direct investigation into her actions.”By Kim Da-sol","vigil calling for president ,saturday peaceful candlelight vigil ,embattled president second apology ,apology last week calls ,president second apology last","['Park Geun', 'Park']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33712876  0.36264881

But regarding more details of the forthcoming countermeasures, the Blue House continued to remain reserved.“We gathered the opinion of each  and are pondering various measures,” the official said.It is thought that the presidential aides contemplated Park’s defection from the ruling conservative Saenuri Party and her handing over all practical power to the incoming prime minister.The presidential office’s worry, however, is that neither defection nor withdrawing to take a backseat in state affairs will appease the public.Despite Park’s actions so far -- including two public apologies, a shake-up of the Cabinet and of the presidential secretariat and her consent to let parliament appoint a prime minister -- her approval rating has remained in the record-low 5 percent range over the past two weeks.The candlelight rally to demand Park’s resignation gathered up to 1 million participants in central Seoul and in various cities across the nation. Organizers said 1 million people attended the Seoul rally, whereas the police figure was 260,000.“We are working non-stop to find a way to settle the aggravated public sentiment but nothing has yet been decided for sure,” another Cheong Wa Dae official admitted.During the hours-long protest on Saturday, the presidential staff remained in an emergency stand-by mode, reporting the situation to the president on a real-time basis, according to officials.With protestors holding the streets from City Hall through Gwanghwamun Square to Anguk Station, the rallying cries were said to be audible in Park’s presidential office and beyond.On such circumstances, political observers are speculating that Park, with few options left to choose from, may deliver another address to the nation as early as within the week.Amid this speculation, there is also rising talk of the prosecution questioning of the president, in line with the imminent indictment of Choi Soon-sil, the presidential confidante at the center of the corruption and influence-peddling scandal.Should it take place, is it would be the first time in South Korea’s history that a standing president has faced questioning by investigators.Prosecutors said earlier that they were considering opening a probe into Park around Nov. 20, which is when the legal period for Choi’s detention is due to expire.By Bae Hyun-jung","candlelight vigil demanding president ,vigil demanding president park ,vigil demanding president ,breaking candlelight vigil demanding ,its silence sunday over","['Park Geun', 'Park']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.02642918  0.26986942

At the meeting, civilian leaders and the military's top brass reviewed potential U.S. defense policy changes that may occur between Washington and its Asian ally.Rep. Kim Young-woo, a ruling Saenuri Party lawmaker who heads the National Defense Committee in parliament, Defense Minister Han Min-koo and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Lee Sun-jin attended the meeting, the ministry said. ""We are planning to set up a task force to help push forward major defense agreements with the U.S. despite the change in the U.S. administration,"" a defense ministry official said. The official said the ministry will make utmost efforts to ensure that existing agreements between the allies will be carried out as planned. ""We will seek a close communication with U.S. lawmakers in charge of defense policies toward the peninsula and the Asia-Pacific region in the Trump administration,"" he said.    A photo taken Nov. 10, 2016, Rep. Kim Young-woo  a ruling Saenuri Party lawmaker who heads the National Defense Committee in parliament, and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Lee Sun-jin walk into the JCS headquarters in Seoul to attend an emergency meeting to discuss defense issues. The agreements involve the conditions-based transfer of the wartime operational control of South Korean forces from Washington to Seoul, the planned deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system in South Korea, and permanent deployment of its strategic assets to the divided peninsula. On Tuesday, Trump was elected as the 45th president of the United States in a stunning victory that reflects deep voter resentment against the establishment.His remarks during the campaign caused deep concerns from longtime U.S. allies such as South Korea, Japan and Europe. Trump, a businessman turned politician, has sometimes referred to allies as a cumbersome burden sucking up taxpayer dollars. He has even suggested arming South Korea and Japan with nuclear weapons so as to reduce U.S. security burdens. The 70-year-old has also argued that South Korea must 100 percent pay for the cost of maintaining the 28,000 American troops stationed in the country, warning Washington could pull out of the Asian alliance unless Seoul agrees to pay more. If Trump follows through on his comments made during the campaign, it could be disastrous for the Seoul-Washington relations, analysts here said.","meeting after trump surprise ,assessment meeting after trump ,emergency meeting on thursday ,after trump surprise win ,meeting after trump","[""South Korea 's"", 'Donald Trump', 'the United States', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'asian', 'Kim Young']",4,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.64302021  0.45031974

When she arrived at around 10:30 a.m., everything seemed to be business as usual. The Assembly’s Secretary-General Woo Yoon-keun and the governing Saenuri Party’s floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk were among the first to greet her. Clad in a red jacket and black trousers, Park smiled as she was escorted into the main assembly hall, leading an impressive entourage. Inside the Assembly, however, the mood was drastically different. Dozens of opposition lawmakers and their aides held up placards and chanted slogans, demanding her resignation. No Saenuri lawmaker was there to welcome the president. Reps. Cho Won-jin, Min Kyung-wook and Ju Sang-ook showed up at the elevator near the entrance hall, but turned back after seeing the crowd of protestors. “It is an order from the people: Park Geun-hye must stay away from state affairs,” read the placards held up by lawmakers of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, including Reps. Sul Hoon and Woo Won-shik. Another banner, carried by first-termer Rep. Chae Yi-bae and other members of the runner-up opposition People’s Party, read: “The president should step down.” President Park Geun-hye walks past protesters to hold an one-on-one talk with National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun at the parliamentary building in Yeouido, Seoul, Tuesday. Six lawmakers from the minor Justice Party, including its leader Rep. Shim Sang-jeung, held a sign reading, “Resignation for Park.”“Stop giving a hard time to the people. Please resign,” a group of staffers from the Democratic Party shouted. The words “resignation” reverberated across the hallway until the president took the elevator to meet Speaker Chung Sye-kyun. Park, not losing her smile despite the palpable hostility, made no comment or gestures.After a 13-minute one-on-one meeting with Speaker Chung, hurriedly arranged to salvage her embattled presidency, Park faced the same protestors as she made her way out of the building. They continued to chant “resignation for Park” until well after she left. No Saenuri lawmakers were there to send her off. It was a far cry from her last visit to the Assembly on Oct. 24, when she dropped a political bomb -- a proposal to revise the Constitution and modify the country’s single-term, five-year presidency. Refusing to be a lame-duck in her fourth year in office, she had thrust herself into the center of political talk. Then, not only did Saenuri lawmakers line up to greet and escort her in and out of the Assembly, some loyalists had given her a standing ovation during her speech. The reason for Park’s fall from grace in just over two weeks’ time -- her misguided reliance on embattled friend Choi Soon-sil. By Yeo Jun-suk","anger protest president park ,with anger protest president ,anger protest president ,protest president park surprise ,protest president","['Park', 'the National Assembly', 'Assembly', 'Woo Yoon - keun', 'Saenuri Party ’s', 'Chung Jin - suk']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65850991  0.15579997

Her freefall in popularity has stopped, a recent survey showed, with an uptick in the president’s core support base of older and right-wing voters. According to local pollster Realmeter, Park’s daily approval ratings have gone downhill, dropping from around 30 percent, before a scandal involving her close confidante Choi Soon-sil broke out, to just 10.2 percent last Wednesday. The conservative president, however, stopped her losing streak in polls Thursday, registering a slight uptick -- 0.7 percentage point -- in approval ratings to reach 10.9 percent. Then on Friday, after her nationally televised mea culpa, the daily reading inched further up to 12.7 percent. “Park’s second apology, in which she expressed her willingness to undergo investigation, appears to have consolidated support behind her,” Realmeter explained. The president saw her support among voters aged 60 or older rise by nearly 5 percentage points after the apology -- from 23.5 percent on Thursday to 28.4 percent on Friday. Among supporters of the conservative Saenuri Party, those who approve of the job Park is doing rose from 36.9 percent to 42.6 percent. On a weekly basis, however, the Realmeter result also showed that Park has become the least popular of all democratically-elected presidents in South Korea. Her approval rating for the first week of November stood at 11.5 percent, down 7.5 percentage points from the previous week. The previous record was 12.6 percent held by former President Roh Moo-hyun. Last week, Gallup Korea put Park’s approval rating at 5 percent, the lowest ever for any Korean president. By Korea Herald staff /","polls stops after apology ,her emotional apology friday ,freefall in polls stops ,after her emotional apology ,ratings have gone downhill",['Park Geun'],4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66706163  0.75817674

""We are closely watching every move by the North Korean military at its Punggye-ri nuclear test site and other possible missile-launching sites. The military is fully prepared to respond to any provocative acts by the North,"" an official from Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff told reporters in a briefing. Both the South Korean military and the US forces stationed on the Korean Peninsula said they are utilizing all available resources to keep close tabs on the movement of missiles. The Musudan or BM-35 missile is an IRBM with an estimated range of some 3,500 kilometers, which is enough to allow it to target the US Pacific territory of Guam. The island is home to many strategic assets that can support South Korean and US forces in the event of a conflict breaking out on the peninsula. Meanwhile, the defense ministry said it won't allow any impact of the corruption scandal involving President Park Geun-hye's close confidante Choi Soon-sil on the military's preparedness against the North's provocations.In the influence-peddling scandal, Choi used her four-decades-long relationship with the president to meddle in affairs of state. She was arrested Thursday on charges of fraud and abuse of power.  ""All military and security matters, including the deployment of an advanced missile defense system known as THAAD, will be pushed forward as planned regardless of the scandal,"" a ministry spokesman said. US Forces Korea Commander Gen. Vincent K. Brooks said Friday a THAAD battery will be deployed in South Korea within eight to 10 months to counter growing threats from the communist regime.","us presidential election scheduled ,for tuesday military officials ,election scheduled for tuesday ,tuesday military officials ,presidential election scheduled for","[""South Korea 's"", 'North Korea', 'IRBM', 'US', 'Pyongyang', 'US']",4,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.4211508   0.14814678

The island is home to many strategic assets that can support South Korean and US forces in the event of a conflict breaking out on the Korean Peninsula.""Speculation of a launch taking place in the near future comes as North Korean experts have said Pyongyang will likely want to send a strong message to the next president,"" another military official, who declined to be identified, said. He added the North recently has carried out many of its provocations to coincide with key foreign events.Others said if the launch succeeds this time around, it will highlight Pyongyang's growing nuclear and long-range missile capability that will give it more leverage in potential future talks.Both the South Korean military and the US forces stationed on the Korean Peninsula said they are utilizing all available resources to keep close tabs on movement of missiles.The military said it had detected a Musudan missile near Kusong in North Pyongan Province. The region is where the North fired off a Musudan on Oct. 20.The North is known to have first fielded the IRBM in 2007, but it only test fired it for the first time on April 15 of this year.Since then, it has fired eight missiles with only one, which was launched on June 22, flying any distance. That missile flew about 400 km after reaching an altitude of 1,400 km.Besides the missile launch, military forces here are not ruling out other forms of provocations by the North, although it has thus detected nothing out of the ordinary along the heavily guarded inter-Korean border.There has even been speculation that the North may be preparing for another nuclear test, which could drastically escalate tensions.After detonating its first nuclear device in 2006, the North tested nukes in 2009 and 2013. For 2016, the North conducted two nuclear tests in January and September.","us presidential election military ,presidential election military ,us presidential election take ,presidential election military north ,the us presidential election","['North Korea', 'IRBM', 'US', 'Musudan', 'US']",4,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.65298152  0.19912933

It is the first time a General Assembly resolution has mentioned the North's labor exports, which has become an increasingly important source of hard currency for Pyongyang amid concern that the funds could be used for its nuclear and missile programs.About 50,000-60,000 North Koreans are believed to be toiling overseas, mainly in the mining, logging, textile and construction industries. The average wage was stated as $120 to $150 per month, but in most cases employing firms paid salaries directly to the North's government.The North reportedly receives more than $100 million from this system per year.As in the past, the new resolution also calls on the Security Council to ""take appropriate action to ensure accountability, including through consideration of referral of the situation"" to the ICC, and through ""consideration of the further development of sanctions in order to target effectively those who appear to be most responsible for human rights violations.""It also encourages the council to continue discussions on the issue.The 2014 General Assembly resolution is considered a watershed moment in international efforts to improve the North's human rights situation as it marked the first time for the Assembly to call for the North's referral to the ICC.That resolution led to the UN Security Council holding consultations on the issue for the first time later that year. In addition, a similar resolution was adopted last year and the Security Council also held discussions on the North's human rights situation for the second time.The consecutive adoption of such resolutions underscored the seriousness the international community attaches to the problem and is expected to increase pressure on Pyongyang. North Korea has long been labeled as one of the worst human rights violators. The communist regime does not tolerate dissent, holds hundreds of thousands of people in political prison camps and keeps tight control over outside information.But the North has bristled at such criticism, calling it a US-led attempt to topple its regime.","third consecutive year for ,text unveiled thursday passage ,third consecutive year ,text unveiled thursday ,unveiled thursday","['UN General Assembly', ""North Korea 's"", 'the International Criminal Court', 'Pyongyang', 'the Third Committee']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44022447  0.07460275

The statement, read by their representatives at a press conference in Seoul, said that the new Cabinet should be formed by a prime minister who can garner support from across the aisle and the public. It also urged political parties to come together to address the current paralysis of state affairs for the sake of the country and the people, and not to try to use the situation for their own interest. Among the 22 are former Prime Minister Chung Un-chan and five former National Assembly speakers: Park Gwan-yong, Lim Chae-jung, Chung Ui-hwa, Kim Won-ki and Kim Hyung-oh.Some of them expressed their opposition to President Park’s selection of a new Prime Minister -- Kim Byong-joon -- earlier in the day.“What we call for is a nonparty Cabinet that can win the support of both ruling and opposition parties, and the public. Replacing the prime minister and a couple of other ministers isn’t enough,” said Park Nam-soo, head of the United Religions Initiative of Korea and supreme leader of Chondogyo, a native Korean religion. Voices denouncing President Park are growing across academia, civil society, religion and other parts of society, with the latest poll showing her approval ratings dipping to an unprecedented below 10 percent range.

63,63,[Reporter‘s Column] A president in isolation,"Former Senior Presidential Secretary for Political Affairs Kim Jae-won may have had a point when he said that “the president is lonely and sad, please protect her” in his parting message, though his sympathetic tone was not echoed by the majority of the public.　Yes, President Park Geun-hye is most certain to be lonely as she finds herself isolated from the aggressive legislature, from the half-empty secretariat, f...","Former Senior Presidential Secretary for Political Affairs Kim Jae-won may have had a point when he said that “the president is lonely and sad, please protect her” in his parting message, though his sympathetic tone was not echoed by the majority of the public.Yes, President Park Geun-hye is most certain to be lonely as she finds herself isolated from the aggressive legislature, from the half-empty secretariat, from the soon-to-be overhauled Cabinet, from the furious public -- in short, from the nation which she is supposed to govern.But one would hardly think that her “sadness” is justified as it was brought on by her own inappropriate involvement with a corrupt shadow broker, dampening the spirits of even those most loyal to her.The distressed president on Tuesday made her first public appearance in five days with a meeting of the newly-appointed foreign ambassadors in Korea to receive their letters of credence.But apart from this diplomatic ceremony, most of the president’s pre-scheduled events have been called off since she hurriedly issued a very terse “apology” last Tuesday, admitting to her long-suspected ties with Choi Soon-sil.The only official actions taken by the feud-ridden state chief during those frantic days were to order her senior secretaries to submit their resignation en masse and to replace some of the most disputed members.Cheong Wa Dae attributed Park’s prolonged silence to her “prudent contemplation” on how to respond to the people’s call for reform, especially on how to restructure the Cabinet.Such pretext obviously did not have the intended effect, as Park’s approval rating has continued to plunge.The Blue House has so far feigned indifference to the plummeting polls, but now faced with the risk of an unprecedented single-digit popularity rating, the president should grasp the reality that “prudent contemplation” is not the answer to any of her pressing challenges.President Park’s approval rating stands at a record low of 10.4 percent, according to a survey released by local pollster Research View on Tuesday.As shocking as this figure may be, it is more surprising that Park’s longtime stronghold clusters -- elderly voters aged 60 or more and residents of the conservative-leaning Gyeongsang region -- have begun turning their back on her.Even the ruling conservative Saenuri Party is voicing complaints, some non-mainstream members going as far as demanding her resignation, just like the opposition parties.The president’s aides have often spoken of Park’s “dark period in life,” when she found herself “cut off from the rest of the world” upon the death of her father, the assassinated autocratic President Park Chung-hee.This traumatic experience was often used not only to stimulate nostalgia in elderly voters, but also to explain Park’s irrational attachment to the controversial aide Choi, as well as to her deceased father and cult leader Choi Tae-min.But this time, the “isolation” is real for the president who now has nowhere to turn to, in this nation in which she is still the nominal leader.By Bae Hyun-jung","the president is lonely ,president is lonely ,president is lonely and ,isolation former senior presidential ,column president in isolation","['Kim Jae - won', 'Park Geun']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.77095479  0.48076838

A whirlwind of events have taken place in the past few days: the return from overseas of Choi’s key men and herself on Sunday, the prosecution’s “search by voluntary cooperation” of Cheong Wa Dae and finally Choi’s appearance Monday at the prosecution some 32 hours after her arrival in Seoul. These may have been part of a “prearranged scenario” prepared by the shared inner circle of President Park Geun-hye and Choi, they claimed. “I believe that Park’s former Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon, Civil Affairs Secretary Woo Byung-woo and their team apparently put together by Choi have embarked on a covert operation to cover up their crimes,” said Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo of the second-largest opposition People’s Party. Kim served as the chief of the presidential secretariat from August 2013 to February 2015. Woo, a former state prosecutor, joined the secretariat in April 2014 until he was replaced Sunday by Choi Jai-kyeong, another prosecutorial figure said to have close ties to Kim. Both Kim and Woo are accused of condoning or even actively aiding Choi’s string-pulling behind the scenes by using her 40-year-long ties to President Park. “Under the direction of Woo, they are trying to cover this up and make it look like Choi’s personal failure that she went overboard to edit presidential speeches and conduct irregularities,” Rep. Park Jie-won of the People’s Party said. “They are now making up the story and destroying evidence,” he claimed. Fueling such suspicion was the prosecution, which waited 33 hours to call Choi -- the main suspect in its probe -- in for questioning. Choi arrived at Incheon Airport at 7:30 a.m. on Sunday and was summoned for questioning only at 3 p.m. on Monday. During this time, Choi could have consulted with others who are also facing questioning in the investigation to match their statements or destroy evidence, the opposition lawmakers said. “This is the biggest favor ever given by prosecutors to a suspect in this country,” Rep. Choo Mi-ae of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea said. The prosecutors said Monday that they secured seven boxes of documents from Cheong Wa Dae in their two-day raid, which was conducted without even entering the premise. Investigators, having been denied access to the offices of presidential aides, made requests for certain documents and Cheong Wa Dae provided them, they said.","politicians tuesday cried foul ,opposition politicians tuesday cried ,questioned opposition politicians tuesday ,tuesday cried foul over ,politicians tuesday cried",['Choi ’s'],4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35210529  0.56390506

Park, the daughter of military strongman Park Chung-hee, lost her mother in 1974 to a bullet meant for her father. Five years later, her father was assassinated by his intelligence chief.   It was not the first time she has been on the hot seat for her relationship with the Choi family.  Throughout her political career, she has constantly fought lurid rumors regarding her ties to Choi’s father -- Choi Tae-min, a pseudo-Christian cult leader, who, according to a 2007 US embassy cable revealed by WikiLeaks, was rumored to “have complete control over her body and soul.”South Korean President Park Geun-hye Whenever someone raised questions about the elder Choi, Park reacted angrily. During the primary presidential race in 2007, she famously said those who made up such rumors “should be punished by the divine law.” Now that the Chois have become the cause of her biggest political crisis, many people can’t help but wonder: Why did the president maintain her relations with the Chois for all those years? What made the president so reluctant to cut her ties? Various theories abound in political circles, among the public and even among psychologists. One of them is that the Chois may have been like a family for Park, who spent most of her private life by herself. She has never married and has no family of her own, having been estranged from her younger siblings. “Her brother and sister are not her family members -- the Chois are her real family,” said Jun Yeo-ok, a former lawmaker who served Park as a spokesperson until their relationship soured in 2007. “Average people would have abandoned such family, but she kept them in heart.” The other theory is the president has been “mystified” by the elder Choi and her belief in him is religious, and therefore beyond logic. “It has been like how sorcery works,” said Chung Doo-un, a former three-term lawmaker from the president’s own Saenuri Party. “For Park, the elder Choi has been someone like a demigod, and I assume it is the case until now. I don’t think there is another way to explain such a relationship but this.”According to a media report earlier in the week, Park Ji-man had described the president as acting strangely, as if she was “hypnotized,” whenever talking about Choi Soon-sil. The conservation was reportedly with former Cheong Wa Dae official Park Gwan-chun, one of the first among Park’s aides to expose the alleged influence-peddling of Choi to the public.Kim Tae-hyung, a psychologist who published his own analysis of President Park in 2015, said Park, who lost her parents when she was young, has a “commitment issue,” and the childhood trauma has prompted her to rely too much on the Chois. “Psychologically speaking, I think the president was held hostage by the Chois,” said Kim. “I don’t think the president has the ability to address the crisis. Since they cannot help now, I’m afraid she may undergo a mental breakdown.” In his previous book, the psychologist compared the president to ancient leaders who ascended to power despite their lack of interest in politics. He noted that unlike other political leaders and her predecessors, she appeared to be indifferent to expanding power by herself. “Most politicians have wanted to assert themselves,” wrote Kim. “But President Park seems to act the other way around -- since she entered politics she has highlighted the fact she is done with her role. I think her being elected as president is not something she wants, but her supporters wanted.”  By Yeo Jun-suk","her tragic family ,tragic family history park ,her tragic family history ,to her tragic family ,last week to apologize","['Park Geun', 'Choi', 'Park Chung - hee']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.12588345  0.22701077

Despite being an age-old tradition in many western countries, Halloween is a new phenomenon here. Once mainly been celebrated by party-loving youngsters and expats in Hongdae or Itaewon, it has more recently found a new audience -- kindergartens. “Traditional holidays in Korea are rather formal and rigid and may be a little heavy for children. Halloween parties can be a fun opportunity for kids to try out different costumes and culture,” Kwon Jeong-yun, a child education professor at Sungshin Women’s University in Seoul said in a phone interview. Halloween has its roots in Celtic Ireland during the celebration of seasonal change and harvest. The idea of donning a costume came about from the myth that during this time the worlds of the living and dead were at their closest and it was feared that ghosts would try to possess human bodies. In order to confuse the ghouls people would wear masks. While the myth behind it may have died, the idea of dressing up remains. Children dressed in Halloween costumes Halloween celebrations at kindergartens first started with English-immersive institutions, but more regular schools are now incorporating it into the yearly calendar, viewing it as a fun event that can introduce kids to another culture.Unfortunately, it seems that in Korea’s hyper-competitive society where devoted mothers can apparently do everything, Halloween parties can bring out rivalry. “Does this look ok? I bought a cheap wizard gown last year and my child did not stand out at all in the picture,” a mother posted in a local online mother’s community in Dongtan, Gyeonggi Province. Instead of it being a fun day for kids, mothers feel under pressure to buy expensive costumes, kindergarten teachers said. There have even been complaints by some mothers because they feel that their costume choice will reflect their financial status. The cost of a costume can vary from 10,000 won to over 100,000 won.For young parents, this new festival is greeted with interest and worry. Some think that just as Valentines’ Day here has become a big season for buying chocolate and candy, Halloween is driven mainly by marketing. “It is definitely not a Korean tradition at all. My daughter’s kindergarten held a Halloween party last year but some parents complained and now they don’t do it anymore,” said Shin Sae-young, a 38-year-old mother from Gwangju. “I also do not see the point of celebrating it. It is a trend created by companies.”Some kindergartens have moved to take the pressure off mothers by banning any preparation. “We told parents not to prepare makeup and clothes, because it is a burden on them. We will do face painting and provide costumes at the kindergarten,” said An Hae-jin, a teacher at an English hagwon in Cheonan, South Chungcheong Province.  Experts point out that the day is not just about costumes but is related to religion and culture. “It is important to properly explain and teach the background of the foreign tradition,” professor Kwon said.“It is, in part, an anti-religious event. In the US, schools give guidelines on the dress codes to prohibit offensive costumes and also gives the option either to send or not send the kids to school for Christian families. Such guidelines can be applied,” she said.

Other polls, released after the scandal broke Monday, all signaled a weakening of Park’s core support base -- namely in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province as well as the over-60 age group. A series of media reports have indicated that Choi -- who is also the daughter of Park’s late mentor Choi Tae-min -- received reports on presidential documents, including those containing top secret military and diplomatic information. The Realmeter survey also indicated that the public deemed Park’s apology Tuesday as insufficient. On how Park should “take responsibility” for the Choi fiasco, 42 percent of respondents called for Park to resign or be impeached, while 21.5 percent demanded a Cabinet and presidential staff reshuffle. This was followed by Park leaving the ruling Saenuri Party and a public apology, at 17.8 percent and 10.6 percent, respectively. The scandal saw even Park’s most loyal voter groups turning away from her. During the 2012 presidential election, over 80 percent of those who voted in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province picked Park as the next leader, but the weekly approval rating in the region also fell to reach an all-time low of 35.4 percent.The disapproval rating for the over-60 age group -- 54.9 percent -- surpassed the approval rating -- 42.7 percent -- for the first time. The same trend held true for the conservative group with approval and disapproval at 42.2 percent and 53 percent, respectively.Traditionally anti-Park liberals only showed 10.1 percent of approval for her, while 15.8 percent of nonpartisan respondents showed support.By Yoon Min-sik","park ratings plummet ,park ratings plummet to ,percent survey showed thursday ,ratings plummet to new ,ratings plummet","['Park Geun - hye', 'Choi Soon - sil']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51929671  0.48875314

President Park admitted to sharing her presidential speech scripts with Choi, who the president described as “someone who had helped” during Park’s presidential bid in 2012. She described her consultations with Choi as an act done “out of pure heart to be meticulous” in preparing her speeches. “There are so many things to be proved and such a short apology is insufficient,” said Minjoo spokesperson Rep. Lee Jae-jung. “It is nothing but the same tactics used by the president to avoid communicating with the public about serious cases.” While the ruling Saenuri Party offered “deep regret” over the scandal following the president’s apology, some moderate Saenuri members echoed the criticism that Park’s explanation was not enough to prove her innocence. Rep. Choo Mi-ae, chairwoman of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea, holds a press conference at the National Assembly in Seoul on Tuesday. “I believe that she has offered zero explanation about wrongdoings,” said former Saenuri floor leader Rep. Yoo Seung-min, who had clashed with the president over her welfare policies. “I don’t think the president’s apology is enough to wrap up the scandal. More investigation is needed.” The political parties demanded prompt investigation into the allegation -- raised by cable TV channel JTBC on Monday -- that Cheong Wa Dae had leaked confidential presidential speeches to Choi, who was also allegedly involved in abusing her power to fund dubious government entities by raising money from conglomerates Opposition parties’ presidential hopefuls, Moon Jae-in of the Minjoo Party and Ahn Cheol-soo of the People’s Party, adopted a more assertive tone. While Moon denounced the scandal for disrupting the national system, Ahn demanded the president herself face investigation and her Cabinet members resign en mass. The pressure on the president is expected to derail Park’s efforts to amend the current Constitution that she described as currently “unfit” for South Korea. The revision requires approval by two-thirds of the 300-member National Assembly and majority support in a referendum. “If the allegations are true, President Park should come forward and explain herself,” said Saenuri floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk. “We need to find out how Choi Soon-sil has been abusing her power to misguide this country.” Saenuri also appeared in disarray over the proposed Constitutional amendment. Though the party began working-level discussions over Constitutional amendment Tuesday, its leadership struggled to bring focus to revision of the basic law. Some Saenuri lawmakers, most of whom belong to the group outside the faction close to President Park, urged the government to name special prosecutors to investigate Choi, whose whereabouts are still unknown since she allegedly moved to Germany.But some members from the pro-Park faction, such as Saenuri leader Rep. Lee Jun-hyun, appeared to defend the president by saying, “I have also relied on my friends’ help when writing speeches.” Lee served as Park’s senior presidential secretary between 2012 and 2013.While ratcheting up their attacks against the president over the scandal, the opposition parties vowed to block the president’s attempt to amend the Constitution and denounced the move as an attempt to divert the public’s attention. “It is an attempt to cover up the snowballing scandal,” said Minjoo leader Rep. Choo Mi-ae during the party’s emergency meeting Tuesday “I don’t think there is anyone in this country who wants to trust such a president with revising the basic law.” By Yeo Jun-suk","park apology insufficient president ,apology insufficient president ,apology insufficient president park ,insufficient saying the president ,liberal foes on tuesday","['Park Geun', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'People ’s Party']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42044762  0.45037642

The budget review kicks off this week with President Park Geun-hye addressing the Assembly on Monday and the lawmakers inquiring Prime Minister and Finance Minister later in the week. Parliamentary committees, meanwhile, are to begin their month-long review session on Tuesday. Minjoo Party’s chief policy strategist Rep. Yoon Ho-jung  on Sunday explains the party‘s plan to review 2017 budget. But the prospect of passing the bill by Dec. 2, a legal deadline set by a parliamentary law otherwise known as “National Assembly Advancement Act,” remains grim as the opposition-dominated legislature poses challenges upon government-proposed budget bills.“Neither the ruling party nor opposition bloc can seize a sweeping victory during the budget battle,” said Rep. Kim Hyun-mee, lawmaker of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea and chairperson of the Assembly’s Special Committee on Budget and Accounts.Over the past two years, yearly budget bills have cleared the Assembly before the deadline as the Saenuri, based on the advancement law, put the bill to a plenary floor vote, even without opposition approval. Now holding 129 out of the 300 parliamentary seats, the ruling party is no longer capable of meeting the required three-fifths quorum.At the core of the budget battle is the debate on whether to raise the corporate tax rate. Since the previous Lee Myung-bak administration lowered the tax rate from 25 to 22 percent in 2009, opposition lawmakers have been working to bring the rate back to its previous level of 25 percent. It is the claim of the Minjoo and People’s Party that the 2009 tax cut had offered benefits only to a limited number of top-tier conglomerates, not to the nation‘s economy in general. They also argued that more taxes are needed to implement the pending state-led welfare policies. But Saenuri lawmakers and some business groups countered that the tax hike would hamper the government’s effort to jumpstart the nation’s faltering businesses, describing that the measure is “global trend” shared by advanced economies aiming to boost their economies. The escalating tax battle is expected to depend upon the position taken by the Assembly Speaker Rep. Chung Sye-kyun. The top legislator has an authority to designate the auxiliary bills to the state budget bill.“Given that corporate tax plays an important part in tax system, I believe that it is eligible as an auxiliary bill,” Chung told reporters last week, alluding his approval for the move.Should the former Minjoo lawmaker maintain his view, the motion to reinstate the former corporate tax rate may directly be put to a full floor vote, without committee-level reviews.Chung had clashed with Saenuri lawmaker over his decision to allow the passage of a motion asking for the dismissal of Agriculture Minister Kim Jae-soo over ethical lapses. Angered by the move, Saenuri leadership boycotted the state audit for days, calling for Chung’s resignation.By Yeo Jun-suk","budget battle looms over ,next year government budget ,this week with president ,monday and the lawmakers ,the budget review kicks","['the National Assembly', 'Park Geun', 'Assembly']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44760373  0.3916094

You know how you try to hold it in, but sometimes feel like you’ve had enough and are about to explode? I felt I would explode someday, which is why I came here,” he said.Having joined the Army in 1987 right out of high school, Yeom said he was under a lot of stress as a sergeant major, caught between conscripted soldiers and ranking officers. In 2014, he ended 27 years of service in the military and retired to a tiny rural town in Myeongji-ri, Gangwon Province, where he would lead a quiet, stress-free life, far removed from the social hierarchy and peer competition of his previous life. Yeom joined an increasing number of city dwellers trading urban life for the countryside. The fad is called “gwinong” here, which roughly translates to “return to agriculture.”According to the state-run information center on gwinong , there are currently 11,959 households in the countryside made up of families who moved from cities. About 18.6 percent dwell in North Gyeongsang Province, followed by South Jeolla and South Gyeongsang provinces at 15.6 percent and 13.5 percent, respectively.But rural life is no picnic, the third-year farmer pointed out.“If you decide  in a certain area, you need all the information you can get. In the past, people didn’t need a lot of money to start farming. But this is not the case, now,” he said. He moved to the rural home with 200 million won . Most of the money went to buying his humble plot of 3,322 square meters and building a house. His military pension helped him get through the next couple of years, when he lacked immediate income.“Farming in the fields hardly pays enough to make a living when you are an amateur,” he said, revealing his total net income from vegetable farming last year was about 2 million won.  Yeom also grows vegetable at his farm in Myeongji-ri, Gangwon Province. This year, he is trying new things, including growing oyster mushrooms indoors. He found that for an amateur farmer like him, the controlled environment of the greenhouse is much better, enabling him to make more money with less effort.“For the first year here, my goal was to make 10 million won in farming. It looks like this year I will be able to exceed that goal by 2 million,” Yeom said. He plans to build another greenhouse for the mushrooms on spare land, which is expected to triple the profit.Still, it will hardly be a bonanza, but Yeom says money is not the main issue when the quality of life is satisfying. “I can work when I want, sleep when I want. We have a beach and a valley just a few minutes away,” he said. Also sitting just a stone’s throw away from his home is Seoraksan, the province’s most popular tourist attraction.The neighborhood of Myeongji-ri is another reason he feels life is more fulfilling here. In cities, people rarely interact with neighbors, but that is not the case in rural communities, he said. “We help each other out when there’s some work to be done. When you first move, it definitely helps to participate whenever there’s a town event, because it helps them get a good impression of you,” he said.Rural life, however, is not for everyone, he pointed out. Sometimes the inconvenience and hardship can be too much, which is why he recommends potential movers to get some real experience before actually making the move.On Wednesday, he had two guests from cities who are looking to move to the countryside. They came to see what it was like to live there. One of them said he used to run a Japanese restaurant and made up to 200 million won a month. Another was a 33-year-old man who was quickly growing weary of city life.“A part of me thought that 33 was too early. But then again, maybe starting early is a good thing because it would help him get settled early,” Yeom said.With growing interest in rural life among Koreans, there has also been an increasing number of swindlers targeting them.Last week, police busted a crime ring that swindled 12.4 billion won from 1,300 people by luring them with high profits.“Farming is not something you make a ton of money with. Don’t expect a jackpot when you come here. And when you decide on what you want to do, stick to it.“And finally, get all the information and experience you can. Even if you don’t end up cultivating that specific crop, you can at least learn a thing or two,” said Yeom. By Yoon Min-sik /","dream now mushroom farmer ,mushroom farmer ,now mushroom farmer the ,explains greenhouse mushroom farming ,mushroom farmer the former","['Yeom Deok - gi', 'South Korea ’s', 'Yeom', 'Yoon Min - sik', 'the Korea Herald)“It ’s']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50472116  0.47942784

Park's approval rating fell to a record low of 26 percent in a survey released Friday by the local pollster Gallup Korea.Park first met with officials and employees at an industrial-academic convergence district within the Gumi National Industrial Complex, located 261 kilometers southeast of Seoul, to offer her encouragement. In particular, she visited KAIDEA, a 3-D printer developer, and VM e-Korea, an electric bicycle manufacturer, in the district.Formed in 2014, the district is now home to some 50 research institutes and four universities, and has emerged as a key model for industrial-academic collaboration, which the Park government has been pushing to expand to help create jobs, find new growth engines and revitalize the economy.Over the last three years, some 19 industrial-academic collaborative projects have been carried out in the sprawling district with scores of students having participated in these projects. Of these students, some 77 have landed jobs within the Gumi industrial complex.The president, then, toured the smart factory of Mooryong Co., a high-tech firm specializing in the surface treatment of auto parts and mobile phones cases.Her government, in cooperation with local businesses, has been striving to introduce automated smart factories to enhance the quality of products, cut production costs, and streamline and speed up the manufacturing process.Mooryong is one of the leading companies in the introduction of smart factories. It has invested 14.1 billion won  over the last six years to refurbish its manufacturing facilities and make them fully automated.In Gumi, Park also attended the ground-breaking ceremony for a factory of Toray Advanced Materials Korea Inc., an affiliate of Japan's Toray Industries Inc., which specializes in the production of chemical materials.During the ceremony, Park stressed the importance of developing the materials industry to respond more actively to the fourth industrial revolution -- the fast-paced transformation linked to the fusion of various cutting-edge technologies such as big data and artificial intelligence.The ceremony was attended by some 500 people, including Akihiro Nikkaku, the president of the Japanese firm, workers and top officials from the local governments of North Gyeongsang Province and Gumi City. Toray currently runs a dozen factories in South Korea, and has invested 3.7 trillion won into the Asian country. After the groundbreaking ceremony, Park visited a traditional market in the city to meet with vendors and citizens.There, she expressed her goal of increasing support for traditional markets whose sales have been waning in the face of large-scale discount stores.","wednesday in her latest ,local pollster gallup korea ,economy her provincial tour ,of gumi on wednesday ,her latest move","['Park Geun', 'Gumi', 'Gumi', 'Park', 'Gallup Korea']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56218606  0.6617071

Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and Defense Minister Han Min-koo will join US Secretary of State John Kerry and Defense Secretary Ash Carter in Wednesday's ""two plus two"" talks, a biennial gathering designed mainly to demonstrate the firmness of the alliance and discuss strategies to deal with the North.The meeting comes just a few days after the communist nation carried out a banned test Saturday of a Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missile, believed to be capable of reaching the US territory of Guam, about a month after its fifth nuclear test.The test was unsuccessful as the missile exploded shortly after take-off, but the launch still showed how committed the North is to developing nuclear-armed, long-range missiles. Officials and experts have warned Pyongyang could keep conducting nuclear and missile tests in coming months.Wednesday's talks are expected to focus on ways to strengthen the US ""extended deterrence"" protection of South Korea and to ramp up pressure and sanctions on Pyongyang, including through a strong new U.N. Security Council sanctions resolution and unilateral sanctions of their own.""Extended deterrence"" refers to the threat of nuclear retaliation to deter attacks on allies. The US has provided extended deterrence or a ""nuclear umbrella"" to South Korea after withdrawing nuclear warheads from the country in the early 1990s.""We will discuss comprehensive strategies to deal with North Korean threats. In particular, we're going to have in-depth discussions on ways to specify and institutionalize extended deterrence, which is a key element in the US security commitment to South Korea,"" Yun told reporters during a joint visit with Han to the Korean War Veterans Memorial in Washington.Yun also said the two sides will discuss ways to maximize effects of sanctions on the North.On Thursday, the two sides are scheduled to hold annual defense ministers talks, known as the Security Consultative Meeting , where Han and Carter are expected to discuss detailed ""extended deterrence"" measures, possibly including permanently deploying US ""strategic assets"" in the South, such as nuclear-capable B-52 and B-1B bombers, F-22 stealth fighter jets and nuclear-powered submarines.""In the SCM talks, we will jointly assess North Korea's threats and the situation in the North ... and discuss ways to guarantee the implementation of extended deterrence, including the US nuclear umbrella, so as to cope with North Korea's nuclear and missile threats,"" Han told reporters during the visit to the war memorial.The US has temporarily sent such strategic assets to South Korea as a show of force in the wake of the North's two nuclear tests in January and September, but perceptions have grown among South Koreans that such one-off missions are not enough at a time of unprecedented threats from the North.Permanent deployment of such military hardware is expected to reassure South Koreans of the US defense commitment amid heightened security jitters that sparked calls for developing the country's own nuclear weapons or bringing US nuclear bombs back into the country. Such sophisticated weapons would also serve as a strong warning against the North.In the SCM talks, the two sides are also expected to check on progress in efforts to deploy the US THAAD missile defense system in the South, while reaffirming that the deployment is aimed only at defending against North Korean threats and poses no threats to China and other countries.","in washington on tuesday ,ministers arrive in washington ,on tuesday for security ,washington on tuesday for ,tuesday for security","[""South Korea 's"", 'Washington', 'US', 'North Korea', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Defense', 'Han Min - koo', 'US', 'State', 'John Kerry', 'Defense', 'Ash Carter']",4,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.48792905  0.2686823

The 47-year-old special education teacher, wife, mother of three children and dog owner no longer wanted to spend much time on cleaning, washing dishes and an endless list of household chores after returning home from work. What first caught her eye was a pile of clothes that she had not been wearing for years. Then she moved on to flowerpots and a fishbowl, which she had wanted at the time of purchase but at some point turned into nuisances. And so it began. It was September 2014. Two years later, tens of thousands of South Koreans have joined the movement and started decluttering their houses, living the so-called minimalist lifestyle. Hwang is now the manager of an online community with over 45,000 registered users sharing their minimalist experiences, as well as the author of a book on living a minimal life here.  This photo provided by 47-year-old special education teacher Hwang Yun-jeong on Oct. 3, 2016, shows her dresser at her house in Hanam, southeast of Seoul, almost empty. ""If you start decluttering, you will be surprised how we live surrounded by stuff we don't even use,"" Hwang said in a recent interview with Yonhap News Agency. ""And just by getting rid of them, you can focus more on things you care about."" Hwang's book, published last month, is one of the first books on living a minimalist life written by a Korean author amid a number of others from Japan and western countries. Though many people think the trend here originated from its neighboring country Japan, Kim Min-hye at Ntree, who was in charge of publishing the book, said the drive seems quite different. ""Japan traditionally has a culture of living in very small houses, which led its people to minimize everything,"" Kim said. ""The recent series of quakes that struck the island country also contributed to the boom in Japan as people found that a lot of furniture can easily turn into deadly weapons in case of an earthquake."" In South Korea, which remains relatively safe from such natural disasters, it is more of the change in family type and perception of consumption that induces many people to live in a minimalist way, according to experts. The surge especially comes along with the rising number of working women in the country.  This photo provided by Tak Jin-hyun, who operates an online website on living a minimalist life, on Oct. 4, 2016, shows her room. She said all her possessions can be packed in the black traveling bag shown in this photo. Just like Hwang, 24-year-old social worker Kim Bo-min started emptying her house when she realized that neither of her working parents nor she had energy left to do chores after work. ""My mom was often irritated by looking at all the things she had to do after long working hours,"" she said. ""Now that the house is always clean, there is really not much to do for all of us."" According to the data by Statistics Korea, some 5.2 million households had both husband and wife working, accounting for 43.9 percent of all South Korean married couple households, as of October last year. Professor Kim Yun-tae at Seoul's Korea University, meanwhile, said the phenomenon cannot be explained without understanding the change in people's perception of excessive consumption. ""Everyone would have their own motivations for why they chose to live with less stuff, but it basically seems like an effort to find an alternative to the current excessive and conspicuous consumption trend,"" professor Kim said. ""It is quite natural that the minimalist lifestyle surfaced as a reaction in a society where people endlessly consume and brag about their consumption."" Professor Lee Seung-sin at Seoul's Konkuk University said the new trend of living with less is also related to the development of the idea of responsible consumption. ""Many people start living the minimalist life, overwhelmed by all those things, or because they are too busy to handle them but in the end, they pay more attention to what they buy and what kind of impact it has on our society,"" she said. The 47-year-old Hwang now has a ""no shopping"" project. The only thing she has bought for the last 10 months -- except for groceries and other daily necessities -- is a pair of shoes, she said. ""I felt sort of guilty to face the amount of trash I have created while decluttering,"" Hwang said. In the beginning, living a minimalist life was more related to a simple and tidy interior that reminded her of northern European design, but now, the focus has clearly shifted to the environmental and social impact of buying and throwing things away. The members of the minimalist online community actually share information on where and how they can donate things they do not use anymore. According to the non-governmental Beautiful Store Foundation, the number of contributed items have been constantly increasing from some 10 million in 2014 to over 12 million last year. The number reached 11.9 million as of early October this year. ""We see the increase as an indication of more people embracing the idea of recycling and donation,"" activist Jo Sang-eui said. ""The recent trend of the minimalist lifestyle seems to have had an influence on that as well."" Still, many, even the minimalists themselves, remain skeptical that this trend would become mainstream. ""Right after this whole living simple thing became all the rage, household goods companies used it as a marketing point, telling people to throw away stuff and buy new ones: their products,"" Hwang said. ""We are living in a capitalist society after all,"" she added. ""I am not saying that we shouldn't buy anything. I just hope the increase in the number of consumers who want to act responsibly to change society in a better way, someday.""","education teacher wife mother ,special education teacher wife ,returning home from work ,teacher wife mother ,education teacher wife",['Hwang Yun - jeong'],4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67850929  0.05356403

The convicted woman, surnamed Kim, had attempted to die with a man she came to know through an online community on suicide. She survived the attempt alone, and was put on trial.Kim, 21, had asked for a jury trial, whereupon the jury of seven unanimously declared her guilty. The court sentenced Kim to six months in prison with a two-year probation period. The court said Kim suffered manic depression at the time of her suicide attempt, but she was capable of making life-changing decisions for the man.Kim, who first met the man in December 2015, found a deserted house in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province, where they took sleeping pills together and lit briquettes in an enclosed space for death by carbon monoxide poisoning.Kim, however, woke up and escaped, leaving the man to die.The court said it considered Kim’s psychological and physical conditions in determining her punishment.

From an architect to a housewife and retiree, the group was composed of people from different walks of life, but their mission for the day was the same: discover the hidden charm of a town called Seochon. “Many may consider Seochon as an area that has recently gained popularity among foreign tourists, but Seochon has numerous historical sites that boast rich traditional value as well as an artistic atmosphere,” said Youn Sung-gi, the guide. Meaning “west town” in Korean, Seochon is located to the east of Inwangsan and the west of Gyeongbokbung. In the early Joseon era, the area was famous for its serene natural beauty, which attracted flocks of artists and poets, said 68-year-old Youn, who has given tours in Seochon for over a decade. Sunday’s tour was part of a Seoul Metropolitan Government program launched in August to offer its citizens a chance to uncover public art in their neighborhoods.  Participants for “Art on Seoul’s streets found by citizens” listen to alley tour guide’s explanation during Seochon alley tour in Seoul on Sunday. Kim Da-sol/The Korea HeraldUnder the “Art on Seoul’s streets found by citizens” project, participants find and promote lesser-known public art and landmarks in groups of 10, joined by field experts and art connoisseurs.Once a week, each team goes out to the corners of Seoul to excavate relatively unpopular or undiscovered artworks, take photos and write logs on how to continue to excavate to promote these hidden spots, as well as how to preserve it for the next generation.The day began cold but warmed up slightly in the afternoon, as members moved through more than 20 spots in alleys and boulevards of Seochon leading to the front gate of Cheong Wa Dae, the presidential office. The tour stopped by sites like Artspace Boan 1942, located in Tongyi-dong, which used to be the Boan Inn where painter Lee Jung-seob and poet Seo Jeong-ju hid out during the Japanese colonization period. “I have lived in Seoul my entire life, but never knew that there were historical places on the streets that we pass by every day. I love how I can now realize the hidden beauty of Seoul through this program,” said Jung Tae-young, 61, the eldest in the group.Kwon Yun-hee, 38, an artist manager at Artist Pension Trust who joined the tour as a leading field expert, stressed the importance of constantly searching and unearthing public art for citizens’ interest.“Like how we toured and found today, there are so many traces of art and history left undiscovered on the streets, alleys and corners of buildings in Seoul. I hope more kinds of municipal citizen programs are introduced to arouse citizens’ excitement and interest in Seoul’s hidden beauty,” said Kwon.

Support among Trump backers was even higher at 72 percent, according to the poll.""Donald Trump has repeatedly included South Korea in a group of what he considers free-riding allies, unwilling to contribute more to their own defense. That criticism, however, has done little to dampen Americans' support for the US-Korea alliance,"" the council said in a report.Support for keeping troops in South Korea was higher than in the cases for other allies. Only 46 percent of the respondents were in favor of having a presence in Australia, 61 percent in Germany and 60 percent in Japan, according to the survey.By party, 76 percent of Republicans, 70 percent of Democrats and 64 percent of independents expressed support for troop presence in the South, the council said, adding that one reason for the increased support is the ""growing perception of North Korea as a critical threat to the US""The survey was conducted from June 10-27, and had margins of error of plus or minus 2.2-3.5 percentage points.About 28,500 American troops are stationed in South Korea to help deter North Korea. Seoul pays about half the costs, about $900 million a year, to help finance the troop presence, and US officials, including Gen. Brooks, said it would cost more to keep those troops stationed in the US than it does in Korea.But Trump has long expressed deeply negative views of such security commitments, seeing them as a cumbersome burden sucking up taxpayer dollars. The real-estate tycoon has claimed that allies should pay more, or the US should be prepared to end their protection. ""While the American public at large may not be aware of the details of these contributions , three quarters  of Americans say that US relations with South Korea are either staying about the same  or improving ,"" the council said.The survey also showed that 60 percent think the North's nuclear program is a critical threat to the US, up 5 percentage points from last year. The North represented the third-highest threat after international terrorism  and the possibility of unfriendly countries becoming a nuclear power .Among those who cite the North's nuclear program as a threat, 75 percent support long-term bases in the South. As to how to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, 81 percent expressed support for continuing diplomatic efforts to get the North to suspend its nuclear program. Eighty percent also support imposing sanctions and 53 percent support conducting cyberattacks on the communist nation, the survey showed.Military action remains less favored, with 35 percent supporting airstrikes against the North's nuclear facilities and only 25 percent supporting sending American troops to destroy those facilities, it showed.The North was also the least favored country.On a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 representing the highest possible favorability, the North had 19 points, being the only country among a dozen nations listed in the poll to fall below 20. The second-least favored nation was Iran with 26 points. In contrast, the favorability of South Korea remains at its highest recorded value at 55 points.","10 americans support the ,annual survey released thursday ,don buy donald trump ,korea up from last ,of 10 americans support","['Americans', 'US', 'South Korea', ""Donald Trump 's"", 'US', 'asian', 'the Chicago Council on Global Affairs', 'South Korea']",4,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.17903127  0.43661594

Moon is seeking to break away from his image as an idealistic progressive icon to gain an upper hand on economic policy, traditionally seen as a strong suit for the conservatives.Moon Jae-in, former chairman of the opposition Minjoo Party, steps out of a restaurant after lunch during a visit to Daegu on Sept. 28. YonhapHe plans to begin by leading the foundation of a private think tank, which is expected to later become an election campaign strategy team.The think tank, tentatively titled “People’s Growth,” will hold a pre-foundation symposium at the Korea Press Center in central Seoul on Thursday, according to Minjoo Party Rep. Kim Kyoung-soo, a close aide to Moon. The official launch of the organization is scheduled to take place as early as this month.“People’s Growth consists of voluntary participants, most of them experts in political and economic fields who agree with Moon’s vision,” Kim said Wednesday.“Our initial goal is to develop the think tank into a valid alternative policy group by the end of the year, increasing the advisers’ pool from the current 500 to some 1,000.”The core concept of the incoming think tank is a strong focus on down-to-earth economic issues and engagement with the centrist-conservative section of the public, according to Kim.In his keynote speech for Thursday’s symposium, Moon is expected to provide a renewed strategy as a presidential hopeful, underlining his economic growth plans.Cho Yoon-je, a professor at Sogang University and economic adviser to former President Roh Moo-hyun, is to be the think tank’s director, while former Deputy Prime Minister Han Wan-sang will serve as senior adviser. The listed professors are to be assigned to one of the seven sectors -- foreign and security policy, economy, information technology, industry, labor, welfare and regional autonomy.“In this era of low growth, it is no longer significant to distinguish between conservative and progressive, or growth and distribution,” said Kim Hyun-chul, professor at Seoul National University’s graduate school of international studies.“I agreed with Moon in that a new policy frame was needed to promote growth and distribution simultaneously.”Professor Kim, who has for long kept a distance from the progressive political camp, is to make a presentation during the symposium on how South Korea should gear up for a growth-driven economic initiative.The term “People’s Growth,” he added, was an attempt to break free from the conventional prejudice that growth is a conservative agenda and distribution a progressive one.The economy-driven centrist agenda may, however, evoke unease among progressive supporters, some admitted.“We are aware that some of the progressive supporters may feel uncomfortable with the name  or the slogan it carries,” said Cho Dae-yeop, director of Korea University’s graduate school of labor studies and vice director of the think tank.“But people need to understand that our definition of growth is not just an increase in the nation’s economic indexes or the growth of companies, but the kind that actually helps people earn money and improve their livelihoods.”Criticism of the incumbent Park Geun-hye administration’s “unsuccessful” economic policies also pushed a number of scholars to join in Moon’s initiative, he added.By launching “People’s Growth,” Moon is to become the first among top-ranking presidential potentials to affirm his bid in next year’s race.His aggressive turn is seen as reflecting the lesson he learned from the 2012 presidential election, in which he lost to conservative rival Park -- a result which many attributed to Moon’s limited political pool and neglect of economic issues.The opposition politician is also facing a potential challenge from United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who is expected to enter domestic politics once he steps down from his current post at the end of the year.According to a survey conducted by local pollster Realmeter on 2,525 voters nationwide in the last week of September, Ban outran Moon in approval ratings outside the margin of error. The UN official received 26.8 percent of respondents’ support, while Moon stood at 18.8 percent.Meanwhile, the Minjoo Party also launched a set of policy task forces to address progressive issues such as welfare, in a move to rally progressive voters and to back Moon‘s moves. In the last presidential election, the opposition camp lost momentum in the welfare sector as the ruling conservative Saenuri Party had fielded the slogan of “economic democratization,” in an appealing gesture toward the political center.By Bae Hyun-jung","2017 presidential election moon ,election moon is seeking ,2017 presidential race ,of 2017 presidential race ,2017 presidential race the","['the Minjoo Party', 'Korea ’s', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Moon Jae - in']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5160411  -0.16764209

China is North Korea's ally and economic benefactor.North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho had appealed for help during his closed-door meetings with UN officials when he visited New York for a General Assembly meeting last month, according to a report by US-based media Radio Free Asia.South Korea earlier said that it will not provide aids to North Korea over the flooding amid heightened tensions following Pyongyang's nuclear test in early September.On Sept. 9, North Korea conducted its fifth and most powerful nuclear test to date, eight months after its fourth. The test was conducted days after heavy rains pummeled the northeastern region.Seoul condemned North Korea for pouring money into its nuclear program while neglecting the suffering of its people in the flood-hit areas.","after the latest floods ,aid after massive floods ,latest floods that struck ,after massive floods ,after massive floods two","['United Nations', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs', ""the UN International Children 's Emergency Fund"", 'North Korea']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54762203  0.21125741

Bae added that complicated math problems in text books compel students to seek cram schools.Such a situation carries over into middle school and even during their free-semesters which were introduced in full-scale starting this year.South Korea first introduced the pilot program in 2013 to provide middle school students with chances to experience a wide range of learning activities for their future careers.Under the program, schools shift the focus away from test scores and teach students through such diverse engaging methods as discussion, experiments, outdoor activities and team projects.Bae pointed out that complicated math questions cannot help students develop their capabilities.","math textbooks too complicated ,complicated for students lawmaker ,wednesday existing math textbooks ,math is complicated when ,textbooks too complicated for","['South Koreans', 'Bae Duk - kwang', 'Saenuri']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53793317  0.35612282

Victor Cha, former director for Asian Affairs in the White House’s National Security Council and currently senior adviser to the US-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote in a CSIS study he co-authored with other experts that a major nuclear or missile test “would be a way  of trying to intimidate the incoming president.”“North Korea chooses particular windows that they know will gain maximum attention from the world, and the US in particular. ... It could be a sixth nuclear test, it could be launching of their rocket which put a satellite in orbit,” Cha was quoted as saying to the CNN.Pyongyang has been upping efforts to complete its nuclear strike capacity under its leader Kim Jong-un, and conducted two nuclear tests this year in an unprecedented pace. The UN Security Council resolution bans the communist state of any nuclear or ballistic missile programs.North Korea has had a history of marking its ceremonious occasions or prominent incidents from elsewhere in the world with shows of force.On Sept. 9, Pyongyang conducted its fifth nuclear test to coincide with the 68th anniversary of its governmental foundation day. It was the first time that two tests in one year were conducted since the hermit kingdom carried out its first nuclear test in October of 2006.Rodong Sinmun, the daily newspaper of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party of Korea, bashed South Korean President Park Geun-hye with its usual harsh tone, saying her administration had driven inter-Korea relations to an “unclimbable depth.” It blamed Park for the current inter-Korea tensions while claiming the UN had become a puppet to defend interests of member states.The words came after Park on Saturday urged North Koreans to defect to South.Seoul’s Unification Ministry expressed strong regrets on Pyongyang’s rhetoric. It also reaffirmed the government’s stance it has no plans to provide relief for the people of North Korea, who were hit hard by flooding recently.Local observers have been anticipating the North to conduct some sort of armed protest, particularly since it revealed a new rocket engine last month that is believed to have stronger thrust capacity than its existing rocket engines.The communist country have been seeking to acquire nuclear strike capacity that can reach the US mainland. Its biggest functional weapon, as of now, is believed to be the intermediate-range Musudan, with range over 3,000 kilometers.Kim Dong-yup, a professor at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies at Kyungnam University, said the North may attempt to use the new engine a as means to threaten the new US leadership. He, however, said that using the engine may take place next year, after the new administration has taken office.In light of the growing threats from the North, the South Korean military is seeking to complete its three-legged “3K” defense system of missile defense, pre-emptive strike and massive retaliation.The Kill Chain centers on striking North Korean missiles before they are fired, the Korea Air and Missile Defense system is on intercepting the missiles in the air, while the Korea Massive Punishment and Retaliation is about wiping out the North Korean leadership upon attack.The newly applied operation plan 5015 of the Seoul-Washington alliance reportedly has boosted plans for pre-emptive strikes on Pyongyang, stepping up vigilance against the threats from the northern neighbor.But all three defense systems are expected to be completed in the 2020s at earliest, and some are questioning whether they will be effective as the military boasts.Rep. Kim Jong-dae of the minor opposition Justice Party said Tuesday that 80 percent of the military’s 9 trillion won  budget for Kill Chain is being used on ballistic and cruise missiles that purportedly are not very effective in striking missile facilities like transporter erector launchers or underground tunnels.“The ballistic and cruise missiles are effective against fixed targets, but is ineffective against portable launchers or underground facilities. Our  missiles require a pre-entered coordinate, which limits its use against moving launchers,” Kim pointed out in his press release. He also said that the Seoul-Washington agreement on missiles restricts the payload of Korean missiles to an 800-kilometer range and 500 kilograms, which would make it difficult to destroy underground facilities.

Seoul has cut off all inter-Korean economic ties that have been cited for bankrolling the North's weapons of mass destruction program.The reclusive country's main daily, the Rodong Sinmun, said in an article last week that the plan by President Park and her supporters to retain power is in itself an affront and shameless act, and will be opposed by ordinary South Koreans.The paper, an organ of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea , said ever since Park took power in 2013, her government has sided against the Korean people and has ruled the country with an authoritarian hand. It then went on to claim that Park and her followers have a confrontational policy toward the DPRK that has caused inter-Korean relations to deteriorate to their worst levels in recent times.The DPRK is the acronym of North Korea's full name: the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.""The incumbent conservatives should not think of trying to hold on to power but leave politics altogether, which is the wish of the people,"" the paper argued.The WPK mouthpiece in addition urged various elements in South Korean society to rise up, and send Park and her followers to their graves, clearly trying to stoke internal strife within the country.The same paper said in a separate report said that people in the South have given up hope on Park and her supporters, and know that if they hold onto power by winning next year's presidential election, a great tragedy will befall them.Echoing this view, Uriminzokkiri, Pyongyang's main Internet-based media and propaganda website, said in a piece released Tuesday that the South Korea's ruling Saenuri Party is already contemplating who will become the new prime minister under the newly elected government, as well as who will become party chief. It warned that if Saenuri again wins the presidency it will be a catastrophe for the Korean people as a whole.In particular, Radio Pyongyang even lashed out at United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who is widely viewed as running in the race as a conservative party standard bearer, by claiming he has no real support base and is politically incompetent. ""Ban knows very little about the challenges facing South Korea,"" the broadcaster claimed.Ban, whose second five-year term at the helm of the global body, ends this year said he will return home early next year and said he will think of ways to serve his country. He has never said he will or will not run for president. His approval rating among potential runners has consistently been high, exceeding those of potential candidates from the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea like Moon Jae-in and Ahn Cheol-soo from the smaller People's Party.Local experts, meanwhile, said the North's moves to influence South Korea's parliamentary and presidential elections is nothing new. ""The more the North tries to impact South Korean elections and take sides, the opposite results generally occur,"" said Yang Moo-jin, a political science professor at Seoul's University of North Korean Studies. He said the fact that it is trying again may indicate that there is a loyalty race within the leadership's inner circle to look good to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.Other scholars said that the North traditionally seems to favor the South Korean liberal camp, which has been more dovish, and wants to maintain good relations with the North.","presidential race by blasting ,korea 2017 presidential race ,presidential race north korea ,in korea presidential race ,korea presidential race north","['North Korea', ""South Korea 's"", 'Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'inter - korean']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47019494  0.0672826

He was taken to a hospital, but never regained consciousness until his death Sunday. Activists call for measure against former National Police Agency chief Kang Sin-myeong at a press conference held in Seoul on Friday. Authorities in charge have so far denied responsibility, and the court has issued a warrant to conduct an autopsy on Baek earlier this week. His family members and civic activists as well as a number of opinion leaders oppose the police move.The compensation suit seeks approximately 240 million won in compensation.Lawyers for a Democratic Society, also known as Minbyun, which has taken the case on behalf of Baek’s family’s side has contended that the case represents an abuse of power by the enforcement officers.During the trial, the plaintiff’s side argued that the water cannon, which is required to be aimed at protestors below the chest, was aimed at Baek’s face, thereby commiting intentional gross negligence. The attorney asked to conduct an on-site survey of the water cannon vehicle in question.The police’s side, on the other hand, said that an autopsy was necessary to figure out the exact cause of Baek’s death and that it would take responsibility if it was found to be responsible.","farmer death the first ,being hit by police ,on farmer death ,died months after being ,cannon was held friday","['Baek Nam - gi', 'National Police Agency', 'Kang Sin - myeong']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37550291  0.38114026

Daniel Russel “We’re focusing our efforts on cutting off sources of revenue for the regime’s unlawful nuclear and ballistic weapons programs, including revenue generated through the coal trade and overseas by North Korean workers,” Russel said in the statement.“Our three countries will continue to increase the costs on North Korea and target its revenue and reputation until it makes a strategic decision to return to serious talks on denuclearization and complies with its international obligations and commitments,” he said.Russel said that the US has long expressed its willingness to hold “credible and authentic talks aimed at returning to the six-party talks on ending the North’s nuclear programs, but Pyongyang’s “litany of provocations demonstrates its rejection” of dialogue.Exports of coal and other mineral resources are an important source of hard currency that accounts for nearly half of the North‘s total exports. The latest UN Security Council resolution bans such mineral exports unless they are intended for livelihood purposes.Labor exports have also increasingly become a key source of income for Pyongyang.About 50,000 North Koreans are believed to be toiling overseas, mainly in the mining, logging, textile and construction industries.Such workers earn on average $120-150 per month while employers pay significantly higher amounts to the North’s government.Russel also said that the US is in discussions with partners about tightening the financial screws on Pyongyang to “deny North Korea access to the international banking infrastructure that has been abused and manipulated in furtherance of its illicit programs.”He was referring to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication  network that enables financial institutions worldwide to send and receive information about financial transactions in a secure, standardized and reliable environment.“I think that our hope is that we will in fact ultimately be able to reach an agreement that would further restrict North Korea‘s access,” Russel said, adding that the US government is also looking at North Korean banks and banking activities in an effort to shut down “anything that might contribute to the illicit programs or otherwise violate the Security Council resolutions or our own laws.”","coal labor exports russel ,tuesday daniel russel assistant ,japan to cut off ,labor exports russel washington ,cutting off nk coal","['WASHINGTON', 'Yonhap', 'the United States', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'North Korea', 'State Department', 'asian', 'Daniel Russel', 'the House Foreign Affairs Su']",4,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.29065338  0.34880602

Lee Jung-hyun‘s on-going hunger strike in turn.“Most of the members agreed that they cannot return to the audit while leaving the chairman on a hunger strike on his own,” said the party’s floor spokesman Rep. Min Kyung-wook. Saenuri Party lawmakers hold up pickets calling for the resignation of National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun in front of the Assembly hall on Wednesday. Adding that Speaker Chung Sye-kyun has repeated his refusal to apologize, Min said they had no reason to return at this time.The party’s decision came several hours after chairman Lee told the party’s members to cease its boycott of the audit, as calls for the resumption of the annual audit are growing.Saenuri has been refusing to participate in the audit since Monday over what they claim was an abuse of power by Speaker Chung Sye-kyun during a vote for the dismissal of the controversy-ridden agriculture minister.Lee has been on a hunger strike calling for Chung’s resignation. “It is my belief, as well as Saenuri’s, that we should work for the country no matter what the situation is. Through the audit, please make sure that  is spending its budget right and is not mistreating the people,” Lee said during a party meeting about Chung’s resignation.But earlier in the day, Saenuri floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk had remained more adamant, saying that the party leadership “will not tolerate” attempts to break away from the party’s general direction.Lee vowed to continue his hunger strike, maintaining his claim that Chung has failed to remain politically neutral and must step down. Speaker Chung maintained that he has acted according to parliamentary regulations and that he has no reason to apologize during a meeting with the foreign press.Rep. Woo Sang-ho, the floor leader for the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea, had welcomed Lee‘s announcement and said it would help “normalize” the Assembly.“I assess  as giving in to the pressure from the people, that they  cannot abandon the parliamentary audit which takes care of people‘s lives. It has been my consistent position that the parliament’s discussion of the state affairs cannot be discarded under any circumstances,” he said, adding that Lee‘s remarks came as a complete surprise. The ruling party said Wednesday it will press criminal charges against the Assembly speaker for libel due to his alleged spreading of false information. The ruling party has accused Chung of falsely claiming to have reached an agreement with both ruling and opposition parties to start a parliamentary session Saturday. The attending opposition lawmakers approved a resolution to recommend the dismissal of newly appointed Agriculture Minister Kim Jae-soo. The Saenuri Party said Chung failed to remain politically neutral.After President Park Geun-hye’s veto of the recommendation Monday, Kim was named to the post. Kim has been marred by multiple allegations including questionable real estate transactions and receiving a bank loan at a suspiciously low rate.Saenuri subsequently commenced a boycott of the audit, but there have been growing calls for the ruling party to scrap its protests from the opposition as well as within the party. Choo Mi-ae, the leader of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea, accused Lee of acting solely on the president’s behalf.Earlier in the day, she called the Saenuri leader and urged him to stop the hunger strike “for the people” and carry out political actions “in a normal way.” Friction within the Saenuri Party was hinted at Tuesday when Rep. Kim Young-woo, the head of the parliamentary Defense Committee, defied the party’s leadership and attempted to participate in the audit.Kim was prevented from doing so when fellow party members -- including former leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung -- entered his office and stopped him from leaving.The Assembly’s Strategy and Finance Committee Chairman Rep. Cho Kyoung-tae, who is also a Saenuri Party member, appeared open to resuming the audit, as he convened a meeting Wednesday with members of the main and opposition party of the committee to discuss conditions. They failed to reach an agreement.Both chairmen Kim and Cho, along with other members such as Rep. Ha Tae-keung, who had called for the resumption of the audit against their party’s boycott, belong to the party’s minority faction. Prior to Lee’s announcement, members of the opposition bloc and Saenuri had commenced talks on the Chung conundrum.Minor opposition People’s Party floor leader Rep.

The Improper Solicitation and Graft Act bans members of civil agencies, private educational institutions and media from giving and receiving free meals, presents or monetary gifts respectively worth 30,000 won , 50,000 won and 100,000 won or higher. The “Kim Young-ran” law, named after the former chief of the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission who initiated the drive in 2011, is forecast to bring about a sweeping shift in a culture that has long cherished generous hospitality and exchanges of presents as an intrinsic part of business. Some 4 million people from more than 49,000 organizations are subject to the legislation. Violators could face a fine of up to 30 million won or imprisonment for a maximum of three years, irrespective of the existence of a direct link between the gift and a favor. “We expect the act would help create a clean society where everyone can compete on a level playing field, and provide a turning point to sharply increase our national rectitude,” Cheong Wa Dae spokesperson Jeong Yeon-kuk told reporters. A restaurant selling Korean beef located near the government complex in Sejong City remains vacant during lunch Wednesday, when the anti-solicitation act came into effect. At noon around Gwanghwamun in downtown Seoul, traditional Korean restaurants frequented by officials and lawyers appeared less full, even though many of them had lowered the prices of their lunch courses below the 30,000 won ceiling. Some storied diners had already shut down or changed their menus, such as to everyday food. “We have only two rooms out of eight booked today, but the real problem is dinnertime, because that involves alcohol,” a restaurant owner said. “I think it’s more about the atmosphere of the first day of the law’s effectuation and things will get better hopefully over time.” A server at a Korean beef place in Mapo-gu, where a district court, prosecutors’ office and police station are located, said: “We are just doing fine, which was anticipated because we offer rice soups and table d’hote menus at reasonable prices for lunch as before. But given the higher prices of our main barbecue options, we are thinking to introduce additional cheaper dinner options.” The cafeteria at the Education Ministry in Sejong City is crowded with officials during lunch hours Wednesday, when the anti-solicitation act came into effect. To boost understanding and minimize confusion, public agencies, businesses and schools have been holding briefing sessions, distributing guidelines and taking written oaths to abide by the law from their employees. “Though we teachers did receive education, there is lingering confusion such as regarding what if parents bring things like coffee or pastries as usual when they visit to consult on their children, and the report process looks a bit too complex, unrealistic or has much room for interpretation,” said Jeong Hye-yeon, a 31-year-old instructor at a high school in Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province. Concerns remain that the legislation may further dampen consumer sentiment in an already flagging economy. It could reinforce bureaucracy and prompt daunted civil servants to further shun contact with the people, critics say.Initial backlash came from cattle growers, fruit farmers and fishermen, as well as small and mid-sized firms. Their yearly boons typically come around the Chuseok and New Year holidays, when many Koreans exchange costly gift packages of high-quality beef, homegrown fruit and fish in a display of gratitude and respect. With the legislation having now taken effect, however, thorough enforcement should be a top priority and any revisions be explored later if necessary to shore it up, officials said. Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn has also called for related state agencies to encourage an “active attitude” among the officials and eliminate uncertainties through the commission’s authoritative interpretations. “For the act to take root in a stable manner and contribute to making a clean, transparent society, it’s more important than anything to prevent confusion at an early phase of its implementation,” he said at a videoconference Cabinet meeting Tuesday.

The US Treasury on Monday blacklisted Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development, an industry machinery wholesaler, and four of its executives, including founder Ma Xiaohong. The Department of Justice also laid criminal charges against them for “conspiring to evade” its sanctions and to “launder money instruments.”   Images of Hongxiang Group The announcement marks Washington’s first independent penalty of a Chinese enterprise for ties with the North, and its latest step to tighten its economic noose around the wayward regime.  “The move alerts individuals and entities of not only China but other third countries to the risks of dealings with the North, and is expected to help consolidate the international community’s resolve for a thorough implementation of UN Security council resolutions,” Seoul’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Based in the North Korean-Chinese border city of Dandong, DHID was found to have used front companies, financial facilitators and trade representatives to facilitate transactions on behalf of Korea Kwangson Banking Corp., which is already under UN and US bans for providing financial services in support of the communist state’s proliferation program. The company and four people are subject to a property freeze in the US, and Americans are prohibited from making transactions involving them. The Department of Justice has also filed a civil forfeiture action for all funds in 25 bank accounts linked with DHID, as well as a request for a related restraining order to China.“Today’s action exposes a key illicit network supporting North Korea’s weapons proliferation,” Adam Szubin, the Treasury’s acting under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a statement. “DHID and its employees sought to evade US and UN sanctions, facilitating access to the US financial system by a designated entity. Treasury will take forceful action to pressure North Korea’s proliferation network and to protect the US financial system from abuse.” The firm is a subsidiary of Hongxiang Group, which is under the investigation of Beijing on allegations it has supplied items with potential military uses to Pyongyang. Early this month, the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul and the Center for Advanced Defense Studies in Washington said in a joint report that the conglomerate provided aluminum oxide, pure aluminum ingots, ammonium paratungstate, tungsten trioxide and other “dual use” materials used in enriching uranium or building missiles. The latest announcement came as the UNSC moves to slap a fresh set of sanctions in response to Pyongyang’s fifth nuclear test on Sept. 9. While crafting independent punitive steps at home, Seoul and Washington are intensifying diplomatic efforts to bring Beijing, Pyongyang’s top diplomatic and economic backer, aboard an even more biting resolution. A focal point is whether it would include bans on trade of livelihood goods and energy, as well as “secondary boycott” measures calling for penalties for third-party groups and individuals engaging in transactions with the North.“The recent progress on Hongxiang indicates the resolve of the US and China to tighten its squeeze on North Korea, and would inevitably have some impact on the ongoing UNSC discussions,” a Seoul diplomat said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.

Afternoon operations from Tuesday to next Monday, however, will be reduced to around 80 to 85 percent of their normal levels should unionized workers go on strike as planned, it said. The strike by subway workers, if carried out, will be the first in 12 years since the last one took place in 2004.The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport also has said the country's railway services will run without any major disruption. It plans to expand other means of transportation, such as buses, to cover the routes with reduced train services.The government and unionized workers have said they will continue to seek a resolution until the very start of the strike, but those close to the negotiations said chances of an agreement are slim.The new wage system is part of the Park Geun-hye administration's efforts to boost labor flexibility to create more jobs, especially for the young generation.Some 120 public companies and institutions are in the process of adopting the new wage program, with some of their unions protesting the move.","labor unions said monday ,scheduled to begin tuesday ,strike against the government ,two decades labor unions ,monday the walkout scheduled","[""South Korea 's"", 'the Federation of Korean Public Industr']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44577566  0.22921376

This followed two strong earthquakes that hit the city on Sept. 12. The larger quake, which was felt throughout South Korea, was the strongest ever recorded on the Korean Peninsula.Wednesday's quake was one of the stronger aftershocks among 423 tremors detected as of 2 p.m. Thursday since the two big quakes hit the historical city, the KMA said during a press briefing held at its office in Seoul. The weather agency said aftershocks of magnitude between 3.0 and 4.0 can occur down the road, though it could not predict when they will end.The KMA said it will dispatch a task force in charge of on-site studies to the city. The team, comprised of scholars and other experts, will analyze the influence of the series of quakes until the end of March. Meanwhile, the weather agency corrected the epicenter of the5.8 quake to 8.7 km southwest from the city from the originally reported 8 km. The epicenter of the first quake that happened less than an hour before the strongest one was also corrected from 9 km southwest from the city to 8.2 km away.The meteorological agency also said it will reduce the time it takes to send alert messages to the public. There have been calls to improve the current system as the alert messages did not immediately reach the residents near the quake-hit region when they occurred.The KMA plans to directly send the warning messages starting in November in the event of an emergency. At present, the notification goes through the Ministry of Public Safety and Security, a process which has been cited for causing the delay.The KMA said it will also increase the number of seismic stations in the country to 315 by 2018 from the current 206.","exceeding the magnitude quake ,thursday that an aftershock ,after magnitude aftershock hit ,day after magnitude aftershock ,magnitude quake that jolted","[""South Korea 's"", 'the Korea Meteorological Administration', 'Gyeongju', 'Seoul']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47190383  0.3232803

Woo Won-shik of the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea, as well as Rep. Ha Tae-keung of the ruling Saenuri Party, Rep. Jung Choun-sook of the Minjoo Party and Rep. Kim Sam-hwa of the People’s Party.Their first schedule involved visiting a group of victims’ relatives who were holding a protest near Downing Street in London, where the UK Prime Minister’s Office is located.Their next schedule involved visiting the Reckitt Benckiser headquarters and talking with the CEO Rakesh Kapoor on Wednesday.“We will make sure to get an apology from RB. RB has maintained that it has not been aware of the situation that was the responsibility of its , but a number of data and hearings have shown that the headquarters had actually been involved and were at the forefront of all developments, including tests,” said Woo. He added that he brought all the necessary evidence with his team.Lawmakers belonging to the special committee on the humidifier disinfectant case talk with families of the victims near the Prime Ministers Office in London on Tuesday. In May, former CEOs and officials at Oxy Reckitt Benckiser -- formally renamed Reckitt Benckiser Korea in 2014 -- were arrested by the prosecution and fined for falsely advertising their product as “safe for humans.”The humidifier case first came to light in August 2011 after four pregnant women died of lung failure. A government-led investigation found that chemicals used to clean humidifiers were to blame. The authorities confirmed 221 victims, 95 of whom died, after using the products made by several consumer goods companies, including largely Oxy.RB Korea announced in July that it would provide up to 350 million won  in compensation to each Korean victim of its lethal humidifier sanitizers.Under the final plan, Oxy will compensate victims at least 150 million won if they were categorized by the government investigation as classes 1 or 2, meaning that it is highly likely that exposure to Oxy’s products led to their deaths.Compensation of 1 billion won will be given for infant and child victims’ deaths due to the seriousness of the related suffering and difficulty in calculating potential earning losses, the company had said.The final plan does not address the victims’ previous demands for compensation packages for victims classified under categories 3 and 4, whose suffering was deemed less directly related to humidifier sanitizers.","tuesday to meet representatives ,disinfectant deaths began three ,london over disinfectant tragedy ,deaths began three day ,assembly committee visits london","['UK', 'Woo Won - shik']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55760449  0.46400362

Lee Jung-hyun  talks with Supreme Council member Rep. Cho Won-jin during a party meeting at the National Assembly on Monday. Ahn Hoon/The Korea HeraldThe ruling conservative Saenuri Party, on the other hand, is vowing to place all focus on the people’s livelihoods, blaming the opposition circles for holding back the government’s economic revitalization plans. It is also expected to accentuate the imminent security threats upon North Korea’s latest nuclear test to impart stronger control of state affairs to the Park administration.“During the Chuseok holidays, the public has increasingly voiced out complaints against the government’s faulty administration over the past 3 1/2 years,” said the Minjoo Party’s vice floor leader Rep. Park Wan-joo at a party meeting.The leading opposition party thus vowed to clarify the administration’s liability in the aggravation of the domestic economy, especially over the fall of the shipbuilding and shipping industries.It is also set to blast upon the government for lacking a diplomatic paradigm in the face of North Korea’s repeated ballistic missile launches and the strongest-yet nuclear test on Sept. 9.Spearheading the questions in the domestic politics sector will be Rep. Cho Eung-cheon, recognized for his aggressive stance against ruling powers.Cho, who formerly served as presidential secretary for civil service discipline under President Park in 2013-2014, turned his back on the Blue House after he leaked internal documents. He is also expected to press the presidential office to speak out on Woo Byung-woo, a disgraced senior presidential aide who for months has been caught up in bribery scandals.“Saenuri will focus on issues concerning the people’s daily livelihoods and also address national security, an issue of growing importance since North Korea’s fifth nuclear test,” said the party’s vice floor leader Rep. Kim Do-eup.Leading the party’s talks in the foreign affairs session will be Rep. Lee Cheol-woo, a third-termer and chairman of the parliamentary intelligence committee.Lee, a former senior official at the National Intelligence Service, is expected to reiterate the party’s strong antipathy toward the reclusive neighbor state’s military aggressions and to advocate the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, an advanced US anti-missile battery to be deployed here.The opposition camp, however, is not likely to address the THAAD issue directly during this week’s questioning sessions.“We will call the government to account for raising diplomatic tensions in the Northeast Asian region with the THAAD announcement, rather than expressing disapproval over the deployment itself,” said a Minjoo Party official who refused to be named.The party’s “toned-down” response is seen as reflecting the public’s increased sense of crisis over national security, following the North’s fifth nuclear test on Sept. 9.The People’s Party is set to take the lead in the social affairs sector, with former judge and lawyer Rep. Cho Bae-sook calling for the establishment of an independent agency dedicated to the probe of high-ranking officials’ corruption cases.The interpellation, the first to take place since the regular parliamentary session kicked off earlier this month, will cover four sectors -- domestic politics, foreign affairs, economy and social affairs.Questioners will consist of five lawmakers from the Saenuri Party, another five from the Minjoo Party, two from the runner-up opposition People’s Party and one not affiliated with a parliamentary bargaining unit. The latter would involve either a member of the progressive minority Justice Party or an independent lawmaker.By Bae Hyun-jung","political parties on monday ,session running from tuesday ,brace for agenda battle ,parties on monday geared ,to friday each struggling","['the Minjoo Party', 'Korea ’s', 'Choo Mi - ae', 'Supreme Council', 'Kim Young - joo', 'the National Assembly', 'Ahn Hoon']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22722149  0.41140449

Ranking members of the ruling Saenuri Party are stepping up demands that the government consider seeking measures equivalent to obtaining nukes. Their calls, officially denied by the government, are joined by some of the opposition members but are also met with criticism from both within and outside the party for being unrealistic and dangerous.Since joining the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty in 1975, South Korea has been banned from acquiring nuclear weapons. The government reiterated Monday that it would neither seek nuclear armament nor push for the redeployment of a US tactical nuclear weapon in South Korea. Earlier on Thursday, Defense Minister Han Min-koo said “there is a limitation” to nuclear armament. Defense Minister Han Min-koo  on Monday attends the meeting for nuclear armament at the National Assembly along with the Saenuri Party’s lawmakers and security experts. Park Hae-mook/The Korea Herald.The Saenuri Party’s leader Rep. Lee Jung-hyun egged on the debate by saying Sunday that the government should consider all measures against Pyongyang’s nuclear threat. “It is time to put even unthinkable options on the table,” he said, hinting at the possibility for nuclear armament. A group of Saenuri lawmakers who formed a parliamentary group calling for nuclear armament demanded Monday that the government develop a nuclear submarine on its own and redeploy US tactical nuclear weapons. In September 1991, former US president George H. W. Bush withdrew tactical nuclear weapons from Korea under his campaign to reduce nuclear arsenal known as the “Presidential Nuclear Initiative.” Three months later, the two Koreas signed the Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Led by former Saenuri floor leader Rep. Won Yoo-chul as well as more than a dozen of his fellow party members, the group said in a statement that the National Assembly should build a bipartisan legislative body to come up with specific measures for nuclear armament. But dissenting voices emerged even among the hawkish wing of Saenuri lawmakers. They described nuclear armament as “far-fetched” because any damage to the NPT and other non-nuclear agreements would seriously strain ties with Washington as well as the international community.“ is an unrealistic choice. It would only lead to South Korea’s diplomatic and economic isolation,” said Rep. Yoon Sang-hyun in a media interview. Yoon was a member of the Assembly’s Foreign Affairs, Trade and Unification Committee and had served as presidential secretary for civil affairs for President Park Geun-hye.Citing US President Obama’s pledge to maintain a non-nuclear policy on the Korean Peninsula and the extended deterrence to South Korea, Yoon said that Washington would never agree to Seoul’s nuclear armament or the redeployment of US tactical nuclear weapons. The opposition parties also denounced the calls, accusing the pro-nuclear lawmakers of engaging in a political stunt to promote their profile. “I can’t help but think that the nuclear armament is a politicized campaign to cover up the government’s failure in containing cross-border tension,” said Rep. Yoon Kwan-suk, a spokesman of the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea. Yoon asserted that if the government seeks to develop or deploy a nuclear weapon, it would lose moral grounds to criticize Pyongyang for obtaining nukes in violation of the 1991 denuclearization pact.The People’s Party interim leader Rep. Park Jie-won also condemned the nuclear armament initiative. “Nuclear armament is a dangerous and irresponsible policy and could bring another war on the Korean Peninsula. They should stop promoting a populistic approach to security matters,” he said. Meanwhile, some opposition lawmakers joined calls to rethink Korea’s current defense strategy.Rep. Kim Chong-in, the former chairman of the Minjoo Party, said in a Facebook post, “It is hoped that the president and leaders of the three parties have a detailed and substantial discussion on reviewing the redeployment of tactical nuclear  of the USFK, tasks that need to be accomplished during next month’s Korea-US Military Committee Meeting and the Security Consultative Meeting, and measures against North Korea’s additional nuclear test within this year, to dissolve the anxiety felt by the people.”","debate over seoul nuclear ,over seoul nuclear armament ,refuels debate over seoul ,fifth and strongest nuclear ,seoul nuclear armament north","['North Korea ’s', 'South Korea', 'Saenuri Party']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44845462  0.19313157

It will mark the first time since 2003 that the head of the liberal-leaning political party will visit Chun.Former President Chun Doo-hwan Chun, who was president of the country for seven years from 1981, remains a controversial figure among the liberal opposition bloc for his alleged involvement in the crackdown on the May 18 democracy movement in 1980. Tens of thousands of citizens rose up in Gwangju against the military junta led by Chun, who seized power in a December 1979 coup. The government officially maintains that about 200 people were killed in the crackdown, although some put the estimate higher. Chun was sentenced to death in 1996 for his part in the suppression of the uprising but was later pardoned.Political pundits said Choo's visit may spark opposition from other party members, especially from those from the South Jeolla Province and Gwangju.Shortly after her appointment in late August, Choo also paid tribute to late president Park Chung-hee, the father of incumbent President Park Geun-hye, at the Seoul National Cemetery, also sparking a controversy.","next year presidential race ,hwan next week political ,next week political sources ,presidential race close aide ,year presidential race close","['Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Chun Doo - hwan', 'Choo']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.80520856  0.23563983

Choo Mi-ae said South Korea should move beyond a conglomerate-dominated, export-driven economy toward a “fair economy” by revamping the tax code and increasing the corporate tax rate.The Minjoo Party of Korea chairperson Rep. Choo Mi-ae delivers a speech at the National Assembly on Tuesday, under the chairmanship of parliamentary speaker Chung Sye-kyun. But the opposition chief tried to steer clear of politically sensitive issues, including the bribery scandal involving senior presidential secretary for civil affairs Woo Byung-woo. Instead, she proposed a one-on-one meeting with President Park to address agendas concerning the people’s livelihood.“Political interests cannot take precedence over our people’s livelihood,” said the party leader in an address to lawmakers. “Regardless of ideological and partisan differences, the government and the Assembly must be practical in doing their business.” The fifth-term lawmaker, who has echoed the idea of “economic democratization” advocated by her predecessor Rep. Kim Chong-in, devoted much of her speech to highlighting the economic challenges facing Korea and the government’s inability to navigate the issue. Using the collapse of South Korea’s biggest container shipping company, Hanjin Shipping Co., as an example, Choo asserted the nation’s economy is “in a state of emergency,” and criticized President Park for sticking to the “antiquated” economic policy implemented during her father’s presidency between the 1960s and 1970s“President Park is now losing the main industry built during her father’s term,” Choo said. “Her economic policy is just dependent upon her father’s growth plan. She is just missing the success story achieved by her father.” Instead, the chairwoman demanded that the government and businesses implement a fair salary system, overhaul the tax code system and increase the corporate tax rate. She asserted that the measures would ensure fairness in taxation and improve wealth distribution. Aware of businesses’ opposition to the tax increase -- they have warned that it would hurt their competitiveness -- she urged them either to join the effort or to introduce an alternative. “We should figure out who is more capable of burdening taxes. If businesses can’t join the plan, they should lay out a compelling option,” she said. The center-left party leader took time to criticize President Park’s hard-line diplomacy for fueling cross-border tension with North Korea, while acknowledging that the communist regime should be blamed for its persistent nuclear ambition.“Nuclear development is not a method to ensure the regime’s stability and survival,” she said, adding that former President Lee Myung-bak and President Park’s hawkish approach “makes the North a monster without reins.”By Yeo Jun-suk","economy blasting what president ,in her debut speech ,party leader emphasizes economy ,blasting what president ,korea chairwoman rep","['Park Geun', 'the National Assembly', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Choo Mi', 'South Korea']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.30447987  0.44065878

It will document cases of Pyongyang’s rights violations and information regarding separated families, abductees and prisoners of war. The director-general-level organization is supposed to deliver the results of its works to an archive to be installed under the Justice Ministry every three months. The ministry also plans to create a new bureau that will oversee North Korean rights-related tasks while taking over other existing divisions responsible for the separated families issues, defector resettlement support and humanitarian assistance. “By now, there is sufficient consensus formed in the international community that the quality of lives of North Koreans has to be improved, and the overall human rights situation there has to be improved,” ministry spokesperson Jeong Joon-hee said Friday, referring to similar laws enacted in countries such as the US and Japan. “So it’s time for the North, too, to face up to the reality and strive to advance the rights of its people, instead of decrying and disparaging the South’s efforts.”  The image taken on Aug. 29 from Paju, Gyeonggi Province, shows towns near the inter-Korean border where the South and North Korean flags flap respectively. In Seoul, the legislative campaign was initiated in 2005 by then Saenuri Party lawmaker and former Gyeonggi Province Gov. Kim Moon-su, one year after the US put in place its own act. But the issue had since been a source of partisan bickering until it gathered international traction in recent years which culminated in a watershed February 2014 report of the UN Commission of Inquiry. Then last March, a more comprehensive bill passed the National Assembly. The landmark act reflects South Korea’s approach to separately deal with the Kim Jong-un regime and its oppressed, isolated rank-and-file citizens. In her Liberation Day address on Aug. 15, President Park Geun-hye called for the North’s “officials and ordinary people” to join endeavors for reunification. With global support being key to changes, the law called for the Foreign Ministry to appoint an ambassador for North Korean human rights. The Unification Ministry will also establish a policy advisory committee.By keeping track of cases of political persecution and coercion, Seoul expects to secure grounds to hold Kim and other perpetrators accountable someday, while ratcheting up pressure on the regime in the short term. The US, for instance, placed the young ruler and other 14 executives and eight entities on its sanctions blacklist over human rights abuses for the first time last July. South Korea is exploring taking a similar “naming-and-shaming” step, officials said.  “The regime’s violations of its people’s basic rights to freedom and life constitute a grave crime, and it’s an issue that should be handled not only within the domestic justice system after unification, but also from an international criminal law’s aspect from now on,” Kim Han-kyun, a researcher at the Korean Institute of Criminology, said in his recent report. “In particular, managing the archive and inter-Korean human rights dialogue would help establish the foundation for a post-unification criminal system and policies.” Pyongyang has been ferociously resisting the drive as a plot to topple its system, arguing that such human rights issues do not and cannot exist there. “ is an act that is as ridiculous, futile and blind as trying to break a rock with an egg,” the North’s Measure Council for Human Rights in South Korea said Thursday through state media, threatening the Park administration with “destruction.” The official Korean Central News Agency also accused the president and her aides of inciting confrontation Friday, saying they deserved “being trampled.” Sources of contention linger, however, with the act defining applicable targets as “persons who have their domicile, lineal ascendants and descendants, spouse, workplace and other bases of living north of the Military Demarcation Line.” This could complicate support for North Koreans in a third country seeking to enter the South. The text also failed to carry concrete steps or a detailed agenda to bring about a inter-Korean human rights dialogue. Any talks appear far-fetched at this point, given Seoul’s “no-dialogue” principles -- unless the North makes progress in denuclearization -- as well as Pyongyang’s unbridled nuclear and missile provocations and refusal to accept the rights problems. “With regard to defectors in a third country, we will need to make a prudent decision taking comprehensively into account diplomatic relations and other issues involved,” a senior Unification Ministry official told reporters last week, adding details of future programs are to be hammered out.By Shin Hyon-hee","sunday fueling momentum for ,new law on north ,force sunday fueling momentum ,force sunday fueling ,into force sunday fueling","['North Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'the Unification Ministry']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52501708  0.01185452

In protest, the ruling party, officially supportive of the deployment plan, announced a boycott of all National Assembly sessions.The parties, nonetheless, managed to hold a regular meeting late Friday to pass the extra budget bill, with vice speaker Park Joo-sun of the minor People’s Party chairing it on behalf of Chung. ""We are glad that the extra budget plan was finally passed,"" Saenuri said in a statement.The ruling party argued that Chung should be held responsible for the delay in passing the budget bill, as he failed to maintain political neutrality.

The Supreme Court found Jang, 53, guilty of abusing his 30-year-old pupil for two years since March 2013.Jang was indicted in August 2015 under charges of feeding human feces to the victim, as well as beating him with an aluminum bat and spraying tear gas over his face which was covered by a plastic bag. The first trial gave Jang 12 years in prison, with his actions condemned as “psychological murder and unpardonable abuse of human dignity.”However, in the second appeals trial the verdict was reduced to eight years following the victim’s wishes and due to omission of a few charges from the legal documents.Jang had hired the victim to work for his academic society but later began to abuse him for his “unsatisfactory work style.”Jang’s other pupils Jang, 25, and Jeong, 28, were respectively given four and two years in prison for taking part in the violence.Another accomplice Kim, 30, did not appeal for retrial and will go through the 18-month term he received in the original trial.

Choo Mi-ae responds to cheers upon her election at the party‘s national convention held in Seoul on Saturday. “I will consider each and every vote I got as a heaven-sent command to cure division , make a strong opposition by unification and win in a fair presidential race on July 20, 2017 by any means. I will serve by winning,” she said, after winning 54 percent approval to Rep. Lee Jong-kul’s 23.8 percent and Kim Sang-gon’s 22 percent to easily take the race. She became the first female party leader and the first chief from the “TK” region, referring to Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province, which has traditionally been a stronghold for Saenuri and President Park.Choo defined division, defeatism and “old politics” as those that should be eradicated during her leadership.The five-time lawmaker has been calling for party members to rally on key points of dispute. She has been endorsed by the party’s mainstream faction that stands behind former party leader Moon Jae-in and the late former president Roh Moo-hyun. This includes on where the Minjoo Party stands on the upcoming deployment of the US’ Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile system. The preceding Kim Chong-in leadership had publicly agreed with the deployment, with the outgoing leader going as far as saying that THAAD was “inevitable,” considering North Korea’s ballistic missile threats and the importance of the Seoul-Washington alliance.But contrary to Kim’s overall neutral stance, Choo has vowed to make clear where the party stands on the THAAD issue. She backed her resolve by saying she will adopt rejection of THAAD as an official plank of the party platform.Pundits say this makes the possibility of a coalition with minor opposition parties People’s Party of Korea and Justice Party more likely, as they are already publicly opposed to the government’s THAAD plans.A Choo-led Minjoo Party is also expected to take a firmer approach on issues related to the investigation on the deadly sinking of the Sewol ferry in 2014. While the government has decided to dissolve the Sewol Special Committee investigating the tragedy, the bereaved families of victims have been requesting an extension of its term and called for the Minjoo Party to work with them on revising the related law.Choo has vowed she will extend the term of the committee to “unveil the truth that the Park administration has been struggling to hide.”The fifth-termer has also pledged a different approach on economic reform than the Park administration, which includes reducing the wage gap between guaranteed and non-guaranteed contract workers and having corporations use their funds for job creation, supporting affiliated companies in exchange for tax benefits.Speculation is growing that the 20th National Assembly may be muddled with confrontations as the Saenuri Party similarly selected Park loyalist Rep. Lee Jung-hyun as its new chairman. The apparent dominance of the pro-Moon faction has sparked concerns that minor factions will be mostly ignored within the party. Cho Guk, a professor at Seoul National University who supported Kim Sang-gon in the race, wrote via his Facebook account that “minor presidential candidates” such as Seoul Mayor Park Won-sun and South Chungnam Province Gov. Ahn Hee-jung may be discouraged from competing for the presidential candidacy. Although both Choo and President Park were born in the city of Daegu, Choo’s family background contrasts drastically with that of Park’s. While Park’s father, Park Chung-hee, was the dictatorial leader of the country across the 1960s and 1970s, Choo’s father ran a local laundry shop. Despite being a Daegu-native, Choo eventually became an “adopted daughter” of the largely Gwangju and Jeolla Province-based opposition block. She worked as a judge for the Gwangju High Court before iconic former president Kim Dae-jung led her to politics. Choo became a key member of the opposition under the Kim and Roh administrations.While considered part of the pro-Moon faction, Choo has somewhat of a complicated history with the Minjoo Party’s former leader. Dating back to 2003, the lawmaker voted for the impeachment of then-president Roh. The liberal leader was Moon’s political ally and close friend, which remains one of the key rallying points for the opposition bloc.The two have mended ties since then, with Choo making gestures like participating in Moon’s 2012 presidential bid. Choo, who represents Gwangjin-gu of Seoul, has apologized for her involvement in Roh’s impeachment, calling it “the worst mistake” of her political career.By Yoon Min-sik","next year presidential race ,presidential race in an ,new opposition leader expected ,year presidential race in ,in sweeping victory saturday","['the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun - hy']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.76301312  0.31139159

YonhapEarlier this week, the company management and union leaders struck a deal to raise the monthly base pay of an employee by 58,000 won . Each worker will also receive 350 percent of the base monthly payment and an additional 3.3 million won in performance incentives.Many members of the labor union were apparently displeased with the wage hike rates.Under the 2015 deal, their monthly salary went up by 85,000 won along with a 400 percent bonus and an additional 4.2 million won in incentives.The labor union has also struggled with internal conflicts among several factions, inside sources said, adding some members of the union even staged an unannounced campaign to vote down the agreement.It remains uncertain that a new wage agreement will be reached before Chuseok, the Korean Thanksgiving holiday, in mid-September.The management claims relatively small pay hikes are inevitable due to unfavorable business conditions both at home and abroad.""Operating profits have decreased each year since recording 8.44 trillion won in 2012. In the first half of this year, operating profits dropped 7 percent to 3.1 trillion won, compared to the same period last year,"" a company official said.In return for the smaller pay rise this year, the management retracted plans for a wage peak system to start cutting payments for workers as they near retirement, he pointed out.The unionized workers of Hyundai Motor have staged 14 rounds of partial walkouts since the wage talks began in July.Their collective action has affected the production of 65,500 cars, worth 1.4 trillion won, company officials said.","hyundai motor workers reject ,workers reject wage deal ,motor workers reject wage ,south korea leading carmaker ,thursday vote and 35","[""South Korea 's"", 'Hyundai Motor Co.']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.21923473  0.6934942

Also, the government will provide up to 2 million won  per month to men on paternity leave for three months, the ministry said.The measures came after the number of newborns in the January-May period decreased by 10,000 from a year ago despite the government's measures announced earlier this year.The number of newborns in the country came to 34,400 in May, down 5.8 percent from a year earlier. It marked the lowest monthly level since Statistics Korea began compiling such data in 2000.Again, the number of childbirths here dropped to a six-month low of 32,900 in June.Medical costs for infertility treatment had so far been covered by national health insurance only to couples with low income. In order to qualify for the subsidy, a couple had to earn less than 150 percent of the national average monthly income, which is about 5.3 million won.The ministry said medical costs for infertility treatments, including three sets of artificial insemination and a maximum of four sets of external fertilization, will be covered by national health insurance.For artificial insemination, a couple can receive up to 500,000 won for each procedure, which is about half of the total cost, while a maximum of 2.4 million won is given to each round of an external fertilization.The ministry said the number of couples forecast to receive the subsidy will increase from the current 50,000 to 96,000.In order to help families with children, the government said it will increase the subsidy to households with a father taking parental leave from the current 1.5 million to 2 million per month.The government has been encouraging paternity leave, including turning unpaid leave into paid leave in 2001 and extending the age limit for children in 2008.Also, families, where both the husband and wife work with more than three children will have priority access to daycare centers, the ministry said.Under the measure, households with dual income and more than three children will be guaranteed priority in enrolling their children to both state and private daycare centers as well as kindergartens.Families with three children and a single income will also be given priority, the ministry said, noting that dual income families with two children will soon have more benefits as well.A total of some 60,000 infants from dual income families with more than three children are currently waiting to be admitted to daycare centers across the country.Also, the government will support small-and-medium sized firms to construct a system that allows more workers to stay at home while working. Under the measures, public officials or those working at state-run companies with more than three children will be given priority in choosing a place of work, the ministry said.The ministry said it expects the number of newborns next year to increase by additional 20,000 thanks due to the measures.Health and Welfare Minister Chung Chin-youb announced a statement, urging business entities to actively participate in tackling the low birth rate problem.""The problem of low birth rate is a grave task that will greatly influence the national future. Unless it is solved, we cannot pursue sound and sustained development,"" said Chung.South Korea has one of the lowest birth rates among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development members, stoking concern that it could cripple the country's growth potential and possibly result in more welfare expenses.According to data by Statistics Korea, some 435,400 babies were born last year, down around 1,000, or 0.2 percent, from a year earlier. It marked the second straight year of on-year decline and was the lowest since 2005, when around 435,000 babies were born.","government on thursday rolled ,20 000 next year ,the government on thursday ,government on thursday ,infertility treatments to couples","['Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.56450754  0.39650151

To boost the birth rate and help workers strike a balance between work and family, the government has pursued a series of programs, including a flextime system, a tailored childcare program and an after-school education scheme.","thursday pledged constant efforts ,on thursday pledged constant ,ahn on thursday pledged ,thursday pledged constant ,on thursday pledged","['Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Hwang']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.27615991  0.23040998

Led by Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, the government taskforce aimed at combating corruption, released a report on the condition of school meals and a set of measures to improve the situation at a ministerial meeting. During the inspection from April to July, the taskforce uncovered a total of 677 cases in which the School Meals Act were breached, such as through the poor sanitation of ingredients, failure in quality control and dubious deals between lunch operators and food suppliers. The group, which comprises the Food and Drug Safety Ministry, Agriculture Ministry, Education Ministry and local education offices, probed 274 out of 11,698 schools providing students with school meals, as well as 2,415 food production and distribution companies. The taskforce filed a complaint about 45 cases and imposed administrative punishment on 157 cases.The team found 487 cases in which schools granted deals to some food firms at the expense of the quality of food through an unfair bidding process. Of these cases, 16 involved bid rigging and schools’ cozy relationships with food firms owned by school staff members’ families and acquaintances. According to the probe, some nutritionists ordered food items from particular companies in return for rebates such as gifts, cash cards and movie tickets. Four food firms -- Dongwon, Daesang, CJ Freshway and Pulmuone -- are suspected of offering kickbacks worth 1.6 billion won to nutritionists at 3,000 schools for the past 2 1/2 years in exchange for a business contract to procure food ingredients for school meals. The taskforce found that dubious deals led to shady execution of the schools’ budgets, an increase in food prices and the poor quality control of ingredients for school lunches. A total of 68 cases involved the lax monitoring of cooking staff’s health conditions, poor hygiene in handling ingredients, false reports about the sanitary of storage rooms and vehicles transporting food. In 118 cases, schools failed to inspect the quality of ingredients, using food whose expiry date was over or whose country of origin was falsified About 6.14 million students at 11,698 elementary, middle and high schools across the country enjoy school meals daily as of 2015, costing the government 56 trillion won in budget. Following the inspection, the government laid out a plan to improve the quality and safety of school meals and root out unfair practices by 2017. The government plans to set up a website and mobile application dedicated to informing the public of results of the evaluation on school meals hygiene and safety as well as the ingredient supply system. It will develop a standardized menu to narrow differences in the quality of school meals in 17 cities and order a regular inspection of food suppliers. Some 170 parents will be tasked with overseeing school-operated kitchens and meals across the country. Meanwhile, some 730 students at five schools in Seoul, Busan, Daegu and Bonghwa across the nation showed symptoms of food poisoning after having school meals, health authorities said Tuesday. The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety cited food ingredients spoiled by the continued heat wave as a cause and it has collected cooking tools, water and food from the schools for a relevant agency to conduct an in-depth investigation. The results are expected in about a week. The Education Ministry and the MFDS rolled out a plan to prevent food poisoning from spreading to other schools at a news briefing later in the day. The ministries said that it will bring forward a scheduled inspection on school kitchens and food supplier to Wednesday. It will also adopt a quicker system to find out the cause of the food poisoning and to inform other schools of a possible breakout of the disease.

Her disapproval rating was 58.8 percent, 1.3 percentage point up from last week. Realmeter attributed the outcome to a surprise defection of a high-profile North Korea diplomat overshadowing the issue.The survey was conducted between Tuesday and Friday. Park reshuffled her Cabinet during this period, but retained Woo Byung-woo, her senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, despite him facing several corruption allegations.President Park Geun-hye speaks as her senior secretary for civil affairs Woo Byung-woo watches during the Cabinet meeting on Monday. The decision brought her approval rating down to 33.4 percent Wednesday, but the number bounced back a day after, upon reports of London-based diplomat Thae Yong-ho defecting to South Korea with his family, the pollster said. The poll was taken too early to reflect the public response to the controversy over an alleged information leak by a special inspector who was looking into allegations, the pollster added.On Friday, Cheong Wa Dae denounced inspector Lee Seok-su for allegedly leaking information about a probe on Woo to an unidentified group of reporters.The survey also found that the ruling Saenuri Party’s approval rating stood at 33.3 percent, 0.3 percentage point down from a week earlier. The main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea’s approval rating managed to narrow the gap with its rival by rising 1.5 percentage points to reach 28.3 percent. The third-biggest People’s Party, on the other hand, dropped 0.2 percentage points to 12.3 percent, a fall that has continued over the past six weeks. Even in their political strongholds of Gwangju and South Jeolla Province, the centrist party saw its approval rating lagging behind The Minjoo Party seven weeks in a row. Meanwhile, the survey also found that UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was picked as the most favored presidential hopeful for next year’s election, maintaining his lead over the former main opposition party leader Moon Jae-in for the past three weeks. According to the poll, Ban held an approval rating of 24.8 percent, 1 percentage point up from a week earlier, outpacing Moon and other potential candidates. Moon’s approval rating took second place with 19.2 percent and the People Party’s former leader Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo ranked third with 9.8 percent.

Kim Myung-yeon in a briefing.“Considering the urgency of state budgeting, the opposition must keep its words and pass the budget bill first.”Vice floor leader Rep. Kim Do-eup underlined that it was the opposition camp which had suggested the extra budget in the first place.“The opposition leaders should at least offer some explanation on why they suddenly broke the agreement),“ said Kim.The main opposition Minjoo Party accused the Saenuri of covering up for key presidential aides by dodging the related discussions.“There is to be no floor leadership meeting today. The Saenuri Party made it clear last Thursday that it has no enthusiasm for the extra budget,” said a text message sent out by the Minjoo’s vice whip Rep. Park Wan-joo to reporters on Sunday morning. Rep. Chung Jin-suk, floor leader of the Saenuri Party, on Friday urges for the passage of the government’s supplementary budget bill. YonhapLast week, the three main parties agreed to meet in a session on Aug. 22 to pass the government’s supplementary budget plan in a bid to revitalize the nation’s economy.But the hard-struck deal was waylaid by arguments over the responsibility of some ranking government officials who are suspected of secretly plotting a massive injection of government funds into the financially struggling shipbuilding sector.Those in question are former Finance Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan, senior presidential secretary for policy coordination An Chong-bum and former chairman of the state-run Korea Development Bank Hong Ky-ttack.The three officials allegedly held a secret meeting at Cheong Wa Dae in October last year and agreed to inject some 4.2 trillion won into DSME, the nation’s No. 2 shipbuilder which has been weighed down by deficits and irregularity charges.”In order to establish effective measures, it is crucial to get down to the root cause,“ said the Minjoo‘s floor spokesperson Rep. Ki Dong-min.”But the Saenuri is constantly looking away from the issue and shifting the blame onto the opposition.“Amid the partisan stalemate, however, some officials speculated that parties could reach a last-minute compromise to pass the budget bill within the week.“In order for the budget bill to take the anticipated pump-priming effect, it has to obtain parliamentary approval by Wednesday at the latest,” said an official of the National Assembly, explaining that a one or two-day delay would not cause major setbacks.By Bae Hyun-jung","weekend posing last minute ,11 trillion won billion ,posing last minute challenges ,standoff over the weekend ,won billion supplementary budget","['Assembly', 'Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.72702134  0.05839327

Advocates of the Night Tube also emphasise its benefits on the rest of the cultural sector, with theatres and galleries now able to stay open late if visitors can get home.""This is about offering access to people who work in London throughout the night as well as those who enjoy the entertainment of London as well,"" said Steve Griffiths, chief operating officer for the night tube.""So we are serving many different people with many different requirements and this is fantastic for London and now we are part of that 24/7 operation,"" he added.The new service was inaugurated by London Mayor Sadiq Khan and there are plans to extend the scheme later this year to the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines, with the latter reaching Heathrow airport.It is expected the night tube will transport about 200,000 people between now and the end of the year.The night-time service was scheduled to start in September last year but was delayed by a dispute with trade unions over staff conditions and pay.Concerns have also been expressed about the safety of the new service, after a leaked internal assessment by operating firm Transport for London indicated that sexual offences and other crimes are likely to increase.The British Transport Police are providing 100 more officers to patrol the 144 stations that will be open all night when the service begins.The Tube dates back to 1863 and carries over one billion passengers every year.","london opens first night ,midnight at bustling oxford ,bustling oxford circus underground ,night tube new service ,never sleeps london opens","['LONDON', 'AFP', 'Oxford Circus Underground', 'London', 'the Big Smoke', 'Excited Londoners']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47723377  0.59843254

He also has experience in courts as he has served as a judge. It also noted that he carries “balanced values and philosophies such as in history.” The committee also praised his wish to continue his academic activities rather than open a private practice upon his retirement.Since his nomination, Kim has expressed his support for the National Security Law and alternative services for faith-based draft objectors. He has also called for the abolition of capital punishment in written answers to questions during his parliamentary hearing. Supreme Court Justice nominee Kim Jae-hyung takes an oath while attending a parliamentary hearing on his nomination Thursday. Kim, currently a professor at Seoul National University’s School of Law, said that the National Security Law is still crucial for a country in consistent military confrontation with the North and that its pitfalls have been considerably reduced in its interpretation and enforcement through revisions.The committee, however, pointed out that while he did not show any significant “ethical lapses,” his past work with a large law firm in exchange for “large” compensation as a professor at a national university could be considered inappropriate. His relatively lack of experience in criminal law was also noted. Kim was nominated on July 21 to replace retiring Justice Lee In-bok next month. Kim will be officially named to the post after the Assembly’s plenary session endorses the committee’s report, to be followed by the president’s formal appointment.A native of Imsil, North Jeolla Province, Kim graduated from Seoul National University’s School of Law before passing the bar exam. He served as a civil court judge in Seoul from 1992 to 1995. Since 1995, he has moved to his alma mater, and researched and lectured on the civil code.He is to be the second professor-turned-justice at the Supreme Court since former Justice Yang Chang-soo, who served between 2008 and 2014 before returning to the academia.","friday approved supreme court ,expert in civil law ,well versed in legal ,approved supreme court justice ,versed in legal theories","['the National Assembly ’s', 'Supreme Court', 'Kim Jae - hyung', 'Kim']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40911305  0.65054172

""Her trip to Russia and China was arranged in the midst of various forms of pressure on South Korea to scrap the THAAD deployment plan,"" Nam Chang-hee, international politics professor at Inha University, said.""Park should stay focused steadfastly on seeking understanding for Seoul's position that the deployment was an inevitable choice in response to Pyongyang's growing missile and nuclear threats."" On Sept. 2, Park will fly to Vladivostok, Russia, for the Eastern Economic Summit and a bilateral meeting with her Russian counterpart, President Vladimir Putin. Following her trip to Russia, she will travel to Hangzhou, China, on Sept. 4 for the Group of 20  summit. Laos will be the last leg of her three-nation trip. From Sept. 7-9, Park will attend the forums related to the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations and a bilateral summit with her Laotian counterpart Bounnhang Vorachith. Photo taken on April 1, shows President Park Geun-hye  shaking hands with her Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping before their talks on the sidelines of the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington, D.C. During the multilateral summits, Park is expected to encounter the leaders of the United States, China and Japan, among others.But her aides said whether Park will hold bilateral summits with any of them is yet to be determined.The South Korean chief executive is expected to capitalize on these gatherings to stress that the planned deployment of THAAD will not target any country other than North Korea.Amid strong opposition from China and Russia, Park has defended the deployment plan as a ""self-defense"" measure, vowing not to bow to any pressure when it comes to the crucial issue of national security.Beijing and Moscow believe that a THAAD battery on the Korean Peninsula would strengthen America's military clout in the Asia-Pacific region and thus undermine their security interests.China's opposition to THAAD, in particular, has caused a diplomatic headache for Park as she has been striving to strengthen the strategic partnership with the Asian power -- despite growing concerns both in Seoul and Washington that South Korea, America's core ally in the region, was tilting too much towards China.Since Park took office in February 2013, the South Korean leader has been trying to shore up trust with China, South Korea's key partner for trade, tourism, as part of a plan to push the North to denuclearize and lay the foundation for reunification of the divided country. The former Lee Myung-bak government gave short shrift to China with its policy thought to have focused inordinately on the US It sought to strengthen the South Korea-US alliance, which had buckled under his predecessor Roh Moo-hyun, who pursued a more ""balanced"" relationship with the country's superpower ally.During her possible encounter with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Park may seek to patch things up with him, the observers said.Ensuring that the international community maintains a united front against the North's nuclear program would be another critical task for Park's multilateral diplomacy drive next month.The vehement opposition from Beijing and Moscow -- the key players in the implementation of international sanctions on North Korea -- has spawned concerns that they could become less willing to faithfully enforce the sanctions due to the THAAD row.In March, the U.N. Security Council imposed the toughest-ever set of sanctions on the communist state for its nuclear test in January and long-range rocket test the following month.""Park may be able to garner China's understanding over the THAAD issue by emphasizing to Xi that Seoul would not have decided to deploy THAAD had Beijing taken a meaningful step to prevent Pyongyang from advancing its nuclear and missile programs,"" Inha University's Nam said.At the multilateral summits in China and Laos, maritime disputes over the South China Sea could also be dealt with at the gatherings, which could put Park in a diplomatically challenging situation.Seoul has maintained that freedom of navigation and flight over the South China Sea should be protected, and that the strategically vital waterway should not be militarized. But it has been cautious not to step into the increasingly sensitive spats over territorial issues centered on the South China Sea.In Laos, Park is expected to seek ways to further strengthen economic ties with the ASEAN, whose regional influence has been increasing since it launched the ASEAN Economic Community late last year, experts pointed out.In recent years, Seoul has intensified efforts to build deeper, wider economic ties with the resource-rich ASEAN that boasts a huge market with the combined population of 632 million. ASEAN is South Korea's second-largest trade partner with two-way trade reaching $119 billion last year.""The ASEAN is rich in natural resources and labor force -- a reason why South Korean companies have been seeking to advance into it,"" Jang Jun-young, Southeast Asia expert at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.Jang added that Seoul needs to expand its diplomatic cooperation with the ASEAN over various issues including North Korea-related ones -- rather than focusing its policy toward the bloc wholly on the economic dimension.","summit diplomacy next month ,weeklong trip to russia ,diplomacy next month ,friday on sept park ,diplomacy next month to","['Park Geun', 'US', 'South Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Park', 'Russia', 'China', 'Laos']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.32250223  0.49252799

Moon Jae-in, a former leader of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea and presidential aspirant, voiced hopes on Thursday that opposition parties would join forces to win next year's presidential election.Attending a ceremony to mark the seventh anniversary of the death of former President Kim Dae-jung, Moon said that although the opposition parties competed against each other in the parliamentary elections in April, the presidential race would bring them together so as to prevail over the ruling Saenuri Party.""What I can say with confidence is that we  will definitely join forces in any way we can to win in the presidential election,"" Moon told reporters after the commemorative event at Seoul National Cemetery in southern Seoul.He was referring to the possibility that his party and its splinter party, the People's Party, may join hands to secure an electoral win in the race for the presidential office.Commenting on late former President Kim who led the country from 1998-2003, Moon stressed that Kim represented the ""politics of integration"" through which the liberal leader even embraced North Korea.The late president and Nobel Peace laureate is revered as an icon of the country's democracy movement and credited with the reconciliation process with the communist neighbor in the early 2000s. ""Kim engaged in politics that embraced the other side,"" he said. ""Today's divisive politics hurt the nation and frustrate the citizens. I miss the former president's politics of integration and his spirit.""In various opinion polls, Moon remains ahead of other opposition politicians mentioned as potential presidential contenders, including Rep.

The thesis was published by the Korean Association of Party Studies.While the percentage of the moderates came at 28.7 percent right after the 19th election, it increased by 6.9 percentage points to 35.6 percent after this year’s election.The ratio of conservatives, meanwhile, dropped by 7.5 percentage points from 40.1 percent four years ago to 32.6 percent this year.The change in the ratio of progressives remained little changed from 31.1 percent in 2012 to 31.6 percent now.The survey was conducted on 1,600 eligible voters between April 20 and May 12 this year. The election was held on April 16. The statistics for 2012 was taken from a survey conducted by Seoul National University’s political research institute. Banners hung during the 20th general election in April The research also pointed out that while the ideological identification among the voters changed, both rivaling parties saw a rise in the portion of supporters who are conservative.The ruling Saenuri Party saw the proportion of conservative supporters rise significantly from 48.7 percent upon the 19th election to 69.0 percent after the 20th election. Progressive supporters for the party, on the other hand, declined from 28.5 percent to 8.9 percent.Meanwhile, the main opposition, The Minjoo Party of Korea, saw the ratio of their progressive supporters remain slightly changed from 51.2 percent to 56.1 percent, while the conservatives surged from 8.9 percent to 18.8 percent. The proportion of moderates, on the other hand, dropped from 38.8 percent to 25.1 percent.Observers noted that while the Minjoo Party appears to have succeeded in bringing in more conservative voters by moderating its progressive agendas and naming conservative Rep. Kim Chong-in as its interim chairman, it has relatively failed in wooing the moderates.In the report professor Ryu noted that, despite their proclaimed political disposition, conservative and progressive voters showed little difference toward specific policies. He also noted that there were many cases in which a conservative voter would support a progressive policy and vice versa. “They can be deemed as voters who can change their position if an issue becomes politicized, despite how there are bigger possibilities of drawing out a consensus when it comes to specific policies,” Rhy was quoted as telling Munhwa Ilbo.","the latest parliamentary election ,latest parliamentary election ,latest parliamentary election the ,research showed on wednesday ,latest parliamentary","['Ryu Jae - sung', 'Keimyung University']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.02206016  0.22354044

The final outbreaks were last reported on the western outskirts of Seoul on April 5.This year's AI outbreak started on March 23 and lasted for only 13 days, which is far shorter than the previous outbreak that had continued for nearly two years between January 2014 and November 2015.The ministry said the government will keep conducting quarantine and surveillance in poultry and in wild birds, and make efforts to resume exports of poultry products to Asian countries including Singapore, which has suspended imports of South Korean eggs since 2014.Some 7 tons of eggs, worth $14,000, were exported to Singapore in 2010.","flu free this week ,flu later this week ,738 poultry farms throughout ,three months the ministry ,bird flu free","['South Korea', 'the World Organization for Animal Health']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23752755  0.19524851

Last month, the U.S. imposed its first-ever sanctions on North Korean leader Kim Jong-un for his roles in the country's human rights violations.The department is required to submit the report by Aug. 17 or within 180 days of the enactment of the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016, which went into effect February in the wake of the North's fourth nuclear test and a long-range rocket launch. As required by the law, the report is expected to include a list of countries that forcibly repatriate refugees from the North, a list of countries where North Korean laborers work, including countries that have formal arrangements with the North or any person acting for or on behalf of the North to employ North Korean workers.The report is also expected to include a plan for bilateral and multilateral outreach, including sustained engagement with the governments of partners and allies to brief them on North Korea human rights issues, as well as public affairs and public diplomacy strategies.About 50,000-60,000 North Koreans are believed to be toiling overseas, mostly in China and Russia and mainly in the mining, logging, textile and construction industries. The average wage was stated as $120 to $150 per month, but in most cases employing firms paid salaries directly to the North's government.The North reportedly receives in the low $100s of millions from this system per year.They are also forced to work usually between 12 and 16 hours, and sometimes up to 20 hours, per day, with only one or two rest days per month, and health and safety measures are often inadequate. Workers are given insufficient daily food rations.North Korea has long been labeled as one of the worst human rights violators. The communist regime does not tolerate dissent, holds hundreds of thousands of people in political prison camps and keeps tight control over outside information. But the North has bristled at such criticism, calling it a U.S.-led attempt to topple its regime.","labor exports this week ,to congress this week ,congress this week ,rights records last month ,exports this week","['the U.S. State Department', 'Congress', ""North Korea 's"", 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'U.S.']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.72682118  0.13880377

Often referred to as the Kim Young-ran law, named after former Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission chief Kim Young-ran who proposed it in 2011, the act puts the threshold for money spent on meals at 30,000 won per person, gifts at 50,000 won and money given for ceremonial occasions limited to 100,000 won.It is intended to curb unlawful solicitation and bribery by public officials, journalists and private school faculty, but has sparked concerns it will have a detrimental impact on overall consumption across the country. Members of an association of agricultural and livestock farmers hold a rally against the antigraft law in Seoul on July 21. “I don’t think there has been a notable impact on sales yet, but we are worried that public officials will be afraid to come after the law takes effect in September,” said a worker at a restaurant near the Defense Ministry in Yongsan-gu, Seoul. Military officials and civilian workers in the military are both constituted as public officials by Korean law, and thereby fall under the influence of the antigraft law.It is customary in Korea to treat business partners to meals or hand out gifts in ceremonial occasions as a token of appreciation or good intent. It is also conventional for public officials to send out gifts during holidays, such as the upcoming Chuseok holidays next month.But there have been consistent concerns that such customs are being used as an excuse for de facto bribery and ultimately a network of corruption across civil and public sectors.The Constitutional Court’s ruling last month turned down challenges against the disputed act and has cleared the way for it to take effect on Sept. 28.Upon the court’s ruling, protests from the agricultural and marine sectors have further escalated.The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries and Small and Medium Business Administration filed for a suspension of the implementation along with adjustment of the spending limits to the Ministry of Government Legislation. The legislative body turned down the request for a delay, and requested arbitration on the spending limits to the Office for Government Policy Coordination.On Monday, the National Assembly’s Agriculture, Food, Rural Affairs, Oceans and Fisheries Committee unanimously adopted a resolution calling for exclusion of agricultural and marine products from being affected by the law citing concerns of drastic cut in demand. The committee said it will deliver the resolution to the State Affairs Committee in charge of the antigraft law.According to the Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs Ministry, about 93 percent of domestically grown beef gift sets are priced over 100,000 won. Some at the ministry estimate the law would cause demand for beef sets to slide to the tune of some 240 billion won. “The law will threaten our survival,” said Kim Young-won, in charge of public relations affairs at the Hanwoo Association. “It might be possible to lower prices of fruit gift sets by reducing the weight of the gifts. It is impossible to do so  because they would make the gifts too small to express gratitude.”A manager of beef restaurant Samwon Garden’s Daechi-dong branch, located in the affluent neighborhood in southern Seoul, agreed, “Yes, we are much concerned about the impact on our sales starting next month.”The decades-old eatery offers 200 grams of marinated Korean sliced beef bulgogi for 37,000 won. The fresh short ribs are sold at 79,000 won for 150 grams. According to Statistics Korea, the average expenditure on dining out per person is about 43,900 won on a meal of Korean food, 29,300 won on Western food, 69,000 won on Japanese and 33,000 won on Chinese.With the introduction of the bill, some restaurants are even cooking up their own “Kim Young-ran menu” designed to not exceed the limit. Seafood cuisine chain Haeuri is slated to launch a 29,000 won dinner set on the day the act kicks off.“The most affordable dinner course was 36,000 won, our chain plans to bring down the price below 30,000 won in order to prevent falls in sales,” said a manager at a Haeuri branch near Namdaemun in central Seoul.Regardless of the last-ditch efforts, some pundits have forecast the anticorruption law to have a significant impact on the Korean economy. According to a June report by the Korea Economic Research Institute, the collective loss in annual sales is expected to be around 11.6 trillion won. In terms of each industry, restaurants are expected to earn 8.5 trillion less, gift-related industries will see their profit fall by 1.97 trillion won and country clubs, primarily for golf, will make 1.1 trillion won less. The country’s Chuseok holidays from Sept. 14-16, where robust exchanging of gifts, usually takes place, are expected to be demonstrate on some level just how much of an impact the Kim Young-ran law has.An official from Lotte Department Store said that while it is preparing a cheaper sets of gift, it will be nearly impossible to make affordable choices for beef and other meats, which have been popular choices for holiday gifts.But some government officials supported the act, saying it will serve as an opportunity to uproot what is sometimes seen as an “excessive” act of hospitality to business partners.“There are not many people who would spend 30,000 won per person at a family dinner.

According to the official, residents said they do not want to meet with Defense Minister Han Min-koo if he only wants to persuade them to accept the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system.“Instead of suggesting any new bargaining chip in talks with local residents, the minister will listen to their opinions about the planned deployment of THAAD,” the official said. If Han manages to begin a dialogue in Seongju next week, it could become a starting point to resolve ongoing disputes over potential health risks linked to the THAAD’s powerful X-band radar, he said. As for the request from Seongju residents for documents that show the site selection process, the ministry said it will provide as much data as it can without violating security rules.On July 8, Seoul and Washington announced a decision to deploy a THAAD battery in South Korea by the end of 2017 to better deal with evolving nuclear and missile threats from North Korea. The two sides then picked Seongju on July 13. Seongju residents are concerned over potential health problems from the THAAD’s radar waves and have called for the deployment plan to be scrapped.","next week for dialogue ,next week said ministry ,defense ministry said friday ,site next week for ,thaad site next week","['South Korea ’s', 'Seongju county', 'U.S.', 'the Defense Ministry']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63207763  0.6019907

Seoul's unification ministry stressed that the closure of the complex was an inevitable decision as North Korea has never stopped its nuclear and missile development, and threatening South Korea's national security.""At a time when North Korea poses  threats, it is nonsense to talk about the reopening of the factory zone,"" Jeong Joon-hee, ministry spokesman, told a regular press briefing.Seoul said that the government places priority on making Pyongyang give up its nuclear weapons program over the resumption of any inter-Korean talks.Critics and opposition lawmakers said the government should seek ways to resume the factory zone, saying that politics and economic activities need to be handled separately.South Korea's decision to close the complex aims to prevent money generated from the factory zone from bankrolling the North's nuclear and missile programs, the government said.Since the opening in 2004, a total of 124 South Korean firms had operated factories at the complex, some 50 kilometers northwest of Seoul, employing more than 54,000 North Korean workers to produce labor-intensive goods, such as clothes and utensils.The companies claimed that the shutdown has incurred more than 1.5 trillion won  in financial losses, saying that the government's financial support is not sufficient to cover their damage.Seoul said that it has provided 336.9 billion won, or 66 percent, of earmarked support funds totaling 500 billion won to the firms.""The government hopes that the companies could normalize their businesses within this year, aided by the government's financial support plan and their self-rescue efforts,"" Jeong said.","months ago seoul shut ,ago seoul shut down ,seoul shut down ,seoul shut down the ,south korea rejects calls","['South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'inter - korean']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49724874  0.41729319

Lee Jung-hyun, a third-term lawmaker loyal to President Park Geun-hye, as its new leader, and chose five new members of the party’s decision-making Supreme Council. The appointment of the party’s leadership to replace the interim one is seen as step in the right direction and comes when Saenuri needs to pull itself together and put up a united front.The biggest challenge for the new cadre of leaders comes from ever-simmering factional strife, which analysts have cited as part of the reason why the ruling party lost in the April general elections and the public remained largely apathetic about the party’s leadership race.“At the moment, addressing factional conflicts would be the most crucial issue for the new leadership to tackle as we have witnessed relentless spats between different party factions before and during the leadership election,” said Lee Chung-hee, politics professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.“Now the new party is in dire need of the kind of leadership that promotes party unity and harmony.”Factional fissures were laid bare during the grueling leadership race that pitted the the newly elected party chairman -- from the “pro-Park” faction -- against those classified as belonging to the “non-Park” faction, or “neutrals,” with no ties to any of the two rival factions.Public apathy towards the Saenuri leadership contest, seen as a prelude to the party’s in-house race for a presidential nomination, reflects the degree to which citizens have been displeased with the party’s persistent factional discord, analysts said.The president herself voiced concerns over the elusive task of overcoming internal strife.“ trust from citizens would be far-fetched if we cannot stand united and if we hate, criticize and distrust one another,” Park said earlier in the day during her congratulatory remarks at the party convention.Another major task for the new leadership is reshaping the party-government relationship, which has long been seen as “vertical,” with the president exerting inconspicuous yet considerable influence on party affairs, analysts said.The two-way relationship should be turned into a more “horizontal one” so that the party can more actively pursue its own policy platforms that would help win back the minds of citizens, observers pointed out.“The new party leadership should ponder how to play a positive role as a coordinator that helps the Park administration stably manage state affairs by talking tough to the president rather than just upholding the wishes of the chief executive,” said political analysts Jun Kye-wan.Forging cooperative ties with the opposition bloc is another challenging task given that the ruling party no longer maintains a majority in the 300-seat National Assembly.Currently, the Saenuri Party holds 129 seats, well shy of a majority, meaning it needs to secure backing from the opposition parties to pass bills. “On various issues, including the passage of the government’s extra budget proposal, the ruling party needs support from the opposition parties,” said Lee Nae-young, a politics professor at Korea University. “Pursuing the politics of cooperation with the opposition bloc ... that is the message voters conveyed to the ruling party during the April parliamentary elections.”The passage of the 11 trillion won  extra budget, in particular, is something that the new leadership must tackle as Seoul pushes forward industrywide restructuring efforts and strives to create new jobs when the national economy is expected to grow at a slower pace than previously anticipated. Gearing the party towards winning next year’s presidential election will be another major task for the new leadership, though any unforeseen mishap could cut short its term and spare it from the Herculean task.The preparations for a presidential election, which may include a personnel overhaul to shore up public trust, are always fraught with bitter in-house rivalries that could reopen cracks in the already fractured party, observers pointed out.“If the leadership were to fail to handle the problems that could flare up in the process of the presidential candidate nomination, the party could suffer yet another serious confusion,”Jun said. “How to craft a fair, democratic primary process could be a challenge for the leadership.”","election victory on tuesday ,hyun third term lawmaker ,tuesday the new leadership ,fresh from its election ,national convention in seoul","['Saenuri Party', 'Seoul', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'Park Geun - hye']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.31285477  0.48337245

We should now revive such values,” Park said.And the role of the incoming leadership, according to the president, is to end the ongoing divides and help the nation stand firm.“We have a history of regaining public trust and renewing the party amid difficult times,” she said.“To achieve such political changes is the mission bestowed upon the Saenuri.”By Bae Hyun-jung","her opening speech for ,tuesday urged the incoming ,hye on tuesday urged ,her opening speech ,in her opening speech","['Park Geun - hye', 'U.S.', 'Saenuri Party ’s']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.08656681  0.21133024

The crackdown against wasteful air conditioning started earlier in the day and fines will be imposed from Thursday after a two-day grace period, said an official at the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy.The move came as electricity consumption hit an all-time high this week amid a drawn-out heat wave. Chae Hee-bong, head of energy resource division at the ministry, told reporters, ""There is the need to cope with a possible problem in the supply of electricity as electricity demand hits all-time highs. ""So, the government decided to crack down in earnest on businesses that leave their doors open while their air conditioning is on,"" Chae said. The crackdown will end on Aug. 26. If a store is found failing to keep its front doors shut while the air conditioning is on, it will first receive a warning without a fine. When the store is found to violate the government's guideline a second time, it will face a fine of 500,000 won. When the store is found to violate the guideline a fifth time, it will face a fine of 3 million won, according to the ministry. The maximum electricity load soared to 83.7 million kilowatts as of 3 p.m. on Monday, beating the previous record of 82.9 million kilowatts on Jan. 21 this year.

The Yeosu Coast Guard confirmed Sunday that a 64-year-old man surnamed Kang and a 44-year-old woman surnamed Cho were found dead while participating in a 1-kilometer swim hosted by the Yeosu Swimming League on the same day.  After passing the halfway point, Kang passed out, and Cho followed suit five minutes later, according to police. The two were rescued from the water by other participants and sent to a nearby hospital.The host organizer came under fire for lack of safety measures as they had only one ambulance ready. Cho had to wait for the first patient Kang to be transported to the hospital. They both were pronounced dead on the same day.According to participants, the meet also began without proper warm-up exercises.“We did not have proper warm-up exercises before the race began,” a participant said to The Korea Herald. “An organizer did mention it regarding warming up, but it wasn’t official or anything so who would care?” Kang’s family members said the organizer was to blame for his death. “My father was a head of an amateur swimming club and had been competing in numerous swimming meets,” said the second son of Kang in despair. “Things all went wrong when the organization suddenly advanced the competition without any announcement beforehand, so my father had to rush into the water, unprepared.” Before the incident, Kang enjoyed indoor swimming as a hobby and had completed 2-kilometer and 3-kilimeter water courses before participating in the tragic event, family members said. Police have started a probe into the deadly accident to investigate whether there were any lacking safety measures.

141,141,Park suggests moving THAAD location within Seongju,"President Park Geun-hye said Thursday that the government may consider deploying an advanced U.S. antimissile shield to a new location within Seongju, in what is seen as reconciliatory a move toward the protesting local residents.She also stood by the necessity and safety of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, urging the ruling camp and the corresponding region to cooperate with the government’s plan.The presid...","President Park Geun-hye said Thursday that the government may consider deploying an advanced U.S. antimissile shield to a new location within Seongju, in what is seen as reconciliatory a move toward the protesting local residents.She also stood by the necessity and safety of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, urging the ruling camp and the corresponding region to cooperate with the government’s plan.The president’s remarks came during a two-hour meeting with 11 lawmakers of the Saenuri Party representing districts in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province. Cheong Wa Dae’s chief of staff Lee Won-jong also attended, accompanied by senior presidential secretaries An Chong-bum and Kim Jae-won.President Park Geun-hye meets with Saenuri Party lawmakers representing Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province on Thursday at Cheong Wa Dae to discuss the disputed deployment of an advanced missile defense system in the region. Yonhap“Considering the concerns from Seongju residents,  will thoroughly review  a new location within Seongju, should the military make relevant recommendations,” Park was quoted as saying by some of the participants.It was Seongju representative Rep. Yi Wan-young who had first suggested the compromise, reflecting the worries that, THAAD’s radar waves would pass directly across residential areas from the original location.The Daegu-North Gyeongsang cluster, collectively referred to as the TK belt, has long been considered a political stronghold for the conservative party and especially for President Park, who was born in Daegu.But since Seoul and Washington last month selected a South Korean artillery unit in Seongju as the location for a THAAD battery, local residents’ feelings toward the government have soured.Their claim is that THAAD’s far-reaching radar system is likely to cause damage to people’s health and agricultural crops, and that the existence of such a powerful military device could also make Seongju a military target if a conflict occurred.Another point of concern has been economic retaliation from China and Russia, both of which see THAAD as part of the U.S. missile program as well as a threat upon their national security.“The electromagnetic waves are nothing to worry about, as a safety test carried out in Guam proved that  is innocuous,” Park told the lawmakers, persuading them of the necessity and safety of the U.S.-initiated defense battery.While the Blue House strove to push ahead with the THAAD plan, some opposition members said that they will visit China next week to meet with ranking diplomatic officials.Rep. Kim Young-ho of The Minjoo Party of Korea and five other first-termers will leave next Monday for Beijing to gather opinion on THAAD deployment and its consequent impact on Korea-China ties, officials said Thursday.A group of Saenuri members, including Gyeonggi Gov. Nam Kyung-pil made a similar visit last month, shortly after the deployment announcement, but China’s key officials did not attend the conference.In a stepped-up protest against Seoul’s THAAD decision, a state-run newspaper in China blamed President Park in an editorial Wednesday for installing the defense system in the Korean Peninsula.Chong Wa Dae, though it refrained from commenting, alluded to some level of disapproval.“It is not appropriate  to answer every question related to diplomatic issues,” said spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk.“The Foreign Ministry will take charge, if necessary.” By Bae Hyun-jung","toward the protesting local ,urging the ruling camp ,move toward the protesting ,protesting local residents she ,the protesting local residents","['Park Geun', 'U.S.', 'Seongju', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44544861  0.34595084

He was standing 2 meters from the end of the belt and 2 meters from the mouth of the crusher below. The managing instructor said he did not hear a scream. The police requested the National Forensic Service do an autopsy to determine the exact cause of Park’s unnatural death. They will also conduct a joint investigation with the region’s labor office to see if there were loopholes in safety management. Park was in Korea on a work visa.

The regulations make it illegal to accept meals exceeding 30,000 won , presents in excess of 50,000 won, and money for congratulations or condolences of over 100,000 won.Stock imageA maximum penalty of three years in prison or a fine of five times the amount they accept in money or valuables can also be applied if they exceed 1 million won in one lump sum or 3 million won in total annually, regardless of whether it is in exchange for favors or related to their work. In addition people in these fields are barred from making improper solicitation for favors.The Constitutional Court ruled the law that goes into effect on Sept. 28 is valid last week, paving the way for it to be implemented.The ruling Saenuri Party, however, said the law should exclude agricultural and fishery goods, as the price ceilings could bring negative impacts on the country's provincial economy.The main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea expressed concerns that the price limit should be revised up to 50,000 won and 100,000 won for meals and gifts, respectively, adding the presidential office should also lend support to revision.Smaller parties, however, claim that the law should be first implemented as stipulated, adding a revision can be made in the future.Political pundits, meanwhile, said there are growing calls for the anti-graft law to be applied to a wider scope of people, such as lawyers and workers at civil advocacy groups, who can exercise considerable control over various aspects of society.","last week political watchers ,political watchers said monday ,nod last week political ,week political watchers ,last week political","[""South Korea 's"", 'Kim Young - run', 'the Anti - Corruption and Civil Rights Commission']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.80920309  0.35969022

One of the disinfectants had contained OIT. The meeting was attended by officials from the KACA and representatives from local air purifier manufacturers including Samsung Electronics, LG, Cuckoo and Winia. YonhapTo improve product safety and dispel public anxiety, companies said they agreed to revise the current regulation standard and ask the Environment Ministry to strengthen control of chemicals used in filters.Currently, electronic home appliances are supervised by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy under the Electrical Appliances Safety Control Act. Air filters are not included in the list for ministry supervision because they are considered electronic components.According to the regulation, the ministry-designated association is in charge of the authentication process for air purifiers. Since 1998, the KACA has been giving Clean Air authentication marks to air purifiers based on the functions of the product, such as deodorization efficiency, noise level and dust collection efficiency. A total of 113 air purifier models from 24 local brands including Samsung Electronics, LG, Coway, Chungho Nice, Winia, Cukcoo, have acquired this Clean Air mark.The revised authentication standard will include stricter safety test for filters. Five chemicals -- OIT, CMIT, PHMG, PGH and MCIT -- will be banned from use in manufacturing filters. These are the chemicals that were found to have been used in toxic humidifier disinfectants, which caused at least 200 deaths since 2011.Substances designated as harmful in other countries and uncertified sterilizing chemicals will also be banned from being used in filters.If a company breaches the above regulations or cannot provide documents to prove product safety, they will not be able to acquire the Clean Air mark.“It is true that the current authentication standard did not fully consider the safety of air purifiers,” one of the attendees at the meeting was quoted as saying.“Although it may seem like 20-20 hindsight, we believe the related ministries and customers will welcome our idea of a stricter authentication process, which is aimed at putting customer safety first before anything” the official added.According to a local news report, 3M sold over 720,000 filters to local companies from 2014 to May this year. This accounts for 80 percent of the total number of filters sold in the market.Amid moves to recall the products out of concern, the corresponding companies last week announced that they would offer free filter replacements to customers.

Kim Moon-soo, a former governor of Gyeonggi Province Political pundits said the move apparently came as Kim has hinted he may run in the presidential race slated for next year.Saenuri's law stipulates a party leader must step down from his or her post 18 months before the presidential election. South Korea's next presidential election is slated for Dec. 20, 2017.Party members have been eyeing Kim's candidacy amid on-going factional infighting that has hurt Saenuri's standing.

Lee Jung-hyun is considered the only pro-Park candidate at present, although Rep.Hong Moon-jong, another Park loyalist, may make a bid soon.The non-Park faction has yet to push for a single candidate to compete with the pro-Park group.The Minjoo Party of Korea, meanwhile, also plans to hold a convention on Aug. 27 to vote on a new leader.So far, three candidates have vowed to join the race. The main opposition party plans to conduct a primary if there are four or more candidates for the top leadership position to limit the number to three.Rep. Lee Jong-kul, a five-term lawmaker, said Wednesday morning that he will also join the race but withdrew after the party's interim leader Kim Chong-in suggested he reconsider his candidacy.","skip saenuri leadership race ,gyeonggi governor to skip ,leadership election said wednesday ,governor to skip ,leadership race kim moon","['Kim Moon - soo', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Kim', 'South Korea']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33807474  0.51366949

During his visit, Chung said the residents, the U.S. Army and the party should establish a committee to discuss the issue, adding that the case cannot be settled by staging protests.Residents have been expressing discontent with the move, questioning the transparency of the decision-making process, as well as the potential risks to their health. They have also staged rallies in both Seongju and Seoul, urging the government to withdraw the plan.Residents stage a mock funeral of the ruling Saenuri Party in Seongju on July 26, 2016.

Incheon National University, which aims to place itself within the country’s top five national universities by 2020, has run the annual volunteer program since last year to enhance its students’ spirit of giving and to enhance their sense of community, the university said.Participants pose for a photograph after their volunteer works in Can Tho, Vietnam. The participants flew to Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam’s center of commerce, and Can Tho, the largest city in the Mekong Delta, from July 6-13. Can Tho is also home to most of the Vietnamese women residing in Korea. Upon arrival in Ho Chi Minh City, the team traveled for about 4 hours and 30 minutes to reach Can Tho. For the next five days, the students gave musical performances and organized recreational activities in partnership with local university students for 250 orphans in the region. The volunteers also visited facilities housing the physically challenged due to their exposure to defoliants to help clean the place and cook Korean traditional food. They also visited homes of two marginalized families to rebuild their houses.Volunteer students of Incheon National Unversity rebuilt a home for local residents in Can Tho, Vietnam. The university prepared for the program a month in advance, by traveling to the destinations and meeting with the local government officials and representatives of the University of Can Tho.It conducted an open audition to select local students who participated in the program and collected donations such as used clothes which were given to orphans in the region. “Volunteering in Vietnam gave a crucial opportunity to the volunteering students and university faculty members to rethink our role as a major national university,” an official from the university said. “We will strive to nurture students’ ability and attitude as a global citizen through various volunteer projects.”Incheon National University, located in the port city of Incheon and established in 1979, has 64 academic departments and programs from 12 colleges.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon recently sent a letter to a former prime minister, political sources said Thursday, a move seen by local political observers here as a sign of his intent to run for Korea's presidential race slated for next year.In the letter sent to Kim Jong-pil, an iconic conservative politician from Chungcheong Province, who was once considered a contender for the presidency, Ban said he will visit once he returns to Korea in January, the sources said. The U.N. chief is also from the Chungcheong region.U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  meets Kim Jong-pil, a former prime minister in Seoul on May 28.The sources added the letter also expressed Ban's gratitude for greeting him during his visit to Korea in May, and asked Kim to give him ""guidance"" in the future as well. Kim, a former prime minister still has symbolic importance even though he has retired from frontline politics.Political pundits said the letter may reflect Ban's wish to seek the country's highest elected office. They added that it could also spark renewed debate, particularly among conservatives on the need to rally behind Ban next year, since there is a scarcity of contenders who could take on liberal candidates in the 2017 election.During his visit to South Korea earlier in the year, Ban said he would ""contemplate"" what he would do as a South Korean citizen when he returns to his home country after completing two terms as the U.N. helmsman at the end of this year.While Ban never clarified his plan, he has been standing at the top of the public survey on preferred potential candidates.According to the survey compiled by local pollster RealMeter on Thursday, Ban's approval rate came to 38 percent, handily beating Moon Jae-in, the former head of the Minjoo Party of Korea whose numbers stood at 31.8 percent.A source in Korea's foreign ministry, meanwhile, said that while some media outlets have raised issue with the possibility that Ban's letter may have been sent through a diplomatic pouch, he said there is nothing unusual if it did. He pointed out that using diplomatic pouches to deliver certain letters is a standing diplomatic tradition.","korea presidential race slated ,for korea presidential race ,presidential race slated for ,presidential race slated ,korea presidential race","['U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Korea', 'Kim Jong - pil', 'Chungcheong Province', 'Ban']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42760834  0.09200516

The Gangwon Pyeongchang Police are seeking an arrest warrant for the driver surnamed Bang. Bang had changed his statement twice. He initially gave false information that the accident occurred as he was changing lanes from the second lane to the first. However, recordings surfaced on social media showing that he had only driven on the first lane. Bang changed his statement, claiming that he had failed to see the cars in front. Shortly after, another recording showed Bang’s bus veering between lanes, igniting accusations of his having dozed off while driving. Bang then claimed that he had been reaching for some gum to curb his drowsiness, effectively admitting to having dozed. According to the police, Bang said he had started feeling drowsy 7 to 9 kilometers away from the site where he crashed into other vehicles. He had been driving at 105 kilometers per hour, over the speed limit of 100 kph. In the pileup of five cars, four women in their 20s died and 37 were injured.  The day before the accident, Bang had driven his tourist bus for five hours from Seoul to the city of Gangneung. The trip had taken double the usual time due to weekend congestion coinciding with the summer holidays. The group on the bus arrived at their accommodation at around 9 p.m. Bang said he dined with the mechanics who had been on the bus, but denied drinking. He told the police he slept in the bus instead of at the accommodation because the latter was “unfamiliar” and “too noisy.” He woke up at around 6 a.m. and spent the day driving around tourist spots.The 57-year-old had worked as a bus driver for 25 years. In 2014, he had his driver’s license revoked after being caught driving under the influence three times. Bang reacquired the license in March 2016.

""The government failed in dealing with the THAAD issue, aggravating risks rather than solving issues.""Local pundits said the remark reflects the internal dispute within Minjoo, as Kim Chong-in, the interim head, has remained relatively neutral on the deployment.Kim also expressed concerns over the THAAD deployment, he said that the party will not oppose the stationing.On Wednesday, a group of lawmakers from Minjoo also made a separate statement against the THAAD.""The deployment will deteriorate the inter-Korean issues, and weaken the international cooperation against the nuke problems,"" the statement said.

163,163,Korean mother-in-law’s mantra: Please cook for my son,"When Kim Eun-ju got married in 2007, she never expected her mother-in-law would call her every day to ask a particular question: What did you feed my son for breakfast today?  　“My mother-in-law would first call me, get my answers and then call my husband to check whether I lied to her or not,” the 39-year-old registered nurse told The Korea Herald. “She would call me every day for the first three months of my m...","When Kim Eun-ju got married in 2007, she never expected her mother-in-law would call her every day to ask a particular question: What did you feed my son for breakfast today?  “My mother-in-law would first call me, get my answers and then call my husband to check whether I lied to her or not,” the 39-year-old registered nurse told The Korea Herald. “She would call me every day for the first three months of my marriage – just to make sure I made him homemade breakfast.”Throughout her 10-year marriage, Kim said she struggled with her work and life balance partly because of her mother-in-law, who insisted all the household chores, especially cooking, were a woman’s job. As a nurse working at a general hospital, Kim would often have full-length nightshifts and catch up on her sleep during the day. But whenever Kim’s mother-in-law saw her husband doing laundry or cleaning, she would get upset and make him stop. She would tell her son: ‘Why on earth do you have to do such trivial work? All my life, my wish was to see you being respected .”“There were many times my mother-in-law interrupted my sleep during the day by calling me, just to ask me what I made my husband for breakfast,” she said. “I was so stressed about it and my mother ended up making side dishes for me -- so I can tell my mother-in-law I made my husband something good every day.”Generation gap among Korean women  South Korea’s family structure has gone through dramatic changes since the 1980s, and so has the collective experience of Korean women. From 2010 to 2014 alone, the number of double-income households increased from 27.9 percent to 31.2 percent. More women in Korea are being educated, participating in the labor force and putting off marriage.  Turbulent relationships between mothers-in-law and their daughters-in-law have been featured countless times in South Korea‘s TV series, films and plays. A scene from MBC‘s drama series ""Iron Lady Cha."" In the 1980s, only about 30 percent of Korean girls enrolled in post-secondary education, whereas 74.6 percent of school girls did so last year. Women’s employment rate also rose from 42.8 percent to 49.5 in the same time period. The average age at first marriage among Korean women increased significantly from 23 in 1981 to 30 this year. The generational dissonance between Korean mothers-in-law – who expects their daughters-in-law to take care of domestic chores and husbands even if they have their own careers – and their “worn-out” daughters-in-law have been prevalently discussed on Korea’s social media. Earlier this month, a citizen journalist’s column on her wish to be treated to a home-cooked dinner by her pregnant daughter-in-law triggered outrage among some netizens on SNS, some even calling it a “piece that belongs to the horror genre.” The netizens asked why the author expects a home-cooked meal -- which requires time and service on top of money – only from her daughter-in-law, not from her own son. “There is a severe generational gap between women born in the 1950s and 60s, and those who were born in the 70s and 80s,” said Hong Seung-ah, a researcher who specializes in women’s work and life balance at the Korean Women’s Development Institute. “While many of the older women spent their lives as housewives, thinking domestic chores and child care are women’s responsibilities, the younger generation value individual happiness and professional ambitions, as well as sharing domestic work with their  spouses.”Hong pointed out that for women in their 50s and older, the idea of sharing domestic responsibilities with their husbands was practically unthinkable, even if they had their own jobs while raising their young children. “They are not really used to the idea of equality at home. Regardless of their employment status, they considered domestic chores as their basic duty . And some of them have trouble coping with the changing gender roles as they are expecting their daughters-in-law to do the same.”Statistics show that Korean men still spend the least hours on domestic chores in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations. As of 2014, Korean women on average spent 3 hours and 25 minutes daily on household chores on weekdays, whereas men only spent 39 minutes. Jeong Eun-ji, a 34-year-old working wife, said Korean mothers in their 50s and older contributed to the gender disparity experienced by young married Korean women at home, by not teaching their sons how to perform household activities while raising them. Her husband, for example, lived with his parents for 34 years until he married Jeong two years ago. Throughout his entire life prior to the marriage, his mother did all household chores for him – preparing his meals, cleaning his room and doing his laundry. She said her younger brother was raised in a similar way – her mother would only make Jeong help her with cooking and other household chores. “It seems like my mother-in-law still wants me to replace her as his caregiver slash his personal chef, instead of treating him like an adult. She once told me, ‘your husband needs somebody to look after him. Otherwise he’s going to skip meals.’ But he’s 36 years old. If he skips meals, let him deal with it. It shouldn’t be his mother’s problem anymore.”A scene from jTBC‘s drama series “Childless Comfort,” which deals with a full-time pharmacist  and her difficult relationship with her mohter-in-law. Between ‘Please rest’ and ‘I appreciate your work’ Lee Mi-yeon, a 38-year-old public servant, thinks of her mother-in-law as a sweet, kind-hearted person. Born in 1948 to farmers in a small rural town, she couldn’t continue her studies after finishing elementary school as she had to care for her eight younger siblings while working in her family farm. After marrying Lee’s father-in-law, a railway worker from a not-so-affluent family, she became a full-time housewife and mother. “She just belongs to a different generation,” Lee said. “That does not make her a bad person.”For Lee’s mother-in-law, making food on national holidays for her grown children is one of her biggest joys. She also takes pride in being respected by her daughters-in-law, usually in the form of being treated to a home-cooked meal. But Lee said it was not always easy getting along with her mother-in-law, who firmly believed that domestic chores should be done by women. Whenever she and her husband visited the parents’ house, only Lee would have to help her make food, while her husband was told to rest. “She would always tell me, ‘I appreciate your hard work,’ while making sure my husband does not set foot in the kitchen,” she said. “She’d tell him: ‘Please rest, you have to rest. It’s your rare chance to relax away from work.’ But, you know, I’m also employed full-time.”Once, Lee was almost late for work because her mother-in-law, who was briefly staying at Lee’s house, insisted Lee must use newly cooked rice for her husband’s breakfast, instead of the left-over made the night before. “She said her son needs to have a proper breakfast with freshly cooked rice,” Lee said. Another time, when Lee’s family went on a camping, her husband ended up grilling the meat at an outdoor barbecue – as he was more experienced with the fire. Her mother-in-law became extremely upset. “She kept saying, ‘He should be eating! He should be eating !” Lee said. “It was as if she was witnessing his son being severely mistreated by others in public.”“My husband repeatedly explained that it’s more common for men to grill meat at a barbecue these days, but it just made her even more upset,” Lee said. Park Soo-ha, a 28-year-old working professional in Seoul, said she had to lie many times to her mother-in-law, especially when she and her husband ate out. Like Kim, Park also received regular phone calls from her mother-in-law, who would always ask her what she made for her husband for dinner each day. “I would just say whatever menu that popped up in my head,” she said. “One day I’d say we ate kimchi stew, the other day I’d say I cooked the meat you sent us a few days back. Should I repeat the same menu from the day before, she would say ‘You ate that again today?’” Once, when Park lied she made galchijjim, braised hairtail, for dinner, Park’s mother-in-law became suspicious. “She asked me to make the same dish and bring it to her house the next time I visit her,” she said. “So I bought the dish at a market and put it in a Tupperware container, to make it look like it’s homemade.”Feeling conflictedDuring her first year as a married woman, Lee Su-bin received an unexpected phone call from her sister-in-law. Lee had just made a reservation at a restaurant for her mother-in-law’s upcoming birthday. “My sister-in-law said, ‘Daughters-in-law are supposed to provide a home-cooked meal for their mothers-in-law’s first birthday that they celebrate as a family. You know that, right?’” Despite the pressure, Lee went ahead with the restaurant plan, as her husband defended Lee on her behalf.But Lee said she felt guilty when her mother-in-law’s birthday returned a year later.“So I just decided to make her a home-cooked birthday dinner just to get it off my chest,” she said.Lee said as a woman who grew up in a gender-specific culture, she finds herself feeling conflicted about such traditional yet sexist expectations on daughters-in-laws.“To be honest, I know that if I had a younger brother and his wife didn’t provide a home-cooked dinner for my mother’s birthday, I would also question her fitness to become the member of our family,” she said. Park, meanwhile, said even her own mother tells her to make sure her husband eats properly. “I make more money than my husband, and I work longer hours than him,” she said. “And still, cooking is considered my responsibility ”Colliding different dreamsIt took some time for Kim’s mother-in-law to understand why Kim needs to catch up on her sleep during the day. She’s never been treated as an inpatient at a general hospital, and has only encountered nurses at small clinics. She simply thought being a nurse at night can’t be “that hard.”“In my mother-in-law’s time, most married women who had a job worked as bookkeepers, domestic workers or teachers,” Kim said. “She said all the nurses she’d encountered are ‘just sitting down’ a lot of the time.”Three years ago, her mother-in-law temporarily moved in to Kim’s house to care for her grandchildren. Her mother-in-law did not understand why Kim was always asleep during the day, and why her son was doing domestic chores.Once, before going to work, Kim was about to have her lunch at home after waking up during the day. But all of a sudden, her mother-in-law started cleaning the fridge and took every item out of it, making the kitchen too cluttered to prepare anything. “I still don’t know why she did that,” Kim said. “I just grabbed a piece of bread on my way to work and cried until I arrived in the hospital. It just felt so unfair.”To tackle the situation, Kim’s husband had to repeatedly explain to his mother, in detail, what Kim has to do at work -- including maintaining reports of patient’s medical histories and providing instant care during medical emergencies.With Kim’s husband’s help, her mother-in-law has changed over the years, albeit reluctantly, she said. She no longer calls Kim during the day. She now asks her own sons for help when preparing for food on holidays. “My mother-in-law said although my husband is her own son, he is still a grown man, and she’s just not comfortable nor used to asking adult male for favors,” Kim said.One of Kim’s mother-in-law’s biggest joys has been ironing her son’s suits. Kim never really understood why, until about four years ago. Having been married to a blue-collar worker, her mother-in-law said she at least hoped her son to be respected by others. To her, a respected man was someone who is highly educated, successful, does not have worry about domestic chores and treated well by his wife and his children. “I’ve always admired women who get to iron suits for her husbands,” Kim’s mother-in-law told her four years ago, while ironing her son’s shirt. “But ironing suits for my spouse has never been one of my lifelong wishes,” Kim said.

Suh Chung-won, an eighth-termer who is said to be considering his candidacy upon the request of the pro-Park Geun-hye clique.Rep. Chung Byoung-gug on Sunday announces his bid for the ruling Saenuri Party’s chairmanship election. Yonhap“I announce my bid in the party’s chairmanship election, seeking to renew the Saenuri and to renovate the nation,” said fifth-termer Chung Byoung-gug during a press conference.“I will restore fundamental conservative values such as liberal democracy, market economy and national security.”The party’s national convention, including its election for new leadership, is slated for Aug. 9.Chung’s key slogan is to end the rampant abuse of power, which has often been pointed out as a social ill that triggers discrimination and violence.“What the people want the most is to put an end to such abuse of power. We should learn from their anger so as to implement disruptive and creative self-reform,” he said.It was the party’s arrogance which made the public turn its back on it in the April 13 general election, resulting in the crushing defeat of the ruling conservative camp, according to Chung.Chung, who served as culture minister in the former Lee Myung-bak administration, is considered a representative member of the non-Park cluster, standing at odds with the pro-Park mainstreamers.Speaking for the pro-Park faction, fourth-termer and former broadcasting announcer Rep. Han Sun-kyo also announced his bid to join in the race, along with other pro-Park members who have already confirmed their candidacy. Among them is Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, a former senior presidential secretary for public affairs, who recently came under fire for allegedly censoring a public broadcasting report on the Sewol ferry sinking in 2014 that had blamed the nation’s coast guard for neglecting rescue duties.“I cannot suddenly turn into a non-Park figure but I will give up all vested rights of the pro-Park faction,” Rep. Han said, calling for self-reflection and unity.The main concern for both factions, however, is whether Rep. Suh Chung-won will also run, in response to calls from pro-presidential members.Last week, former Deputy Prime Minister and ranking pro-Park figure Rep. Choi Kyung-hwan renounced his candidacy, encouraging Rep. Suh to take control of the party. This move drew complaints -- from within and outside the party -- that pro-Park Suh is not fit to achieve the political reforms required of the party.Observers nevertheless speculated that the obvious support from his faction and from the president may eventually push him to accept the challenge.“I appreciate your efforts as the top senior member ,” President Park told Rep. Suh on Friday, during a Blue House luncheon with all 129 members of the Saenuri.By Bae Hyun-jung","leadership race heats up ,the upcoming leadership election ,saenuri leadership race heats ,upcoming leadership election adding ,upcoming leadership election","['Saenuri Party ’s', 'Suh Chung - won']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36940205  0.28285721

When the reporters asked Na to define “the general public” for them, the official reportedly said they are “the 99 percent of all Koreans.” The official, who defined himself as a “person who tries hard to belong to the remaining 1 percent,” also argued that there should be a stricter caste system in Korea, and the general public should accept the fact that equality is nothing but an unattainable illusion. The official also shared his views on the race-based “caste system” that he thinks currently exists in the U.S., claiming that African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans, “don’t even try to climb the social ladder” and have no ambition in politics.“All the senators and representatives have to do is to provide a means of survival for such people in the U.S.,” Na reportedly told reporters.One of the most controversial remarks made by Na that night was his comments on the case of a 19-year-old contract worker who died in May at Guui Station in Seoul. He was killed by an incoming train after getting stuck behind a platform screen door that he was trying to repair.The reporters challenged Na that night, arguing his own children may belong to the 99 percent should they fail to secure full-time employment. “Think about the victim who was killed at Guui station – how would you feel if the victim were your own child?” the reporters asked Na.The official said those who say they empathize with the specific case were “hypocrites” and that he could not really imagine  of such labor accident happening to his own children. A caste-driven society is more “practical” than societies where social mobility is possible and fluid,  he added. The reporters told him that they may publish his remarks and asked him for his official explanation, but he declined to comment further, they said. According to local studies, social immobility is becoming more prevalent among the younger generation in South Korea, especially in terms of their access to education and housing. A report by the Korea institute for Health and Social Affairs showed that as of last year, 89 percent of Koreans in their 20s and 30s who received higher education also had university-educated parents. Following the news report on Friday, all three opposition parties released statements criticizing both Na and the Education Ministry. “Na’s comments are beyond shocking. They give us a sense of despair,” the Minjoo Party of Korea said in a statement. “As his job is to oversee the nation’s education policies, the Education Ministry is also responsible for what he said. The ministry needs to reform itself.”The People’s Party asked for Na’s resignation, while the Justice Ministry asked for an official apology from the government.The Korean Federation of Teachers’ Associations also released a statement, asking for a thorough investigation of the case and disciplinary measures against Na. Na, who passed his civil service examination back in 1993, previously served as the secretary for Education Minister, an administrative officer at Cheong Wa Dae for former President Lee Myung-bak, as well as an officer at the Education Ministry’s University Support Bureau before being promoted to his latest position in March. “Both Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye administrations should provide an explanation on how someone like Na was given such important positions in the ministry, as well as on what grounds he was promoted in March,” said the nongovernmental organization People’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy in a statement, while asking for Na’s permanent expulsion.  By Claire Lee","education official disdainful remark ,on education official disdainful ,education official disdainful ,official disdainful remark high ,controversy grows on education",['Education Ministry'],4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.19117165  0.1465531

Chung Jin-suk, vice floor leader Rep. Kim Do-eup and chief policymaker Rep. Kim Gwang-lim.This was their first official encounter since the presidential office reshuffled its ranking members including the chief of staff. The ruling party established its incumbent leadership last month.The key agenda of the meeting was economic revitalization, a push which has gained further momentum recently in the wake of Britain’s decision to exit the European Union and its consequent impact on the global economy.“Economy is by far the most crucial task,” said the Saenuri Party’s chief Kim, pressing for immediate economic rescue plans.“As a result of Brexit, the global economy has grown vulnerable, while some of our core industries have come to require restructuring.”The party chief also stressed that the restructuring program should not remain at a superficial level but should get to the root of the problem.Presidential Chief of Staff Lee called for unity between the government and ruling party.“What the people want the most is for the government and the ruling party to join hands and stabilize the economy.“The presidential office, ruling party and government will work together to process the labor reform and deregulation bills, which failed to pass the previous Assembly,” Lee said.Saenuri whip Chung, meanwhile, also took time to distance the party from the Blue House ahead of the meeting, namely over criticism of the presidential office lacking communication with the public.“The government and Cheong Wa Dae should change their way of thought, so as to reinforce communication with the people,” he said. He later said during the meeting that the government and the party should work together as a “dream team.”Prime Minister Hwang placed focus on pushing for the extra budget plan set to support the restructuring program for ailing industries, especially the distressed shipbuilding sector.“We have limited time on our hands , but such challenges may be overcome, if we work together for the same goal,” he said.During the gathering, noneconomic issues were also discussed, such as fine dust pollution, toxic humidifier disinfectant aftermaths, follow-up measures for Sewol ferry victims, and the country’s cash-strapped Nuri child care curriculum, according to officials.The three-way talks were originally scheduled to be held on June 17, shortly after the new Assembly kicked off, but was called off due to the Saenuri’s internal feuding.On June 14, the party’s emergency committee decided to reinstate seven controversial defectors who had left the camp in the run-up to the April 13 general election, rekindling the factional divide within the party and widening the gap between the party and the presidential house.At the heart of the dispute was Rep. Yoo Seong-min, Daegu’s fourth-termer and the party’s former floor leader, known for his deep rift with President Park Geun-hye. His return to his home camp has been considered a yardstick of Saenuri’s willingness to overcome the chronic strife between the pro-Park and the non-Park factions.Interim committee chief Kim Hee-ok, who had temporarily boycotted party affairs in protest against the reformists’ decision, resumed his position upon Chung’s apology, to lead the party until it elects new leadership in early August.By Bae Hyun-jung","government met thursday seeking ,the government met thursday ,government met thursday ,thursday seeking to cooperate ,met thursday seeking to","['the Saenuri Party', 'Cabinet', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn ’s', 'National Assembly', 'the Blue House']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47753042  0.57261467

That deadline passed on June 17.The department is expected to submit the report this week as it is unable to delay any longer, and the report is expected to mention the North's leader, the source said on condition of anonymity.

News reports have said that the U.S. is expected to blacklist about 10 North Korean officials. Should Kim be included in the report, he is also expected to be blacklisted.It has been widely believed that the report will include a direct mention of the North's leader after Amb. Robert King, special representative for North Korean human rights issues, strongly suggested it during a visit to Seoul last week.""With regard to human rights, one of the things that has to be reported on is Kim Jong-un's role and so, there will be probably something about him in the report,"" King said at the time in an interview with a TV station in Seoul.King also said the department was doing final checks on the report, and would be able to release the report ""in the next few days, maybe next week or so.""The report is the latest in a series of measures the U.S. is taking to increase pressure on the North.The U.S. has led the U.N.

The KDVA’s scale remains to be seen, but it could be the largest-ever organization in the U.S. with ties to South Korea given that some 3.5 million Americans have served here since the 1950-53 Korean War. U.S. veterans, retired Korean Augmentation Troops to the U.S. Army and South Koreans assisting the USFK are expected to secure full membership, while incumbent servicemen would be given associate status. Following its inception, the group would carry out various programs such as scholarships for the veterans’ families and conferences and seminars on the security of the peninsula.  By Shin Hyon-hee","veterans to launch fraternity ,usfk veterans to launch ,launch fraternity this year ,tuesday the korea defense ,fraternity this year retired","['the U.S. Forces Korea', 'Seoul', 'the Korea Defense Veterans Association', 'Walter Sharp', 'USFK', 'Leon Laporte', 'James Thurman']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22941723  0.4847056

The campaign is the second round of efforts led by VANK to popularize hanbok, following the one launched in January 2015. The civic group asked people to post photos of themselves in the traditional garments on social media with hashtags.  The new campaign also wants people to post photos of calligraphy explaining what hanbok means to them on social media. Participants should then designate three other people to do the same thing. The civic group said it is planning to give hanbok and postcards as gifts to avid participants selected by the end of the year. Launched in 1999, VANK has some 130,000 members enrolled on its website, according to the civic group.Park said the network plans to keep advertising its campaign to its members online so the movement can gain traction and acceptance throughout society.","daily life tuesday proposing ,workplaces once every month ,life tuesday proposing ,life tuesday proposing that ,sending emails to schools","['korean', 'Voluntary Agency Network', 'Korea']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54742259  0.22195315

State media’s recent dispatches signaled the shift in their introductions of Minister of People’s Armed Forces Pak Yong-sik. The ministry had been overseen by the National Defense Commission, the communist state’s potent top governing body, which was dismantled with the launch of the State Affairs Commission during a parliamentary meeting last week. “This indicates that the ministry is now under the control of the cabinet instead of the now-defunct NDC,” said Cheong Seong-chang, head of unification strategy at the Sejong Institute who has been monitoring changes within the North’s top echelons for years. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un  is inducted as chairman of the new State Affairs Commission during a session of the Supreme People’s Assembly on Wednesday in an image carried on June 30 by the Rodong Sinmun. “As a member of the SAC himself, Pak would now have to keep following Kim’s direct orders while actively reflecting instructions from the premier .” Alongside the agency, the Ministry of People’s Security led by Choe Pu-il has also possibly been repositioned within the cabinet or the SAC, given his appointment to the fledgling organization. The perceived transfer indicates the young leader’s ongoing drive to dilute the influence of the powerful, rigid military in his state governance, shying away from his late father’s “songun ” mantra in favor of the party and cabinet playing a greater role, Cheong said. “With the Armed Forces Ministry being in charge of military diplomacy and logistics and welfare programs, the decision was probably intended to facilitate the military’s cooperation in the cabinet’s economic campaign,” he added. “As a result, the military’s traditionally robust standing is relatively weakening, whereas the influences of the party and the cabinet are growing further.” But Seoul’s Unification Ministry remained cautious, saying more analysis is needed to confirm the move. Other experts such as Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, also noted that it was too early to come to a conclusion because Pyongyang had changed the Armed Forces Ministry’s name and then restored it again in the past. “It is to be determined after collecting further information whether the Armed Forces Ministry’s affiliation has actually changed to the cabinet or it remains within the SAC, but with a different name,” ministry spokesperson Jeong Joon-hee said at a regular news briefing. Last Wednesday, North’s rubber-stamp Supreme People’s Assembly unveiled the formation of the SAC and named Kim its chairman, which is the “top position” in the country. But little has since been revealed other than the relaunch of the Committee for the Peaceful Unification of the Fatherland as an independent state organ in charge of inter-Korean affairs, detaching it from the party. In another development, the official Korean Central News Agency on Sunday introduced Ma Won-chun, the formerly director of the NDC’s Designing Department, as from the SAC, though still with the same position.

A chicken skewer, a cube of watermelon, a slice of pickle and a handful of noodles were placed on a food tray. It was prepared as a lunch for elementary school students aged approximately 7 to 12.Not only did the meal seem to lack enough nutritional value for a growing child, but it also seemed unable to justify the fixed price per meal at 3,000-3,500 won .“Why do innocent schoolchildren have to eat this poor meal?” read one comment. “It is really shocking and sad for them,” said another.Hygiene at the school’s kitchen was also found to be inadequate. Some fifth and sixth graders said they sometimes found hair, tissues and plastic pieces in their meals. One government investigation, found that food trays contained up to 5,979 types of bacteria, about 30 times more than would normally be expected.Students at an elementary school in Seoul receive rice cakes and fruit juice as a replacement for a regular school meal, after temporary school staff at some 115 schools in Seoul went on strike on June 23. About 40 percent of temporary workers at schools are cooks in school kitchens. YonhapThe Daejeon Metropolitan Office of Education immediately released an apology and vowed to conduct a special audit into Bongsan Elementary School through a committee comprising parents, civic groups and field experts. As a result, seven faculty staff in the school kitchen, including a nutritionist and cook, lost their jobs.South Korea’s public schools have been providing meals since 2003. A total of 6.14 million students at some 11,700 elementary, middle, high and special schools nationwide were provided meals from Monday to Friday at their schools as of February, according to the Education Ministry. The current School Meals Act states that the local government is responsible for ensuring meals are nutritional and produced in hygienic conditions. After a huge food poisoning scandal broke out in schools in Incheon in 2006, stricter regulations, such as mandatory food service from school-operated kitchens and penalty systems, were introduced. Despite the government and municipalities’ efforts to improve conditions at school kitchens and meals, complaints have continued to grow among students and workers at school kitchens.Jeong Su-bin, a 17-year-old high school student in Suwon, told The Korea Herald that she buys her lunch from a nearby convenience store on her way to school. She said the diverse options to choose for her meal, despite most of them presumably containing significant amounts of preservatives, was the biggest merit of not relying on the school kitchen.“Food at my school is simply not tasty,” said Jeong, adding she normally buys bulgogi kimbap or crab sandwiches. Jeong said she started to buy her own meals after she was told to eat all the leftovers on her food tray. She said she was given a large portion from the staff at the school kitchen, and was forced to eat it all due to the penalty system at her school.“It was like a nightmare. Why do I have to eat bad-tasting food just because it was on my food tray?” asked Jeong.A photo uploaded by a parent of a student at Bongsan Elementary School shows a school meal served at an elementary school. Many of the schools here face problems from food waste, which costs a tremendous amount of money to dispose of each year. According to Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education, at least 2 billion won was spent in 2015 to dispose of 15,970 tons of food waste at schools in Seoul. This accounted for 13.3 percent of the total school support budget provided by the government.Statistics in 2013 showed that an average of 30.8 kilograms of food waste was produced by a single high school student each year, while an average of 15.1 kilograms of food waste was produced by an elementary school student. In order to prevent accumulation of food waste, some schools prepare meals with a minimum amount of ingredients or cook with ingredients that can be stored for a long period of time, leading to poor quality. According to a recent investigation by authorities, 16 schools in North Gyeongsang Province were caught using ingredients that had expired. In order to calm public distrust toward school meals and criticisms from parents, the Education Ministry said Thursday that it would implement active monitoring and conduct evaluations on food service at schools by checking a photo uploaded by the school kitchen every day of the meal distributed on the food tray. The ministry explained that it was to offer a transparent food service system that was open and accessible to all students, parents and authorities.Those who do not upload a photo will be given a penalty point during the food service evaluation that is conducted twice a year by the local government. However, industry workers point to what they see as a more fundamental cause -- the need for better working conditions for cooking staff. They added that cooking staff, mostly temporary workers, are faced with discriminatory treatment at the workplace compared to nutritionists.“There is a big gap in treatment between nutritionists and cooking staff at school kitchens. A lot of the cooks are very often neglected and treated unfairly,” said Kim Jin-sook, head of the nutritionist association, citing a lack of communication between them as another big issue. “A reduced workload and an improved labor environment for the cooking staff would naturally lead to better quality of school meals,” said an official from the labor union for temporary workers at schools.According to the current Enforcement Decree of the School Meal Act, the related regulation only addresses the duty and role of a nutrition teacher, someone who, as a licensed teacher, should be able to “guide and supervise the kitchen staff.”By Kim Da-sol","school meal complaints grow ,school meal complaints ,lunch for elementary school ,social media chicken skewer ,photo of school lunch",['Bongsan Elementary School'],4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32510599  0.05858001

This is the first time a heatstroke death has been reported in South Korea this year.Korea has endured unusually warm weather this year since spring. The average temperature in May was 18.6 degrees Celsius this year, making it the warmest May dating back to 1973. The highest temperature during the month was 32.4 degrees on May 19 in Ichon, Gyeonggi Province.Last year, the first heatstroke death was reported on July 28, much later than this year’s case that occurred on June 25.“We recommend all citizens be careful of the heat, especially children, the elderly, those who work outdoors and those with chronic health conditions,” said the Health Ministry in a statement issued Wednesday. The Korea Centers for Disease Prevention and Control have been monitoring Koreans who seek medical help for heat-related illnesses since May 23. From May 23 to June 25, 122 Koreans were treated for such ailments, including heatstroke. Last year, fewer patients – 101 -- visited health clinics for heat-related conditions in the same time period.Among the 122 patients reported this year, 71 percent of them were male. Also, 30.7 percent of all patients were aged 65 or older. The largest number of them, 61 individuals, were brought to medical professionals because of heat exhaustion, followed by those who had hyperthermia  and heat cramps . Almost 87 percent of them developed heat-related ailments after spending time outdoors, such as farms and mountains.In order to prevent heatstroke, the Health Ministry recommends wearing lightweight, light-colored clothing, using sunscreen and drinking extra fluids. It’s generally recommended to drink at least eight glasses of water daily during summer. Last year, 1,056 Koreans sought medical help for heat-related conditions. Among them, 11 died.

Extra meetings are scheduled to be held for three consecutive days from July 4, with both sides set to present revised proposals. Minimum Wage Council chairman Park Joon-sung leaves the meeting after failing to meet the legal deadline, in Sejong City on Wednesday. YonhapLabor representatives demand next year’s hourly minimum wage be raised to 10,000 won  from this year’s 6,030 won. They argue the hike would curb the nation’s income inequality, improve living standards of low-income workers and boost the economy by spurring consumer spending. Business leaders campaign for a freeze, saying that the minimum wage has risen too rapidly and needs to be stabilized. They also claim that soaring labor costs will take a toll on small and medium-sized enterprises and result in job losses for low-skilled workers. Through seven rounds of plenary sessions, the Minimum Wage Council decided to stipulate hourly wages as well as monthly wages in employment contracts, an attempt to better protect workers’ rights to be entitled to one paid holiday for five working days. Since the government adopted the minimum wage in 1988, the 27-member Minimum Wage Council, consisting of nine members each from labor, management and the public sector, has set the minimum wage through discussion.

America, very much defined by car culture, is seeing lowering importance of getting a car.

America, very much defined by car culture, is seeing lowering importance of getting a car. An interesting shift over the last five years,” Cook said in an interview with The Korea Herald.He explained that many drivers in the U.S. are choosing electric vehicles as the first option, wanting to move away from gasoline and fossil fuels, as they recognize the impact when they switch the transportation mode.Amid the fast-changing consumer attitude for greener options, big names such as Facebook and Google are also contributing to the environment-friendly movement.  Gary Cook, a senior IT analyst at Greenpeace, poses during the interview with The Korea Herald. Greenpeace has initiated the “Cool IT Campaign,” urging IT companies to adopt renewable energy and power technological solutions in order to fight climate change. At least 16 companies including Facebook, Google Softbank, Apple and eBay have been participating in this campaign since 2011.According to a Greenpeace report, when IT companies mitigate their own carbon footprints, they can deliver approximately 7.8 gigatons of equivalent carbon dioxide emissions savings by 2020. By improving energy efficiency in power transmission and distribution in buildings and factories as well as in the use of transportation to deliver goods, these companies can also deliver carbon savings five times larger than the total emissions from the entire IT sector by 2020.What the campaign asks for is simple. It recommends companies to break the cycle in which “computing is in the cloud, the cloud is driven by data centers and these data centers are overwhelmingly powered by dirty coal-fired plants.”“We asked these companies, look, you’re incredibly innovative company, changing the world, but your current growth with your data center investments are in fact increasing demand for coal,” he said.Last year, Naver also joined the move as the first Asian company to do so. “Naver is the first Asian company to commit to be 100 percent powered by renewable energy among IT companies. But we still need policies to open the market first and you also need policies to help the drive of the use of renewable energy at scale,” added Cook.Greenpeace data in 2013 showed that an average datac enter in Korea consumes at least 2.6 billion kilowatt-hour per year. This figure is a fivefold rise from 2006, since at least 50 million users are enjoying the perks of speedy Internet in the wired country. Korea is the second largest country in the world to produce the largest traffic, followed by the United States, as of 2013.Cloud computing, for all its virtual advantages, relies on brick-and-mortar data storage infrastructure. Thanks to this, individuals can store unlimited media instead of filling up hard drives, but electricity consumption required to power the cloud is soaring. And the overwhelming source is coal.According to Jude Lee, a senior climate and energy campaigner at Greenpeace Korea, that is why the way these companies provide services is becoming significant.“If they are providing services by killing our earth that we are standing on, they are going the opposite of their industry philosophy. So, that’s why most of the IT sectors agree with using renewable energy,” said Lee. Gary Cook, a senior IT analyst at Greenpeace and Jude Lee, a senior climate and energy campaigner at Greenpeace Korea, talk during an interview with The Korea Herald. As the campaign is quickly gathering momentum, Greenpeace is actually seeing a race within the IT sector.“That race is starting to spread to other sectors, where renewable energy is becoming a critical part of not only for brand identity, but also the smart business,” Cook said. But Cook stressed that the current government lacks a holistic view in viewing the whole energy system in Korea.“You are beginning to see some movement, but the policies are far behind,” said Cook.“Policies in the U.S. have been really pushing toward the targets, maybe utilities have initially resisted that move, but now they actually showed they can meet the goal so the municipalities are gradually raising the target,” he added. In the U.S., California is already roughly 20 percent powered by renewable energy. The state is aiming to become 50 percent powered by renewable energy by 2030.“Policies matter a lot. Both Korea and U.S. have IT sectors and we see that they are driving the movement and now, how they define innovation is being increasingly defined by how much green energy they use,“Ultimately it needs leadership in the beginning, to get moving,” added Cook. Amid mounting worries over fine dust here, Cook said that one of the biggest contributing factors comes from coal-fired power plants.In South Korea, there 53 coal power plants predominantly located in the Chungcheong-do area. In order to meet expanding demand for electricity, the South Korean government recently proposed to build at least 20 more coal-fired power plants by 2030.“From an environmental perception, we cannot afford more coal fired power consumptions. In U.S., we are actually shutting down coal plants,” said Cook.According to an article on Guardian published earlier this year, America’s use of coal for electricity dropped to its lowest point on historical record in 2015 – it accounted for just 34 percent of U.S. electricity generation last year, the Sustainable Energy in America data was quoted as saying. In 2014, coal made up 39 percent of electricity supply.Coal has been long defined as the dirtiest of fossil fuels and America’s biggest single source of climate pollution. “Coal is no longer a part of the question. No one is proposing new coal plants in the U.S. It is question of which ones are going to be shut down in what order,” added him.He added that not only big companies but also individuals can contribute to make the world greener. “Solar has been a huge growth in many parts of the U.S., as consumers can install solar panels with the least payment as companies will come and change them regularly according to regulation,” he said.“It is a win-win strategy, which is better for the environment and better for the pocketbook,” he said.In the same vein, Lee also underlined the importance of the power that consumers have.“Consumers have a lot of power. They can send strong messages and signals to companies which operate in unsustainable ways,” she said.“We -- as informed digital citizens -- have the power to demand IT move away from dirty energy, embracing renewables instead,” she added.By Kim Da-sol","last five years cook ,delay getting their driver ,cook senior it analyst ,five years cook ,green gary cook senior","['Gary Cook', 'Greenpeace', 'the United States', 'America', 'Cook', 'the Korea Herald']",4,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.80220699  0.37071145

The bottom line is we take all missile launches seriously and consider these actions provocative in nature,"" Cmdr. Gary Ross, a Pentagon spokesman, told Yonhap News Agency. ""We strongly condemn this and other North Korean missile launches in violation of U.N. Security Council Resolutions, which explicitly prohibit North Korea's use of ballistic missile technology,"" he said.The KCNA said the missile flew out of the atmosphere as it soared to an altitude of 1,413.6 kilometers before successfully re-entering the atmosphere and landing in the targeted waters about 400 kilometers away from the launching site. If confirmed, the launch would mark important progress in the North's missile program as re-entry technology has been considered one of the hardest parts the North must overcome before developing a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile.","wednesday on north korea ,department declined comment wednesday ,wednesday test ,declined comment wednesday on ,declines comment on korea","['the U.S. Defense Department', ""North Korea 's"", 'U.S.', 'Korean Central News Agency', 'Musudan']",4,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.00360792 0.35135153 0.56947654],KH디지털2,North Korea,6,2016,"wednesday on north korea claims ,defense department declined comment wednesday ,korean missile launches in violation ,comment wednesday on north korea ,other north korean missile launches","['the U.S. Defense Department', ""North Korea 's"", 'U.S.', 'Korean Central News Agency', 'Musudan', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Cmdr', 'Gary Ross', 'Pentagon', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'north korean', 'U.N.

Had the North wanted to fly the missile longer, it could have used the Dongchang-ri or Sohae launching site in the country's west, instead of firing the missile from the east coast.The western site ""has a clear range as far south as the Philippines and has been used for their Unha space launches,"" he said, referring to a series of long-range rocket launches that the North has carried out, including one conducted in February.""More importantly, the second test launch was conducted only hours after the first one reportedly broke up in flight. That's not nearly long enough to figure out what went wrong, much less fix it.Even the month or so since the last test isn't really long enough for that,"" Schilling said. ""So these can't be real tests in the engineering sense, where one is trying to find and fix problems so as to build a reliable system,"" he said. ""This only makes sense as a desperate attempt to achieve, by luck if nothing else, something close enough to a success to be used for some propaganda purpose even as they have no way of knowing why one missile managed to fly as far as it did, while all the others failed completely."" The North will hold a meeting of its rubber-stamp parliament, the Supreme People's Assembly, one week from now, and Wednesday's launches could be lauded as a key achievement of leader Kim Jong-un following the North's fourth nuclear test in January and February's long-range rocket launch.The North first test-launched the Musudan missile on April 15.All but the last and sixth launch failed, with the missile exploding in midair or on a mobile launcher, or crashing seconds after launch.The U.S. condemned the latest launches and said it will raise the issue at the U.N.

She usually posts selfies, photos of food she ate and sometimes pictures of her dog. “I usually post something before I go to bed,” she said. “And it feels nice to wake up in the morning and find out how people responded. It’s like my morning ritual.”Kim said she is addicted to her smartphone “just as much as everyone else she knows.” She carries it with her everywhere, all the time, every day. She charges her phone by the bed every night. One of her biggest anxieties in fact has to do with the battery dying. “I get anxious whenever I forget my phone charger,” she said. “It feels like I’m missing out on life when my phone is dead. I have no problem admitting that a big portion of my life exists in the online world. And it’s not just me -- most people are connected in KakaoTalk group chat rooms as much as they are in offline gatherings.”123rfKim is one of many South Korean women who spend a significant amount of their time socializing via smartphone apps and social media. A recent study by Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital, in fact, found that Korean women are twice more likely to be addicted to smart devices as their male counterparts. For the study, psychiatrists at the hospital surveyed 2,281 women and 2,573 men. Among the female participants, 17.9 percent were addicted to their smartphones, while only 9.4 percent of the surveyed men experienced the same. “We assume one of the reasons behind the statistics is that women tend to form more social relationships online than men do,” said Kim Dae-jin, a psychiatrist who organized the study.The study also found that depression and high activity of the behavioral inhibition system is related to smartphone addiction among South Koreans. Koreans who were depressed or had high activity of the BIS -- meaning they tend to avoid human interactions and conflicts in order to prevent negative emotions such as fear, sadness and anxiety -- were more likely to be addicted to smartphones and have a limited social network offline.  A study last year by the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs found that Korean women, especially those who are financially and socially vulnerable, were much more prone to depression than their male counterparts. While 9.1 percent of all Korean women experience the mental condition at least once in their lives, only 4.3 percent of Korean men go through the same, according to the study. Notably, 31.7 percent of Korean women who never attended high school have been depressed in the past, the study showed. Reasons included poor work and life balance, postpartum stress and domestic abuse experienced during childhood.The study by Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital claimed that smartphone addiction is, in some ways, a form of escapism for those who are depressed. “When one is stressed and experiencing negative emotions, it’s natural for him or her to find a place where they can be free from their fear and anxieties,” the report said. “The online world gives people anonymity and therefore gives them a chance to be somebody else, and act differently. This can be addictive to those who are unhappy with themselves in the offline world, because you don’t get the kind of endorsements you get online in your real life.”In terms of those with high activity of the BIS, researchers said interacting online can be less stressful for those who are afraid of human conflicts or difficult relationships. “Those who are highly sensitive to negative emotions tend to prefer socializing online, because they want to avoid conflicts that can occur when interacting with others in person. And they feel they can protect themselves better online, as they can be anonymous.”Kim said she is just as social offline as she is online, but agreed that avoiding those she doesn’t want to associate with is much easier in the virtual world. “You can easily cut them off by blocking them or just erasing your account altogether,” she said. “I guess it’s both convenient and somewhat sad at the same time.”By Claire Lee","addicted to her smartphone ,her instagram she usually ,checking her instagram she ,checking her instagram ,instagram she usually posts","['Kim Ji - yeon', 'Seoulite']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.7397027   0.12887761

If the lifting proceeds smoothly, the ferry may be brought to the surface by late July, experts anticipate.

Lifting a 6,825-ton wreck in such a method has never before been tried, authorities added. A naval architect involved in the operation had projected the success rate of the operation at 80 percent during a briefing in April. The Sewol ferry was carrying 476 people -- mostly students on a school trip -- when it sank off the southwestern island of Jindo in April 2014. Just 172 passengers were rescued. Nine remain missing.Bringing the ferry to land has been a key demand of the victims’ families.

Ahn Cheol-soo of the People’s Party already finds himself trapped between a nose-diving party approval rating and an illicit fund probe concerning some of his closest aides.Whether or not he succeeds in pulling the fledgling centrist opposition party out of the current trials will also act as a leadership barometer, judging his qualifications for the 2017 presidential election, in which he is expected to make a bid. “Regardless of what happened, I am sorry to cause anxiety to the people,” Ahn said Friday over the ongoing allegations that one of the party’s proportional representatives took illicit funds during the April 13 general election campaigns.This was a compromising turn from his stout response the previous day, in which he said that “the given allegations are not true.”The National Election Commission on Thursday had reported Rep. Kim Su-min to the prosecution, charging her with taking up to hundreds of millions of won in political funds earlier this year.According to the election watchdog, two local advertisement companies in charge of the party‘s campaign promotion transferred 238.2 million won  to an account owned by a hotel that Kim used to run, but the detailed use of the money remained unclear.The lawmaker denied the given charges, but has so far refrained from explaining any further.Amid growing public reproach, Ahn quickly promised to establish an internal investigation team to look into the claims, in a preemptive attempt to eradicate the controversy once and for all.“We will look into every detail, including on Kim’s proportional representative nomination, and disclose everything to the people,” he told reporters Saturday.The greatest dilemma for the runner-up opposition party, which has been built on the promise of “new politics,” is that one of its core founding members is involved in the dishonorable charge.One of the allegations is that the political novice Kim, who also happens to be the youngest member of the new legislature, had acted under the direction of party leadership, especially then-secretary general Rep. Park Sun-sook, and thus won herself the nomination for the proportional representation.The fact that Kim had not even asked for the position further boosted suspicion that party leadership -- possibly Rep. Ahn himself -- may have been involved. The beleaguered party chief turned out to have interviewed Kim in a closed-door session, shortly before the party kicked off its proportional representative nomination committee.The illicit fund probe came at a time when the No. 3 party‘s approval rating was faltering upon the swift rise of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as a potential presidential candidate speaking for the ruling conservative Saenuri Party.According to a survey conducted by local pollster Gallup Korea on June 7-9 of 1,002 voters here, the support rate for Ahn stood at 10 percent. He thus fell to No. 3 behind Ban, who accounted for 26 percent, and The Minjoo Party of Korea’s former chief Moon Jae-in, who won 16 percent.Observers noted that a large number of reformist swing votes flocked from Ahn to Ban, preferring his reputed career as reelected chief of the international organization.By Bae Hyun-jung","hit by political double ,political double whammy ,by political double whammy ,soo hit by political ,political double whammy the","['National Assembly', 'Ahn Cheol', 'the People ’s Party']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32591689  0.21487771

Pyo Chang-won of the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea said on Twitter on Wednesday that his office at the National Assembly would not answer any the telephone calls between 12 p.m. and 1 p.m., and between 6 p.m. and 9 a.m. during the weekdays. The move -- considered bold in the country notorious for long working hours -- was met with mixed reactions. South Korea’s average yearly working hours reached 2,285 in 2015, the longest of any OECD member.Unlike private companies and government agencies, there was no rule governing working hours for lawmakers. “I think we can work more efficiently by separating when to work and when to take a break,” Pyo said. The former criminology professor has gained fame by being the country‘s first profiler and for his biting criticisms of the established system and President Park Geun-hye’s stance on civil liberty. He joined politics last year and won a seat in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province.The 50-year-old said that his aides and staff were often forced to work overtime to respond to calls from ordinary citizens and reporters. Those working at other lawmakers’ offices said that the former police officer’s celebrity status tended to attract more calls than the other first-term lawmakers. Instead, the opposition lawmaker vowed to communicate more frequently via online platforms by keeping communication channels open at all times.  Rep. Pyo Chang-won, a first-term lawmaker of the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea. Kim Myung-sub/The Korea HeraldTo make the case for his decision, Pyo cited the Labor Standards Act, which governs conditions for workers in South Korea. The regulation, implemented in 2014, stipulates that workers shall not work no longer than 8 hours per day and 40 hours per week. It also limits overtime to 12 hours per week.Pyo’s decision was welcomed by some parliamentary aides who said their work was often distracted by “frivolous” phone calls leaving them less time to actually work on sorting out requests from their constituents.“Not answering to calls doesn’t mean leaving the office and going home,” 33-year-old staff aide to an opposition lawmaker’s office. “Using telephone is not the only method to file a request or complain. I don’t think it should be taken for granted that the aides stay late at the office to answer calls,” the staff said, wishing to remain unnamed.But some citizens cautioned that the decision would hamper the work ethics among public servants. “A lawmaker’s office is not a bank ,” Yoon Gye-hun, 30-year-old office worker in Seoul, saying that the Assembly already enjoys superiority in authority over most stakeholders trying to reach out to the lawmakers.By Yeo Jun-suk","working hours police turned ,hours police turned lawmaker ,on twitter on wednesday ,on working hours police ,working hours police","['Pyo Chang - won', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Twitter', 'the National Assembly']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.69711053  0.07562061

Park vetoed the contentious bill, drawing the ire of the opposition parties.Seeking to reset her ties with the opposition camp, Park will deliver a speech to mark the launch of the new legislature, which officially began its four-year term on May 30.The schedule for her speech at the assembly has yet to be finalized. But the presidential Cheong Wa Dae said that it is ""customary"" for the chief executive to deliver a speech to celebrate the launch of parliament.The speech is likely to be designed to drum up legislative support for her drive to create jobs and reinvigorate the economy, and reset relations with the newly-elected assembly on a high note, political observers said.With assembly speaker Rep. Chung Sye-kyun having cut affiliation with the Minjoo Party of Korea, the main opposition party now has 122 seats in the 300-member assembly -- the same number of seats for the ruling Saenuri Party.

Chung was voted in as the speaker for the first half of the 20th National Assembly at the plenary session of parliament.Chung will be obligated to sever party ties during his two-year term.The appointment of the speaker, which was deadlocked after the new parliament began its four year term on May 30, came about after the ruling Saenuri Party agreed to let Minjoo take the speaker's post on Wednesday. In exchange, it secured the right to appoint the chairs for the critical house steering and legislation committees.The latter, in particular, can hold up bills from being put to a vote in the plenary session.Saenuri and Minjoo had been fighting over the speaker post, especially as the April 13 election showed no concrete winner.Saenuri won 122 seats compared to the Minjoo's 123 in the 300-seat unicameral parliament with the rest being taken by minor parties and independents. ""I wanted to become the speaker as I believed this would be the best opportunity for me to do what I can for the country, parliament and our party,"" Chung said after the nomination, adding the parliament is facing a grave period amid signs of economic crisis and the incumbent administration inability to push for change.Besides the speakers, lawmakers voted for Saenuri's Rep. Shim Jae-chul and People's Party tapped Rep. Park Joo-sun as the new vice speakers. Shim is a five-term lawmaker while Park has been elected four times.Following Chung's inauguration, Saenuri and Minjoo now hold an equal number of seats in the National Assembly.

C. Johnson & Son, Aekyung, SK Planet, Daiso and more. They either produce or distribute the 15 types of household products that come under the ministry’s direct supervision.According to the revised Chemical Registration and Assessment Act that took effect last year, the ministry is responsible for overseeing the safety of 15 new types of household products including detergents, bleaches, fabric conditioners, coating agents, air fresheners, preservatives, insecticides, antiseptics, tattoo dyes, coloring bleaches, antifogging agents and antirust additives. Under the ministry agenda, companies that signed MOUs are required to submit a list of the chemicals used in their products and the amount and purpose of those chemicals by June 25. After the ministry assesses the products’ safety, products with high health risks will immediately be ordered to be recalled or banned from sales. The results of assessments will also be made public. For companies that did not wish to sign an MOU, the ministry still has sent an official letter to require them to hand in the list of substances, based on the current law. Those who do not turn in the list by the end of this month could be fined up to 10 million won .“This is just the beginning for the ministry to ensure the safety of household products, and we will complete a survey on all such products by the end of this year and expand into all biocide-containing industrial and electronic goods from next year,” said Vice Environment Minister Jeong Yeon-man.Vice Environment Minister Jeong Yeon-man  attends a meeting with the toxic humidifier disinfectant victims in Seoul on June 7. The ministry also plans to join hands with the Ministry of Public Safety and Security to host a nationwide campaign in August.

The teacher’s rape by three locals has sparked criticism against the lack of safety measures and flagrant disregard for the rights of women and teachers in rural areas.The regional government’s homepage is being bombarded with comments on the case and incompetence of the local officials, which some say was the cause for the attack. More than 300 messages called for the governor’s resignation, while some said they would boycott the sea salt produced in the region.The police revealed details of the case on June 3. The victim’s distress call came in the wee hours of May 22.According to police, the victim had dinner at one of the local restaurants where she was asked to join the three suspects, two of whom are parents of children at her school. The men insisted that the victim drink, despite her repeated refusal as she had plans to explore the village the next day.Once the victim was inebriated, one of the men volunteered to drop her home and raped her at her residence, followed by the other two. The teachers’ residence, a detached house where four female teachers lived, does not have a gate and the nearest CCTV is located over a kilometer away. The victim reported the crime to the police when she regained consciousness. Her soiled clothes and blankets were taken in as evidence. In the morning the victim went to a hospital where DNA evidence was collected from her body. Tests have matched the evidence collected from the victim with those of the three suspects. The police are currently investigating whether this was a premeditated crime, taking into consideration the rape occurred close to the end of her contract as a temporary teacher and she was planning to leave the island.

Kim reasserted the need to raise safety measures in far-flung areas and the Education Ministry’s responsibility to enhance the female teachers’ social position.  The South Jeolla Office of Education said it plans to help transfer the victim to a school of her choice, as well as grant her a leave of absence and sick leave. It will hire a lawyer for the victim if the case goes to court.The office said it will run a check on all female teachers’ residences in the remote islands of South Jeolla Province. The Ministry of Education will follow up with nationwide security checks on teachers’ residences.

The survey was conducted on 1,004 South Koreans.While Park's approval rating stood at 43 percent earlier in April, it slipped to as low as 29 percent after the ruling Saenuri Party suffered a defeat against the major opposition Minjoo Party of Korea and splinter People's Party. In the election, Saenuri only managed to grab 122 seats vis-a-vis 123 for the Minjoo Party and 38 for the People's Party.Gallup Korea said a rising number of respondents cited her achievements in international relations and diplomacy as the main reason for the approval.By party, Saenuri led the list with an approval rating of 29 percent, but it edged down 1 percentage point from a week earlier.Its major rival Minjoo Party advanced 1 percentage point over the cited period to 27 percent, its highest level reached in 2016.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon emerged as the most favored potential presidential candidate for next year's election, a poll showed Thursday, bypassing long-established hopefuls in the opposition parties.According to the survey conducted by Realmeter on 2,018 South Koreans earlier this week, Ban held an approval rate of 25.3 percent, outpacing other potential candidates. It marked the first time for Ban to be included in the Realmeter survey, which is one of the key barometers to gauge public sentiment.During his visit to Seoul last month, Ban said he would ""contemplate"" what he would do as a South Korean citizen when he returns to his home country after completing his two terms as U.N. helmsman at the end of this year. He did not directly deny the speculation that he will run for the presidency. Political watchers said if he opts to run, Ban will probably seek the ruling Saenuri Party's ticket, which can put a dent in the opposition's plans for regime change in 2018.Moon Jae-in, former leader of the Minjoo Party of Korea, held 22.2 percent, up 0.7 percentage point from a week earlier. Ahn Cheol-soo, co-chairman of the minor People's Party, saw his approval rate drop 3.2 percentage points to 12.9 percent. Realmeter said if Ban runs for president the race slated for late next year will become a contest between the U.N. chief and Moon. Until Ban hinted at his political ambitions, many here believed the race would pit Moon against Ahn, with any ruling party candidate coming in third. President Park Geun-hye's approval rating stood at 36.1 percent, up a noticeable 2.2 percentage points from a week earlier.The disapproval rating edged down 1.6 percentage points over the cited period to reach 59.7 percent.The ruling Saenuri Party held an approval rating of 30.1 percent, while the main opposition Minjoo Party managed to narrow its gap with its rival by rising 3.4 percentage points to 29.8 percent.

Security Council sanctions on Pyongyang, which are considered the toughest ever to be imposed on the North, and China has expressed its determination to fully carry out the sanctions. ""The outcome that we're looking for is North Korean agreement to negotiate the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. That's not unconditional surrender,"" Russel said. ""That is a reasonable and consistent objective of ours. We have a vastly improved chance of getting there with China's full cooperation and we intend to use the S&ED; to game out how we can speed up the outcome that we're both working to achieve,"" he added.Russel rejected the term ""strategic patience"" to refer to the U.S. policy on the North.""I think that was at the time a badly misunderstood concept, and right now I think the phrase that captures our strategy more succinctly is U.N.

The widespread view is that he would seek to warm relations with Beijing at a time of growing international pressure on Pyongyang.On Tuesday, Ri held talks with his Chinese counterpart, Song Tao, minister of the International Department of the Chinese Communist Party, and they agreed to ""strengthen exchanges and cooperation between the two parties,"" the Chinese Communist Party said in a statement.

The National Assembly The ruling Saenuri Party prioritized drafting bills designed to support President Park Geun-hye’s major economic and security initiatives such as business deregulation, labor market overhaul and counterterrorism measures. The main opposition’s top agenda involves seeking measures to address social issues such as compensating the victims of toxic humidifier disinfectant and the Sewol ferry sinking, and funding of the state-led child care program. “Since we face many challenges on the economic and security front, I am hoping that  the 20th National Assembly will devote themselves to improving the people’s lives and serving their interests,” said President Park on Monday in a message released during her visit to Uganda. But a legislative impasse looms large as the three mainstream parties remain deadlocked over how to assign key parliamentary positons and whether to revisit controversial bills that failed to clear the previous Assembly. One of the key issues roiling the upcoming parliamentary session is a bill vetoed by the president last week that grants lawmakers the authority to hold parliamentary hearings on a wider range of issues. The rivaling lawmakers’ views clash over whether they can revote on the bill in the new session.  While the Saenuri Party contends that the bill has been scrapped with the ending of the 19th Assembly, The Minjoo Party of Korea and People’s Party claimed that the bill can still be put to a vote during the upcoming plenary session. On the first day of the new Assembly, the parties gathered their newly-elected lawmakers to share their main legislative goals and take steps to elect new leaderships.The Saenuri Party officially endorsed Kim Hee-ok, a former chief of Government Public Ethic Committee, as the chairman of emergency committee. The party also named a total of nine bills as “major” legislative agenda, including the one designed to address youth unemployment and others related to business deregulation, labor reforms and counterterrorism efforts. The party had proposed similar legislations during the previous assembly, but failed to get them passed due to the pushback from opposition parties. The opposition parties have again vowed to not budge on their stance during the new term. The Minjoo Party members, on their part, announced that they would hold a national convention on Aug. 27 to elect their leadership. The new leadership would replace current leader Rep. Kim chong-in who has been serving as an interim chief since January.  They also vowed to enact bills designed to compensate victims of toxic humidifier disinfectant and the Sewol ferry sinking, and to seek a parliamentary tool to investigate the tragedies and punish those accountable. Another major bill involves implementing measures to fund the state-led free child care program known as the “Nuri” initiative. The government has said that there is not enough budget to sustain the initiative that targets children aged 3 to 5. The third-biggest People’s Party, meanwhile, laid out its own legislative agenda including plans to achieve fair economic growth, create jobs for the young people, relive economic disparity and build robust national security.By Yeo Jun-suk","presidential race next year ,assembly kicked off monday ,include presidential race next ,presidential race next ,will include presidential race",['National Assembly'],4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53415972 -0.17609337

According to the data compiled by RealMeter last week, Moon Jae-in, former leader of the Minjoo Party, topped the survey for the preferred presidential candidate with 21.5 percent, followed by Ahn Cheol-soo, co-chairman of the People's Party, with 16.1 percent. Ban was not included in the poll.A separate study released by a local daily on Monday, however, showed that Ban far outpaced other candidates with an approval rating of nearly 30 percent.As such, the unexpected remark made during Ban's trip to South Korea gave urgency to opposition parties who are now scrambling to counter Ban's possible bid, including asking the legitimacy of an ex-U.N. secretary-general participating in local politics and his overall qualifications as a leader.Chung Sye-kyun, the former head of the Minjoo Party of Korea, said Ban's presidential bid is ""inappropriate"" and will ""damage"" the reputation of South Korea around the globe."" is not receiving a good response around the globe,"" Chung said during an interview with CBS Radio, adding Ban should make efforts to be remembered as a competent secretary-general like Kofi Annan.Chung also claimed Ban will not become a strong candidate for the presidential election even if he actually joins the race.""I worked with him some 10 years ago. I don't know how much he has grown, but I do not think he is capable enough to lead South Korea,"" Chung added. Lee Jong-kul, a former floor leader of the main opposition Minjoo Party who had used foul language to lash out at Ban, meanwhile, apologized for insulting the U.N. chief.""If  becomes the president, his name will be the one we will be throwing out into the gutter,"" Lee told reporters on Sunday. ""The ruling party is trying to invite Ban because they have no other suitable figure to compete in the upcoming election.""It is a disaster that a person like Ban appeared,"" Lee added.Critics of the opposition's bashing of the secretary-general, on the other hand, point out that it was the liberal camp's own icon, late President Roh Moo-hyun, who helped Ban become the U.N. chief in the first place.""If Roh thought highly of Ban, I don't see the logic of the late president's ardent followers questioning his qualifications,"" a local political pundit said.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon visits Hahoe folk village, a UNESCO World Heritage site near Andong, North Gyeongsang, Sunday. YonhapUpon arriving at the historical site, he had a luncheon with local leaders and prominent politicians such as North Gyeongsang Province Gov. Kim Kwan-yong and the Saenuri Party’s chief policymaker Rep. Kim Kwang-lim. “Not only does the trip show his enthusiasm toward a potential bid, but it also tells us his strategy for the next election,” said Yoon Hee-woong, a senior researcher at Opinion Live, a Seoul-based political consulting firm. One of the strategies that Ban might have in mind, Yoon said, is regional coalition between the conservative Gyeongsang region and Ban’s hometown Chungcheong provinces. “Though the regional coalition is not as strong as it used to be, it still carries significant impact,” he said. The Chungcheong area, politically positioned between the conservative Gyeongsang and the liberal Jeolla regions, has served as a bellwether electorate through the decades. Since the 1992 presidential election, the candidates who gathered the largest votes there ended up victorious in the national race.In an apparent move to consolidate his political base, Ban met on Saturday with former Prime Minister Kim Jong-pil. The 90-year-old Chungcheong-born politician had exercised his sway to help Jeolla native then-presidential candidate Kim Dae Jung beat his conservative counterpart Lee Hoi-chang in the 1997 election.“We discussed secret issues,” said the former prime minister after the 30-minute closed-door meeting. Ban told reporters that the two Chungchung natives mostly exchanged pleasantries such as about Ban’s work at the multinational organization. Faced with escalating talks over Ban’s alleged political ambitions, his close aides, mostly consisting of former foreign ministers and high-ranking ambassadors, have described Ban’s run for the 2017 race as a “likely” choice, but reiterated that no decision had yet been made.“The likelihood of Ban running for the presidential election is higher than before ,” said Oh Joon, South Korea’s ambassador to the U.N, who have accompanied most of Ban’s trips to South Korea. But the ambassador added that Ban’s shifted stance toward the local politics does not mean he would enter the politics to run for the 2017 race.“He currently sees his run for the election as one of the possible options, which is a change from his previous position,” Oh said. Political parties wasted no time in responding to Ban’s highly politicized trip. While the Saenuri Party raised expectations that the U.N. chief would run as its candidate, the opposition bloc denounced the move as a desperate attempt to overcome a lack of prominent candidates in the ruling party. The Minjoo Party of Korea’s former floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul on Sunday urged Ban to forgo his presidential bid as a Saenuri candidate, saying that his legacy as the U.N. chief would “go down the drain” should he run for the 2017 race.“Ban appears to move up the calendar for the presidential election,” said political analyst Yoon.“Since his popularity could constrain the rise of prospective candidates, other presidential hopefuls will be forced to make political actions before Ban officially establishes himself as a candidate,” he said.

Korea's 19th National Assembly ends its term today,"The 19th National Assembly of Korea finished its four-year term Sunday, pulling the curtain down on what critics say is one of the worst-performing parliaments of all time.    It got off to a rough start due to a brewing controversy over surveillance by the state on ordinary people and a rigged election process involving a progressive minor political party.    In 2014, the parliament didn't pass a single piece of...","The 19th National Assembly of Korea finished its four-year term Sunday, pulling the curtain down on what critics say is one of the worst-performing parliaments of all time.    It got off to a rough start due to a brewing controversy over surveillance by the state on ordinary people and a rigged election process involving a progressive minor political party.    In 2014, the parliament didn't pass a single piece of legislation for nearly five months amid a political deadlock over a special law advocated by the opposition regarding an extensive probe into the root cause of the sinking in April of a ferry off the southwestern coast of the peninsula. The tragedy claimed over300 lives and raised questions about public transportation safety.   Earlier this year, the ruling and opposition parties again wrangled over the passage of an anti-terrorism bill that the government said was crucial to protecting its citizens from an ever-growing terrorism threat around the globe, while the opposition parties voiced worries over a possibility of the law being used for political oppression and illegal monitoring of people's lives.    Such infighting among lawmakers continued right up until the end of the parliamentary session.   On Friday, President Park Geun-hye vetoed the revision to the National Assembly Act that was passed despite opposition from the ruling Saenuri Party.    The government believes the revision that allows more hearings would likely put a huge constraint on the administration and allow the opposition to use it as a political tool, but the opposition parties argued it was a better check and balance on the government.   Official data, meanwhile, showed that the outgoing 19th National Assembly opened 34 parliamentary sessions. With the exception of temporary sessions, regular plenary gatherings were convened for 175 days during the past four years.   According to parliamentary data, a total of 18,000 pieces of legislation and resolutions have been tabled, but around 10,000 were thrown out.   Only two petitions for legislation, among 277, were brought to the regular sessions for discussion during the 19th National Assembly.","the worst performing parliaments ,worst performing parliaments ,worst performing parliaments of ,korea finished its four ,19th national assembly ends",['National Assembly of Korea'],4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.80340326  0.3993127

In a 2003 survey, 32.1 percent of the parents surveyed said their responsibility continues until marriage, but the number fell to 27 percent in 2006, 23.1 percent in 2009 and to 20.4 percent in 2012.In 2003, 6.3 percent of parents said they will continue to look after their children after marriage if necessary. That number dropped to 4.6 percent in 2012.The new standard for parents was that their duty ends when children graduate from college. While 40.2 percent said so in 2003, a larger 49.6 percent gave the answer in 2012.A separate report by the institute earlier this week showed 31.7 percent of children felt they have to support their aging parents, a staggering drop from 89.9 percent in 1998.The report on parental duty was based on a family life survey held by the institute every three years.In another poll by the institute in the August-September period last year, the results showed the overall thinking on parental responsibility was not all that rigid.The poll was conducted on 1,000 South Koreans  by telephone, asking them to rate four factors related to parents caring for their children between one and five. A higher number meant stronger parental responsibility.The average rating was 2.94 on whether parents needed to financially support children until they got a job. As to monetary help for marriage, the rating was 2.6. A close 2.59 rating was given for assistance in getting a home after marriage, and 2.22 for parental help in raising grandchildren.","their aging parents weakened ,aging parents weakened over ,their aging parents ,aging parents weakened ,parental duty ends earlier",['the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs'],4,[ 0.         0.         0.        ... -0.6300475  0.3330223  0.2142854],임정요,Social affairs,5,2016,"aging parents staggering drop from ,their aging parents staggering drop ,their aging parents weakened over ,support their aging parents staggering ,aging parents staggering drop","['the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs', 'South Koreans']",18,[ 0.         0.         0.        ... -0.6300475  0.3330223  0.2142854]

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon indicated potentially joining next year’s presidential race, frenzied debate was sparked in political circles on its implications for the current political landscape and whether he stands a chance.The 71-year-old diplomat said Wednesday evening that he would “contemplate” what he would do as a South Korean citizen when his term ends in December 2016 in response to widespread speculation of him becoming a presidential candidate for the ruling Saenuri Party.U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon talks with South Korean Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn at the 11th Jeju Forum on Thursday. YonhapWith media outlets and local pundits wasting no time to interpret his remark as tacit acknowledgement to running in the 2017 election, Ban reportedly tried to water down the remarks the next day by commenting that they were taken out of context.   “ reports as if I decided to run for the election, but it was not my intention,” Ban was quoted as saying by Jeju Gov. Won Hee-ryong, who attended the closed-door luncheon alongside foreign dignitaries such as former Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama. In a breakfast meeting that came before the afternoon meeting, Ban reportedly reiterated that South Korea needs a leader that can unite the divided country, echoing his yesterday’s remarks viewed as making the case for his foray into the politics. The rival political parties also roiled over what was considered a step forward from Ban’s previous position not to comment at all on his political plan. The Saenuri Party welcomed the idea, while the opposition parties denounced it as being inappropriate and premature. “If Ban comes to our party , we will win ,” said Rep. Hong Moon-pyo of the Saenuri Party. “It seems to me that the opposition party is intimated ,” he said. But Hong added that Ban must prove himself as a strong candidate during the party primaries by competing with other presidential hopefuls such as Rep. Kim Moo-sung, who had insisted that Ban should win the nomination contest in order to become a party candidate. The Minjoo Party of Korea and the People’s Party, for their part, claimed that it is inappropriate for the incumbent U. N. chief to engage with local politics and urged the world’s top diplomat to bring his focus back on international issues. “Ban’s comment on the presidential bid has brought confusion to the nation,” said Minjoo Party floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho. He accused Ban of hijacking the debate over crucial legislative matters such as how to distribute seats for the parliamentary committees in the 20th National Assembly that opens next Monday. The main opposition’s lukewarm response contrasts with their previous welcoming gesture toward the former foreign affairs minister. The liberal party had contended that Ban should run as their candidate because the liberal Roh Moo-hyun named him as a foreign minister and helped his bid for the U.N. chief. Following the meeting with Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, Ban flew to Japan to attend the G7 summit. He will return on Friday and attend a conference in Gyeonggi Province, before heading down to North Gyeongsang Province to meet with the city’s senior citizens.By Yeo Jun-suk","presidential race frenzied debate ,next year presidential race ,year presidential race frenzied ,old diplomat said wednesday ,presidential race frenzied","['U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'south korean']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62991887  0.38071784

About 2,600 teachers, members of the liberal Korean Teachers and Educational Workers’ Union, vowed they would not use the textbooks made for sixth graders. Since March, sixth graders have been taught with new state-issued history textbooks. The new textbooks, first published in September 2014 on a trial basis, were revised after having been criticized for errors and allegedly biased content. All elementary school students in Korea study with state-issued textbooks and learn history as part of social studies. “The textbook still deleted contents about the sexual slavery enforced by the Japanese government, and justified the May 16 military coup. Teaching incorrect history is educationally dangerous for elementary students who learn the history for the first time,” said the teachers. They urged the Education Ministry to abolish the history textbooks for elementary schools and vowed they would teach students with their own supplementary materials. The ministry, however, has refuted that it deliberately deleted the sexual slavery part, claiming that teaching the children with words such as “sexual slavery” or “comfort women” is not be appropriate. It has also maintained its stance that it would not allow any extra classes that are not approved by school principals in advance. Meanwhile, the government is currently working on publishing state-authored history textbooks for middle and high schools, amid persistent controversy over their reinstatement and the publication process that has mostly been kept confidential, citing security risk for the writers.By Lee Hyun-jeong","000 teachers reject history ,teachers reject history textbook ,teachers on wednesday rejected ,000 teachers reject ,teachers reject history","['korean', 'Korean Teachers and Educational Workers ’ Union']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.15773624  0.30282632

Most ...","About two years ago, Jeong Yu-jin faced an unexpected predicament. After having unprotected sex on Saturday night, she decided to get morning-after pills -- also known as emergency contraception pills -- to prevent unwanted pregnancy the day after. “And then I realized it was Sunday,” the 31-year-old told The Korea Herald. “I couldn’t find any gynecologist clinics that were open because it was the weekend. Most pharmacies in my town were closed, too.”Jeong ended up visiting a gynecologist on Monday, more than 35 hours after the incident. “I was really anxious as I knew the drug is most effective when taken as soon as possible,” she said, explaining that although she had been on birth control pills, she had sometimes forgotten to take them. “I thought the doctor would explain how the drug works and its possible side effects, but instead she only asked me two questions – when the intercourse took place and the date of my last period.”And then the doctor scolded Jeong for asking for the drug. “She said I should’ve protected myself better. ... But I don’t think women should be shamed for it,” she said.  According to a government study, 47 percent of all surveyed Korean women said they learn about birth control options, including oral contraceptives, from non-health care professionals. A growing number of Korean women, along with several women’s rights groups are stepping up their demands for access to morning-after pills without prescription, protesting the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety’s recent decision to continue disallowing over-the-counter sales of the drug at pharmacies. Currently, all women are required to have a prescription from a medical professional in order to obtain the drug, which is not covered by the national health insurance. Since 2012, the ministry has been considering the option of designating the emergency contraception pills an over-the-counter drug. As the drug is known to be effective up to 72 hours after unprotected sex, the requirement of a doctor’s prescription may deter prompt access to the pills and reduce its effect, the ministry had said three years ago. Yet after receiving fierce and continuous criticism from the nation’s gynecologists and religious groups, the government announced last week that the pills shall remain a prescription drug here indefinitely. Debate has persisted with religious groups contending that the morning-after pills are equivalent to abortion, which they classify as murder, and that easy access would encourage unruly sexual relationships.Citing its own study with gynecologists and pharmacists, the ministry argued that the drug’s overuse can be a health threat to women, especially young girls, and many are “not informed enough” on birth control in general. The ministry stated last week that it plans to come up with a proposal to better educate the public on the matter. According to the ministry’s study, only 36 percent of young Korean girls aged 15-19 were accurately informed about morning-after pills and its possible side effects. Also, 47 percent of all surveyed women said they learn about birth control options, including oral contraceptives, from non-health care professionals. As of 2014, only 39 percent of sexually active South Korean teenagers used birth control, while 66.1 percent of all teenagers who became pregnant had abortions. The nation’s sex education, which often discourages students from dating but does not provide enough information on birth control, is highlighted as one of the main reasons behind such statistics. “I don’t think Korea is ready for it just yet,” said Lee Im-soon, a gynecologist and professor at Soon Chun Hyang University’s medical school. “Most people are ill-informed about birth control options, including morning-after pills,” said the professor, who also contributed to the decision made by the ministry.“There is also a huge misconception about oral contraceptives, such as that it may cause infertility and increase the risk of cancer. Because of this, only about 3 percent of Korean use oral contraceptives, whereas about 30 to 40 percent of women in Europe and North American do the same. I think people need to be educated first on birth control  before designating the drug an OTC drug.”Yet Yoo Rim from the Center for Health and Social Change, a nongovernment think tank, said it is irresponsible for the government and physicians to point to the “ill-informed” public as one of the reasons for their decision not to designate morning-after pills as an OTC drug. “The government is the reason why people are not informed enough,” the researcher said. “They should make the drug more accessible and educate the public at the same time.”Jeong Yu-jin said there was no benefit to her in visiting her gynecologist to obtain the drug, as the doctor gave no explanation on birth control as well as the pills. “It just cost me more time and more money,” she said. “With or without a prescription, it’s very hard for women to access accurate information about the drug and its effects. So why not just make it an OTC drug and at least allow us to access it as soon as possible?”In order to avoid getting a “scolding” from doctors and unwanted attention from visitors and nurses, she visited different clinics every time she needed the drug, Jeong said.“I think this notion of ‘unwed women are supposed to be sexually inactive,’ still prevails in Korea,” she said. The Korean Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the biggest organization of obstetricians and gynecologists here, has been arguing that the overuse of morning-after pills can cause “serious side effects” to women, since 2012. There are currently a total of 13 morning-after pills available upon prescription in Korea, and among them, 12 of them are levonogestrel-only emergency contraceptive pills .Contrary to the claims made by the largest body of Korean gynecologists, the LNG ECPs, made solely of levonogestrel -- a manufactured hormone used in a number of birth control methods -- are very safe and pose no risk of overdose, according to the World Health Organization. “Levonogestrel is well tolerated, is not a known allergen,  leaves the body within a few days, is not addictive and has demonstrated no toxic reactions,” said a WHO report available online. “Its frequent use can result in increased side-effects, such as menstrual irregularities, although their repeated use poses no known health risks.”The Korean Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology was unavailable to comment when reached by The Korea Herald.Women’s groups said designating morning-after pills as OTC drug would help women save on costs for birth control. “Right now women have to pay doctors for prescription, and pay for the drug at the same time,” said Yeo Gyeong from an NGO named Womenlink. “The prescription alone costs about 10,000 won  while the drug about 30,000 won. It costs more on weekends because emergency clinics charge you more.”Bae Bok-ju, the head of an organization supporting women with disabilities, said disabled women as well as sexual violence victims also need easier access to the drug. “For many women with physical disabilities, oral contraceptives and morning-after pills are the most convenient birth control option,” she said. “Right now rape victims can get a prescription at emergency medical facilities, but it would be easier if they could just get it at pharmacies immediately.”Professor Lee said while getting a prescription can require more time, especially on national holidays and weekends, people can easily find information on pharmacies and medical clinics that run 365 days a year online. “I think such clinics and pharmacies are not hard to find in Korea as it’s one of the most wired countries in the world,” she said.  Yoon Jeong-won, a Seoul-based gynecologist, said although she agrees that the overuse of the drug can be harmful to a woman’s health, it is still better than the possible physical and emotional side effects from an abortion.“I think the most important part of this debate is the lack of sex education in this country,” she said. “Most Korean women don’t know that the LNG ECPs are not effective at all if taken more than twice during their menstrual cycle – the length of time between the first day of one period and the first day of the next. If every woman knows this, no one’s going to ‘overuse’ the drug.”By Claire Lee","women fight morning after ,unprotected sex on saturday ,korean women fight morning ,fight morning after pill ,unwanted pregnancy the day","['Jeong Yu - jin', 'the Korea Herald']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62936836  0.36077726

But he has also avoided taking a stand that will lay to rest his future in Korean politics.Such discussions have again sparked debate here as Ban will visit Korea on Wednesday. The U.N. chief said he has no plans to meet political officials during the visit, but his trip is being carefully scrutinized. ""U.N. secretary-generals have access to confidential information around the globe. If they become officials of a single government, they could abuse the information,"" Park said. The Seoul mayor, however, said the public's opinion and personal willingness will also play key roles in making the final decision.While most U.N. secretary-generals do retire from public life, some, like the late Trygve Halvdan Lie of Norway, have remained very active in domestic politics and even have held several ministerial posts.Meanwhile, a local poll carried out by Realmeter showed Park ranking in fourth place in terms of his approval rating for the next presidential election at 7.6 percent. In a separate survey conducted by Yonhap News Agency and KBS, a local broadcaster in February, Ban topped the list of potential presidential hopefuls by receiving 28.3 percent support.","presidential race after stepping ,seoul mayor says ban ,political activities seoul mayor ,next presidential race after ,next presidential race","['Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'United Nations', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Ban', 'U.N.', 'U.N.', 'Park', 'YTN Radio']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36668378  0.01543326

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is set to arrive in South Korea on Wednesday amid wide speculation that he may join domestic politics to run in next year’s presidential election.Ban has consistently avoided questions on the issue, but he has long been included in the list of potential presidential candidates in Korea’s leading public polls, in which he has often been a front-runner. Ban, who served as foreign minister in the Roh Moo-hyun administration, has especially been courted by the ruling Saenuri Party, which has yet to identify a clear standout presidential candidate.Aside from a short trip to Japan, Ban is to stay here for six days, attending various forums and conferences and meeting with locals in the Gyeongsang provinces, a political stronghold for the Saenuri Party.U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  talks with South Korean Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn as they attend the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul, Turkey, Monday. Ban’s first stop is the 11th Jeju Forum for Peace and Prosperity, for which he will deliver a keynote speech at the opening ceremony Thursday. Upon his arrival on Wednesday, Ban will meet with members of an association of senior journalists, and is likely to field questions on his political ambitions after his U.N. tenure concludes by the end of this year.Ban had told Korean correspondents in New York that he would appreciate if they “help him bring a successful conclusion to his service as U.N. secretary-general.” He did not directly comment on whether he is considering a presidential bid.On Thursday afternoon, Ban will fly to Shima, Mie Prefecture in Japan, to participate in the G7 summit for two days.After another two days in Seoul with no official schedule, Ban is to visit various regions including North Gyeongsang Province, a destination widely speculated by the local media and watchers as being politically driven. His schedule in Andong and Gyeongju include a visit to UNESCO world cultural asset Hahoe Village and a U.N. nongovernmental organizations conference. A survey by pollster Realmeter earlier this month showed Ban leading ahead of opposition bigwigs Moon Jae-in and Ahn Cheol-soo with 38.9 percent to 34.4 percent and 21.4 percent, respectively.On Tuesday, People’s Party floor leader Rep. Park Jie-won fueled talks on Ban’s political motivation.“As the secretary-general is someone with immense thirst for power,  he can run as a presidential candidate if the pro-Parks  gather to enthrone him at the least,” he said, adding that one of Ban’s strengths is his political neutrality that led all rival parties would consider inviting him to join them.","presidential candidates in korea ,korea leading public polls ,south korea on wednesday ,next year presidential election ,of potential presidential candidates","['U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'South Korea', 'Ban', 'Korea ’s', 'Ban']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.6196233   0.25871992

The Saenuri Party’s former leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung and former Financial Minister Choi Kyung-hwan have applied for positions at the Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee, according to party sources Tuesday. Kim leads the faction that challenges loyalists to President Park Geun-hye and Choi is a key member of the pro-Park faction. YonhapAlthough the committee is relatively unpopular among lawmakers whose interest centers on domestic issues that can resonate with local voters, presumptive presidential candidates consider the committee a prime opportunity to gain experience on foreign affairs and national defense.“He has had strong interest in inter-Korea relations since he served as party chairman,” said an aide to the former leader on customary condition of anonymity. Choi’s staff said that the former finance minister needs leadership experience outside financial matters. The assignment of the parliamentary committee seats is determined by negotiation between party members. The parties agreed last week to ensure that the parliamentary committee should be set up no later than June 9, almost a week after the upcoming Assembly kicks off. For political bigwigs at opposition camps, the Strategy and Finance Committee is the most sought-after post as it deals with tax policies and budget review. The committee can also hold parliamentary hearings over state agencies related to economic policies and decide whether to pass contentious business bills.The Minjoo Party of Korea leader Kim Chong-in is reportedly considering serving in the Strategy and Finance Committee to achieve his goal of “economic democratization.” The former economics professor has long advocated this as a means to prevent economic dominance by family-owned conglomerates. Seats on the finance committee are also being sought by progressive Justice Party leader Rep. Sim Sang-jeung and moderate independent Rep. Yoo Seung-min -- former Saenuri lawmaker who defected from the party after a fallout with President Park over her veto of parliamentary law last June. Meanwhile, People’s Party leader Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo reportedly told his party that he hopes to work in the Education, Culture, Sports and Tourism Committee. The former entrepreneur has criticized the national policies for failing to deliver innovative education and seeks to secure wider autonomy in educational entities.By Yeo Jun-suk","presidential candidates the saenuri ,presidential candidates ,presidential candidates the ,positions as presidential candidates ,as presidential candidates the","['Saenuri Party ’s', 'inter - korea', 'National Assembly', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'Choi Kyung - hwan', 'the Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.80767369  0.45142356

But the peaceful mourning was soon disturbed by the arrival of a group of men with their faces covered. They held up placards that read: “Not all men are potential criminals” and “Only those  commit crimes are bad.” Enraged by the placards and by some of the men who attempted to take post-it memos off the walls, scores of female participants asked the men to leave the memorial site. A brawl soon ensued, with them cursing at each other, until the police came to separate them with a police line.  Pro-men activists hold up placards reading, “Not all meat eaters are bad, but only animals committing crimes are bad” and “Hatred cannot be mourning. Let’s make prejudice-free Korea” outside exit 10 of Gangnam Station on Sunday. “We are just here to mourn the death of the girl, hoping that such a murder against women will not happen again. Why do the men behave like that?” said Kim Eun-ji, 25, who dropped by to leave a tribute on her way to a picnic. “I am sick of hearing that women should be careful at night and should not wear short skirts. Why don’t men know that they can also be safe when women are safe?” A makeshift memorial outside exit 10 of Gangnam Station On May 17, a man, only identified by his surname Kim, stabbed a woman to death at a public bathroom near Gangnam Station. The man, who was a stranger to the victim, said that he had committed the crime because he had been “belittled” by women many times in the past. While police defined the case as an “accidental crime” committed by an individual who is mentally ill, thousands of citizens, mostly young women in their 20s and 30s, flocked to the makeshift memorial site to express their fear and anger toward what they see as a hate crime against women. Post-it memos outside exit 10 of Gangnam Station Exit 10 of Gangnam Station soon turned into an outdoor public forum to discuss gender equality and misogyny in Korean society. The majority of the mourners called for better safety for women and an end to gender-based discrimination. But some men expressed discomfort about being branded as “potential criminal."" “I don’t know why women keep talking about misogyny here. The criminal is an animal. An animal does not hunt animals that are stronger than them either,” said a 26-year-old student, who wished to remain anonymous. “People here are obsessed and politicizing the case. Women can kill men, too. It is not right to assume all men are criminals.”Han Ella, one of the volunteers who has been standing watch over the memorial site since Thursday, said that men do not understand discrimination against women, because they are too used to their privileges as men.“They are not happy because women finally spoke up and started talking about discrimination against us. We hate men despising women. We don’t hate all men. Fighting against misogyny is a matter of our survival,” she said. Mourners hold up placards opposing hate crime agasint women outside exit 10 of Gangnam Station on Sunday. Hong Sung-hee, 23, who majors in theater at a university, said that some radical male protestors’ behavior not only saddened but also scared her. “I don’t know how I feel about men anymore. I feel like they will never understand what women go through in society. Why do they have to come here to disparage the movement and incite fear?” she said. “As a person who feels discriminated and sexually harassed in everyday life, I am relieved that I am not the only one feeling sick of the male-dominant society.”A foreign woman prays in front of post-it memos outside exit 10 of Gangnam Station on Sunday. The murder of the young girl has become a watershed moment in society, as it has prompted Korean women to publicly address the subject of misogyny and systematic discrimination against women, experts said. Lee Na-young, a sociology professor at Chungang University, pointed out that misogyny is not a new phenomenon. “It has always existed due to structural discrimination in the society,” she said. “But the new generation of women, who have felt ignored, harassed and insulted, are finally coming forward to speak up about the unfair treatment.”South Korea has a high level of gender inequality -- economically, socially and politically -- ranking 115 out of 145 nations, according to the World Economic Forum last year.“Some extreme behavior by men to deny the misogynist nature of the crime could be part of their attempt to defend the discriminative structure in the society. They are perhaps against distributing privilege to women.”A man holds up a placard reading ""Not all meat eaters are bad, but only those commit crimes are bad"" outside exit 10 of Gangnam Station on Sunday The explicit emergence of modern-day misogyny began about a decade ago, when a new term “Doeonjangnyeo”  started to be widely used on an online platform in 2006. A website Ilbe, infamously known for its right-wing political views, was launched in 2010 and its members started to publicly disparage women online using terms such as “Kimchinyeo” and “Samilhan.” “Kimchinyeo” refers to materialistic Korean women economically dependent on men, while “Samilhan” means that women should be beaten by men at least once every three days.In response to Ilbe members’ misogynist acts, a group of women started a website called “Megalia” in 2015 to show their hatred toward men, adding to tensions between the radical anti-women and anti-men communities. According to a survey on 300 women by the Korea Women’s Development Institute, 83 percent of them said that they have seen such derogatory terms to describe women being widely used online. Nearly 60 percent of them expected the misogynist trend to be aggravated in the coming years. Experts pointed out that the reasons behind the seemingly growing misogyny are the rapidly shifting gender roles, social discontent among young men who are struggling economically and the anonymity offered online.“I think that socio-economic inequality in Korean society is a source of the hatred,” said Park Jin-kyong, a director of the Gender Research Institute. “It seems that some men, who feel marginalized, look for someone to blame for failing to get a job or to get married, for example, amid economic difficulties.”“Their collective anger turns toward women, which is an easy target, cementing their own logic.” Lee Soo-yeon, a researcher from the Korea Women’s Development Institute, said that some men feel insecure about escalating competition for limited resources and jobs in what used to be a male-dominant, patriarchal society. “At home and work, they are at risk of losing a job, while they are not able to support a family without women’s help,” she said. “The reality changes, but they appear to be slower at adapting to the rise in women’s economic, social status.”“Online platforms also contribute to misogyny because of the anonymity ,” she said. “Netizens  started to more radically express hatred on grounds of gender, political ideology and region.” The sex-ratio imbalance at birth is also cited as one of the factors intensifying insecurity among some men. Due to the traditional preference for sons in the 1970s and 1980s, there 1.14 males born for every female, according to the latest census in 2010. But Kim Dong-guen, a head of pro-man rights group NGO for Gender Equality, said that the misogyny fundamentally resulted from reverse discrimination against men in society. “Korean men suffer from reverse discrimination due to policies and institutions favoring women in college admissions and employment,” he said. “Women are biologically designed to give birth and men appreciate it, but that should not mean women can legally take away opportunities from men.”“Korean men in their 20s and 30s have not enjoyed any power or privilege as the older generation, but our duty and responsibility as a breadwinner has not changed.”  A woman shares her stories of living in fear as a girl in Korean soceity outside exit 10 of Gangnam Station on Sunday. As dusk gathered, a peaceful dialogue began among the mourners over gender discrimination and misogyny. Stories of rape, attacks and discriminations were shared, often responded by applause of support.Most of the mourners at the scene frowned upon the extreme groups of men and women slamming each other based on gender. They said in unison that the death of the young girl should pave the way for the public discourse to tackle the discrimination and violence against women. Kim Seong-heon, a 22-year-old university student, said that he was able to learn how much fear and discrimination Korean women have to live with at the memorial site. “I looked back on myself to see whether my remarks have ever hurt women. I was sad to see a post-it message saying that she was sad to be born as a woman,” he said, holing up a placard “As a human being, I feel shame and anger.” Kim Da-young, a 27-year-old officer worker, said that she has no reason to hate men. “I am afraid to take a taxi at night. I am scared when I am alone with a man in an elevator. We are here to talk about the prevailing fear among women in the society,” Kim said. “My brother and boyfriend are all men. I don’t see them as potential criminals. I just hope that the tragic death can shed light on what women in Korea have to bear at home and work every day.”""This is not a war between men and women. I believe that this is an opportunity for both men and women to openly talk about the issue and seek answers together.”By Ock Hyun-ju","mourning for murder victim ,amid mourning for murder ,murder victim on sunday ,mourning for murder ,war intensifies amid mourning",['Gangnam Station'],4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23538616  0.25183785

Under Secretary-General Kim Won-soo, one of Ban's closest confidants, rejected such speculation, saying that the speech at the Rotary International Convention was set up at the last minute due to the complexity of Ban's schedule and the visit to the Hahoe folk village is not unusual as the U.N. chief often makes visits to cultural sites.Kim spoke in a meeting with South Korean correspondents.Ban's visit, which will be his first in about a year, comes after South Korea's ruling Saenuri Party suffered a crushing defeat in last month's parliamentary elections amid speculation it could face a similar fate in next year's presidential election.Ban, whose second five-year term as U.N. chief ends late this year, has long been talked about as a potential candidate for next year's election. But he has refused to discuss such a possibility, saying he would focus on his duties as U.N. chief.Still, opinion polls have consistently shown that he is one of the favorites.Political analysts in South Korea say that the beleaguered ruling party could try to scout Ban as its presidential candidate.","his presidential ambitions ban ,ban trip to korea ,office announced last week ,presidential ambitions ban office ,trip to korea no","['U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Ban', 'South Korea', 'Ban', 'South Korea', 'Ban']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.19045709  0.22828664

Yoo Seong-min consoles former fellow member Rep. Kim Eul-dong as she cries during their conversation at the National Assembly on Thursday. Yoo’s move to return to the party after leaving upon pressure from the rival faction is part of the burgeoning feud in the ruling party. “I will summon a meeting of senior party members tomorrow and give them an open hearing,” Chung told reporters Thursday morning in his constituency of Gongju, South Chungcheong Province.When asked whether he would succumb to pressure and readjust the composition of the emergency leadership council to include more pro-Park members, he withheld his answer.The Saenuri whip then returned to Yeouido and met with opposition counterparts, Reps. Woo Sang-ho of The Minjoo Party of Korea and Park Jie-won of the People’s Party, to negotiate concerning key agenda items including the allotment of parliamentary committee chairmanships in the upcoming legislature.Chung, who is now effectively representing the party in the absence of official leadership, thereby ended his brief daylong escape from party affairs. After attending a May 18 Gwangju Uprising memorial ceremony on Wednesday, he returned to his constituency, refusing to tend to party affairs.His quick return to the post also came amid escalating speculation that the party may end up splitting. It gained further momentum as Speaker Chung Ui-hwa, whose term ends with the outgoing 19th National Assembly, hinted at creating a new political party.“It could be a political consulting organization or a party,” the speaker told reporters Thursday, elaborating a little on the political entity he had earlier said he would establish.“I will ponder on my path in the next few months and make a decision by October or so.”The veteran five-term lawmaker had earlier said that he would not return to his party after his term as speaker, disapproving of the factional feud in his home camp.“Should the junior politicians do a good job in leading the country, I will remain as adviser, but if not, I may have to make a decision ,” he said.On Tuesday, Saenuri failed to hold two key meetings due to a lack of quorum, and failed to establish an emergency panel and innovation committee to steer the party until an official leadership is formed as early as next month.It was mostly those close to the president who denounced Chung’s temporary leadership as unilaterally excluding the pro-Park faction and blamed him for a lack of communication. Some even demanded Chung resign from his post.“This is not about  winning or losing,” Chung said Thursday, before resuming his duties.“Our politics should be based on beliefs and give trust to people, instead of clinging to the factional frame, and the president is no exception .”Since its crushing defeat in the April 13 general election, the conservative camp has been struggling to elect a new leadership that can regain support of the public. Through the race, the party not only lost its former parliamentary majority, but also gave away several of its symbolic stronghold constituencies -- results largely attributed to the infighting of the pro-Park and non-Park groups.“I neither belong to any faction, nor have significant power within the political circles,” Chung said.“But I received a substantial number of votes, which I take as a sign that the party wanted someone who could maintain neutrality and work in balance, which is exactly what I am striving to do.”One of the reasons the legitimately elected floor leader finds himself powerless against the pro-Park protest, according to observers, is the absence of a pivotal figure who can unite the non-Park members.Previously, the role was played by former party chief Rep. Kim Moo-sung, who stepped down from his post after the party’s election defeat and has remained out of the spotlight ever since. Kim, when approached by reporters on his way to attend the general meeting Thursday, was mum on the party’s ongoing strife.Other senior non-Park members either defected prior to the election after being excluded from nominations or lost in the election. The list includes Rep. Yoo Seong-min, who ran as an independent candidate, and Rep. Chin Young who joined the Minjoo Party.By Bae Hyun-jung","the deepening factional strife ,president herself for egging ,thursday called for meeting ,address the deepening factional ,deepening factional strife","['Saenuri Party ’s', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'Chung', 'Park Geun - hye']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45084617  0.36918613

Prosecutors said his status can change to that of a suspect in the course of the probe if necessary.Some other former and current foreign executives in the summons list include John Lee, who headed the company from 2005 to 2010 and Gaurav Jain, who succeeded Lee until 2012. Lee, the incumbent CEO of Google Korea, led the Korean unit of Oxy when the sales of the sterilizer product was at its peak.Prosecutors said they will soon place a travel ban on the Korean-American.Jain is suspected of orchestrating the fabrication of reports unfavorable to the company when he was the chief executive, according to prosecutors. He is known to be currently in Singapore.Prosecutors said they are not yet at the stage to investigate the company's headquarters in London.The humidifier disinfectant case, one of the worst scandals involving a consumer product using chemicals, came to light after four pregnant women died of lung problems from unknown causes in 2011. A government-led investigation confirmed a connection between people who died of lung problems and the chemicals used to clean household humidifiers.Korea confirmed 221 people as victims. Among them, 177 had used Oxy products.

Since then, she has not attended the event for various reasons, such as a meeting with Iranian vice president that had coincided Wednesday’s ceremony.The move has been widely seen as a gesture to avoid political conflict. Since its commemorative song “March for our Beloved” was made unofficial in 2009, the ceremony has been at the center of ideological debate.But from the perspective of former foreign correspondents, who were invited to this year’s ceremony in respect for their coverage of the bloodied uprising 36 years ago, Park is the only leader who can resolve the deadlock.“I don’t understand why she is holding back,” said Bradley Martin, who covered the May 18 uprising as a reporter for the Baltimore Sun. “All she has to say is that this song is not about North Korea and the beloved refer to the people of our country and people of our city,” he said in a group interview with The Korea Herald.Right-wing activists and politicians have claimed that the song has an element of being pro-North, claiming the word “beloved” refers to Pyongyang’s late leader Kim Il-sung. The song was written in 1982 to honor the victims of the pro-democracy movement and has been often used during civic demonstrations. From left: Bradley Martin, Donald Kirk, Tim Shorrock and Norman Thorpe Tim Shorrock, who was a reporter for the Journal of Commerce, said that the president should exercise her leadership to embrace the dissenters. “The president can take steps to heal wounds and to push ahead even though you disagree,” said the 64-year-old reporter.On recent reports that former president Chun Doo-hwan denied responsibility for ordering the Army to shoot at the protesters, the veteran reporters said that his claim was not consistent with what they saw in Gwangju. “The shooting went off for several days. But we have never heard of any punishment for anyone. So now if he didn’t order, why didn’t he punish them?” said Martin. “Let’s put it stronger, he is a monster and a fool,” the 73-year-old reporter said. Asked if Chun should make an official apologize for the victims of the families, the reporters said that it was “too late.” Donald Kirk, who was with the Chicago Tribune, said that the man’s gesture would not “create much of an impression” and that the victims wouldn’t take it as a sincere apology.The reporters agreed that the May 18 uprising left a significant impact on the nation’s democratic development as the condemnation against the violent crackdown forced Chung to yield to peaceful transition toward democracy in 1987. “The government couldn’t be trusted to avoid the use of force so the U.S., unlike in 1980, in 1987, told them to keep the Army out of this. There are very important influences from Gwangju that help the transition in 1987,” said Norman Thorpe, a former reporter for the Asian Wall Street Journal.By Yeo Jun-suk","last time president park ,wednesday ceremony the move ,after her inauguration ,the last time president ,soon after her inauguration","['Park Geun', 'iranian']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54318792  0.26338884

Chun Doo-hwan, who took power a year after the assassination of then-President Park Chung-hee, father of President Park Geun-hye. Hundreds of civilians died as Chun ordered the most violent crackdown in the nation’s modern history.The 20-minute ceremony closed with the much-anticipated song “March of Our Beloved,” belted out by about 30 members of a choir on stage.Most participants sang the song, some waving the flag of South Korea, except for several, including Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, whose lips remained sealed throughout the voluntary sing-along.Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn  and political leaders attend a ceremony commemorating the 36th anniversary of the May 18 Uprising at the May 18th National Cemetery in Gwangju on Wednesday. Park Hae-mook/The Korea HeraldThe ceremony marked the ongoing political division some three decades since the nation introduced democracy, with the rivaling groups fighting until the last minute over whether to have the controversial song reintroduced as a ceremonial tune. “We have to take the May 18 democratic uprising as an opportunity to unite the country,” said Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-an in his speech on behalf of President Park, who has not attended the annual ceremony since her first visit in 2013.  Former presidents have also often sent prime ministers in their place. Her conservative predecessor Lee Myung-bak had come to the event in his first year in office. It was also Lee who decided the song should be sang by a choir in 2009. Prior to that, the signature song had involved all participants singing along since 1997. The conservative governments have said the song should be left outside of official protocol, citing persistent controversy over the song that the conservatives claim is pro-North. The liberals have contended that the song is a symbol of democracy and the government’s move is aimed to undermine the democratic legacy.Among those that sang along was Saenuri Party’s embattled floor leader Chung Jin-suk, whose nomination as interim chairman was thwarted by intensified factional feud within the party the day before.Tension at the site reached a high when Park Sung-chun, the head of Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affair, the organizer of the event, was blocked from entering the event. The former army general had angered Gwangju residents with his decision not to change current rules on the song.“It is very unfortunate,” Park told reporters after being blocked by the angered activists and victims’ family. “Whether to designate the song as an official anthem and whether to mandate sing-along in public space is not a choice made by individuals. It need the people’s consensus over the song,” he said. The attending opposition bigwigs, including former Minjoo Party leader Rep. Moon Jae-in, the Minjoo Party’s interim chief Kim Chong-in and People’s Party chairman Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, spared no expenses at criticizing the government’s stance. “I don’t understand the government’s rationale on banning the sing-along. … We will name the song as an official anthem ,” said Moon. “We believe today’s ceremony was organized sloppily by the government,” he said. Rep. Park Jie-won, floor leader of the People’s Party said the party will continue to push the legislation to have the song sung by all participants at the ceremony and to work with the Minjoo Party to have the minister of patriots and veterans affairs resign.By Yeo Jun-suk","national cemetery on wednesday ,sat through commemorative speeches ,cemetery on wednesday ,may 18th national cemetery ,wednesday as political big",[],4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35549572  0.51771158

Of the total 221 victims officially confirmed by the government, 28 used Homeplus’ product, with 12 deaths, the prosecution said.Homeplus sold its toxic humidifier disinfectant that contained PHMG as private brand goods from 2006 to 2011. It manufactured the product from an original equipment manufacturer after it saw the sales growth of Oxy’s humidifier disinfectant, it said. The prosecution looked into whether Homeplus followed the right product manufacturing manual and when customer complaints started to come in over the product use. Civic groups urge the government to protect people from unsafe chemical products and to take fundamental measures over the humidifier disinfectant tragedy, at Gwanghwamun, Seoul, Tuesday. YonhapThe prosecution summoned the head of the original equipment manufacturer surnamed Kim on Monday. Kim was in charge of producing the problematic product for both Homeplus and Lotte Mart. Kim’s company was later found to have mainly produced shoe polishes. Amid the probe that is widening to local distributors, Justice Minister Kim Hyun-woong said Tuesday that he would track back the history of the government’s overall measures over disinfectant control and monitoring.“It is necessary to reveal who is ultimately responsible for the case. It can be said that  is currently conducting the work of checking all the factors ,” said Kim in the National Assembly’s meeting. The products were made and sold since 2001.Meanwhile, the victims’ families and civic groups accused law firm Kim & Chang of attempting to cover up Oxy Reckitt Benckiser’s responsibility by allegedly suggesting that the two universities manipulate the product-toxicity test. Kim & Chang, one of the largest law firms in Korea, has come under fire after a Seoul National University professor, who was arrested for manipulating the toxicity test of Oxy’s product, claimed that the law firm interfered in the test. Kim & Chang has been Oxy RB’s legal representative August 2011. Kim & Chang has refuted this claim, saying that it never interfered with any experiment. The prosecution raided Seoul National University and Hoseo University earlier this month on suspicions that their professors had allegedly fabricated test results in return for money. The victims claimed that the law firm was behind it.“Kim & Chang demanded the two professors to make unreasonable conditions for the experiment and to stop the test when toxicity was confirmed. It also coaxed the victims to make deals with the company by submitting the fabricated test results to the court,” said Choi Ye-Yong, head of the Asian Citizen’s Center for Environment and Health. Since the case broke out, 80 percent of victims who filed a suit against Oxy have made agreements with the company, before the prosecutorial probe was launched, he added.Under the negotiation, Oxy reportedly said it agrees to provide compensation but this does not mean that the company admits its fault. The victims were also asked not to file civil or criminal lawsuits in the future.

Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office said they had found the Korea Fair Trade Commission’s chemicals labeling report which showed that the company – now formally renamed Reckitt Benckiser Korea -- had received material safety data sheets  on PHMG from ingredient providers, which had specified that PHMG should not be eaten or inhaled by humans. The exact date of when the MSDS was exchanged remains undisclosed.The MSDS is a mandatory document submitted when trading chemicals. Hence, this indicates that the company had known of the toxic chemical, despite Oxy’s claim that it was not aware of the toxicity of PHMG, prosecutors said.Civic activists surround the building of Oxy Reckitt Benckiser Korea’s building in Yeouido in a protest over the humidifier sterilizer case on Monday. YonhapThe KFTC report was made in August 2012 when the agency launched a separate probe into Oxy’s alleged false indication of ingredients. The agency later fined the company 52 million won .The MSDS information was shared in every step of the chemical trading from PHMG manufacturer SK Chemicals to humidifier disinfectant manufacturer Oxy, the KFTC said. Prosecution sources also said that Oxy allegedly destroyed all the MSDS from 2001 to 2011, ahead of the prosecutorial probe launched earlier this year. Meanwhile, the prosecution on Monday summoned an original equipment manufacturer head surnamed Kim, who manufactured disinfectants that Lotte Mart and Homeplus sold as their private brand goods. Of the total official 221 victims, 41 used Lotte Mart’s product, with 16 deaths, and 28 used Homeplus’s product, with 12 deaths. Lotte Mart and Homeplus sold the humidifier disinfectants made of PHMG from 2006 and 2004, respectively, until August 2011 when the government announced the toxicity of the humidifier disinfectant. The prosecution suspects that Lotte Mart and Homeplus copied the manufacturing manual of Oxy, unlike Oxy which developed and tested the product on its own. It has banned the overseas travel of former Lotte Mart head Lee Chul-woo and former Homeplus head Lee Seung-han. Meanwhile, the victims and their families launched a group compensation lawsuit on Monday against the central government, disinfectant manufacturers and distributors. Minbyun, a group of liberal lawyers who are supporting the lawsuit, said 436 people filed the lawsuit to seek 11 billion won of compensation against the government and 22 companies, including Oxy, SK Chemicals and Cefu. Of the plaintiffs, 235 are the actual victims, with 51 dead. Of those victims, 63 are underage and five were killed, Minbyun said. The group said it will seek 50 million won for each dead victim, 30 million won each for those who suffers lung damage, and 10 million for each family member of the victims for mental damage. “The Constitution Article 36 stipulates that the health of all citizens should be protected by the state. The country should have taken clear measures to protect the public,” said lawyer Choi Jae-hong, who leads the group lawsuit. “The prosecution and the Environment Ministry have kept the stance that they are uncertain of their legal accountability, citing the lack of regulations in the past. However, it is likely that the country has compensation responsibility as it did not require the companies to conduct the inhalation-toxicity test, negligently allowing the sales of the problematic products.”By Lee Hyun-jeong","the prosecution said monday ,toxicity report the prosecution ,four years ago seoul ,prosecution said monday ,oxy reckitt benckiser sold","['Oxy Reckitt Benckiser', 'Seoul Central District Prosecutors ’ Office', 'the Korea Fair Trade Commission ’s']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26612851  0.73724222

The 32-year-old used to have three cans of coke a day – one after every meal. “I loved the sensation of carbonation and the sweet taste,” he told The Korea Herald. “It felt like drinking coke helped digestion. It was just a nice way of finishing meals, especially heavy ones. ”Kim developed his love for coke while he was serving his military duty about five years ago. Coke became a daily necessity for him then, and this continued for over three years. “I’d feel anxious whenever I ran out of it in my fridge,” he said.A recent government study has shown that many South Koreans eat too much sugar, particularly in the form of sugar-sweetened beverages such as coke.The report revealed that as of 2013, the sugar consumption of Koreans aged 3-29 was alarmingly high, accounting for more than 10 percent of their daily calorie intake. The largest proportion of the surveyed Koreans -- 31 percent -- was consuming sugar by drinking sugary beverages, including soda, sports and energy drinks.For Park, his daily habit of drinking coke had to come to an end as it started to take a toll on his health. He gained more than 10 kilograms and developed four serious cavities that required him to get dental implants. The dental procedure cost him about 4 million won . According to the World Health Organization, the high consumption of such drinks can lead to an unhealthy diet, weight gain and increased risk of chronic diseases. Dental problems are also the most prevalent symptom worldwide and its treatment cost is expensive, leaving people vulnerable to pain, anxiety and tooth loss, according to the agency.Other local and overseas studies have also shown that sugary drinks increase the risk of a number of diseases, especially heart disease, gout and diabetes. According to a report by Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in the U.S., people who consume sugar-sweetened drinks regularly -- one to two cans a day or more -- have a 26 percent greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes than those who rarely drink such drinks.The report cited a 22-year study of 80,000 women, which found that those who drank a can of sugary drink daily had a 75 percent higher risk of gout than women who did not. In its measures against sugar released last month, South Korea set guidelines to cut down on schoolchildren purchasing certain food products with high sugar levels. It also advised that carbonated drinks and coffee be removed from school vending machines. “We plan to collaborate with the Education Ministry and the state-run Center for Children’s Foodservice Management to better educate young children on healthy diets and protect them from the health risks of carbonated soft drinks,” said an official from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. Park said he has lost more than 5 kilograms since he cut coke from his diet. He explained that he had also started to take bolder moves to improve his health such as by not drinking and changing his job that had previously required long work hours. “I definitely feel healthier,” he said. A 2012 U.S. study published in the American Academy of Sleep Medicine found that when individuals are sleep deprived, their reward activation centers in the brain are in fact greater, thereby making it more difficult to resist sweets.Even in Korea’s traditional medicine, obesity is viewed as a condition that is often caused by consuming too much greasy or sweet foods, physical inactivity, stress and the lack of “gi” – the vital energy that corresponds to the functions of an organ. When there is not enough gi in the body, waste fluids in the digestive system cannot be transformed properly which may result in weight gain and physical fatigue. “I think sugar and its taste are more addictive than other nutrients in general,” said Jang Dong-hyuk, a doctor of Korean medicine. “But there is a difference between sugar in natural foods such as watermelon and sugar contained in processed foods such as deserts. Not all sugar is bad – even rice contains sugar – and I think it’s important to differentiate what’s potentially harmful and what’s not.”Park said he still loves the carbonated drink, and indulges his coke habit sometimes. “I’ve made my own rules,” he said. “I only drink it when I go out for movies. I love the taste and I don’t want to give it up.”By Claire Lee","drinking coke the 32 ,drinking coke helped digestion ,should stop drinking coke ,three cans of coke ,drinking coke helped","['Park Hyung - jun', 'the Korea Herald', 'Kim']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64619732  0.29114458

The products were pulled off the shelves in 2011 after the unexplained deaths were belatedly linked to them by local health agencies.An investigation so far has unraveled serious lapses by all parties, including the company neglecting needed tests for safety and the cover-up and twisting of reports that warned of possible harm.Public fury and concern showed in sales at retailers. Lotte Mart said Friday that sales of bleach fell 22.6 percent between April 18 and May 3, when the Oxy Korea investigation was heading to a peak. Deodorants fell 16.8 percent in sales, as well as air fresheners , fabric softeners  and dehumidifiers .At E-Mart, sales of bleach fell 38 percent and dehumidifiers 44 percent in the April 18-May 11 period.The pattern was the same at online shopping malls such as Auction and Ticket Monster, records showed.Products based on more natural ingredients, on the other hand, like baking soda, saw sales rise 30 percent more. Specialists in environmental safety advise consumer awareness in dealing with the growing fears.""Non-pharmaceutical medical products have been verified for safety, so they can be used without concern,"" Lee Jong-hyun from environmental consulting firm EHR&C; said. ""Disinfectants and insecticides, however, are not yet included in pre-approval requirement, and they need caution in usage.""The National Institute of Environmental Research said it is important for consumers to be careful to use each product according to its intended usage and precautions.  ""Extra care is necessary for products that a human body can easily be exposed to, such as aerosols that can be breathed in,"" an official at the institute said.The more fundamental step would be for the products to be scrutinized before marketing and in managing them.  ""There has to be a step through which the government or the manufacturer confirms without a doubt the safety of a product in order to eliminate any distrust,"" Lee at EHR&C; said.The Environment Ministry has said it will consider changing the biocide management system to concentrate on prior monitoring.Products that cannot prove their safety would be removed from the market, and all new products would be tested before being made available to the public, the ministry said.""It is necessary to test the risks and benefits of each product because a wide multitude of chemical substances are being used in everyday lives,"" said Kim Yong-hwa, a professor at Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul.  ""Governing laws are unprepared and lack details, and it is basically up to the state and the National Assembly to set them right.""","biocide scare the deaths ,on biocide scare the ,humidifier disinfectants have loudly ,biocide scare the ,state on biocide scare",['Oxy Reckitt Benckiser'],4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53550428  0.45151246

A number of residents who preferred to remain anonymous have revealed their distress“The thought of it sickens me to the core,” one said. “I keep feeling like I’ll throw up.” Another said, “My children drank from the tap. I’m worried they may develop health problems.” On Monday at an apartment in the city of Gumi, North Gyeongsang Province, a decomposing corpse was discovered in the water tank after residents complained of a putrid smell from the tap water.The police identified the man as 38-year-old Chinese surnamed Wong who had worked as a crew member of a ship in the nearby coastal town of Pohang. According to the police, Wong had left a note next to the water tank claiming he had not been paid his wages. Why he had traveled to Gumi and to that particular apartment is not known. Based on the level of decomposition of the body, the police estimate that he had been dead for more than 10 days. Records showed Wong arrived at the apartment on April 20, the day after which he left his clothes and shoes at the entrance of the apartment’s first floor and disappeared. Out of the 30 families that lived in the apartment, 12 have moved out. The 50 remaining residents of the afflicted apartment are negotiating to advance the date of their move.The apartment had been earmarked for demolition and reconstruction before the case was uncovered. Residents were scheduled to move out by June 18 at the latest. The apartment management has decided to provide the people with bottled water up to their date of their relocation rather than cleanse the tank. The Gumi city administration said the 0.2ppm residue chlorine in the tap water would have killed the germs from the corpse. No spread of disease has so far been detected.A preliminary autopsy by police revealed no external violence on Wong’s body. The police will conduct further tests for poisoning and alcohol.By Lim Jeong-yeo","corpse case traumatized residents ,tank corpse case traumatized ,corpse case traumatized ,traumatized residents ,the tap worried they",[],4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50937879  0.36072159

Woo Sang-ho said Wednesday.He expressed little hope of the meeting yielding any breakthrough and said it could be considered a success if they are able to freely share their thoughts.The Minjoo Party of Korea’s floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho  talks with People’s Party counterpart Rep. Park Jie-won at the National Assembly on Tuesday. Cheong Wa Dae had announced earlier this week that President Park Geun-hye will invite floor leaders of the three main parties. This is the first gathering since the April 13 general election that stripped the ruling Saenuri Party of its majority status. Both Saenuri and Minjoo are without formal chairmen and are currently run by interim chiefs.Last month, Park said she would utilize more opportunities to talk with the legislature during a meeting with the press.Woo held a preparatory meeting with his team for the presidential talks. The party is set on raising issues such as jobs for youth, housing measures for lower-income groups, private education cost and household debt.Aside from the face-to-face talks at Cheong Wa Dae, the party completed the formation of its policymaking committee earlier this week and is lining up its policy initiatives and offenses for the incoming 20th National Assembly. The Minjoo Party is expected to tackle the government’s economic policy focused on deregulation, the stalemate in the North Korean relations and the nuclear problem, as well as its avoidance of controversial bills including that on the Sewol ferry fact-finding committee.Interim chief Kim Chong-in said at a party meeting on Wednesday, “The government is making announcements as if abolishing regulations are the only way to activate the economy. … Economic regulations have been eased over the past four years, but have failed to provide any help.”Woo, for his part, said the ruling party was still reluctant to endorse some of the most socially sensitive bills. They include the bill to fast track compensation for victims of toxic humidifier sterilizer and expand the scope of recognized damages.The third largest People’s Party also vowed to be vocal. “We will hear out the president, but we will also say what needs to be said,” the party’s whip Rep. Park Jie-won said.The People’s Party stands on the same ground with regard to the bills on extending the operation of the committee investigating the Sewol ferry sinking that claimed 304 lives, and on the humidifier disinfectant victims.","the president on friday ,the president to unilaterally ,president on friday ,president on friday during ,president to unilaterally seek","['the Minjoo Party', 'Korea ’s']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.58617258  0.56715614

They have told me that they are fed up with the homework, but it seems there is no way to escape,” Park told The Korea Herald. Many after-school programs at private elementary schools are different from those at public schools. While public school students usually do various activities in the after-class programs, private school students often have extra English classes on top of them. Parents of private elementary school students in Seoul hold a rally against the government’s decision to ban immersion education in November 2013. YonhapSuch intensive English classes, often conducted in the form of immersion, remain prevalent at private elementary schools, despite it being illegal for first- and second-graders.In February this year, the Constitutional Court ruled that the Education Ministry’s ban on English immersion programs was constitutional. The complaint against the ban was filed in December 2013 by parents of students attending Young Hoon Elementary School in Seoul, which introduced its English immersion program in the late 1990s.The English immersion program, designed to let lower-grade students improve their English proficiency, consisted of mandatory English-only classes with foreign textbooks under foreign faculties. The subjects ranged from English language to math and science. The school claimed that the program, which soon spread to other private schools, was in accordance with the law that allows private schools to draw up their own curriculums. The Education Ministry prohibited the immersion program in 2012 for the first two grades, raising concerns about the Korean language ability of young students and excessive private education fever. Later grades also received a time limit on their immersion classes. Objecting to the ministry’s decision, some 1,000 parent of Young Hoon students filed the constitutional appeal, claiming that there is no scientific proof that the intensive English classes for low-grade students affect the learning of their mother tongue. The parents also filed an administrative lawsuit against the ministry but the court dismissed the case in 2014. Despite the two courts’ decisions, many private schools have resorted to an anomaly operation, by running the “optional” English immersion program after school. While the ministry has also banned advanced learning at schools since last year, there is no specific restraint on how after school classes are conducted.Private elementary schools have abused this loophole by branding their English immersion curriculums as after school program. Some schools even hold regular midterms and finals in their after school schedules, just like a regular curriculum.“Although the extra after-school classes are optional, it’s practically mandatory because students cannot follow the regular curriculum without them,” said an anonymous mother of a student who goes to a private elementary school in Seoul. According to the civic group World Without Worry About Shadow Education, 52 out of 76 private elementary schools in the country violate English class-related rules. Of the total 39 schools in the capital, the majority of the schools run the English immersion program for first and second graders in the after-school schedule. The civic group pointed out that the programs are being run as compulsory courses under their regular curriculum. “Although the regular English classes are allowed from the third grade, the actual difficulty level is designed for those who have studied English in the two previous years. Students cannot help but attend the immersion program,” said Choi Hyun-joo, researcher at the WWSE. The civic organization has urged the education authorities to conduct stern monitoring on the schools, arguing that the English immersion program triggers excessive private education costs. According to Rep. Park Hong-keun of The Minjoo Party of Korea, some private elementary schools were found to have charged students about 10 million won  a year solely for the English immersion program, with some exceeding 11 million won. The after-school programs of public schools cost around 50,000 won per month on average.“This English immersion program not only abuses the education rules but also affects the equal opportunity of education. Although private schools may have discretion to design their own curriculum, there are still some curriculum rules that they have to follow,” said English language education professor Lee Byung-min at Seoul National University. “Elementary education is mandatory for all nationals, which means that it is the basic education for Korean citizens. That is why all the hours of curriculum such as Korean history are fixed by the ministry. Studying with foreign textbooks and learning in a foreign language also raises a question as to which country the students are being educated in.” The efficacy of the immersion program has also been questioned.“It is important to assess if the immersion program practically involves immersion into English. The real immersion is only possible when students, who use English in daily life, learn new concepts in English. At private schools, they just review the concepts in English that they previously learned in Korean. It’s just a modified version of immersion,” said English education expert Lee Wan-ki at Seoul National University of Education. “The ideal immersion is realistically impossible in the Korean system.”The more concerning aspect of the intensive English program is the impact on the linguistic ability development of the low graders, some experts pointed out.“I see many low graders showing slower understanding in other courses, not because of their intellectual level but because of their poor Korean ability. Excessive exposure to a foreign languages before they fully learn their mother tongues seems to have affected both their linguistic ability and understanding level,” said private elementary school teacher Park. “I think it is right to teach foreign languages at least after the third grade.” The WWSE said it has urged the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education to conduct a curriculum inspection of the private elementary schools since late last year, the office has remained lukewarm.Once illegalities in school operation are confirmed, the concerned school can be punished with measures such as limiting the admission quota. However, none of the schools have faced such penalties.“ has conducted special monitoring in January and February. It’s considering undertaking a third monitoring based on the earlier reports,” said an official from the SMOE.By Lee Hyun-jeong","homework every day ,at private elementary school ,34 year old teacher ,of homework every day ,piles of homework every",['Seoul'],4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.58437037  0.58675098

""Through this investment plan, we plan to generate jobs, and by creating jobs, our ambitious aim is to root out the poverty level that amounts to one-third of our population.""South America's second-largest economy has grappled for years with an economic recession that has eroded the livelihoods of a large proportion of the country's 43 million people. Last year, the country posted a growth rate of 0.4 percent and an inflation rate of 26.9 percent.Michetti underscored the importance of working with the private sector at home and abroad to reverse that trend.""I hope we will be able to build good partnerships with the many advanced companies in South Korea to generate jobs in our country,"" she said, pointing to various investment opportunities in infrastructure development, energy, autos and agricultural goods.Last year, South Korean firms invested a total of US$180 million in Argentina, which is also rich in natural resources such as copper and lithium.""Our new government is opening a new era that is unprecedented in Argentina,"" Michetti said, taking a swipe at the previous administration of then President Cristina Fernandez. ""We must do away with all the troubles the previous populist government caused with its incorrect practices. We have to normalize the country this year and that means revealing all statistics and economic data in a realistic and transparent manner.""Michetti also expressed an appreciation for the Korean community in her country whose number has expanded to about 30,000 since the first generation of Korean farming immigrants arrived in 1965.""Through them, we have learned about Korean culture and they have made large contributions to Argentina's development,"" she said.In recent years, the so-called Korean Wave of popular Korean culture -- from TV dramas to artwork and pop music -- has won the hearts of many young Argentinians, she added.When asked, the vice president spoke calmly about the 1994 car accident that paralyzed the lower part of her body and left her in a wheelchair.Asked how she overcame the personal tragedy, she credited her family and friends as well as medicine and her Catholic faith.""Through education, I also had the intellectual ability to distinguish between what's important and what's less important, and that was also an important factor,"" Michetti said.She acknowledged that while she was privileged to be born into a middle-class family that could afford the medical costs, there are many others in similar situations but without access to the same resources. Michetti is a grandniece of former President Arturo Illia.""In such cases, I believe the state should actively intervene and provide help,"" she said.Michetti's visit came at the invitation of Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn. During her stay, she held talks with Hwang, paid a courtesy call on President Park Geun-hye and received an honorary doctoral degree at the Catholic University of Daegu, some 300 kilometers southeast of Seoul.","korea tuesday to help ,on south korea tuesday ,arrived in seoul sunday ,tuesday to help lift ,seoul sunday on three","['Argentina', 'South Korea', 'Argentinians', 'Buenos Aires', 'Gabriela Michetti', 'Mauricio Macri', 'Seoul']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.03951659  0.23997431

239,239,N.K. adopts decision to elect its leader as ruling party's chairman,"North Korea has adopted a decision to elect its leader Kim Jong-un as the chairman of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), the North's state media said Tuesday, a move aimed at bolstering the leader's tight control on power.The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said that the North's leader was elected to the ""top post"" of the ruling party -- chairman of the WPK -- at the first party congress in 36 years, which c...","North Korea has adopted a decision to elect its leader Kim Jong-un as the chairman of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea , the North's state media said Tuesday, a move aimed at bolstering the leader's tight control on power.The Korean Central News Agency  said that the North's leader was elected to the ""top post"" of the ruling party -- chairman of the WPK -- at the first party congress in 36 years, which concluded its four-day run Monday.The country revised its party rules, which stipulate that its top post is ""chairman of the WPK and he is its supreme leader who represents the party and leads the whole party.""Kim has been at the top post of the ruling party, but his previous title was the first secretary of the WPK. He also serves as the first chairman of the National Defense Commission and the supreme commander of the Korean People's Army.The seventh party congress served as a venue to reaffirm Kim's dual pursuit of nuclear and economic development, and to highlight the role of the WPK as the paramount political body in the North.The current leader's late father Kim Jong-il advocated a military first, or ""songun,"" policy, highlighting the role of the military, but the young leader has shifted his focus to the WPK while simultaneously pursuing nuclear and economic development. At the party gathering, Kim has made it clear that he will ""permanently"" defend the pursuit of his signature policy of developing nuclear weapons in tandem with boosting the country's moribund economy, commonly known as the ""byeongjin"" policy.The party congress has decided to enshrine the leader's policy of simultaneously pursuing nuclear and economic development in its revised party rules, according to the Rodong Sinmun, the country's main newspaper.The North's leader conducted a reshuffle of top party officials but not in a drastic manner, experts said.The KCNA said that at a plenary meeting, the WPK's central committee elected five members to the standing committee of the party's politburo, including the North's leader.The four other members are ceremonial leader Kim Yong-nam; Hwang Pyong-so, director of the general political bureau of North Korea's armed forces; premier of the Cabinet Pak Pong-ju; and Choe Ryong-hae, a party secretary.The party's central committee also elected 19 members and nine alternate members of the party's political bureau, according to the KCNA.North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Su-yong was named as one of the 19 Politburo members. Kim Yo-jong, the younger sister of the North's leader, was not mentioned on the list, but she became one of the party's 129 central committee members.The committee also decided to set up a new political affairs bureau named ""the Executive Policy Bureau,"" which will be led by the North's leader.""The latest reshuffle did not involve a dramatic generational change,"" said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior researcher at the Sejong Institute. ""It means that the North's leader has consolidated his power in a stable manner.""Experts said that it is noteworthy that Choe Ryong-hae has been tapped as a member of the standing committee of the party's politburo, an indication that he has become a key aide to the North's leader.Choe served as a standing member of the political bureau in 2014 and 2015, which effectively made him the third-highest ranking person in the communist country at the time.But he is believed to have lost favor and received re-education at a rural farm late last year as punishment for his mishandling of a newly built hydroelectric power plant project.At the latest shakeup of party elites, Choe has also become a vice chairman of the newly created bureau of political affairs.""Choe has returned as one of the closest aides to the North's leader,"" said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies. ""He is now seen as the No. 2 man in the party.""North Korean top diplomat Ri's ascent to a politburo member was also noteworthy due to a possibility that he may have replaced Kang Sok-ju, a secretary handling international relations at the party, analysts said. Kang is known to be in poor health.Ri is believed to have served as a guardian of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un when Kim studied at an international school in Switzerland in the 1990s.Meanwhile, the North's military official Ri Yong-gil was found on the list of alternate members of the party's political bureau, trumping rumors that he might have been executed.South Korea's spy agency said in February that Army Gen. Ri, a former chief of the General Staff of the Korean People's Army, was executed on corruption and other charges, and replaced by Ri Myong-su, a former minister of people's security.The sudden disappearance of North Korean officials is usually viewed by outside analysts as being linked to a possible purge or punishment.Since taking power, the North's leader has executed around 100 party and military officials to take a firmer grip on power, according to South Korea's Institute for National Security Strategy.","party chairman north korea ,media said tuesday move ,ruling party chairman north ,chairman north korea ,north leader was elected","['North Korea', 'Kim Jong - un', ""Workers ' Party of Korea"", 'WPK', 'the Korean Central News Agency', 'KCNA', 'WPK']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.85976738  0.44730052

It posted economic growth for the fourth straight year in 2014 after contracting in 2009 and 2010.Kim has defended his signature policy of developing nuclear weapons in tandem with boosting the country's moribund economy, commonly known as the ""byeongjin"" policy. Seoul and Washington have warned that the dual-track policy is a dead end.Analysts said that if tougher international sanctions are put in place for a long time, the North's economy is not likely to recover due to a shortage of dollars and products.In March, the U.N. Security Council slapped its toughest sanctions to date on North Korea for its fourth nuclear test in January and long-range rocket launch the following month.Analysts said that Kim's five-year economic development vision is too short on details, compared with his grandfather Kim Il-sung's blueprint for economic growth which was unveiled at the party congress held in October 1980.The North's founder unveiled the 10-point goals to build up a socialist country by setting special targets in economic sectors.North Korea's current leader had sought to attract foreign investment into the country's special economic zones in a bid to avert economic hardship under the U.N. sanctions regime.But foreign investors have shunned them on concerns that the North's ceaseless provocations heightened uncertainty, experts said.","boost economy at party ,economy at party congress ,vision to boost economy ,five year strategy for ,congress north korean leader","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'U.N.']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48582593  0.50743628

Woo Sang-ho was elected as a floor leader of the main opposition party on Wednesday in a race against five to spearhead the party’s legislative negotiations in the new parliament opening later this month. With Woo’s election, floor leaders of all three major parties have now been settled, as they face the joint challenge of regaining public trust in politics and seizing the lead in the legislative battle toward next year’s presidential race.Rep. Woo Sang-ho, a prominent student protester from the democratic movements of the 1980s, will serve as a chief negotiator against the ruling Saenuri’s Chung Jin-suk and the People’s Party’s Rep. Park Jie-won. Woo, who will be serving his third term, will keep the post for a year and work alongside party leader Kim Chong-in until the party elects new leadership between July and August. The first order of business is to hammer out a deal over the allocations of seats for National Assembly’s speaker and high-profile parliamentary committees. The 53-year-old politician won the runoff against another activist-turned-politician Rep. Woo Won-sik. Having come in second to Woo Won-sik, the new whip beat his competitor by 63 to 57 votes. Out of 122 members of lawmakers-elect, 120 casted their votes in the runoff election. The new floor leader vowed to “unify” the liberal party by bridging differences among the factions. The former democratic activist is known to be close with the faction of the former party leader Rep. Moon Jae-in, but has got along well with non-Moon factions. The Minjoo Party's new floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho. Yonhap“We will be united as one and win ” said the floor leader. “I urge fellow lawmakers to transform our party into the one that can win the people’s trust and achieve a change of government,” he said. The new whip became a lawmaker in 2004 when the liberal Uri Party won the elections. Though he had failed to be reelected in 2008, he was elected in the 2012 and 2016 elections. He has served eight times as spokesman inside and outside the party.By Yeo Jun-suk","wednesday in race against ,woo election floor leaders ,opposition party on wednesday ,on wednesday in race ,turned politician rep woo",['Woo Sang - ho'],4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44484809  0.16006389

242,242,Seoul 'on alert' for N.K. nuke test,"South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-koo said Tuesday that the military is on alert based on the belief that the North might carry out another nuclear test to decorate its leader Kim Jong-un ahead of its ruling party congress later this week.“North Korea has been conducting nuclear tests to fulfill its various political agendas,” Han told the parliamentary defense committee, adding that the North’s Punggye-ri nuc...","South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-koo said Tuesday that the military is on alert based on the belief that the North might carry out another nuclear test to decorate its leader Kim Jong-un ahead of its ruling party congress later this week.“North Korea has been conducting nuclear tests to fulfill its various political agendas,” Han told the parliamentary defense committee, adding that the North’s Punggye-ri nuclear test site appears ready to carry out the nuclear test on cue. There has been speculation that Pyongyang may conduct a nuclear test ahead of its ruling Workers’ Party of Korea congress on Friday. Han said that it has been confirmed that the North currently has 40 kilograms of plutonium. “The military is using all resources and cooperation of our allies to counter North Korea’s nuclear threats,” he said. Defense Minister Han Min-koo attends a parliamentary committee meeting on Tuesday. But Han added that there is no evidence to believe that the North has already succeeded in miniaturizing nuclear warheads. Making small enough warheads -- conventionally under 1 ton -- to mount onto a ballistic missile is a critical step toward acquiring nuclear capacity.The minister reiterated his stance that Pyongyang’s nuclear testing on Jan. 6 -- which sparked powerful international sanctions -- is unlikely to have been a hydrogen bomb test as the communist country has claimed. He said based on the magnitude of the detonation, it is possible that the bomb could have been a boosted fission weapon, which is more efficient that a conventional nuclear weapon. Experts like Karl Dewey of the U.K.-based IHS Jane’s also said that there is a possibility that the North’s device is a boosted weapon.In a prereleased parliamentary report, the Defense Ministry said that “strategic provocation” by the North can also involve firing ballistic missiles. In an unprecedented move, the North fired its Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missile three times in the past month, all of which appear to have ended in a failure. It also fired its KN-11 submarine-launched ballistic missile on April 23, which some experts say was a partial success in that it demonstrated a successful underwater cold launch.“In reaction to our  media’s reports on ‘failed missile launches,’ the North has been clinging to regain credibility for its ballistic missile programs,” the ministry said. It also said there is a possibility of spontaneous clashes near the Northern Limit Line, the de facto sea border between the Koreas. Minister Han also addressed Pyongyang’s SLBM threats. While the ministry has assessed that North Korea could use the SLBM within the next three or four years, Han said concentrating the state’s effort may speed up the process. “I don’t believe we have ample amount of time ,” said Han, adding that the April 23 launch demonstrated some accomplishments in terms of ejection, ignition and initial flight of the missile.The military has been touting the potential deployment of the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system here as an effective measure against the North’s ballistic missile threats, along with its own Korea Air and Missile Defense and the “Kill Chain” missile defense system slated to be established in around the early 2020s. Han refrained from presenting a timeline on negotiations for stationing THAAD here, but assured the parliament that the U.S. will shoulder the cost of the deployment.The minister’s parliamentary report also pointed out that the North has been concentrating its efforts in preparation for Friday’s party congress, which marks the first one in 36 years. It also noted that the combined pressure of the U.N. sanctions and preparation for the event has sparked North Korean citizens’ complaints toward the Kim regime.

Stop discrimination! Please join us for filing a petition with the National Human Rights Commission of Korea!” and a piece of paper to collect signatures on a makeshift table during a May Day rally held in central Seoul, Sunday. “We aim to pressure the party and raise awareness on illegality of its discriminatory election pledges,” Osori, an activist working for Solidarity for LGBT Human Rights of Korea, told The Korea Herald. “We want the human rights watchdog to confirm that the Christian Party’s inflammatory acts are illegal and in violation of equal rights.”The petition came amid growing debate over the anti-gay and discriminatory pledges by the new Christian Libertarian Party that fielded their candidates in the April 13 parliamentary election. “The Christian Libertarian Party officially and publicly incite homophobia and xenophobia through their election pledges on flyers, banners and in media,” said a human rights lawyer Han Ga-ram, who is preparing to lodge the petition along with other pro-LGBT activists. Protestant groups hold a counter rally during a gay pride parade held on June 28, 2015 The Christian Libertarian Party has largely opposed three things: creation of a Halal town, passage of an antidiscrimination law and homosexuality. The party said in its election flyers and posters that the plan to build Halal factories would invite at least 300,000 Muslims, which they said would put the country at higher risk of terrorism and sexual crimes against Korean women. The move drew ire from the Korea Muslim Foundation which called it “vicious defamation against a specific region” and demanded the nation’s election committee withdraw the anti-Muslim campaign flyers. Posters and flyers distributed across the nation during the April 13 election campaign read “Korean churches made it!” and “Let’s join the petition to establish Republic of Korea which can stop spread of homosexuality and invasion of Islam.” The Protestant-backed party also vowed to stop the National Assembly from passing the pending antidiscrimination law which it sees as expanding homosexuality and undermining the Bible’s teachings. It also said that homosexuality is against humanity and causes sexual diseases such HIV-AIDS on its campaign trail. “The party’s presence poses a fundamental threat to human rights and democracy. We could not sit back and stay silent when the party is now entitled to government subsidies,” the lawyer Han said. In South Korea, any political party with a seat in the parliament or with more than 2 percent of votes in the election can receive political funds from the government.The Christian Libertarian Party earned 2.63 percent of total votes. Another religion-backed Christian Democratic Party took 0.54 percent of the votes, putting the combined votes for the Christian bloc at over 3 percent. The Christian Libertarian Party failed to secure any seats in the 300-seat National Assembly, but it is expected to receive about 400 million won in the second half of the year and 1.9 billion won in 2017. Anti-gay groups hold placards that read ""Holy Korea"" and ""Homosexuality Out"" in Seoul Plaza, central Seoul, during a pride parade held on June 28, 2015. The party also violates international law, said the lawyer Han. “As the international law is effective as domestic law, the NHRCK should base the international law to confirm the party’s inflammatory policies as discriminatory.” The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by the United Nations General Assembly, which took effect in Korea in 1990, prohibits any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that incites discrimination, hostility or violence. It also stipulates that all persons are entitled to protection against discrimination on grounds such as race, sex and religion.“On one hand, freedom of speech in the political arena should be allowed to the fullest,” said law professor Hong Seong-soo from Sookmyung Women’s University. ”On the other hand, politicians’ opinions inciting discrimination against minorities and different religions in public should be regulated because such actions make those on the edge of society impossible to lead their lives.” “Currently, South Korea has no law that can ban discrimination and inflammatory remarks in public,” Hong said, adding that the Constitution stipulating antidiscrimination values cannot serve as legal deterrence. Thousands of spectators participate in the opening ceremony of the 16th Korea Queer Festival's pride parade in Seoul Plaza, central Seoul, during a gay parade held on June 28, 2015 Antidiscrimination laws aimed at rooting out bigotry on such grounds as gender, disability, age, race, marital status and religion have been submitted to the National Assembly since 2007. But they remain deadlocked in the face of Protestant groups’ fierce resistance to equal rights for sexual minorities.For now, the NHRCK receives complaints and opens an investigation when discrimination based on sexual, religious and racial grounds takes place. If needed, it imposes recommendations, but they have no legally binding force. But the prospects for the upcoming petition against the Christian party do not seem rosy, with the NHRCK official mulling over whether it is within its authority to investigate a political party’s election pledges. “When we receive a petition on discrimination, we decide whether the discrimination occurred in such sectors as employment, education. If not, we are likely to dismiss the case.” The lawyer Han said that he hopes to receive a “proper answer.” “What is more serious than discriminatory action itself is the fundamental structure that continues to allow discrimination to spread across the country,” he said. “It is the human rights watchdog’s responsibility to fix the structure.

The police said the 39-year-old surnamed Park had worked as a 7th grade civil servant for two months, before breaking into tears in front of his mother complaining of his work being “too tough” and disappearing shortly after. His mother reported him as missing to the police, who tracked the location of Park’s cell phone and found his body at a motel located in Jegi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu next to burnt-out coal briquette. He left no will.  Park had suffered a fifth class brain lesions, which meant he could carry out most of the essential daily acts such as maintaining personal hygiene and climbing up and down stairs, albeit with minor difficulties.He first held a position as 5th public official in special service at the National Assembly, then as a 9th grade public official at another government agency, before he was hired as a 7th grade official at the Seoul City Hall this January. He received a month’s training before being assigned to the department where he worked until his death.The Seoul City spokesperson expressed condolences and regrets at Park’s death, saying that he never showed particular signs of distress at work.The spokesperson cautiously offered that Park had “debts from the business he ran prior to getting governmental job. We knew that he took sleeping pills.” Around the end of last year, two public officials took their lives by jumping off the 13-story Seosomun Building in Seoul, provoking some to lash out at the rigid working culture and the pressure for promotion that led to overheated competition among civil servants.In a move to alleviate workplace pressures, Seoul City in March had put forth a number of measures to innovate group culture. It actively recommended officials to take holidays, while drawing up guidelines for work according to each official’s position and year of experience. Those who had more work than they could handle had their duties redistributed while those placed in so-called undesired departments were interviewed to analyze individual cases.

Ahn Cheol-soo  attends a party meeting on Monday. Ahn claimed on Monday that his remarks were misinterpreted, saying, “It is inappropriate to inaccurately report on a private conversation.” His officials said the comment was intended as a “joke” to highlight the need for educational overhaul. The entrepreneur-turned-politician has advocated the need for education reform and criticized the government for lacking long-term plans to oversee and improve the education policy. The former presidential candidate had proposed in 2012 to establish a presidential committee devoted to education issues. “There is a serious mismatch between jobs and education,” said the leader on Monday. “Studying hard does not guarantee getting better jobs anymore. We need to discuss a plan to offer creative education and reform the system,” he said. The centrist party leader has also highlighted that private colleges should be granted more authority to select their own students and that the current college admission system should be scrapped and replaced with more advanced systems such as writing tests tailored for different academic disciplines.

The games included those played on computers, televisions and smartphones. The level of addiction was gauged according to the students’ self-assessment of the negative effects their gaming hours had on their school life, such as their ability to pay attention in class and complete assignments. The results pointed to a difference between male and female students. For male students, there was an inverse proportion between the number of hours they spent playing games and the academic interest they showed at school. However, those who said they had a close relationship with their father seemed to experience less negative impacts on their school life, despite spending three to four hours per day playing games. Their relationships with their mothers showed no apparent correlation. Likewise, female students who thought of themselves as game addicts had relatively well-performing academic records when they had close emotional ties with their mother. Regardless of how severe they considered their addiction, the ones who said they had a good relationship with their mother experienced fewer side effects on their academic performance.  However, the relationship with their father was irrelevant. The Yonsei research team said there needs to be additional discussion to determine the differences between male and female students but that they have tentatively reached conclusions that the way the students identified themselves with the parent of the same gender may have affected the results. The team also said the girls’ academic performance in general were less influenced by the number of hours they spent playing games, possibly due to their playing ‘casual’ games that require a shorter time span and have less burden on their studies.

Their sales promotion included buy-one-get-one-free events and discounts.YonhapThe distributors explained that the event was simply part of regular sales promotion held each season, adding that they would withdraw all Oxy products from the list.“The sales promotion was planned three months in advance and it was practically difficult to exclude Oxy’s products. But we admit that our actions were not thoughtful enough,” an official from Lotte Mart was quoted as saying. Lotte Mart, one of the toxic humidifier disinfectant makers and distributors, is blamed for the loss of 22 lives who used its in-house brand Wislect’s humidifier disinfectant. A boycott backed by the civic group Asian Citizen’s Center for Environment and Health has so far been targeting Oxy, which is allegedly responsible for 103 out of the 143 deaths recognized by the authorities as being caused by the humidifier sterilizers. Oxy sells more than 120 household items and five medicine products here.Amid widening investigation into the toxic humidifier disinfectant tragedy, the Environment Ministry vowed Saturday to find a correlation between the use of toxic disinfectant and other health symptoms in addition to lung-related diseases.The ministry also said it will soon invite experts and analysts to establish new standards for the compensation of damages to victims.

They occur almost every two months.”Distributors are holding special promotions for toys in time for Children’s Day. On an ordinary day, it is still costly to keep a child looking decent, feed him organic food and have him attend various classes -- including math, Korean and English. If you are surrounded by people who do all this, it is extremely hard to be the odd one out. Kim regularly meets a group of mothers to share information on a wide range of products and programs, to make each of their kids “a leader” in their classes. The standard 7-year-old leader would look good, be tall and study well, she said. Kim is one of many Korean parents eager to spend their hard-earned money to satisfy the needs of their children and raise them to become an above-average person, as a future elite school graduate with a decent job. And it all starts at an early age.From name-brand clothes to organic food and tailored education tools for toddlers, the market for kids has grown fast and wide to the point of being overrated.The size of the baby market -- for basic needs such as diapers, toys and baby gears -- is estimated at 1.7 trillion won . Industry insiders say the kids market may be the only one that will not be affected by a slowing economy. According to Auction, an online shopping site, sales of kid’s furniture jumped by 23 percent from Jan. 1- April 21 this year compared to the same time period last year. Popular items were premium products made out of eco-friendly materials. CJmall, another online shopping service, said the sales of toys increased by 15 percent in April compared to March. Each customer spent an average of 170,700 won, a 2.3-fold increase from 72,200 won in 2013.Companies and private education institutes have also jumped into the fray to cash in on the competition and anxiety of the parents.The state-run Korea Institute for Child Care and Education’s February report shows that the size of private education for children aged five and younger reached 3.23 trillion won in 2015, up 22.2 percent from the year before. “No parent wants to force their kids to do something they don’t want to. But in reality, it is not easy to let that expectation go,” said Oh Soo-hyun, the mother of a 5-year-old boy.“After all, Korea is a competitive society, and admission to an elite school is a ticket for a promising future. No parent would miss that opportunity, no matter the cost.”By Cho Chung-un","the latest lego series ,weekender parental competition anxiety ,latest lego series nexo ,latest lego series ,weekender parental competition","['Kim Young - eun', 'Seoul', 'child ’s Day']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.70875645  0.13824305

Civic groups, however, have argued that a total of 1,528 users were affected, with 228 dead. Unrecognized users have not been eligible for financial support from the government. The ministry said it would conduct more health research to confirm the clearer causality between the health damage and the product use. Meanwhile, the boycott against humidifier sterilizer manufacturer Oxy Reckitt Benckiser is expanding across the country, with Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon joining the move calling it an “immoral company.”“The society will only become healthy if immoral companies or labor-management relations that step beyond social magnanimity are punished,” he said during a live-cast on Facebook late Thursday.“As far as I know, the  City Hall is using some Oxy products. I’ll make sure we do not use them anymore,” he said, calling the humidifier sterilizer case “the bedroom version of Sewol ferry disaster.”The boycott movement has started both online and off-line amid public uproar over the belated investigation and company apologies related to the disinfectant products that have been blamed for deaths of at least 143 since 2011. A total of 13 manufacturers and distributors are involved in a lawsuit filed by the victims and their families. Four are under investigation by the prosecution. Oxy Ssak Ssak was the most used brand by the alleged victims -- around 70 percent.“We should make sure that products of such immoral companies cannot set foot in the market as soon as the prosecutorial probe result is released,” Park said.The boycott began to spread this week, with pharmacists being the most active. Oxy has been selling more than 120 household items and five medicine products here, including sore throat medicine Strepsils and antacid Gaviscon. On Tuesday, a group of pharmacists in Busan vowed to stop selling Oxy products, urging the company to take social and moral responsibility. The group comprises of some 3,000 pharmacists.Other pharmacists across the country have also individually taken part in the moveThe Korean Pharmaceutical Association said that it fully understands the boycott movement. “ shares the same awareness that  should take this case as an opportunity to classify public health-related products as ‘sanitary aid’ and raise the safety standards,” said the KPA after holding an urgent meeting Friday.Political parties also accelerated their moves to help the victims. While President Park Geun-hye on Thursday ordered that relevant organizations take appropriate measures for the victims. “As the government has provided 3.7 billion won  for damages to victims so far, there is a need to compensate them first by enacting a special regulation, and then exercising the right to indemnity against the company,” said Rep. Kim Jung-hoon of the ruling party on Friday. “The government should also check whether the victims had suffered damage to other organs other than the lungs because of the humidifier disinfectant. A parliamentary hearing should be held after the ongoing probe is finished.”Earlier this week, The Minjoo Party of Korea said it would consider enacting a special law that would allow the compensation for victims and holding a parliamentary hearing if necessary. The People’s Party joined the Minjoo’s move on Thursday, saying that it was urgent to systematically overhaul the system to prevent a reoccurrence. Meanwhile, the prosecution has reportedly found that the company Butterfly Effect, whose toxic humidifier disinfectant Cefu it says killed 14 and injured 13, had manufactured the product without any professional knowledge. The company head, surnamed Oh who was summoned Thursday, reportedly testified that he had obtained the manufacturing formula on the Internet, research data and dissertations. Cefu contained a chemical known as PGH, which is thought to be more harmful than PHMG, which Oxy had used as its main ingredient. Unlike PHMG, PGH solution is not toxic when ingested and causes little irritation, but its toxicity through inhalation has not been tested. The investigators suspected that Oh overlooked the potential health impacts of inhaling PGH and skipped the safety test. Oh and his colleague allegedly exported the ingredient from a Danish company and mixed it with water. At the time, the company had only about 10 employees, none of which had expertise in chemical manufacturing or chemical research, the prosecution said. The company which sold Cefu from 2009 to 2011, recorded the third-largest number of dead victims. Oxy recorded the highest with 70, followed by Lotte Mart with 16. The investigators are seeking accidental manslaughter charges against Oh. Prosecutors continued the probe Friday by questioning two more Oxy officials.

According to the report, the life vest used by soldiers during a boat drill in Hangang River was designed to have higher buoyance on the back than the front, which led to the device forcing the soldiers’ face under water.The Ipo irrigation pool at the southern stretch of Hangang River in Yeoju-si, Gyeonggi Province. The daily claimed that investigation report obtained from the Army headquarters said that the November 2010 accident of four drownings at the Ipo irrigation pool in Yeoju-si, Gyeonggi Province, was due to the faulty design of the life jacket the soldiers wore at the time. The report read, “If the soldiers lost consciousness while being swept in the current, it can be presumed their centroid was tilted to their torso, which could have submerged their heads under water.” “There appears to be a need for a thorough research to improve the life jackets.” When the boat capsized during the military drill, the soldiers were swept away in the current and were later found drowned with their backs turned up facing the sky. The floatable jackets they wore had 55 percent buoyancy on the back and 45 percent on the chest. The military is being accused of allegedly covering up the faulty life jackets to avoid taking responsibility for the death of the four soldiers. A military insider, whose identity was withheld to protect the source, said in an interview with the local daily that the reason the life jackets were designed in such a manner was due to misconstrued notion that it would allow the soldiers to always maintain a front-facing posture. Unlike the army life jackets, the navy’s kapok life jackets have extra buoyancy at the front, with only one-third of chest buoyancy at the back.  The insider claimed the jackets were not the direct cause of soldiers’ drowning, however the incident has served as a trigger to run a check on safety gears and improve on them. “The buoyancy was corrected so that the chest would have 10 percent higher buoyancy than the back.”The military will distribute the new life jackets to each military unit by the end of this year. A budget of 1.7 billion won  was allocated to the military for this.By Lim Jeong-yeo","soldiers drown due to ,soldiers drown due ,deaths of four soldiers ,soldiers during boat drill ,soldiers drown","['Yeoju', 'Gyeonggi Prov']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27110946  0.07278965

It is this humble gesture of introspection and allusion to betterment that touches the doubting heart amid challenging situations.President Park Geun-hye, however, seems to be in denial of such dynamics as she has once again pointed her finger at political parties instead of shouldering blame as the nation’s top official in charge.When Park invited the chief editors of local media to a luncheon meeting on Tuesday for the first time in three years, anticipation rose that the state leader may at last be open to criticism and show a willingness to change.But throughout the 130-minute session, the president sidestepped most of the issues that called her to account.“The presidential post is to assume unlimited responsibility toward the people and the nation, but I found that there was very little I could do as president,” she said.“I have visited the National Assembly, invited key officials for talks, repeatedly called for their support in revitalizing the economy, but to no avail.”These self-defending remarks, in fact, came in response to a question asking whether she considered the result of the April 13 general election as the people’s disapproval of the current administration.Park, instead of mentioning the underachievement of the ruling conservative Saenuri Party, shifted the blame to the opposition, mainly The Minjoo Party of Korea.“The people felt the need to pull out the parliament from its bipartisan feuds and legislative stagnancy, which is why they created a new tripartite frame, hoping for improved power balance,” she said, referring to rise of the runner-up opposition People’s Party.She neither recognized the public’s criticism of the government, nor mentioned her feud-ridden home party, which lost its parliamentary majority and slipped to the No. 2 in-house party.The evasive answers naturally failed to satisfy the senior journalists, leading another participant to rephrase the question.“I would like to ask, once and for all, whether you consider the election result as a judgment solely upon the legislature or also upon  state affairs,” said one of the chief editors present at the luncheon.Even this hard-hitting query could not elicit a meaningful response from Park.“Based on various analysis and criticism regarding the election result, I am seeking to better embrace the public sentiment and to improve people’s livelihoods by cooperating with the parliament,” was her reply.Park also spent several minutes elaborating on her own hardships.“I have come all the way to presidency to improve the lives of the people, I sleep fitfully at night, struggling to realize such goals, yet I feel helpless and hurt that I should be held back ,” she said.The president’s self-centered attitude tested the patience of even the most administration-friendly newspapers. Chosun Ilbo, the leading conservative paper here, in its editorial questioned the cogency of her words which it described as buck-passing.Park may take this negative turn from the media as a “betrayal” of public sentiment, but it may now be time for her to ponder whether or not she was the one who betrayed people’s expectations.Looking back on her turbulent 18-year political career, she should certainly remember that it was often her unassuming attitude amid troubled times that won her the most cheers.By Bae Hyun-jung","amid challenging situations president ,park blame game fails ,challenging situations president ,challenging situations president park ,her finger at political",['Park Geun - hye'],4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43385217  0.22527434

The Saenuri Party and President Park Geun-hye suffered a continuous decline in ratings in their stronghold Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province.Local pollster Realmeter said the Minjoo Party had an approval rating of 31.5 percent among 2,536 surveyed respondents from April 18-22. The Saenuri fell behind by 3.4 percentage points at 28.1 percent.In Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province, the Saenuri Party collected 47.5 percent, a 1 percentage point drop from the week before. The party had suffered a 3 percentage point decline in the previous week as well.President Park Geun-hye Approval ratings for President Park also dropped by 0.1 percentage point to 31.4 percent, while negative assessment rose by 1.2 percentage points to 63.5 percent.Park’s negative evaluation exceeded positive ones in Daegu and North Gyeongsang region -- 49.2 percent to 46.6 percent -- for the first time in 15 months.Park’s approval ratings dropped more significantly by 8.8 percentage points to 34.1 percent in Daejeon, Sejong and Chungcheong regions.The Minjoo Party, meanwhile, maintained its slight lead since the April 13 general election, and marked another 1.1 percentage point increase. The gap between the Saenuri and the Minjoo, however, is within the margin of error.Among the potential presidential candidates, the Minjoo Party’s former chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in kept his lead at 27 percent. He topped the list in all regions except in Gwangju and Jeolla provinces, the original stronghold for his party that mostly elected People’s Party candidates this time. People’s Party’s co-chief Rep. Ahn Cheo-soo beat Moon in the region with 31.4 percent but his overall popularity dropped slightly to 18.4 percent. Following Moon and Ahn were the Saenuri Party’s Oh Se-hoon and Kim Moo-sung, although both marked small declines in ratings.Alarmed by the election defeat and reeling under low approval ratings, Cheong Wa Dae has indicated the president would broaden her means of communication. On Tuesday, Park is to hold talks with 46 chief editors of the country’s leading newspapers and TV stations, the second such meeting since her inauguration in 2013.Sources from Cheong Wa Dae said Park is also mulling holding talks with chiefs of major parties soon.“It will be important to expand the scope of dialogue starting with the media and continue to create common ground to promote consistent reforms to break through the structure of low growth,” a presidential official said.","gyeongsang province local pollster ,second week the saenuri ,among 536 surveyed respondents ,province local pollster realmeter ,polls the main opposition","['Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun', 'Daegu', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'realmeter', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Saenuri']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34040013  0.76950228

Prosecutors said that Oxy -- formally renamed Reckitt Benckiser Korea since 2014 -- submitted a 77-page report recently that sought to refute the claims, saying the deaths may have been triggered by other risk factors such as yellow dust in spring or separate germs generated from humidifiers. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously confirmed in 2011 that there was a significant association between the health impacts and the use of humidifier disinfectant Oxy Ssak Ssak.The report was submitted in January this year as the prosecution began to speed up the probe into the humidifier disinfectant tragedy. Having summoned several Oxy officials last week, the prosecution said it would also call in Oxy’s former CEO Shin Hyun-woo later this week. Shin is considered the key figure for the investigation, as he worked at the company from 1991 to 2004. The product in question was sold from 2001 onward.Prosecutors will also look into whether the company attempted to distort the report to cover up the case. Speculations have grown that Oxy had allegedly distorted the report on experiments the company had requested from two institutions for toxicity tests in 2011.Right after health authorities confirmed the causal link between the products and the deaths in an August 2011 report, the British company reportedly asked for a toxicity test of the problematic ingredient, PHMG, from Seoul National University and Korea Conformity Laboratories. In Seoul National University’s reproduction-toxicity test, the research team reportedly found out that 13 babies born to 15 pregnant mice died, adding credibility to the government’s health probe. In a separate inhalation-toxicity test, however, the research team allegedly concluded that the causality between the disinfectant and lung diseases was not clear. Despite the two different results, the company allegedly submitted only the latter to the prosecution this year. News reports said that the company did not collect the KCL’s report, which had a similar test results to the university’s reproduction-toxicity test. Oxy reportedly paid over 200 million won  to each institution for the experiments, the prosecution said. Prosecutors are probing whether the two institutions deliberately manipulated the test results or whether there was an under-the-table deal. Meanwhile, families of the humidifier disinfectant victims slammed the recent apologies offered by the disinfectant manufacturers and distributers Sunday. “The companies that had remained unperturbed for the past five years have begun to move as the prosecution’s probe began to rapidly gain speed. Lotte Mart and Oxy, which had remained unmoved, started pretending to apologize in front of the press, all the while still ignoring the voices of the victims. One thing is clear in that we have heard nothing from these companies,” said Kang Chan-ho, representative of the group of the families of victims.Lotte Mart made an apology to the victims on April 18, with a support fund of 10 billion won, a day before the prosecution started to summon the disinfectant company’s officials. Oxy also released a letter of apology Thursday to victims of the humidifier disinfectant, saying it would offer 5 billion won in humanitarian assistance in addition to another 5 billion won in funds it had previously pledged.The families also urged the government to take stronger measures for the victims and potential victims who are waiting for their health causality test results. About 750 disinfectant users requested a health causality test last year to be recognized as official victims of the humidifier disinfectant. Only 221 so far have officially been confirmed to have been affected by the product. The full results are expected to be released late next year. They also urged the government to set up a report-receiving center for other potential victims who have not been officially recognized for the damage due to relatively mild symptoms. To the new National Assembly elected earlier this month, the victims and their families asked for a parliamentary hearing over the disinfectant tragedy. They also demanded that it pass a pending law that would allow the victims to receive financial support.

She added excessive spending on welfare could have an impact on the country's long-term fiscal health.The chief executive also advocated special administrative rules like the ""pay-go"" system. The system makes clear that any additional outlays must be offset by spending cuts or revenue increases. ""The problem of maintaining long-term fiscal soundness is something that is agreed upon by the people,"" the president pointed out.`At the meeting that sets government guidelines on spending, the Ministry of Strategy and Finance said it will maintain its expansionary fiscal policy mode for the next five years to prop up the economy. It, however, said every effort is going to be made to cut unnecessary outlays.The ministry moreover has been moving to streamline the public sector to get rid of overlapping institutions. This can save money and lead to a more efficient fiscal spending structure.The chief executive's latest remarks apparently came after the political parties spearheaded different welfare pledges in the lead-up to the April 13 parliamentary elections.Kim Chong-in, interim chairman of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea, stressed the importance of ""productive welfare,"" saying that the expanded welfare policy will eventually induce growth in related industries, such as health and medical services.Kang Bong-kyun, a campaign chief of the ruling Saenuri Party, meanwhile, agreed with Kim on the need for the expansion of social welfare but warned against irresponsible policies that leaned toward populism. He argued such actions will not solve the country's problems of slow growth or improve the country's employment market.","campaign pledges friday stressing ,populist campaign pledges friday ,populist pledges president park ,pledges friday stressing ,campaign pledges friday",['Park Geun'],4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42570466  0.25050125

If successfully built, they will be the first of such schools established in the city since 2003. As of this year, a total of 29 special education schools are running in Seoul. This is part of medium-term support measures for the disabled, with the country marking its 36th Disabled Persons Day on Wednesday, officials said. Members of the civic group Korean Parents’ Network for People with Disabilities urge the city government to draw up support measures for children with developmental disabilities at Seoul City Hall, on Monday. Concerns, however, remain over potential opposition from neighborhood residents. Previous plans to build a job training center and two schools for the disabled had hit a snag due to opposition from vocal residents who claimed the facilities would hurt their communities’ image and effect real estate prices. “Many people still view special schools as ‘unpleasant institutions.’ Selecting the location for the schools will be most crucial. Unless the office successfully determines the region and deals with the communities’ opposition, it will be tough to build schools,” said Kim Chi-hun, the disability policy and research director of the Korean Parents’ Network for People with Disabilities.The office said it would discuss available sites for the schools with the Seoul Metropolitan Government. Of some 13,000 disabled students in the city, 35 percent attend special schools while the rest go to general schools. Due to scarcity of the schools, out of some 4,600 disabled students, about 42 percent spend on average about 30 minutes to one hour commuting to school, according to the survey by the education office. Of those surveyed, 3 percent said their commute time was about one to two hours on average.Overcrowded classrooms are also another hurdle for the disabled.Most of the special schools in the city are overcrowded, with an overpopulation rate exceeding 150 percent in some schools.

But in what is a usually vibrant and lively fish market drawing some 30,000 customers a day, tension is running high. Red ribbons reading “Opposition to relocation of fish market” or “Please save the Noryangjin Fish Market” flutter above the fish stalls.  On the second floor, all the restaurants to which customers could bring their purchase to cook and eat are shut, with a big X sign and “demolition” in red spray paint on their glass doors.Seoul’s oldest and largest fish market is currently witnessing a fierce battle between its fish vendors and managing company National Federation of Fisheries Cooperation, or Suhyup in Korean.Merchants continue their business at the old Noryangjun Market in Seoul on April 4. Citing the decaying and structurally dangerous facility, Suhyup’s management opened a new state-of-the-art facility on March 12 and asked the fishmongers to move in. It plans to demolish the original building and develop the real estate into a resort. The majority of the seafood vendors, however, have protested the relocation plan, claiming that the stalls allotted to each vendor in the new building are too small and expensive. They said the move will also destroy “a tradition” that they have built in the current site over the past 89 years. Instead of moving to the new location, the vendors want the old market to be refurbished. “A market should be like a market, not a department store,” said a 52-year-old fishmonger in the old market, who wished to be identified by only his surname Kim. “Yes, the facility is in a bad condition, but we can improve it by renovating this place. Would you clear out Gyeongbokgung Palace just because it is old?”“This place has served as a historic market for decades and the value of the market cannot be calculated with money,” Kim said, donning a red vest with a slogan “Fight for rights for living.” “We built a tradition that cannot be replaced elsewhere.” Kim also cited practical issues, such as narrower space, low ceiling and higher rent at the new facility. “If rental fees go up for a stall in the new building, we will have to raise fish prices and restaurant owners will have to raise the price of soju. It is loss for customers, too.” The Noryangjin Fish Market, which has been in operation since 1927, has become an iconic landmark in Seoul, offering over 800 seafood varieties at wholesale prices around-the-clock. South Koreans as well as some 200,000 foreigners visit the market each year, with TripAdvisor placing it at No. 38 out of 678 tourist attractions in Korea. Suhyup, which has managed the fish market since 2002, reached an agreement to modernize the run-down facility with vendors through 23 rounds of negotiations in 2009. The eight-story building, which cost Suhyup a whopping 523 billion won , was completed in October and opened on March 16. A month after its opening, however, only 200 of the 680 vendors moved to the new building, with tourists and customers still flocking to the old market. Most of the spaces in the new Noryangjin Market building remain unoccupied as of April 4. A handful of vendors were doing business on the first floor of the new market, displaying clams, crabs, and salmon, as well as fresh fish in their small tanks. They seemed to be unfazed by the ongoing wrangling in the old market, welcoming new changes. “The old marketplace is so dirty and smells like a sewer. I had to live with rats there,” said Chung Jin-suk, chattering with a group of vendors at a corner of the market. “This building is well polished and equipped with parking facilities and escalators, which my customers like a lot.”Park Tae-jin, 50, who sold fish for 23 years in the old market, said that everything in the new market was satisfactory. “The space is a bit smaller, but facilities are advanced and it is clean here. If I have to pay more as rent, I don’t mind.” Conflicting interests have divided the vendors as well, according to a 58-year-old fish retailer, who wanted to be identified by her surname Lee.Lee speculated that most of the vendors against moving to the new facility are those reaping benefits from the current location of their stalls in the old market. “In the market, the location of each stall makes a huge difference in sales. Those who could not make profits in the old market quickly moved into the new facility to choose a spot they wanted.” “I also opposed the relocation plan at first, but the conditions here turned out to be much better than expected. The remaining merchants in the old market keep complaining without trying,” she said. “They even call me a betrayer.” In the midst of conflicting interests, accusations and stepped-up moves to relocate the old vendors, things have turned radical in recent weeks.On April 1, a vendor was arrested for attempted murder after stabbing a Suhyup official with a knife. Earlier in March, violence erupted when guards hired by an agency attempted to block a parking lot and tear down makeshift restaurants in the old market. On Monday last week, Suhyup partially cut off the water and power supply, which prompted outrage among the remaining vendors. Lee Chae-ho, secretary general of the emergency committee representing vendors, blasted the agency for “unilaterally” and “forcibly” pushing for the plan without sufficiently consulting vendors. “Only a few merchants approved of the new plan, with most of the vendors having no idea of the details of the relocation,” Lee said in his office in the old market. “We were all shocked about how small the space was and how our requests were dismissed when Suhyup first revealed the new building to the public.”A Suhyup official, who requested not to be named, accused the vendors of “illegally” occupying the current site and misleading the public to defend their own interests. “We provided them with a design map and they signed all the documents indicating rent and location of stalls,” an official from Suhyup said, refusing to be named. “We spent extra budget to extend the construction period to meet their demands.” “In the new building, we allocated exactly the same size to each vendor. But vendors are complaining because they cannot use corridors and passages, which is illegal, to display their stuff any longer,” he said. “We also settled the dispute over rental fees in previous negotiations.” The Suhyup official also refuted the vendors’ claims that the company is pushing ahead with the relocation plan to make money from real estate development. “All the vendors agreed to revitalize the neighborhood to draw more customers to the market.” Suhyup applied for a license last year to establish a commercial resort including a casino after demolishing the old market. It aims to make the neighborhood a tourism hub by 2018. Unaware of the fierce behind-the-scenes bickering, scores of customers interviewed by The Korea Herald were generally happy with the new facility. “As a customer, I like the new market more because it is more convenient to shop and park,” said Hwang Jin-tae, a 55-year-old retiree, while checking out the new market with his wife. “Tradition is important, but I will go where it is convenient.” Song Kyo-yeon, a housewife in her 50s, said that she had hated the smell and unhygienic conditions in the old market. “Have you come to this place in summer? It is disgusting. I really want the merchants to move to the new building.” But some others expressed regret and worries about scrapping the old market. “The new building might be clean, polished and shiny, but the smell and mess are what I like about this place. It is traditional. I love this place,” said Jeremy Morris, a musician from England who has visited the fish market four times. “If this market gets demolished, I would be devastated.”Jung Min-jae, a 29-year-old student, hopes the old market stays as it is. “It seems like we  break down everything in the name of modernization. But serving as a fish market for 90 years itself is its identity.” The fishmongers in the old market stage a protest for 30 minutes every morning and plan to bring the case to Seoul and the central government. Suhyup, on the other hand, is set to file suit against the vendors for eviction and compensation and recruit new tenants at the new building. The Noryangjin Fish Market is not alone in fighting against the relocation plan. In eastern Seoul, more than half of the vendors at the Garak Market Seoul are also refusing to move into a new six-story building, saying it cannot function as a wholesale market due to the small space and multiple floors. Its managing company Seoul Agro-Fisheries & Food Corporation also plans to file an eviction suit to expel the tenants. Cho Myung-rae, an urban planning professor at Dankook University, pointed out that “lack of communication” leads to such dispute surrounding the city’s renovation plan for some traditional locations and neighborhoods. “Traditional markets are unique in that they are designed and operated without plans,” Cho said. “But this contradicts standardized and modernized way of business operation. That’s why conflicts erupt between vendors sticking to their traditional way of doing business and experts designing the city with reasonable yardsticks.”Cho suggested that Suhyup and the vendors ask the Board of Audit and Inspection to look into the situation, find wrongdoings, cross-check facts and seek solutions. “If Suhyup had sufficiently interacted with vendors and had not unilaterally pushed for the scheme, many of the problems would have not occurred,” Cho said. “It takes time, but it is important to seek consensus in development projects.” By Ock Hyun-ju","sunday afternoon fishmongers cheerfully ,fish market on sunday ,afternoon fishmongers cheerfully call ,sunday afternoon fishmongers ,afternoon fishmongers","['the Noryangjin Fisheries Wholesale Market', 'Seoul', 'Ock Hyun - ju', 'the Korea']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48064116  0.34624374

Indeed, protracting economic doldrums, the party’s factional fighting, and the Park Geun-hye government’s inflexibility and lack of interaction with the legislature, ordinary citizens and other members of society are blamed for the party's landslide loss in Wednesday's general election, observers said.Saenuri Party chair Kim Moo-sung pauses during a news conference at the National Aseembly on Thursday.  Since she took office about three years ago, the conservative president has rolled out a series of policy packages focusing on robust security and economic revival. While little signs of a growth recovery have surfaced, Cheong Wa Dae has failed, or refused, to consult with the parliament and reflect public opinions to build consensus as it pushed ahead with contentious plans, such as the reintroduction of state-authored history textbooks. It instead denounced opposition lawmakers and other critics as a stumbling block for its statecraft. On top of the schoolbook drive, the administration has been taking flak for attempting to overpower anti-government protesters and dissent on social media, as well as a legislative push to make it easier for family-run conglomerates to fire workers. Such heavy-handed moves invited international criticism that the country is backpedaling on democratic freedoms, reminiscent of the era of military rule by the president’s late father and longtime strongman Park Chung-hee. During his visit here last January, U.N. Special Rapporteur Maina Kiai pointed to a trend of “gradual regression on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association -- not a dramatic shutdown of these rights, but a slow, creeping inclination to degrade them.”Immersed in political infighting and partisan bickering, the ruling Saenuri Party was seen focusing on carrying through the presidential office’s initiatives without taking an in-depth analysis on any policy’s possible outcome and public repercussions. As a result, there have been a string of abrupt shifts in the government’s long-held policies or clashes between the related state agencies. The counterterrorism act, for which opposition members demanded further revisions through a days-long, world record-breaking filibuster on concerns of potential privacy breaches, was passed early last month with the ruling party’s nearly unanimous endorsement. Cheong Wa Dae spokesperson Jeong Yeon-kuk pauses during a news briefing on Thursday. “The  Minjoo Party benefited from the voters’ desperation to block the Saenuri Party from winning the election once again,” Cho Jin-man, a political science and international studies professor at Duksung Women’s University, said at a seminar Thursday in Seoul. The minor opposition’s seizure of greater-than-expected 13 proportional seats was also the result of the voters’ “stern judgment” of the major opposition Minjoo Party, he added. “On its campaign trail, the Minjoo Party was seen putting more energy into attacking the minor opposition People’s Party rather than keeping the ruling party in check, among other missteps,” Cho said. “But overall I think the people made wise choices, even though the parties remain unwise.”Park Sang-in, a professor at Seoul National University’s Graduate School of Public Administration, echoed the view, adding that the voters appear to “have lost confidence” in the current economic policies. “Though the Park presidency is in its fourth year, there’s no sign that the growth rates will go up, while the polarization only continues to deepen,” he said. ‘If the opposition camp wishes to nail another victory in next year’s presidential election, it should present detailed policies and foster trust that it can deliver, rather than approaching the economy in abstract and emotional terms under the slogan of ‘economic democratization.’”By Shin Hyon-hee","blamed for election defeat ,election defeat we will ,his constituents on thursday ,for election defeat we ,from the crushing defeat",['Saenuri Party'],4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47361204  0.16956459

The following are some of the election winners who garnered nationwide attention in their race for a parliamentary seat. Observers note that the election for the 20th National Assembly will be remembered for candidates of major parties -- Saenuri Party and The Minjoo Party of Korea -- winning in constituencies that had traditionally been their rival’s stronghold.Rep. Lee Jung-hyunSaenuri Party’s Lee Jung-hyun retained his seat in Suncheon, located in the longtime liberal base of South Jeolla Province. Lee, a close confidant of Park, had taken the constituency in the 2014 by-elections. The ruling party’s Chung Woon-chun also won a seat in Jeonju, North Jeolla Province. He became the first ruling party lawmaker from the liberal city in 20 years.But it was not just the conservatives who took victory in what was considered their rival’s home turf.Jeon Hyun-heeDecades-old Saenuri Party dominance in the traditionally conservative Gangnam-gu in Seoul was challenged by Minjoo Party candidate Jeon Hyun-hee winning the Gangnam-eul constituency. Jeon, a dentist-turned-lawyer-turned-politician, became the first opposition lawmaker from the affluent region in 24 years.Kim Boo-kyumPresident Park Geun-hye’s own political stronghold of Daegu also fell to the opposition as the Minjoo Party’s Kim Boo-kyum beat out former Gyeonggi Gov. Kim Moon-soo. It was the first time in 31 years an opposition candidate has won in the city.  Kim’s win sparked speculation for his candidacy in next year’s presidential election.Many of the high-profile independents who defected from the ruling party amid the recent nomination fiasco also emerged victorious.Rep. Yoo Seong-min, who voiced his intent to return to Saenuri upon reelection, won with over 75 percent of the votes in Daegu. Yoon Sang-hyun from Incheon was another Saenuri defector who was elected Wednesday. He was excluded from the ruling party’s nomination after an expletive-laden phone call with an acquaintance about party leader Kim Moo-sung was revealed to the public. Fellow Incheon winner Ahn Sang-soo on Thursday become the first Saenuri Party defector to formally apply to return to his old party. The party’s bigwigs have made it clear that they will not allow the return of defectors, but it also needs at least two more members to retake its position as the majority party. Rep. Suh Chung-wonAll the news was not grim for the ruling party, as its Rep. Suh Chung-won, a close associate to President Park, won his eighth term as a lawmaker. He is the longest serving incumbent lawmaker, and only six politicians -- including former President Kim Dae-jung -- have served eight or more terms. Park Ju-min Among opposition figures, first-time lawmaker Park Ju-min of the Minjoo Party is best known for legally representing the bereaved families of victims that perished in the 2014 sinking of the Sewol ferry. Upon being elected from Eunpyeong-gu, Seoul, he vowed to revise the Sewol Special Law for an extended period and get more investigation-related rights for the Sewol special investigative committee.Chin Young of the Minjoo Party has a rather peculiar resume, as he was a lawmaker for the Saenuri Party merely months before the election, but defected after failing to be nominated. The former health minister had been considered a pro-Park faction figure before he had a run-in with the president in 2013 over the government’s scaled-down basic pension plan, and then resigned as minister.Rep. Lee Hae-chanOpposition stalwart Lee Hae-chan -- a former prime minister -- also prevailed in the election, winning in the Sejong constituency as an independent after the Minjoo Party did not nominate him. Lee on Thursday visited the grave of former President Roh Moo-hyun and expressed his wish to return to the Minjoo Party. Minjoo Party leader Kim Chong-in’s refusal to nominate Lee was only one of the controversies that pelleted the main opposition’s nomination process. The dispute was fueled further by Kim’s decision to nominate himself at the No. 2 spot on the party’s proportional representation list.At the height of inner party strife, Kim even offered to resign last month, but reversed his decision after a talk with former party leader Moon Jae-in.In June, Kim will commence his fifth parliamentary term after leading his party to a surprising win over the Saenuri Party.

In the election, the opposition bloc made an unexpectedly strong showing, defying the expectations of local pollsters and analysts, who thought that the ruling conservative party would easily regain the majority. Saenuri took 122 seats in the 300-member National Assembly, while The Minjoo Party of Korea won 123 seats and the new People’s Party secured 38, according to the National Election Commission. City officials in Chuncheon, Gangwon Province, on Thursday take down the posters for Wednesday‘s general election. / YonhapIn Seoul’s heavyweight match in Jongno district, for example, polls widely predicted a victory for former Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon. But five-term lawmaker Chung Sye-kyun of the Minjoo Party defeated Oh by nearly 13 percentage points. In the highly contested Yongsan district in central Seoul, polls suggested that political newcomer Hwang Chun-ja of Saenuri Party would beat Chin Young, a former health minister and defector from the ruling party. In the end, Chin finished ahead of Hwang by 3 percentage points. In Seoul’s Nowon-A district, polls put Ko Yong-jin of the Minjoo Party at least 15 percentage points behind, but he ended up crushing his rival Lee No-keun of the Saenuri Parity by nearly 3 percentage points.  In Busan, polls predicted that the ruling Saenuri party would lose only in two constituencies. But independent and Minjoo Party candidates scored six victories. In Suncheon in South Jeolla Province, Rep. Lee Jeong-hyun of the governing party saw an unexpected upset over his liberal contender Roh Kwan-kyu, in contrast to opinion polls. Electorates remain skeptical of opinion polls, too, raising questions about the credibility of pollsters. Lim Jae-young, 27, who voted in the competitive Nowon-A constituency, told The Korea Herald that he received same phone calls asking about his intentions in the election on five occasions. “I think that opinion polls can give distorted results because it is based on selective sampling,” he said. “The polls did not impact my vote as they were widely seen among my peers as not trustworthy.” According to a survey by Realmeter on 1,054 eligible voters in early April, one in two Koreans did not trust the opinion polls. Nearly 52 percent of them thought that the polls leaned in favor of the governing party, while only 20.4 percent saw them as fair. Experts pointed to unrepresentative poll samples and heavy reliance on landline phones when conducting surveys as reasons for pollsters’ irrelevance.“The method  is not wrong, but random survey on those likely to stay at home and pick up a phone, for instance, could lead to results in favor of conservative bloc.” said Kim Myung-joon, director of Global Research. While all general election polls are carried out through landline phones in Korea, pollsters are finding it increasingly difficult to widen their range of respondents due to growing usage of mobile phones. Respondents are randomly chosen according to age and gender.Young voters, who are not usually available to answer the telephone at home, are thought to be under-represented in opinion polls. Lee Taek-soo, head of local pollster Realmeter, admitted that it is no longer possible to gauge voter sentiment through the current method. He called for a need to curb regulations and revise relevant laws to boost fairness in polls. The NEC has recently slapped penalties on some pollsters for reflecting respondents’ past voting tendencies in analyzing the results, which according to Lee is an effective way of combing out the biased pool of respondents. The election law also bans pollsters from surveying electorates through mobile phones. “The election law should also be revised to expand pollsters’ access to mobile phone numbers of electorates in polls,” he said. “The NEC should also scrap the period in which pollsters cannot reveal their survey results so that the public’ rights to know can be properly upheld.” By Ock Hyun-ju","election surveys credibility questioned ,wednesday parliamentary election ,surveys in the election ,the ruling conservative party ,election with questions growing",['Saenuri'],4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50971693  0.59756863

It said 6.7 percent were caught because they used unauthorized methods to sway votes.Prosecutors said the method of election violations have been clearly shifting from bribery to spreading lies. The total number of people booked on charges of election-related offenses during this year's general elections reached 1,451 so far, with 31 people currently in custody. The figure is up 32.4 percent from that of the previous general elections which stood at 1,096.In the latest elections, the main opposition Minjoo Party and the People's Party won 123 and 38 seats, respectively.

It also marks the highest turnout in 12 years since 63.9 percent was recorded in the parliamentary elections in 1996.Election officials attributed the higher-than-expected voter turnout to the highest voter turnout of an early voting that took place last week.During the two-day early voting period from Friday to Saturday, 5.13 million voters, or 12.2 percent, cast their ballots at more than 3,000 polling stations.""People's attention to politics was very high during the 19th general elections four years ago as it took place just before the presidential election,"" said an NEC official on the condition of customary anonymity, attributing to the effect of the early voting.The early voting system, adopted in the 2013 by-elections, is different from absentee voting in that it does not require voters to sign up in advance. Eligible voters can simply show up at a polling station during the pre-voting period and cast their ballots.Election officials forecast that the voter turnout could reach 60 percent during the next parliamentary elections four years later if more people are aware of the early voting system.The total turnout rate also includes the results of overseas voting that took place earlier this month in 113 countries worldwide,A total of 63,797 out of 154,217 registered overseas Koreans participated in the six-day poll, resulting in a turnout of 41.4 percent.By region, South Jeolla Province saw the highest voter turnout of 63.7 percent, followed by the administrative city of Sejong, with 63.5 percent.The southeastern industrial city of Daegu recorded the lowest voter turnout with 54.8 percent, trailed by the southern port city of Busan with 55.4 percent, the NEC said.The capital city of Seoul and its surrounding areas, which are forecast to be closely contested, saw a preliminary voter turnout of 59.8 percent.Political and survey analysts say Wednesday's voter turnout affected the outcome of the polls since a higher turnout usually means more young voters participated in the balloting.The opposition parties are traditionally more popular among younger voters, while older voters are more supportive of the conservative ruling party. During the 2004 parliamentary elections, the then-liberal party took the sweeping victory when the turnout rate was 60.6 percent.Meanwhile, the predecessor of the ruling Saenuri Party won the next elections in 2008 when the turnout rate marked 46.1 percent.","election watchdog said thursday ,korean voters cast their ,south korean voters cast ,elect new 300 member ,13 837 polling stations","['south korean', 'National Assembly', 'the National Election Commission']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.31959262  0.8230539

The Vietnam War veteran is an advocate of a hawkish stance toward North Korea and has cast his ballot for conservative parties since the 1987 elections.  Saenuri Party leaders, including floor leader Rep. Won Yoo-chul , watch the exit polls Wednesday at the party headquarters in Yeouido. But this time around, he decided to exercise his right “not to vote” — a measure he believes would punish the conservative Saenuri Party mired in factional strife and its counterpart The Minjoo Party of Korea for failing to offer an alternative. “They deserve the punishment,” Cho said, venting his anger at the establishment parties. “Whether they are conservative or liberal parties, they are the same when it comes to treating the people as pushovers. They’d better know what it means when people like me refuse to vote,” he said. The mainstream parties had hailed the election as a means for the public to evaluate each sides’ legislative and political performance. But the electorate appeared to increasingly doubt that going to polling stations would address their frustration at the nation’s faltering economy, security threats and political standoffs. In many conversations on the street, cynicism appears to run deep toward elite politicians who are aloof about the interests of voters — unless it comes to asking for their votes.“I don’t know or care about who is running in our constituencies,” said Koo Jung-hoi, a 27-year-old office worker living in Suwon, south of Seoul. “Whoever represents our neighborhood doesn’t solve my problem. If I met someone who says otherwise, I would be shocked,” he said. Korean politics, with their legislative deadlock and partisan struggles, have long been blamed for voters’ frustration and antipathy. The process leading up to Wednesday’s election stood as a microcosm of the tangled political interests and power struggles. The rival parties failed to meet the deadline for enacting a law to determine the number of parliamentary seats and redraw constituencies. They managed to determine electoral rules just about a month before the election. The stalemate reached its climax when both parties were engulfed in factional infighting over nominations for the election. The parties ended up “strategically” nominating candidates based on factional interests, countering their earlier pledges to screen candidates through internal primaries. Those dropped from the nominations switched parties, leaving constituents confused, betrayed and left out.“It seems as if political frustration is sweeping across the electorate,” said Lee Byoung-hoon, a sociology professor at Chung-Ang University. “Voters no longer expect the political process to find where they hurt and solve the problem. They view it as a way of protecting established politicians,” he said.

It would also have maximized her influence in searching for a potential successor from the pool of heavily competitive candidates.President Park Geun-hye The disappointing results put a dent in Park’s long-held nickname, the “queen of election,” a title she once again attempted to revive this time at the risk of stoking debate over her obligation to stay neutral during elections, such as by making regional support visits up until right before the election day.Park’s loyalists, for their part, are expected to turn the blame onto current chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung for the lackluster results, seizing an opportunity to quell Kim’s faction, which has been unfriendly with the pro-Parks. On the legislative front, the loss of majority means the Saenuri Party would lose the force to push for changes and reform the president had highlighted since the beginning of the year. Park and the ruling party had been pushing to pass a series of bills on economic revitalization and labor reform. One such reform bill is provisionally called Basic Act on the Development of the Service Industry, which provides legal basis for financial support and deregulation in the service sector. Park said Tuesday that the bill would create 690,000 jobs within the next 15 years. But the opposition and the labor industry have opposed the act, pointing out that it also applies to fields that have been provided largely on a public level, such as medicine and education. They say that the bill will pave way for the privatization of the medical services, which will result in a gigantic surge in medical costs.The labor reform bills are also pending at the National Assembly. Park has said that this is crucial to creating jobs, while opponents said it will allow “easy layoffs” or workers and expand the number of nonguaranteed contract workers. Rival parties have also clashed over revising the National Assembly Advancement Act, which stipulates that at least 60 percent of the lawmakers must agree on a contested bill to pass it. The opposition has been fiercely opposing Saenuri‘s plan to revise the bill, which was one of the ruling party’s election pledges in the general election.Local observers have raised the possibility that the Saenuri Party might allow defectors to return in order to procure the majority, despite prominent members of the pro-Park faction like Rep. Choi Kyung-hwan saying they would never allow them to return.Rep. Yoo Seong-min, the former Saenuri floor leader who left the party amid the recent nominations fiasco, has publicly said that he would immediately return to his old party upon being elected. Dong-gu, Daegu handed him a resounding victory Wednesday with over 70 percent support.Park publicly said that the people should “judge the politics of betrayal,” which was widely perceived as targeting Yoo and those who opposed her welfare policies.

The turnout is 3.8 percentage points higher than in the previous general election in 2012, according to the National Election Commission. The official turnout was set to be announced early Thursday.The higher turnout is credited to record-high early voting participation and the presence of a new centrist party seen as an alternative to the long-standing two-party system. The turnout was notably high in constituencies in Jeolla Province where two opposition parties — The Minjoo Party of Korea and People’s Party — fiercely competed. The country saw the highest voter turnout in South Jeolla Province at 63.7 percent, followed by the administrative city of Sejong at 63.5 percent and North Jeolla Province at 62.9 percent. Conservative bastion Daegu recorded the lowest turnout of 54.8 percent, with Busan ranking second-lowest at 55.4 percent. Seoul’s turnout was 59.8 percent, slightly higher than the nation’s average. Early voting on Friday and Saturday, held for the first time for a parliamentary election, hit a record high of 12.2 percent. The system was first introduced for by-elections in June 2013. More than 40 percent of South Korean voters living abroad have also cast ballots, accounting for around 3.2 percent of the total. Overseas voting took place at 198 polling booths across 113 countries.A higher turnout is generally thought to advantage the liberal camp, which has the broad backing of young voters, while a low turnout is thought to benefit the conservative bloc. The liberal party won big in the selection of the 17th National Assembly in 2004, when the turnout was 60.6 percent. The right-wing party had a strong showing in the next election in 2008 when the turnout was 46.1 percent. Rain seems to have held voters at home earlier in the day. But the turnout exceeded that of the previous election by around 1 p.m. as the weather cleared up and early voting turnout was included. When it rained in 2008 and 2012, voter turnout was among its lowest at 46.1 percent and 54.2 percent, respectively.But the turnout was relatively higher on sunny days, with the 15th general election in 1996 recording 63.9 percent and the aforementioned 60.6 percent in 2004.

Yoo Seong-min also kept their names on the list.The Minjoo Party’s Moon, having stepped down from leadership and renounced candidacy for the April parliamentary race from the beginning, has kept a relative distance from the election. The essential variable for him is the outcome in the Gwangju and the Jeolla provinces, dubbed the Honam region, where voters have hinted at withdrawing their longtime political loyalty to the party. Recovering support from the region is considered crucial for Moon to cement his bid for the nation’s top job.Voters in the nation’s southwest belt have increasingly accused the Busan-based Moon of neglecting and mistreating the longtime opposition stronghold.“Should  withdraw its support from me, I will readily move off the political frontline and renounce my candidacy in the presidential election,” Moon had said last Friday, addressing the citizens of Gwangju.“An opposition candidate who fails to mirror the Honam spirit may be considered unqualified .”Though he did not specify the number of seats that will determine his political fate, the runner-up of the 2012 presidential election made it clear that he will not bypass public sentiment in the key strategic area.One big hurdle for Moon is the People’s Party, which has embraced a number of senior Honam-based Minjoo defectors. The party has been widely forecast to make a stable landing as the third largest parliamentary group.People’s Party’s cochief Ahn Cheol-soo continues to face a dilemma of how to reach out to those that remain loyal the Minjoo Party, or to persuade future voters of his political identity.Saenuri chief Kim, meanwhile, has underlined that this year’s parliamentary election is to be his last and that he will step down from party leadership after the polls, regardless of the results. This was taken as a sign that he will be shifting his prime focus to the presidential election.“I wish to play a greater role, so help me,” he said several times while campaigning in his Busan constituency.The lack of endorsement from President Park Geun-hye has been Kim’s weakest point, as pro-Park members are reportedly considering backing other high-profile figures such as U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the party’s presidential ticket.To make up for such vulnerability, Kim had been striving to steer the party to a solid majority victory and thus prove his leadership -- a plan which turned sour as the Saenuri fell short of its ambitions.Former Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon, too, drifted a step away from potential presidency after losing to ranking opposition rival in Seoul’s politically symbolic district of Jongno, based on exit polls.Oh, who had resigned from his mayoral seat in 2011 amid a dispute with the city council over free school meals, sought to make a comeback, leaning on his public recognition, as well as the subtle support of the pro-Park faction.One of the newcomers on the list is Rep. Yoo Seong-min, who successfully ran as an independent in his current constituency in conservative-leaning Daegu. The relatively reformative lawmaker, who was once seen as one of the closest aides to the president, came into public spotlight through his feuds with the party leadership and Cheong Wa Dae.The peak of the conflict was when then-floor leader Yoo agreed with the opposition to revise the parliamentary advancement bill which had been motioned by President Park.Yoo’s obvious exclusion from party nomination, which led to his defection at the eleventh hour, created an image of martyrdom and boosted his position among non-Park conservatives.By Bae Hyun-jung","parties potential presidential runners ,potential presidential runners ,toward blue house race ,potential presidential runners as ,presidential runners",[],4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56483722 -0.12362488

An official counting exit polls questions citizens at a polling station in Ulsan on Wednesday. The 15th general election in 1996 say 63.9 percent of votes, which henceforth continued to remain lower at 57.2 percent in 2000, 60.6 percent in 2004, 46.1 percent in 2008 and 54.2 percent in 2012.It rained in both 2008 and 2012 where the voter turnout was one of the lowest in history.This year, observers have cautiously predicted the ratio to surge nearly 60 percent, considering the highest voter turnout for early voting at 12.2 percent.It has been a popular belief, although never numerically proven, that good weather is more benefiting to a conservative party and bad weather is more favorable for a liberal party.It was based on the notion that younger voters tend to spend the day on outings if the weather is sunny instead of voting.But neither party appeared to depend too much on the meteorological aspect of the polls.Recent election outcomes also shun this theory.While the 15th to 17th elections were conducted in sunny days, the voter turnout among 20s and 30s was lower than in the 18th and 19th election when it rained.This time, regardless of the weather condition, young voters have shown relatively stronger determination to vote, observers note.According to Realmeter, of the 2,536 eligible voters surveyed nationwide on April 4-8, 72.3 percent of those in their 30s said they will “actively vote.” It was the highest percentage out of all age groups.","weather effect election outcome ,11 rain sprinkled across ,weather effect election ,will weather effect election ,voters headed to polls","['National Assembly', 'Korea Meteorological Administration', 'weather']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.71975368  0.48946416

Each voter is asked to cast two ballots: one for a candidate and the other for a party.Voting opened at 6 a.m. and will close 12 hours later.Voter turnout stood at 16.1 percent as of 11:00 a.m., with 6.79 million of the total 42.1 million eligible voters having cast their ballots, the National Election Commission said. The turnout rate is lower than that recorded in the previous regional elections in 2014, when the number reached 18.9 percent at the same point in time. The NEC expects the final voter turnout may reach some 60 percent although full official tallies are not expected until about 2:00 a.m. Thursday. The competition is basically a two-way race between the ruling Saenuri Party and the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea, with Saenuri forecast to win an easy victory, although it may lose some seats in its traditional strongholds to independents.However, many also forecast that the splinter People's Party will grab more than 20 seats, which would allow it to form a parliamentary negotiation bloc.Voter turnout will affect the outcome of the polls as a higher turnout would mean more young voters participated in the balloting.The opposition parties are traditionally more popular among younger voters, while older voters are more supportive of the conservative ruling party. The surveys conducted by four local pollsters last week showed that Saenuri could grab between 150 to 175 seats, while the Minjoo Party of Korea will likely secure fewer than 100 seats, shy of its initial goal of 107 seats.The People's Party is likely to win 28-32 seats on the strong backing of voters in the Honam region in the southeastern part of the country, according to the surveys.A majority win for the ruling party will allow Park to exercise control over state affairs more effectively and make it possible for her to push for various economic and social reforms.Wednesday's elections are also a crucial test for potential presidential hopefuls, including Kim Moo-sung, head of the ruling Saenuri Party; Moon Jae-in, former leader of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea; and Ahn Cheol-soo, who left the Minjoo Party to create the People's Party.South Koreans will go to the polls in December 2017 to elect a new president to succeed Park, whose single five-year term ends in early 2018. By law, she cannot seek re-election.Kim, who is seeking his sixth parliamentary term in the southern port city of Busan, has a lot to prove to party members although the party's victory could help smooth over the recent feud between various factions.Moon's election victory would also solidify his image as a competent presidential candidate, while Ahn's successful achievement of taking more than 20 seats would prove his credentials as a potential leader.Eligible voters in Wednesday's polls total about 42.1 million, more than 80 percent of South Korea's 50 million population, the NEC said.Voters will cast their ballots at a total of 13,837 polling stations across the country, it said.","presidential race the quadrennial ,crucial parliamentary elections voters ,next year presidential race ,in crucial parliamentary elections ,the crucial parliamentary elections","['National Assembly', 'Park Geun']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.85860753  0.17482941

The competition rate is 3.7 to one, compared with 3.76 to one in the previous parliamentary elections in 2012, the country's election watchdog said.Leaders of the ruling Saenuri Party visited Seoul and its surrounding areas Tuesday, as up for grabs are 122 constituencies in the so-called capital city region, cited as a crucial battleground.Chairman Kim Moo-sung first traveled to Suwon, just south of Seoul, to help bolster the chances of a Saenuri Party candidate there.""The Saenuri Party's sweeping victory is the only way to revitalize the economy and to bring hope to young people by creating more jobs,"" Kim said during a street rally in Suwon.After making a dozen stops, Kim traveled to his own electorate in the southern port city of Busan and will cast his ballot on election day.He and other Saenuri leaders have accused the opposition of holding up crucial legislation that can boost the country's economic competitiveness in such areas as the labor market.The latest surveys show that the Saenuri will take an easy victory, although it may lose some seats in its traditional strongholds to independents who defected from the party.The leadership of the Minjoo Party of Korea also focused its campaigns in the same areas, pleading for voter support to keep Saenuri in check.Kim Chong-in, after traveling to the southern resort island of Jeju, visited nearly 20 electorates in Seoul that are forecast to be closely contested.""The Saenuri will grab another chance if voters pick an opposition party that is not the proper one,"" Kim said during a street rally on Jeju Island, apparently warning voters not to cast their ballots for the People's Party. Minjoo has maintained that voting for the rival opposition party is tantamount to handing victory over to the Saenuri.Kim called for the judgment of the incumbent administration's handling of the economy, saying the government and Saenuri failed to improve the people's livelihoods.The People's Party, which is likely to grab more than 20 seats on the strong backing of voters in the Honam region in the southeastern part of the country, focused its attention on Seoul.Securing 20 seats would allow the party to form a parliamentary negotiation bloc.Ahn Cheol-soo, the party's co-chairman, made visits to a dozen electorates in Seoul and its surrounding area that the party believes its candidates has chances of winning.""Saenuri and Minjoo both failed even when they had so many opportunities,"" said Ahn during a Seoul street rally.

Chung Jin-seok’s canvassing in South Chungcheong Province. Rep. Chung is an uncle of Lee’s husband, Chung Ho-young.Actress Lee Young-ae joins a campaign in support of ruling Saenuri Party’s candidate Rep. Chung Jin-seok on Monday. “I have known Rep. Chung for a long time and he is a sincere and honest man. I hope you all support him,” said Lee to potential voters.Trot singer Tae Jin-ah made an appearance at a mini concert on Sunday during a campaign to garner votes for Rep. Park Duk-hyum of the Saenuri Party in North Chungcheong Province. Actor Song Il-guk also stepped in to help his mother Rep. Kim Eul-dong of the Saenuri Party, a second-term lawmaker who is running for a position in Seoul’s southeastern Songpa-C district.Political parties have traditionally aimed to share in the popularity of well-established social influencers to maximize stumping.Celebrity endorsements are nothing new in Korea, although until the 1970s, TV stars’ participation in politics usually served as a means for the iron-fisted government to expand their propaganda. With democratization, more voluntary forms of political involvement by entertainers were seen, with stars using their status to voice out on various social issues.More recently, with the advent of social media, more celebrities have begun to voice their political views. The rise of such “politainers” -- celebrities who freely participate in political and social issues -- include singer Lee Hyo-ri, an animal rights advocator who also supports laborers, and Kim Jang-hoon, a vocal campaigner for the Dokdo Islets. Their political participation, however, has also sometimes garnered backlash, as they were often scrutinized for their “biased” views by those opposed, or for slips of the tongue.An actor, who has been featured in 10 or more TV dramas and commercials, told The Korea Herald that expressing his political preference always comes with caution.“I am very concerned about my image as an actor and how my preference may influence my choice of works in the future,” said the actor, who wished to remain anonymous.While celebrities are raising their voices in political issues with risk, stars such as TV show host Kim Je-dong have allegedly faced trouble for having expressed political preferences. In 2015, Kim participated in a one-man protest against the government’s publishing of state-authored Korean history textbooks for middle and high school students.Singer Kim Jang-hoon also confessed to local media that he has experienced disadvantages in performing on stage because he took part in campaigns for the Dokdo Islets and Sewol ferry accident.Experts say despite different reactions to stars’ involvement in the political scene, the role of celebrities in political issues will continue.“Politicians and entertainers have one thing in common: they live by their social images,” said professor of media communications Song Hae-ryong from Sungkyunkwan University.“Celebrities will always get involved in politics and they will always have the opportunity to influence public opinion,” he added.But the changes that their actions may bring are generally difficult to measure.“Stars may have far-reaching power, especially in the political scene, because the general public considers politics as something difficult and an issue that they are not involved in,” professor of psychology Lee Taek-kwang from Kyunghee University told The Korea Herald.“But celebrities’ political participation can be viewed as populism unless their endorsement brings practical change to policies and current political circles,” added Lee.By Kim Da-sol","voters on monday actress ,election drawing mixed reactions ,wednesday general election drawing ,celebrity campaigning gets mixed ,monday actress lee young","['Lee Young', 'Tae Jin - ah', 'Lee Young', 'Saenuri Party ’s', 'Chung Jin - seok', 'South Chungcheong Province', 'Chung']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.9087745   0.44910944

281,281,[ELECTION 2016] Feud-Plagued parties go to polls,"Political parties raced to the unpredictable final stretch of campaigning on Tuesday, as voters braced to pick the country’s 20th National Assembly that will be tasked with reviving economic growth, addressing security and diplomatic quandaries and setting the political groundwork for next year’s presidential election.Wednesday’s parliamentary race is being held after months of delays in negotiation over electoral...","Political parties raced to the unpredictable final stretch of campaigning on Tuesday, as voters braced to pick the country’s 20th National Assembly that will be tasked with reviving economic growth, addressing security and diplomatic quandaries and setting the political groundwork for next year’s presidential election.Wednesday’s parliamentary race is being held after months of delays in negotiation over electoral maps, heavy in-party feuding over nominations and a number of cross-party membership swaps among candidates.Voter turnout is anticipated to be one of the biggest factors for the winning party as they vie for the majority in the 300-seat Assembly.The general election will run from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. at over 13,000 polls across the country, according to the National Election Commission.Voters can locate their voting booths via the brochure previously mailed out by the election watchdog, or by typing in the name of their district in key portal websites.Once at the polls, they are to show personal identification, sign the electoral register and receive two pages of ballot papers, one listing the district’s candidates and another showing the political parties running in this year’s election. The latter will decide the parties’ approval rating and consequently allocate the number of proportional representatives.Officials check the ballot count equipment set up at a high school in Yeongdeungpo, Seoul, Tuesday. According to NEC data, this year’s electorate consists of some 42 million nationals, up 4.7 percent from the last parliamentary election in 2012.The 5.1 million who cast their ballot in advance during the early voting from Friday to Saturday last week are excluded from Wednesday’s main vote.While the outcome remains hazy due to close races in many constituencies, ranking political parties devoted their last reserves of strength to canvassing metropolitan areas.Leading political parties spent the last legitimate day of electioneering on rallying votes in the Seoul-Gyeonggi zone, which contains nearly half of the nation’s constituencies and the largest ratio of undecided swing voters.“Our party will face a momentous crisis, unless those who care for us step out and vote, helping us achieve the parliamentary majority,” said ruling conservative Saenuri Party’s chief Rep. Kim Moo-sung, stumping for party candidates in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province. “The Saenuri’s victory is the only way to revitalize the economy and to offer jobs to the youths.”Kim also mentioned the increasing military threat from neighboring North Korea, in a bid to remind voters that economy and national security have always been within the conservative camp’s forte.Expressing concerns on the relatively low early turnout in the party’s stronghold regions and on the decrease of political zeal from elderly age groups, the senior politician continued to call for union and action from conventional advocators.Regardless, the ruling party is inwardly anticipating achieving its target number of parliamentary seats, or more, thanks to the split of opposition votes.The Saenuri Party, which was once forecast to take as many as 180 out of the 300 seats, has lowered its ambitions to 150.The party’s chief election strategist Rep. Kweon Seong-dong, however, claimed that the detailed estimation as of Tuesday was about 145 seats.The main opposition, The Minjoo Party of Korea, is hoping to make it over the 100-seat mark, possibly up to 107, which is the figure that party chief Kim Chong-in pledged to achieve.The lower limit for the party is 90 seats, in which case it will have yielded most of its longtime stronghold electorates in Gwangju and Jeolla provinces to the fledgling minority People’s Party.Party spokesperson Kim Sung-soo said in a radio interview Tuesday that the party is not likely to make it over 100 seats, even assuming victory in tightly contested areas and including proportional representatives.With such sense of crisis, the party’s incumbent and former chiefs Kim Chong-in and Moon Jae-in urged voters to gather forces for the main opposition party so as to curb the political monopoly of the ruling party.“If  uphold an unqualified opposition party, it will only act in the benefit of the Saenuri Party,” said Kim, referring to the People’s Party, which has been undermining his party’s votes.Rep. Moon, during his eleventh-hour visit to Gwangju, demanded that voters cast their ballots for Minjoo Party candidates in their districts and divert their party approval ballots to other minority parties.His approach was taken as a second-best plan, in awareness that the “Honam” region, which has been growing apart from the main opposition party, would not readily give out both of their votes.The People’s Party, on the other hand, is confident of winning in the southwestern Gwangju-Jeolla belt and has eyes on buoying its parliamentary seat number to 35-40. Its current figure is 20, the minimum number required for a party to constitute a parliamentary bargaining unit.Meanwhile, the party’s election teams remained tense on the weather circumstances, as the Meteorological Administration forecast rain on polling day.According to private weather forecaster K-Weather, the turnout in past parliamentary elections fell under the influence of the weather. In the 1996, 2000 and 2004 elections, when the weather was sunny, the nation’s average turnout stood at around 60 percent. Over the past two recent elections, however, the figures fell to as low as the 40 percent range.The impact is expected to be the most conspicuous for senior citizens aged 60 or more, who account for 23 percent of the nation’s entire electorate.The age group, however, has been less enthusiastic over voting. A public survey conducted by the NEC showed that 75.7 percent of the 60 or older group were actively willing to vote, which was down 4.9 percent from the last election.By Bae Hyun-jung","election wednesday parliamentary race ,presidential election wednesday parliamentary ,presidential election wednesday ,year presidential election wednesday ,wednesday parliamentary race",['National Assembly'],4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46648663  0.17408535

282,282,Forecast bleak for split opposition,"With the opposition bloc failing to form a common front against the Saenuri Party, the three-way race among the ruling and two prominent opposition parties has observers baffled on the outcome of the upcoming general election Wednesday.The Saenuri and the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea are predicting that their rival will do better than anticipated.The Minjoo Party of Korea supporters campaign in Seoul on Tues...","With the opposition bloc failing to form a common front against the Saenuri Party, the three-way race among the ruling and two prominent opposition parties has observers baffled on the outcome of the upcoming general election Wednesday.The Saenuri and the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea are predicting that their rival will do better than anticipated.The Minjoo Party of Korea supporters campaign in Seoul on Tuesday. The Minjoo Party for its part, has predicted less than 100 seats for itself, considerably less than Saenuri’s prediction of 120 for the main opposition. The Saenuri Party on the other hand is predicting that it will get 145 seats while Minjoo has put its prediction for the ruling party as high as 180. While the modest numbers have been widely perceived as a ruse to rally support, some experts say that their predictions may be accurate.“I don’t think they  are pretending to be weak. The Saenuri’s prediction of 145 is realistic, and it is hard for the Minjoo Party to gain 100 parliamentary seats,” said Shin Yul, a professor of political science at Myongji University.  The recent polls by Gallup Korea revealed earlier in the month showed 37 percent support for Saenuri, 21 percent for the Minjoo and 12 percent for the People’s Party.“Polls represent a trend. Support for Saenuri is clearly dropping, support for the Minjoo is stagnant and the People’s Party is trending up,” he said. Despite the faltering support for Saenuri, the divided opposition bloc makes prospects grim also for the Minjoo, as votes for opposition candidates can be split. Even the Saenuri Party’s election strategy director Kweon Seong-dong, who has been projecting modest numbers for his party, admitted that the three-way race was beneficial to Saenuri.Traditionally, prominent opposition candidates for a major election would “unify” under the common cause of beating the ruling party candidate. This would result in all but one of the candidates dropping out of the race. This was apparent in the 2012 presidential election, when then-independent candidate Ahn Cheol-soo forfeited his candidacy in support of Moon Jae-in, his rival in the opposition bloc. Moon narrowly lost the election to President Park Geun-hye.Four years on, the former allies have turned on each other as they battle for the votes.The two parties have been fighting particularly for support in the North and South Jeolla provinces, traditionally a political stronghold for the opposition. With several prominent Jeolla-based opposition politicians including Chung Dong-young and Park Jie-won defecting to the People’s Party from the Minjoo Party, the minor opposition party has rapidly been gaining momentum and prominence. “I cannot but hold former Minjoo leader Moon Jae-in responsible for the division of the Jeolla provinces and the opposition,” Park said on his Facebook page.In the waning moments of the election campaign, Moon visited the Jeolla areas to win back Minjoo’s campaign. People’s Party’s coleader Ahn, on the other hand, concentrated his efforts in Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi Province.Moon and Minjoo have been recommending “tactical voting,” in which voters support a candidate more likely to win instead of for their most-preferred candidate. Some supporters of minor opposition parties have opted for this method, voting for a candidate from the main opposition in a bid to prevent Saenuri dominance. Korean voters pick both a candidate and a political party they support in the general election, and the parliament’s proportional representative seats are given to parties based on the percentage of the votes each of them receive.  Regardless of the results, experts warned that losing support of the Jeolla region could be fatal for the Minjoo Party. “In Korean politics, a political party without a stronghold  cannot survive,” said professor Shin. He took the example of former President Roh Moo-hyun’s now-defunct Uri Party, which won a majority in the 2004 general election but ultimately lost prominence due to a failure to win support from the Jeolla region. The traditionally conservative North and South Gyeongsang provinces have given over 80 percent of their votes to Saenuri candidates, while progressive Jeolla regions have given equally overwhelming support to the opposition.“It will be a confusing time for the opposition bloc , as the parties could go through a major overhaul,” Shin said.

This was followed by those in their 40s and 20s at 70.3 and 65.1 percent, respectively. The figure was 59 and 54.7 percent respectively for those in their 50s and people aged 60 or above. YonhapThe overall ratio of people who said they were determined to vote rose by 5.9 percentage points from 63.9 percent a week before, Realmeter said.By political disposition of the respondents, 73.2 percent of those that identified themselves as progressives said they would definitely vote. The respective ratios were 67.6 percent among moderates and 61.7 percent among conservatives.The pollster, however, indicated that the higher ratio among liberals does not necessarily lead to better chances for progressive candidates.“While comparatively lower, those in the  age groups with conservative tendencies have also shown an increase in the level of determination to vote. … This generation is also perceived as a group with high voter turnout regardless of their initial indication to vote or not,” Realmeter said in the report.With two days remaining to polling day, both the ruling and main opposition parties have continued to project modest numbers for their potential parliamentary seats in an attempt to rally support.The recent strategies of both the ruling Saenuri and the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea have been to try to win sympathy from their supporters, many of whom have expressed disappointment at the parties’ nomination fiascos. Both Minjoo and Saenuri have been insisting that their rivals will do better than anticipated.Rep. Kweon Seog-dong, Saenuri’s election strategy director, said in a radio interview that the party is expected to win 142 to 145 parliamentary seats in the election. He added that Minjoo will win at least 120 seats.It marked a stark contrast to what Jeong Jang-sun, chief strategist for the Minjoo Party in the election, had said the day before.

Many of the policies also resemble one another, making them less of a factor for voters in casting their support.The ruling Saenuri Party, for one, pledges to take a “tailored” approach toward their welfare policies by offering targeted recipients with the required assistance. The conservative party had promised to adopt universal welfare policies during previous elections, such as free education and child care for all. Citizens watch a general election campaign in Wonju, Gangwon Province. Yonhap“In order to maximize efficient use of limited resources, we need to shift from universal welfare programs toward tailored policies,” said Kang Bong-kyun who manages the Saenuri Party’s election campaign. “Based on the tailored approach, we have determined our election pledges,” he said. Except for a commitment to “gradually” provide free education to all high school students, the Saenuri Party decided to remove universal welfare programs from their manifestos. Instead, they introduced programs targeting specific recipients. Among them is the pledge to increase the basic pension for senior citizens “without measures to live their retirement.” The party said that it would determine who needs assistance the most and raise the pension to 400,000 won per month. The main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea introduced a broader but similar approach toward senior citizens. The liberal party vowed to raise the basic pension to 300,000 won by 2018 for all senior citizens outside the top 30 percent by income. Even though both parties scaled back, they have still failed to come up with specific ways to fund these welfare programs. According to the parties’ manifestoes, the Saenuri Party’s initiative would cost about 56 trillion won and the Minjoo Party’s would cost some 148 trillion won. The Saenuri Party seeks to collect more taxes by “revitalizing” the economy, while the Minjoo Party vows to increase corporate taxes and divert money from National Pension Fund to help fund the programs. “It would cost more than 200 trillion won for the parties to implement those programs. But their plans do not sound like viable plans to secure money,” said Lee Kwang-jae, the secretary-general of the Korea Manifesto Center, a civic group to monitor the parties’ election pledges. Other aspects of the parties’ welfare promises, in the meantime, are almost identical, the observers noted, right down to how they are abstract without details.All three parties -- Saenuri, Minjoo and the People’s Party -- vow to provide services to support women who have had their career suspended due to childbirth and child care. The Gender Ministry already runs 136 such agencies nationwide.Both the Saenuri Party and the Minjoo Party promise to improve the learning environment of “classrooms suffering from sweltering heat or freezing temperatures.”All three parties pledge to build more infrastructure to help mobility of the disabled, without any details.The two leading parties also touch on helping women and children victims of abuse, a topic of attention this year following several high-profile cases, also, without clear details.For the elderly, the pledges continue to be “populist,” according to critics.The Saenuri Party vows to create more than 500,000 jobs by creating a special economic zone for local companies returning home after operating overseas. The Minjoo Party pledges to create more than 700,000 jobs for young people by expanding mandatory youth employment measures to not just state-run institutions but also private companies. The liberal party argues that the plan could create more than 250,000 jobs. But critics have said that the Minjoo Party’s plan is a measure that could distort the labor market and accused the Saenuri Party’s program of duplicating former election pledges made during President Park Geun-hye’s presidential campaign. “The parties’ pledges to create more jobs need to be thoroughly monitored and assessed,” said Baak Kyung-hoon, a vice president for the Youth Forum. “We should be worried about rosy promises with fancy numbers,” he said.

Kim Moo-sung, the outspoken leader of the ruling conservative Saenuri Party, made direct shots at individual opposition candidates. The Minjoo Party of Korea’s Kim Chong-in, in contrast, kept his aim at the ruling party in general and the incumbent Park Geun-hye administration.Saenuri Party chief Rep. Kim Moo-sung  has lunch while campaigning in Junggu, Busan, Monday. The Minjoo Party of Korea chief Kim Chong-in urges voters to cast their ballot wearing a picket on a street in Seonneung, southern Seoul, on Monday. The Saenuri’s Kim started off his day in Ulsan, an industrial city in the conservative southeastern corner of Korea.“Someone who used to belong to the unconstitutional Unified Progressive Party should not be elected as representative,” Kim said in Ulsan’s Dong-gu constituency, while stumping for party candidate Ahn Hyo-dae.He thus fired directly at independent candidate Kim Jong-hoon, who rivals Ahn in the area.The far-left minority UPP was disbanded back in 2014 after being defined by the Constitutional Court as an unconstitutional political unity based on National Security Law.On the previous day, the Saenuri chief had hurled a similar ideological attack upon former Minjoo Party leader Rep. Moon Jae-in.“The Minjoo Party contributed to the infiltration of pro-North figures into the National Assembly by uniting with the UPP back in the 2012 general elections,” Kim said Sunday during his Seoul campaigning tour.“Moon, who has never apologized for the consequences, is once again plotting to ally with pro-communist cliques.”When cheering for Rep. Kim Eul-dong in Seoul’s southeastern Songpa-C on the same day, Kim depicted Minjoo candidate Rep. Nam In-soon as a radical who advocates homosexuality.“Homosexuality is an outrage against humanity, yet candidate Nam is seeking to pass a bill to allow such disorderly actions within the Army,” Kim claimed. The opposition lawmaker had motioned a revised military criminal law in 2013, expanding the scope of what is considered rape in the army from “women” to “people,” stating that men could also be victims of sex crimes.According to the revised article, consensual homosexual relationships may no longer be punished by the military court.The main opposition party, whose motto is to judge the economic misadministration of the current government, chose to reiterate what they branded as “the greater cause.”“A powerful opposition party is absolutely necessary in order to stop the monopolizing ruling party from disregarding and mocking the people,” said Minjoo chief Kim in a speech to the nation on Monday.“This year’s parliamentary election is all about judging the errors of the Saenuri Party and of the Park Geun-hye government.”Kim also stayed largely aloof amid attacks on his affluent assets, following news reports over the weekend in which the ruling party cited his wealth as a contradiction for opposition leader who speaks of economic democratization and distribution of wealth.“The ruling party should be ashamed of its false, fault-finding propaganda,” said the party’s spokesperson Kim Sung-soo.Both Kims headed to Jejudo Island later in the afternoon to canvass the self-governing province which has three legislative seats.Jejudo is the place of the 1948 April 3 movement, in which numerous civilians were killed while fighting against the military rule. Considered a longtime opposition stronghold, the island has voted in Minjoo lawmakers with landslide majorities for the past 12 years.But this year, the ruling party is eyeing a possible victory, as two of the three constituencies are caught in neck-and-neck races within the margin of error, reflecting a split in opposition votes due to the newborn centrist minority People’s Party.People’s Party cochairman Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo greets citizens at Bupeyong Station in Incheon on Monday. Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, on the other hand, continued to criticize the nation’s bipartisan frame, underlining the necessity of a counterbalancing third party.“It’s the politics, stupid,” Ahn said Monday, quoting former U.S. President Bill Clinton’s famous remarks on the economy back in the 1992 election.“There will be no real solution to anything as long as the No. 1 and No. 2 parties keep on brawling.”While parties geared up with their last-minute sprint, the presidential house once again came under fire for making regional trips amid election campaigns.Last Friday, which was also the first day of early voting. President Park visited the creative economy innovation centers in North Jeolla and North Chungcheong provinces.Cheong Wa Dae claimed that the trip was a “economic action short of political intentions” to review the achievements of state-backed organizations, but opposition parties blasted upon the president’s “timely” schedule as an obvious to exert her influence.By Bae Hyun-jung","campaign tours on monday ,election speech strategies rep ,their election speech strategies ,election speech strategies ,in their election speech","['Kim Moo - sung', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Kim Chong - in']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.72732329  0.1043736

According to analysis by local daily Joongang Ilbo, it would take the future 20th National Assembly more than 1 quadrillion won  to carry out their pledges, far exceeding this year’s national budget set for 380 trillion won -- which is already a 10 trillion won increase from the year before.  National Assembly The Joongang Ilbo, together with Korea Manifesto Center, gathered the data by requesting from the 935 candidates running for a seat in the National Assembly their five core policies and the budget required for them. The request had a less-than-half answer rate of 44.8 percent.Article 66 of the current election law stipulates that, unlike presidential elections, candidates in a general election are not obligated to produce printed policy booklets or state their intended mode of securing funds.Although only 419 out of 935 candidates gave answers, their combined estimated budget already went over the predetermined national budget of 380 trillion won. The 419 candidates said they would need 407 trillion won in total to carry out their regional policies, which mostly concerned construction of social overhead capital projects, like highways, railways and subways, while also including large-sized themed parks and tourism districts.Candidate Kim Yung-rok from The Minjoo Party of Korea aspired to build an underwater high speed rail link connecting South Jeolla Province and Jejudo Island and a railway linking the seaport town Mokpo and the green tea town Boseong. Kim said his policies alone would require funding of 22.6 trillion won. Regarding how he would secure the money to realize his plans, Kim hoped to push his plans as national projects upon winning election.Kim’s rival candidate Yoon Young-il of the People’s Party did not submit his policy budget. Apart from regional policies, if national policies were also included in the picture -- rosy but unrealistic policies such as free nationwide high school education and additional free medical care for children under the age of 15 -- the total budget would stretch to 1.017 quadrillion won. The reason for the fuss about the money issues is that all this staggering increase in budget would translate to increases in taxation.Lee Gwang-jae, secretary general of the Korea Manifesto Center, argued for a revision to the current election law. “The Public Official Election Act should be revised to obligate the aspiring members of the National Assembly to clearly set out their planned time of policy implementation and their ways of securing funding,” Lee said.Yoon Jong-bin, professor of politics and foreign affairs at Myungji University, also called for establishing a monitoring body under the central election committee to discern the veracity of the policies proposed by candidates.

The corresponding turnout in the 2014 local elections was 11.5 percent.South Jeolla Province, in the southwest of the country that is leaned toward the opposition, had the highest turnout, while the conservative stronghold city of Busan had the lowest. Seoul’s turnout was close to the national average.Once voting hours ended, the boxes were sealed with a special sealing paper in the presence of election officials and observers, and then transported from individual polling stations to regional NEC offices.For equity’s sake, the NEC will be storing the early ballot boxes within restricted areas of its local offices until the closing of polls on the main voting day, officials said.Also, security cameras were installed at the 253 storage spots nationwide to record the entire process until the ballot boxes are opened Wednesday night.Should any of the candidates or parties raise objections on the delivery, storage or opening of the ballots, the NEC will release the relevant recorded video files, according to officials.Despite such precautions, however, controversy was stirred as some ballot boxes were found to be unsealed. An election supervision official at an early voting station in Incheon erroneously opened the seal of a ballot box late on Friday, the NEC Incheon office said Saturday.“The official mistook the box as containing extra-jurisdictional ballots and tore the seal off,” a representative from the NEC commented.“The unsealing took place under the supervision of the election supervisors and none of the district’s candidates raised an objection.”In Daegu, candidate Kim Boo-kyum of The Minjoo Party of Korea blasted his rival from the ruling Saenuri Party, Kim Moon-soo, for offering transportation to local voters during the early voting period and thus inducing them to vote in his favor.The Saenuri candidate’s camp, however, denied the allegations and lashed back that the Minjoo Party’s Kim violated election regulations by placing his campaigners at the doors of polling stations.The NEC had earlier announced that it would clamp down on acts of expressing support or opposition against a specific candidate within 100 meters of polling spots, as well as on the provision of transportations to voters.By Bae Hyun-jung","wednesday parliamentary election closed ,announcing rather successful kickoff ,for wednesday parliamentary election ,saturday with voter turnout ,wednesday parliamentary election",[],4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54641193  0.16319686

Voters go to the polls on Wednesday to pick the lawmakers who will serve a four year term.The latest findings showed the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea will likely secure 83-100 seats, with the splinter People's Party winning 28-32 seats on the strong backing of the voters in the Jeolla region in the southeastern part of the country. If the People's Party wins more than 20 seats, it can form a negotiating bloc in parliament.The forecast showed almost no change from poll results released by Yonhap on March 13 when Saenuri was expected to win 155-175 seats, but numbers for Minjoo fell while People's Party's prospects improved.Last month's polls showed the main opposition party likely to secure 95-110 seats, with the People's Party getting 10-20 seats.Pollster said that while the ruling party will probably win a majority, there is a chance that more than 10 independents will be elected.""With many having left Saenuri after failing to win party tickets, their return will likely generate attention after the elections,"" one polling official said. Saenuri, in particular, is keeping close tabs on the election outcome in Daegu, some 300 kilometers southeast of Seoul, that had been its power base for generations. At present, former Saenuri whip Yoo Seung-min is expected to win at the polls despite running as an independent.The source then said if the Minjoo party fails to secure less than 100 seats, it will have to concede failure, with the political landscape becoming a three-way situation.Others said that while the People's Party popularity has been on the rise, it may not be able to win too many seats outside of the Jeolla region.""With the exception of party chairman Ahn Cheol-soo's constituency in Nowon, Seoul, the People's Party may not be able to pick up seats outside of Jeolla,"" a political watcher estimated.Of the 122 seat up for grabs in Seoul and the surrounding regions of Gyeonggi Province and Incheon, Saenuri is expected to win 57-67, with 52-61 expected for the Minjoo Party.Experts, however, said that in the Seoul and surrounding regions, the high percentage of undecided voters can change the outcome of the elections by as much as 15 seats, with the turnout of people in their 20-30s and those over 60 to decide which party wins and which losses.Younger people generally tend to favor liberal parties like the Minjoo Party, while the older generation has been staunch loyalists of the conservative Saenuri Party.","april 13 ballot polls ,the upcoming general elections ,win majority in april ,local pollsters last week ,upcoming general elections","['Saenuri Party', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'Saenuri', 'National Assembly']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56542128  0.25311533

291,291, Military culture infuses throughout every part of society,"On an ordinary weekday morning, throngs of executives line up by rank at the lobby of a sprawling glass building in Seoul that houses the headquarters of one of the country’s biggest family-run conglomerates. They are awaiting the chairman, who is about to make his entrance in about half an hour.

They are awaiting the chairman, who is about to make his entrance in about half an hour. As he emerges through the door, a vacuum-like, fleeting stillness sweeps through the pack, followed by waves of deep bows from the waist. In the evening, on the other side of town, a group of college students gathers at a nearby pork belly restaurant. They hold a welcoming ceremony for the new members of an a capella club, with two long rows of glasses filled with a blend of beer and soju, or “somaek.” A senior member shouts as he raises his glass, “All of those younger than me have got to drain their glasses in one gulp.”The scenes epitomize shades of deep-rooted military culture that diffuses into nearly every part of South Korean society. From the public and corporate sectors to academia, fields of arts and sports, juniors are better off when they toe the line without talking back to their bosses. Boot camp has long been a must for staff of all grades and newbies of any organization. “Lacking military discipline” is a universal expression used to scold subordinates. “At our company, there were catchphrases to chant at the beginning and the end of executive meetings,” said Hong Ji-hyun, a 31-year-old who previously worked at another major corporation in Seoul. “The catchphrases would change once in a while, one of them I remember was ‘Let’s be No. 1!’ And they said it was the chairman’s instruction.” As the country increasingly embraces diversity, many aspects of the rigid, hierarchical culture have faded in line with the democratic progress following the demise of iron-fisted rule in 1980s. But a military-style leadership still prevails in male-dominant areas. Remnants of military culture may live on in a traditionally Confucian society, some people say, even long after the two Koreas are reunited. South Korean armed forces partake in winter training. In a 2013 poll commissioned by Hankook Ilbo daily to SurveyMonkey, 610 out of 625 respondents, or 97.6 percent, said they have felt that military culture persists within organizations outside the barracks, including workplaces, schools and sports clubs. Though largely deemed inevitable given the ongoing standoff with the North, the influence of Korea’s conscription system has become deeply embedded in all corners of society, often becoming a perennial source of gender discrimination.The compulsory draft allows young men to not only prepare for a potential emergency on the peninsula but also to learn organized social life through strict military discipline. In return, those who complete their service generally get extra credits when applying for a job, receive higher pay than their female colleagues, and climb up the ladder faster under the same conditions as women. Such values as leadership, loyalty and perseverance are also required for women in order to stand out in the male-dominated society. Many successful female leaders have pushed their way through the top by putting work over everything else, staying later than their male competitors and exercising even more stringent discipline. “I think the country’s overall workplace atmosphere is built on apprenticeship where juniors have to painstakingly follow the directives of their mentors just like you do in the Army,” Kim Chang-hwan, a 32-year-old former editor at a Seoul-based publishing house where the absolute majority of the staff were women and he was the only one who served in the military. Across the sectors, the top brass still chiefly consist of people who either have firsthand experience in military dictatorship or the offspring of the elite from the era when men were even banned from growing their hair and women from wearing short skirts as part of the efforts to establish uniformity and discipline. “There is certainly a bright side to the system -- you can quickly get professional know-how and tips and innately foster teamwork. But on the other hand, it could limit the scope of your thinking and your problem-solving ability. Or even if you manage to find your own methods, someone would say that’s wrong because it’s different from how they’ve done things.”With the maturing of fast-paced society and women’s growing entry into leadership roles, there is a growing call among both old and young generations that the current shift away from military-style culture would only continue to take hold. “In the past, the population was much less educated than now and the military provided one of the few pools of well-disciplined and trained human resources, while businesses, schools and other institutions courted retired officers to teach entry-level workers and refurbish management structure,” a government official in his 50s said. “Things have significantly changed compared with when I started some 30 years ago, though there are still vestiges such as in document writing, reporting and even drinking culture. The trend will evolve, albeit gradually, toward pragmatism with generational changes at higher echelons.” By Shin Hyon-hee","morning throngs of executives ,glass building in seoul ,weekday morning throngs of ,biggest family run conglomerates ,ordinary weekday morning throngs",['Seoul'],4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62902087  0.7344923

YonhapThe early voting, which will be run from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Friday-Saturday, enables voters to cast their vote at a designated polling station, according to the National Election Commission.The voter is only required to suggest a personal identification. No advance registration or document is necessary.The election watchdog also installed three polling booths at Seoul Station, Yongsan Station and Incheon International Airport, offering voting convenience for travelers, officials said.Early votes, despite the limited number of participants, are seen to mirror the final election results.Back in the 2014 local election, when the early voting system was implemented for the first time, the early turnout acted as a litmus test of the results. While the early votes are opened and counted concurrently on the actual voting day, the turnout rate is deemed to serve as a stimulus in encouraging undecided voters to turn up. In 24 out of the 25 districts in Seoul, the candidate who took the lead in early voting also ended up victorious.This year’s early voting rate stood at 3.92 percent as of 3 p.m. Friday, involving some 1.6 million of the nation’s voting pool. On Friday, the first day of the preliminary voting for the April 13 general election, soldiers, police and young voters cast their ballot at polling stations nationwide. YonhapPressed by the lack of time remaining up to the final race, key party leaders focused their energy on canvassing the metropolitan region, consisting of 122 out of 253 constituencies and embracing the largest number of fluctuating voters.Rep. Kim Moo-sung of the ruling conservative Saenuri Party toured Seoul’s outskirt areas, from Anyang, Bucheon, Gimpo, Goyang and Paju, making a second trip to Gyeonggi Province since the official campaigning period began.He continued his low-profile stance, offering apologies for the party’s infighting over candidate nomination and asking for “one more chance.”His opposition counterpart, Kim Chong-in of The Minjoo Party of Korea, started off his day by stumping in Seoul’s northwestern Eunpyeong-B district and moved to Incheon’s Yeonsu-B for early voting.He then swept the rest of Incheon, as well as the northern Gyeonggi areas such as Gimpo, Goyang, and Paju, before returning back to Seoul for late afternoon electioneering.Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo of the No. 3 People’s Party took part in a vote-encouraging campaign held at Seoul Station early morning.Former Minjoo chief Rep. Moon Jae-in, on the other hand, made his appearance in the nation’s southwestern city of Gwangju and the surrounding Jeolla Provinces for a two-day visit.The potential presidential candidate’s move was a head-on challenge to reconcile with the longtime opposition stronghold, where the public sentiment has reportedly turned against the main opposition party for allegedly neglecting the region.By Bae Hyun-jung","korea for general election ,official polling day hoping ,election 2016 first ballots ,korea on friday kicked ,election five days ahead","['South Korea', 'Seoul']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35585365  0.7365973

Around the complex crowded with high-rise buildings and fancy restaurants, signs of a heated race for the 20th National Assembly are nowhere to be seen. No election banners or campaign vehicles were spotted over the span of several hours. Instead, there was a placard urging the government to accelerate a residential redevelopment program, a lucrative housing project for the wealthy residents. Gangnam, indeed, is considered the heart of the nation’s most affluent residence. Aside from the sky-high real estate prices, the monthly income of its three districts -- Gangnam-gu, Seocho-gu and Songpa-gu -- is more than any other districts in Seoul, according to Seoul city government’s statistics.  Such economic status has long turned Gangnam into the conservative’s stronghold. In the 2012 general election, the Saenuri Party won all seven seats allocated to the region. In the election to choose Seoul’s mayor in 2010, the three districts were the only ones that chose conservative candidates over liberal contenders.“The Gangnam voters cast their ballot in their economic interest,” said Kim Min-jeon, a political science professor at Kyung Hee University. “Though some middle-income voters might vote for liberal candidates, top-class high-income voters definitely favor conservative candidates,” she said. Rep. Kim Jong-hoon of the Saenuri Party. YonhapSuch a trend was reflected in the attitude among the candidates and their supporters toward their election campaign.Rep. Kim Jong-hoon, the Saenuri lawmaker seeking reelection in Gangnam-gu B district, said that his aides and supporters often told him to “take a break” from the election campaign. The supporters for main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea’s candidates, such as Jun Hyeon-hee, the former lawmaker competing with Kim in the same constituency, suffered from weak popularity among the conservative voters.“When we said we were from opposition candidate, the people would just walk away,” an official from Jun’s election campaign told the Korea Herald. When her supporter went onto a stage to tout her credentials and pledges, there was not a single pedestrian that stopped walking or listened to the speech. The unwelcoming mood toward the liberals was not always the case. When former President Lee Myung-bak was in power from 2007 to 2012 with low popularity ratings, political pundits and media outlets coined the term “Gangnam leftists” and predicted that the liberal-minded high-earners would transform the region’s political landscape.  Though the idea was often dismissed by critics and failed to bring election victory to the liberal parties, there were some cracks among voters in the conservative districts. For instance, residents in Songpa district voted for the former civil activist Park Won-soon in the 2011 election for Seoul mayor“For Gangnam voters, politics is a complicated procedure filled with rancorous debates,” said Lee Taek-gwang, a professor of cultural studies. “The challenge for the liberals is whether they can change disinterest toward politics and the system dominated by establishment conservative party,” said Lee. Entrepreneur Shin Yeong-soo, 53, who has been a long-time supporter for the Saenuri Party, said he thinks that the party has been too “complacent” toward developing policies tailored for the region. “When I look at the candidates’ posters describing their political careers, I couldn’t help but notice that they are not the best pool of politicians,” said Shin. In the latest 2012 election, out of seven candidates elected in the region, five were rookies.By Yeo Jun-suk","gangnam unmoved by election ,election 2016 conservative gangnam ,2016 conservative gangnam unmoved ,2016 conservative gangnam ,candidates blasting their campaign","['Lee Jae - jung', 'Dogok - dong', 'Gangnam', 'Seoul', 'Lee']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.58903509  0.20580752

Kim Seok-ki, Kim Moo-sung, Na Kyung-won, Kim Jin-tae, Kim Eul-dong, Yoon Sang-hyun, Kim Yong-nam, Choi Kyung-hwan, Hwang Woo-yea, and Oh Se-hoon.  The Citizen Network for General Elections 2016 announced on Wednesday a list of the 10 worst candidates, mostly consisting of ranking figures of the ruling conservative Saenuri Party. The survey was conducted earlier this week on the organization’s official website.The top dishonor was given to Kim Seok-ki, a former commissioner general of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency who had resigned from his post in 2009, after directing a violent suppression that led to 29 casualties, including the deaths of six.Kim, who later took on the post of president of the state-run Korea Airports Corporation, is running in Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province, where the Saenuri Party is enjoying steady support.The list included ranking Saenuri Party figures such as party chief Kim Moo-sung, former Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon, former Deputy Prime Minister Hwang Woo-yea and former Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan. Na Kyung-won and Yoon Sang-hyun were also listed, with the former being included due to recent allegations of influence-peddling over her daughter’s college admission and the latter for making abusive remarks against party chief Kim over candidate nominations.The civic group started its anti-campaign on Wednesday against Oh, a candidate in Jongno.“Oh’s administration was a typical case of budget wasting and antienvironmental show-off business,” the group said at a press conference in front of Oh’s election camp headquarters.“Not only did he stand against policies that are crucial to the economically needy, but he also abused the free school meal issue for his own political needs.”The former mayor stepped down in 2011, after a referendum on free school meals had floundered. The National Election Commission is currently studying whether the list and the anti-campaign constitute a breach of the public official election act clause, which forbids the announcement of unauthorized public polls ahead of the election.By Bae Hyun-jung","groups pick worst election ,pick worst election candidates ,worst election candidates group ,political pot on thursday ,election the 10 worst",[],4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66443509  0.30771202

The ruling conservative Saenuri Party -- with former Finance Minister Kang Bong-kyun as chief policy strategist -- chose to focus on job creation, connecting its campaigns to President Park Geun-hye’s plan to revitalize the economy and unshackle the labor market.The party’s key economic platforms are as follows: create jobs for youths by boosting corporate investment; implement a quantitative easing macroeconomic system; improve income distribution through tax revision; expand welfare support to socially disadvantaged clusters; improve the business environment for owner-operators; solve real estate problems; and accomplish the Park administration’s reform plans.Though its list included some progressive issues, the gist of it was to stimulate economic growth. The concept of economic democratization, which the party had adopted as a key slogan back in the 2012 election, was nowhere to be seen.A report released by the Economic Reform Research Institute on Thursday described the ruling party as “resuming its former persona as a typical conservative party.”“The Saenuri Party’s pledges show that it has completely discarded economic democratization,” the report stated.One of the representative pledges of the party is to create some 500,000 new jobs by establishing a special economic zone for companies that relocate their overseas sites back to South Korea.The plan, however, failed to suggest a valid financing mechanism, as well as possible incentives that may lure firms back home.Another controversy is the quantitative easing program to increase liquidity in the market and reduce household debt.The party said Thursday that it would, in follow-up measures, revise the Bank of Korea Act so as to allow the nation’s central bank to purchase bonds of state-run banks.But the BOK and the Ministry of Strategy and Finance indicated their resistance, as well as doubts, over the financial program.Both Finance Minister Yoo Il-ho and BOK Gov. Lee Ju-yeol have been outspoken on the issue, failing to buttress the ruling party ahead of the upcoming election.The Minjoo Party of Korea’s chief Kim Chong-in  talks with Joo Jin-hyeong, former CEO of Hanwha Investment and Securities, who currently is the deputy head of the party’s economic team, before attending a press conference on Wednesday. The Minjoo Party of Korea, steered by senior economist Kim Chong-in, chose to shore up the idea of economic democratization.The forte of the main opposition party is its consistency -- having maintained its relatively progressive policy stance -- but its weakness is that most of the plans are a deja vu of the 2012 election campaigns.The party’s key economic slogan is the “777 plan,” aimed at pulling up per capita gross national income, labor income share, and the proportion of middle class to the 70 percent mark.“The 777 plan is more or less a copy of the Lee Myung-bak administration’s 747 plan or the Park Geun-hye government’s 474 plan,” said the Saenuri policy chief Kang, challenging Minjoo’s Kim to an economic policy debate.The party’s goal to enforce a ban on the top 10 conglomerates’ cross-shareholding was also a revival of a similar pledge from 2012.The opposition party also vowed to create 700,000 new jobs by expanding the youth employment quota in public organizations and to increase the legal minimum wage to 10,000 won  per hour.But it faced criticism that it was shifting economic responsibility to the public sector and that the figures announced were financially unsound.“Not only do these economic pledges lack practicality, but they also tend to mislead voters, making them believe that a political party has the full discretion to implement its promises,” said an official of the Korea Manifesto Center.By Bae Hyun-jung","new economic pledges daily ,drafted pledges mostly fail ,hastily drafted pledges mostly ,economic pledges daily hoping ,the hastily drafted pledges",[],4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45864728  0.08169548

The early voting will run from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. until Saturday. Three preliminary voting polls are also installed at Seoul Station, Yongsan Station and Incheon International Airport as part of efforts to encourage voter participation, the authorities said.  Ballot boxes will only be opened after the election ends. Polling booths are set up at Incheon International Airport ahead of the preliminary voting for the 20th National Assembly on Thursday. This is the first time the early voting system has been used for a general election. The system, introduced in 2013 to provide better convenience for voters and to raise the turnout, has previously been run for by-elections and local elections.Observers have noted that early voting may be a game changer in neck-and-neck districts, citing the consistently rising preliminary voting rate with more young voters taking part.Voter turnout, which recorded 4.9 percent in the first early polling, jumped to 11.5 percent in local elections in 2014. In the latest round of early voting in 2014, those in their 20s took part the most, at nearly 16 percent, followed by those in their 60s at 12.2 percent and 50s with 11.5 percent. Meanwhile, the absentee voting rate reached 41.4 percent with about 64,000 Korean voters. This is 4.3 percentage points down compared to the previous general election in 2012, officials said. Absentee voting was held in 113 countries from March 30 to April 4. The overall voting rate of the general elections, which reached the highest in 1996 with 63.9 percent, dropped to 46.1 percent in 2008. But it rebounded to 54.2 percent in 2012.

The stark differences in their stances toward hotly debated topics like dialogue with Pyongyang, human rights in the oppressive state and how to achieve a future reunification used to define each party’s identification. This time, however, both the ruling Saenuri Party and main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea introduced packages that appeared rather colorless and lacking substance. The minor opposition People’s Party, which initially did not present any security commitments at all, released a five-point set of pledges last week. Meanwhile, there have been many eye-catching -- yet populist -- pledges such as a cut in the length of the mandatory military service and a hike in soldiers’ salaries. In a rare show of unison, the two leading parties set atop their agendas robust defense readiness against North Korea based on the South Korea-U.S. alliance, though detailed action plans vary. To boost the South Korean military’s response capabilities, both sides reaffirmed support for plans to establish the Kill Chain and Korea Air and Missile Defense preemptive strike systems by the early 2020s, and to adopt more monitoring and reconnaissance assets. The People’s Party also displayed support for the KAMD project, but protested against the planned stationing of the U.S.’ Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system here, citing “astronomical” deployment costs relative to its effectiveness and the high possibility of diplomatic discord with China and Russia. The Saenuri Party’s candidate for the Gangnam constituency, former Trade Minister Kim Jong-hoon. On cross-border ties, the Saenuri Party has focused more on shoring up the government’s drive to ramp up pressure on Pyongyang to denuclearize, whereas the Minjoo Party has called for simultaneous efforts to defuse tensions and build confidence, such as through a joint military committee. Saenuri Party also vowed to help improve the communist state’s grim living conditions, such as by formulating a basic framework on North Korean human rights in line with recently enacted legislation. The conservative party also laid out plans to revive exchanges between separated families, expand assistance to defectors and reinforce unification preparations through research, public events and education, among others. The Minjoo Party is seeking to normalize the joint Gaeseong industrial park that was shut down in February following the North’s latest nuclear and missile tests, while pursuing a Korean-style “freikauf” model, the money-for-prisoner scheme used by the former West Germany, to bring more North Koreans into the South. As part of its initiative for a “new economy on the Korean Peninsula,” the liberal party envisaged creating new joint economic zones in border regions and related organizations. It also aims to revitalize stalled inter-Korean business and people-to-people exchange programs including a tour to the Mount Geumgangsan and Mount Baekdusan resorts, Pyongyang and Gaeseong. Lambasting the controversial settlement on the “comfort women” issue with Japan, the Minjoo Party pledged to reopen negotiations so as to “help the victims regain their honor and the people their pride.” The Minjoo Party of Korea’s proportional representative candidate Lee Soo-hyuk, a former deputy foreign minister and chief nuclear negotiator. The People’s Party, for its part, vowed to reopen the Gaeseong industrial complex, saying it does little to thwart Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs, but rather inflicts economic losses on the South Korean businesses and government. It also calls for a restart of the six-party denuclearization talks, the launch of four-way peace dialogue with the North, the U.S. and China, and the establishment of an economic cooperation zone covering parts of the two Koreas, northeastern China and Russia. The parties are most evidently split over the counterterrorism act, which was passed early last month with the ruling party’s nearly unanimous endorsement despite a days-long, record-breaking filibuster by opposition lawmakers. The Minjoo Party promised to push through a revision, saying the law carries “potential sources of human rights violations,” making way for the National Intelligence Service to step up spying activities on civilians and political maneuvering. In the longer term, the party seeks to abolish the scandal-ridden agency and launch an organization gathering intelligence on North Korea and from overseas. The minor opposition People’s Party also sees an amendment as essential, though it acknowledges the fundamental need for such legislation, citing “unacceptable” concerns that it may “seriously damage the people’s basic rights.” On compulsory military service, Saenuri is looking to allow student enlistees to take more online courses at barracks and receive credits for military training by the end of 2017. It also wants to gradually raise the daily compensation for reserve troops to 30,000 won  through 2021 from the current 12,000 won. The Minjoo Party has unveiled a more ambitious proposal, including shortening the service period by three months to 18 months and jacking up the monthly salary of soldiers on average 100,000 won, or up to 300,000 won step by step. But the prospects for most of the promises remain bleak -- similar ideas have been floated ahead of past elections, but few of them materialized due to budget shortfalls or other administrative setbacks. Rather than touching on issues such as troop salaries or service length, the People’s Party simply introduced plans to overhaul the soldier management system and reinforce therapy and consultation programs to contain suicides and accidents within barracks.  “The Saenuri package falls short of addressing the pressing issues, especially with regard to North Korea, among others, as well as providing detailed rationales behind anticipated effects of its proposals and financing ideas,” the Korea Manifesto Center said in its analysis. “Minjoo’s ‘new economy’ initiative was significant in presenting a peaceful resolution to an inter-Korean stalemate, which is the most pressing issue at hand.”But to move forward with their plans, national consensus should build first, the nongovernmental organization noted, pointing to prevailing dampened sentiment at home and abroad toward any major business cooperation with a nuclear-armed, recalcitrant Pyongyang.“A more scrupulous examination is also needed such as on the reasons why the exchange projects were frozen previously. Given the current cross-border situation and international resolutions, controversy could also arise as to the pledge’s timeliness and viability,” the center added. “As for the People’s Party, it claims to stand for radical center in its creed, but its overall package did not place stress on security matters in favor of promoting fair distribution of wealth and new growth engines.”The lack of weightage given to foreign and security policy in election promises is partly reflected in the absence of specialists at each party’s policymaking core, critics say. Apart from some retired military generals mostly at Saenuri including Reps. Hwang Jin-ha and Kim Sung-chan, few experts in North Korea and foreign affairs and former government officials have been giving advice or secured nominations for the upcoming vote. While former Trade Minister Kim Jong-hoon set sights on serving for another four years, first-term Saenuri member Rep. Shim Yoon-joe who was a deputy foreign minister was defeated in a primary. Kim Keun-sik, a North Korea expert at Kyungnam University and People’s Party hopeful, has dropped his bid in support of former Unification Minister Chung Dong-young. The Minjoo Party’s specialist delegation is led by Lee Soo-hyuk, a former deputy foreign minister and chief nuclear negotiator who is forecast to enter the assembly with his 15th position in the party’s proportional representative list.

But this year, the Saenuri Party is also taking the situation seriously, as various reports suggest it is not just the young -- potentially more progressive -- who are reserving their votes.According to Gallup Korea’s survey, 23 percent of those aged 60 or more were counted as swing voters, visibly up from the 13 percent late last year. Other surveys similarly indicated that an increasing number of senior citizens have moved over to the politically centrist zone.The partial breakaway of elderly voters even pushed the conservative party to announce an “emergency” following apprehension that it may not be able to secure the 150 parliamentary majority, much less the original target of 180-200 seats.It is also amid such background that the ruling party has been highlighting a set of pledges to improve the nation’s economy and to pull up the employment rate, seeking the support of pragmatic centrist voters.The Minjoo Party of Korea’s candidate Geum Tae-seop running in Gangseo-1 of Seoul greets passers-by on Wednesday.

Ahn Cheol-soo’s middle-of-the-road party.“I ask voters in the metropolitan areas to carefully judge as to which party is capable of deterring the ruling party’s monopoly and of taking power,” said party chief Kim Chong-in, encouraging citizens to vote for the main opposition party.“In past elections, the antipathy toward a specific political party led to the upper hand for the rival party, as evident from the backfiring of the conservative camp’s presidential impeachment,” said Shin Yul, professor of politics at Myongji University.“But over recent years, having witnessed worsening feuds and divisions, people are turning away from politics itself.”By Bae Hyun-jung","election 2016 parties look ,voters nationwide public survey ,korea said last friday ,game changers although polling ,election 2016 parties",['Gallup Korea'],4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63686794  0.51302046

Mattner said that she was drugged, abducted and raped in late September in Seoul.She said that while the sexual assault haunted her, the botched investigation into her case by police further broke her down.  After the story surfaced and consequent public attention was paid to the incident, the police station in charge of the investigation decided to post an open letter addressed to Mattner on Facebook on April 1, defending their position.Amid allegations that the police had not properly investigated the crime, the Yongsan Police Station revealed details of the probe and refuted the victim’s statements in both Korean and English in the public letter. An open letter posted by police on Facebook “You are claiming that  police questioned contemptuously while questioning. The police recorded all of the process and has kept the record. We confirmed that there was no insulting question,” a part of the post read. The police also said that they had no way to contact the victim apart from through the Australian Embassy because she had left the country and there were language barriers. They notified her of the investigation process, they claimed. The police even added the link to the Facebook page on Mattner’s campaign on the GoFundMe site. She has shared her story about sexual assault and raised funds to pursue justice in England through the campaign.“It made me feel shocked, unsafe and upset. They tried to harass me by engaging me in the public conversation on Facebook, though they knew formal channels to contact me regarding any information about me or my investigation,” Mattner told The Korea Herald in a phone interview.  In earlier emails exchanged between Mattner and the Korean police, the police admitted that they had the direct email address to reach the victim. According to Mattner, she had emailed the police initially through an email address provided to her, attaching photos of the suspected rapist. However, all the police did was acknowledge the email and then cease communication, she said.Mattner said she had learned about the details of the investigation results regarding her DNA evidence only after the police responded to media about her case and posted the message on Facebook, all without her consent. “They could have directly emailed me or contacted the embassy, but they chose to harass me publicly on Facebook,” she said. “And they had yet to provide evidence supporting any of their claims about the probe.” The post on Facebook prompted outrage on the Internet, with many online commenters condemning the police for failing to protect the victim and publicly humiliating her in public to “save face.”A comment written by a Facebook user Seolhee Park read: “The Yongsan police, you should be ashamed of yourselves to reveal all the details of the victim this way and defending yourselves by refuting the victim’s claims to save your reputation. It is a humiliation to show this badly translated police statement to foreigners. What police should do is to catch the suspect.” The Korea Herald learned that comments written by 12 different people had disappeared from the page. Police admitted to “hiding” the messages. “The comments focused on how police were wrong about posting an open letter, but what we wanted to say to the public was that her claims were different from the truth,” another police officer, in charge of the Facebook page, told The Korea Herald. “We hid some of the messages from being shown, because we were worried that they were missing the point.” One of the comments -- which was captured via screenshot before it disappeared from the Facebook page -- by user Dennis KH Kim read: “I think that it is appropriate to delete this post which includes the victim’s personal information and investigation process as it is an ongoing case.”Cho Ki-woong, a police officer in charge of crimes related to women and juveniles at the Yongsan Police Station, said that they had felt obligated to publicly defend themselves against the “defamatory action.” “Given the victim’s claims in the media, it may seem that police mishandled the case. That’s why we posted the letter to straighten the facts,” Cho told The Korea Herald. “The victim first revealed her own story on her GoFundMe page. We were just refuting her claims that police’s response to the case were not sufficient. What she claims was completely different from what was true.”Cho said the police had never released any information about the probe that the victim had not been aware of. “There must have some miscommunication in the process. We certainly informed that the DNA was collected and CCTV footage was obtained to the victim through the Australian Embassy.”The police’s decision to take her story public on Facebook might neither be legitimate nor appropriate, experts and lawyers pointed out. “This is a typical form of secondary damage facing rape victims. It is shocking that police handled the case this way by revealing the victim’s case in public without her consent,” said Kim Bo-hwa, a senior researcher from the Korea Sexual Violence Relief Center. “This kind of action by police could cause additional damage to the victim’s distress.”“Investigators and judges have a duty to keep victims’ secrets. Posting an open letter including investigation results is a violation of rights,” she said, citing the act on the punishment of sexual crimes and protection of victims enforced in 1994. The law stipulates that victims should not be disadvantaged, and public officials should not reveal victim’s private secrets and personal information learned while performing duties, among other points.  Choi Hee-jin, head of the counseling center for Korea Women’s Hot Line, took issue with low awareness on how to deal with victims of sexual crimes in society. “In Korea, there have been many victims suffering from insensitivity among investigators. The investigators, who do not specialize in sex crimes, tend to suspect the validity of victims’ testimonies and require them to prove their suffering during the investigation process,” she told The Korea Herald. “But such actions can further traumatize the victims.” “There is also a social atmosphere blaming victims for sexual crimes. When victims are turned down by the nation’s justice system, who else can help them?” she posed. “We have a good legal system and institutions to protect victims, but they are not properly implemented.”Lawyer Goh Ji-woon questioned the legitimacy of the police’s decision to reveal personal information via social media, though her story was already public on the GoFundMe campaign page. “The victim can file a lawsuit to seek compensation from the state for failing to properly investigate the case and collect evidence,” she said. “It does not seem to be legitimate for authorities to publish a public letter on social media against the victim.” By Ock Hyun-ju","rape victim sparks fury ,letter to rape victim ,rape victim sparks ,the sexual assault haunted ,to rape victim sparks","['Airdre Mattner', 'Korea', 'Seoul']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51354164  0.17180037

Though I haven’t decided yet, my parents and grandmother are leaning toward the conservative party.” he said. It is easy to find more voters like Heo’s family in Yongin, home to some 980,000 residents, 60 percent of them comprised of senior citizens spending their retirement and young couples commuting to work by subway -- a 40-minute ride to downtown Seoul.Saenuri Party’s candidate for Yongin Lee Sang-il shows his jacket lined with messages from supporters during his campaign on April 2. Such demographic breakdown and geographical proximity has made Yongin and nearby city Suwon serve as a litmus to predict the outcome of elections in the Seoul metropolitan area, the biggest battleground region where 122 seats are up for grabs out of the 253 constituencies elected via direct vote in constituencies. In the past parliamentary polls, the election results in Yongin and Suwon have been similar to those of the Seoul metropolitan areas.In the 2004 and 2008 general elections, the political parties winning the parliamentary majority were the ones that won the most seats in the two cities. Liberal parties claimed the majority of seats in the National Assembly. In the latest 2012 general election, liberal opposition parties lost the parliamentary majority to the ruling Saenuri, but won the majority of seats in Seoul metropolitan areas. Coincidentally, the cities also gave the majority of votes to liberal candidates, by electing four from the liberal parties, out of seven constituencies.The Minjoo Party’s chief Kim Chong-in supports the party’s Yongin-gu candidate Pyo Chang-won  during a campaign on Monday. With the conservative Saenuri Party and the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea now competing neck-and-neck in the Seoul metropolitan areas, the closely fought race has also been playing out in these swing cites. Among those closely watched races is that held in the Yongin D district. The new constituency pits Rep. Lee Sang-il, who had served as a spokesman during the presidential campaign for then-candidate President Park Geun-hye, against Pyo Chang-won, a former criminology professor popular with young voters. The opinion polls show different results according to pollsters. A survey conducted by national newspaper Hankookilbo showed that Pyo enjoyed a lead over Lee, with 36.9 to 29.4 percent, while local newspaper Kyeongyilbo showed that Lee held the lead over Pyo at 39.2 to 32.8 percent.  “We will bring justice to North Korea dictator Kim Jung-un” said Pyo, also a former police officer, at a rally to support Rep. Baek Kun-ki. Baek was wearing a battle dress uniform for the Special Warfare Command. The former four-star general served as the commander of the SWC. He is running for election to represent the Yongin A constituency. Pyo Chang-won and Rep. Baek Kun-ki give speech to their supporters at Cheoin-gu, Yongin. Yeo Jun-suk/The Korea Herald“I think our party is more up to the task than the Saenuri Party because most of their party members have never served military service,” the former policeman and general said, giving a salute to the audience that ranged from the elderly to young people. The audience response to the 30-minute speech was mixed. Younger voters, such as 35-year-old Kim Jin-ah described Pyo as a trustworthy law enforcement officer, while elder attendees, such as 58-year-old Kim Sung-hwan, dismissed Pyo as a typical liberal-minded politician using fancy rhetoric. But Kim, who has spent his entire life in Yongin, noted that he would cast his ballots for Baek Kun-ki in the direct voting from the constituencies, while choosing the conservative Saenuri Party for the seats elected through proportional representation. “I like his soldierly manners, disciplined attitude and the way we contributed to our constituencies,” the Yongin native told The Korea Herald. “Though I have voted for the conservative parties throughout my life, this time around I’d like to give Baek a chance to win the elections.” he said.By Yeo Jun-suk","2016 parties battle for ,in seoul most affluent ,seoul the 27 year ,election 2016 parties battle ,seoul most affluent district","['YONGIN', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Seoul', 'Gangnam - gu', 'Yongin', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Gangnam', 'Seoul']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.76042831  0.19548455

With the parties’ public debate and media appearances dedicated to elaboration on their election pledges and policy agendas, a less formal and easygoing approach appears to be the norm on the ground where the politicians meet with voters face-to-face.Saenuri chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung gives a piggyback ride to Park Jong-hee, the party’s candidate for Suwon in Gyeonggi Province. The ruling Saenuri Party’s chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung, for instance, is making full use of his “big brother” charm -- he is known by his supporters to be hearty and valorous. The chairman, who has been elected for five consecutive terms in Busan since 1996, has showcased his ability to engage with voters -- sometimes using self-deprecating jokes to vouch for candidates.“This guy can get the president on the phone, which is something I can’t do,” said Kim on Monday at a rally he attended to support former presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook. The former journalist is running for the Yeonsu district in Incheon. One of Kim’s signature tactics on the campaign trail is “giving a piggyback ride” to some of the party’s other candidates. The seasoned politician has been traveling to constituencies likely to be closely fought to give candidates a boost, touting that candidates he has supported have never been defeated at the polls. The Minjoo Party of Korea’s chief Kim Chong-in dances with supporters during a campaign in Gangseo-gu, Seoul. The main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea’s leader Kim Chong-in appears to be following in the footsteps of the Saenuri leader Kim. The 76-year-old politician set a causal tone for the election campaign by wearing a wig colored in the party’s official hue, dancing alongside younger supporters of the party. The move represents a shift from the usual style of the former economist who has often made elaborate speeches on the economy and policies centering on statistics. Kim has never been elected via a direct vote in a constituency, but has served four terms through proportional representation. On April 1, the first day of the party’s official campaign, Kim filled his speech with pledges containing numbers and statistics. “We will give the young people 700,000 jobs. ... We will give a 300,000-won  pension to all senior citizens whose income falls in the bottom 70 percent,” he said.People’s Party cochairman Rep.

Once considered to be too “aloof” toward realpolitik, the new party’s cochairman is allegedly the first of the party’s leaders to suffer from a hoarse throat during the campaigning period. “I think I am the healthiest and strongest one among our staff,” said Ahn on Friday when he launched the party’s official campaign in the Nowon district of Seoul. The party official noted he has never been late for his or his supported candidates‘ election campaign stops.

304,304,[ELECTION 2016] Time runs out for opposition unity,"Moves to form an opposition coalition effectively came to naught Monday, amplifying the challenges faced by The Minjoo Party of Korea in its battle with the ruling conservative Saenuri Party in the April 13 general election.With a little over a week remaining to polling day, the National Election Commission has started printing the ballot papers, including all registered candidates, officials said Monday.Candidates w...","Moves to form an opposition coalition effectively came to naught Monday, amplifying the challenges faced by The Minjoo Party of Korea in its battle with the ruling conservative Saenuri Party in the April 13 general election.With a little over a week remaining to polling day, the National Election Commission has started printing the ballot papers, including all registered candidates, officials said Monday.Candidates will henceforth be unable to strike their names from the ballot, even if they quit midway upon either resignation or candidacy coalition.The multi-opposition structure is expected to disperse votes and thus strike a direct blow to the main opposition Minjoo Party, which has been struggling to unite with the split-off centrist People’s Party.According to internal analysis, the Minjoo Party is anticipated to have an upper hand in 35 constituencies out of the 253 regional constituencies nationwide, while the People’s Party is counting about 20.If aggregated, the two opposition parties might have stood a better chance against the Saenuri, which expects a significant predominance in about 82 constituencies.In the remaining -- some 110 in total -- all three parties have forecast a neck-and-neck race.“It was the Minjoo Party’s Kim Chong-in who refused the idea of party-to-party solidarity,” said the People’s Party cochairman Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo at a forum hosted by broadcasting journalists.The main opposition party’s chief Kim had suggested the coalition to the newborn minority party, calling for their common goal to take down the current conservative administration and to achieve a change of government.But Rep. Ahn, while acknowledging the need for unity, claimed the Minjoo had no true intention of joining hands on equal terms.With the united opposition bloc scenario crossed out, the Minjoo camp decided to adopt a select-and-concentration strategy, focusing on censuring the administration and on the relatively free-flowing metropolitan area.“We will no longer cling on to the implausible unity as the true essence of the elections is to judge the economic failure of the current administration and ruling party,” said the Minjoo Party’s election planning chief Jung Jang-sun.Party leader Kim Chong-in reiterated his call to citizens to participate in the vote, counting on the election rule that a high voter turnout tends to act in favor of the opposition.“Only your votes may prevent the monopoly of power, promote democracy and take our nation’s economy in the right direction,” he said while stumping for the party’s candidates in the metropolitan areas, including Seoul, Seongnam and Suwon.The Seoul-Gyeonggi cluster has always been the ultimate battlefield in key elections.In the 2012 parliamentary elections, the voting outcomes of 48 constituencies nationwide were decided by a gap of less than 5 percentage points, among which 31 constituencies were located in the metropolitan zone. This also means that candidates in such tightly challenged electorates are desperate for the slightest momentum, including a candidacy unification.“Rep. Ahn, if he truly intends to judge the current administration, should not stand against opposition coalition,” said Kim Byung-kwan, the Minjoo Party candidate for Seongnam’s Bundang-B in Gyeonggi Province.Kim pointed out that Ahn’s concession in the 2011 Seoul mayoral by-election led to the victory of Park Won-soon and of the opposition camp.While the party’s leadership set to focusing on the Seoul-Gyeonggi area, however, former party leader Rep. Moon Jae-in went his own way by showing up in the Gwangju-Jeolla regions, seeking to whip up votes in the long-standing opposition stronghold zone.“Kim is doing a great job in expanding the party’s outer boundaries, but we should also work on our conventional supporters,” Moon said Sunday, upon visiting the southwestern area.Incumbent chief Kim had earlier attempted to dissuade Moon from marking his presence in the so-called Honam region, where public sentiment is largely against the Busan-based Moon.“ is free to go , but I doubt that any of the party’s candidates there would want his appearance ,” Kim told reporters.By Bae Hyun-jung","candidates officials said monday ,april 13 general election ,monday amplifying the challenges ,officials said monday candidates ,said monday candidates","['the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Saenuri Party', 'the National Election Commission']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48518315  0.31280792

The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles on candidate agendas, election trends and notable runners leading up to the race. This is the 14th installment. –EdStruggling to add momentum to their campaigns leading up to the April 13 general election, political parties canvassed key swing constituencies over the weekend, posing as troubleshooters for the people’s economic hardships.The ruling conservative Saenuri Party stepped up its aggression against the opposition camp for holding back the nation’s economy by deterring a series of economic revitalization and labor reform bills.The Minjoo Party of Korea urged voters to “pass judgement on” the Park Geun-hye administration’s economic failures, blaming the conservative side for deepening the nation’s social and economic inequality.“Our goal is to create jobs for the people, but it is the Minjoo Party that has been standing against the idea,” Saenuri chief Rep. Kim Moo-sung repeated on Saturday while canvassing the metropolitan city of Incheon in support of the party’s candidates.Incheon, with 13 constituencies and a considerable pool of undecided swing voters, is considered a highly strategic campaign field both for the ruling and opposition parties.Also, due to its high density of manufacturing industrial complexes and distribution centers, the western seaport city is sensitive to the change in economic policies.  The ruling Saenuri Party chief Rep. Kim Moo-sung  cheers on Saturday for Rep. Hwang Woo-yea, candidate for Incheon's Seo-gu-B constituency. Yonhap“The Minjoo Party seems to think that by obstructing every action of the Park Geun-hye administration, they may rise to power in the next presidential election,” Kim said, while stumping for fifth-termer and former Education Minister Rep. Hwang Woo-yea.“But it is the Saenuri Party that has been taking real action to revitalize the economy, create jobs and reduce social gaps.”In a matching move, the party’s election committee chief and former Finance Minister Kang Bong-kyun on Sunday released new economic policies, including a plan to pull up the legal minimum wage to 8,000 won  or more from the current 6,030 won over the next four years.“Distribution measures, such as an increase in corporate tax, not only have limited impact but may also weaken the nation’s industrial competitiveness in the long-term,” Kang said.“The key solution is to promote growth first, and then move on to income distribution.”This was a direct attack against the economic democratization platform led by the Minjoo chief Kim Chong-in. The Minjoo Party of Korea chief Kim Chong-in urges citizens to vote, while stumping for party candidates in western Seoul on Sunday. YonhapIn retaliation, the Minjoo Party reiterated its call to judge the Park administration for the nation’s economic difficulties.“It is the Saenuri administration that is liable for our economic reality today,” said party chief Kim Chong-in while campaigning in Gwangju and the Jeolla provinces on Saturday.“Unless we secure seats in the next parliamentary term, the Saenuri Party will continue its misled economic policies.”The ruling party leadership has been largely confident of winning at least 180 seats -- that will allow the party to pass contentious bills without the consent of the opposition.The Gwangju and Jeolla regions -- referred to as the Honam area -- have long been a stronghold for the Minjoo Party and its former incarnations. But due to the defections of several lawmakers who joined the new centrist People’s Party led by Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, the main opposition is expecting a hard battle this year.“We have successfully placed economic issues at the top of the election agenda,” said Minjoo Party spokesperson Kim Sung-soo.“Many voters will agree that it is the current administration and ruling party that should hold responsibility for the economic reality.”The People’s Party, on the other hand, chose to stay away from the economic frame and to criticize the conventional political circles, in an aim to whip up swing votes.“People who have been disappointed over the incompetence of the National Assembly over the past four years are ready to judge both leading parties,” said spokesperson Kim Jae-doo.Sim Sang-jeong of the left-wing Justice Party claimed that the top three parties, obsessed with their power struggle, had failed to suggest distinctive economic policies.By Bae Hyun-jeong","april 13 general election ,candidate agendas election trends ,13 general election political ,election on april 13 ,weak economy south korea","['South Korea', 'National Assembly', 'the Korea Herald']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59231681  0.36950007

Cho Won-jin, the second-term lawmaker running in Dalseo district in the city, said to the supporters in a heavy Daegu accent. “If we lose Daegu, it is not just a defeat of the Saenuri Party. It is a defeat to the Republic of Korea and its liberal democracy,” he said.  Rep. Cho Won-jin gives speech to his supporters at the Saenuri Party`s Daegu office. Yonhap.The two-hour event, packed with Saenuri bigwigs and fervent supporters who punctuated the occasion with resounding applause and cheers, represented a snapshot of the conservative party’s stronghold. It is the political hometown of President Park and her father late President Park Chung-hee. Being elected as a lawmaker first in Dalseong district of Daegu in 1998, the female president began her political career aided by strong supports of Daegu residents. Her popularity culminated in the 2012 presidential elections where almost 80 percent of Daegu voters cast their ballots for the daughter of the late president, who also spent most of his earlier life in Daegu.  The city's strong conservativsm is featured in the breakdown of its representatives in the National Assembly and the municipal parliament. All of the lawmakers representing the region at the 19th Assembly and the city’s municipalities are Saenuri members – making the city the only region that has a legislative body monopolized by a single party. “I don’t know about politics and I think all politicians are basically thieves. But, if I have to choose one among those thieves, I will definitely choose a thief from our town,” a 40-year-old man, who runs a sushi restaurant at Pyeonghwa commercial district downtown of the city, told The Korea Herald. Another resident offered more specific rationale to his support for the ruling party. A 50-year-old pharmacist running his business for more than 30 years in the city said that he would support the Saenuri Party to help Park avoid lame-duck presidency and allocate more budgets to boost the city’s faltering economy. One of the candidates seeking to leverage such sentiment was Chung Jong-sup. The former interior minister runs in Dong-gu A district to compete with Rep. Yoo Sung-kull, a former Saenuri lawmaker who left the party in protest against his nomination drop.Saenuri’s Chong Jong-sup talks to a seller at a market on his campaign trail in Daegu. Yeo Jun-suk/The Korea Herald“If you photocopied President Park, I would be what you’d get,” said Chung in an interview with The Korea Herald. “I believe that the president and I see eye-to-eye on the philosophy to govern the nation. In that sense, I am a perfect fit because I have spearheaded the tasks as a cabinet member,” he said. Such enthusiastic loyalty had put Chung on a hot seat. Last year, the former minister was accused by the main opposition party of violating election laws when proposing a toast in favor of the Saenuri Party. One of his ministry’s tasks was to oversee fair parliamentary elections However, Chung and his aides did not bother to dispel such an image on the campaign trail. Instead of elaborating on election pledges and policy agendas, they chanted ""pick the candidate listed number one” to the voters who hold strong allegiance to the conservative party being allocated a top spot at the ballot.  But Chung’s strategy appears to face an exceptional challenge: contesting against his former colleagues who have left the Saenuri Party in the wake of the party’s infamous factional strife. Of the 11 defectors, four were incumbent lawmaker in Daegu, and all of them seek reelection bids as independents.Independent runner Yoo Seong-min shakes hands with citizens in Daegu. Spearheading the group is Rep. Yoo Seong-min. The former whip quit the party months after President Park displayed disapproval toward him for objecting to her policy initiatives. The conservative party dropped him from the nomination list last month, claiming that Yoo’s political stance clashes with its identity. “The Saenuri Party used to boast a wide spectrum of ideologies ,” said Yoo in an interview with The Korea Herald. “But that spectrum has become too narrow over a short period of time. I will help those being excluded from the nomination and discuss election strategies among us,” said Yoo.What could help the Daegu native’s case for reelection is the region’s worsening economy. The former economics professor said in a media interview that he was the right choice to steer the city in the right direction after President Park finishes her term in 2017. One of the economic hurdles facing the city, once home to Korea’s textile industry in the 1980s, is lack of job opportunities for young people. According to the 2015 statistics from Daegu Gyeongbuk Development Institute, the city’s youth unemployment was 11.4 percent, the third biggest employment rate nationwide. “There are no big companies or conglomerates in Daegu. The most lucrative option for young people is working at local Daegu banks,” said Jang Wang-ki, the 48-year-old man who has run an auto repair shop for 23 years in the downtown of the city. “If the Saenuri Party keeps nominating politicians who don’t have any association with the region, then the city’s economy will pay the price,”, said Jang, referring to the candidate Chung, who he said came to the city just a month ago. The Minjoo Party’s Kim Boo-kyum waves to citizens in Daegu. With most of the city’s constituents divided between the Saenuri candidates and the party defectors, one lawmaker from the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea aims to crack the duopoly by offering alternatives to the voters.He is Rep. Kim Boo-kyum. Having been defeated by conservative candidates by a narrow margin in the 2012 parliamentary elections and 2014 race to choose the city’s mayor, the third-term lawmaker is the only liberal candidate ahead of the Saenuri candidate in opinion polls in the constituency. In a survey conducted by local pollster Realmeter, The Minjoo Party’s third-term lawmakers enjoyed a hefty lead over his counterpart Kim Moon-soo, the former governor of Gyeonggi Province, with 52.7 percent to his 38.2 percent in the Suseong A district. “While citizens of Daegu may have strong patriotism and allegiance to the president, they are undoubtedly outraged at the way the local  is headed. I am committed to breaking the nation’s deep-rooted regionalism” said the Minjoo Party candidate said in an interview with The Korea Herald.

In Asia, China and Japan have reported several isolated cases, although neither have reported a full-fledged outbreak.The first infection case in South Korea raised some concerns over the possible spread of the virus here following an outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome last year. Many experts, however, said the chances of a full-blown outbreak are slim, especially in the cooler months when mosquitoes are not active. The virus can be passed on through blood transfusion or sexual intercourse.The virus is almost always non-life threatening and only poses health concerns for pregnant women and their unborn babies, who may be born with abnormally small heads and improperly developed brains.""We will ramp up efforts to prevent the Zika virus from spreading within the military, based on our experience of containing the MERS virus,"" the ministry said.","borne virus last month ,the ministry on thursday ,mosquito borne virus last ,virus last month after ,virus last month","[""South Korea 's"", 'Zika', 'Brazil']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52693659  0.59541506

Bae Hyun-jung/The Korea HeraldOh Se-hoon, candidate for the ruling conservative Saenuri Party and former Seoul mayor, announced the start of his election campaign by the Cheonggyecheon Stream, which cuts across Jongno-gu and neighboring Jung-gu.The initiation ceremony, cohosted by Oh and the party’s Jung-gu candidate Ji Sang-wook, was considered a win-win strategy for the two who each have different political circumstances.The urban stream of Cheonggyecheon, redeveloped by former Seoul Mayor and President Lee Myung-bak and refined by his successor Oh Se-hoon, is considered a major administrative achievement of the conservative camp.Through his choice of location, Oh sought to remind the citizens of his mayoral career and to revive his former glory.“I shall make the best use of my administrative experience as Seoul mayor, this time to improve Jongno,” read his campaign banners.Ji, who is relatively more low profile, is more widely known as the husband of retired actress Shim Eun-ha. He has little to lose from his strategic union with Oh, a popular presidential aspirant on friendly terms with President Park Geun-hye. Despite his unrivaled lead in the polls, Ji has been striving to improve ties with the party’s pro-Park group, after winning in an in-party primary against former presidential spokesperson Kim Haeng.Oh, should he wind up victorious in Jongno, will reinstate himself as a ranking party figure, breaking the long political pause since stepping down from his mayoral post in 2011 amid disputes over free school meals.But due to such rising political leverage, he also received feeble support from party chairman Kim Moo-sung.Much in contrast to his opposition counterparts, Kim neither showed up at the party’s Jongno campaign scenes, nor offered encouraging gestures to Oh upon their encounter at the Seoul National Cemetery earlier in the morning.In a public survey conducted last week by local pollster Realmeter, the former mayor soared to No. 3 among presidential hopefuls with 13.8 percent in approval ratings, on the heels of Kim’s 14.4 percent. The Minjoo Party of Korea chief Kim Chong-in  accompanies Rep. Chung Sye-kyun, running in Jongno-gu district, Thursday. The Minjoo Party of Korea’s interim chief Kim Chong-in, on the other hand, spared no efforts in endorsing former party chief Rep. Chung Sye-kyun for his heavyweight match in Jongno.“This April 13 election is about judging the Saenuri Party’s economic maladministration over the past eight years,” Kim said, while stumping for Chung during his early morning campaign at Dongmyo Station.“As former Commerce Minister and economic expert, Chung will play a great role in solving the people’s pending economic hardships.”Kim also stayed by Chung’s side throughout the party’s election campaign ceremony, confirming his support for the party’s key player.Chung made a dramatic comeback in the 2012 general election for the then-Democratic United Party when he achieved a sweeping victory against a ranking pro-presidential aide in the symbolic Jongno. His commitment was taken as a risky self-sacrifice as he had given up his guaranteed win in his longtime constituency in North Jeolla Province upon the leadership’s call.But with former mayor Oh now in the picture, the odds seem to turn against the opposition candidate.Most local polls revealed last week that the incumbent representative Chung was falling behind Oh by a maximum of 11 percentage points.“Years-long election experiences have taught me that one should never rely too much on public polls,” said Chung, shrugging off his supporters’ concerns.“Having been here with the people for the past four years, I firmly feel and believe that the voter sentiment is on our side.”He highlighted his favorable evaluation as having implemented 83.6 percent of his 2012 election pledges.People’s Party cochairman Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo  shakes hands with a citizen while helping the campaign for the party’s Jongno-gu candidate Park Tae-soon on Thursday. Bae Hyun-jung/The Korea HeraldThe newborn centrist minority People’s Party, despite having lower chances of winning in Jongno, nevertheless paid significant attention to the district.While campaigning in Hyehwa-dong, cochairman Ahn Cheol-soo volunteered to usher in and introduce passers-by to his party’s Jongno candidate Park Tae-soon.

The Education Ministry said it would run four healing support centers for teachers on a trial basis as part of its efforts to support the mental treatment of those who suffer abuse by students. The photo shows a contract teacher being hit by his students with a broom during class in December in Incheon, Gyeonggi Province. YonhapStarting in Daejeon, Busan, Daegu and Jejudo Island, healing support centers will be established in all municipalities by next year, the ministry said. They will provide a range of systematic support services from mental health checkups, psychological counseling, legal counseling and adjustment checkups. The move came after public concerns grew over lax measures to protect the teachers’ well-being after several high-profile violent incidents at schools. In December last year, five 16-year-old high school students in Icheon, Gyeonggi Province, repeatedly attacked a male contract teacher with a broom while he was checking attendance. Prosecutors sought a one-year jail term for two students last week after the video footage prompted a police investigation earlier this year. A similar incident took place at an elementary school in North Gyeongsang Province earlier this month. A male fourth grader punched his female home room teacher when she disciplined him and told him to apologize to his friend over a quarrel. The teacher received medical treatment for two weeks. According to the Korean Federation of Teachers’ Association, more than 24,500 cases of breach-of-authority were reported in the last five years from local schools, with 95 percent being verbal and physical abuse, sexual harassment and interfering with classes.  A separate survey, conducted on some 1,600 teachers in 2013, showed that nearly 97 percent considered themselves as “emotional laborers.” About 78 percent said their stress level was serious.Despite the large number of cases and reports of mental stress, little support has been provided for teachers so far. In the case of Seoul City, of more than 700 cases reported from March to December last year, only 39 were provided with legal and psychological support.Some municipalities are taking their own initiatives. The Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education on Wednesday said it had recruited a full-time lawyer -- a former teacher -- to provide professional legal services for teachers. Although Seoul City education authorities set up a special legal counseling team of 38 outside lawyers last year, their role has been limited to providing basic consultations, the office said. Experts welcomed the various moves by central and municipal governments but stressed the importance of prevention measures. “Initiatives such as establishing healing centers and strengthening legal counseling are positive moves, but they are all actions to help repair the damage after the fact,” said Cheon Seong-moon, an education professor at Kyungsung University in Busan.“The government should simultaneously come up with effective prevention measures that can be taken before teachers’ rights are affected.” By Lee Hyun-jeong","protect teachers from violence ,for teachers on trial ,teachers from violence ,violence the korean government ,teachers on trial","['korean', 'the Education Ministry']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28443116  0.0742197

With the official campaigning for parliamentary elections kicking off Thursday, a slew of candidates declared their passion to the public, adding to the growing volume of remarkable statements in Korean politics.""I step forward with a desperate heart, resolute to save this country,” wrote Kim Moo-sung, the ruling Saenuri party’s representative, who visited the Seoul’s public cemetery for those who sacrificed their lives for Korea.  ""I step forward with a desperate heart, resolute to save this country. Please look down on me,"" wrote Kim Moo-sung.Some lauded the president in their pursuit to heighten party achievements, even comparing her to Jesus.

Kim Moo-sung in Busan and the newborn People’s Party cochairman Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo in the Nowon-A constituency in northeastern Seoul.Rep. Moon Jae-in of The Minjoo Party of Korea has been laying low since he stepped down from the party leadership earlier this year.The Minjoo Party of Korea’s former chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in attends a meeting in support of a candidate running in Daegu on Wednesday.Saenuri head Kim expects little difficulty in winning his sixth parliamentary term in the southeastern conservative stronghold.Adding to his unrivaled lead in public polls, the risk-taking chairman revved up his presence within the party last week when he stood up to what he saw as President Park Geun-hye’s interference in the party’s nomination process.Saenuri Party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung attends a debate in Seoul on Wednesday. By successfully preventing the party from allocating candidates to run against ranking defectors such as Lee Jae-oh and Rep. Yoo Seong-min, Kim consolidated his position as the leader of the “non-Park” faction.Having distanced himself from the current administration, Kim’s goal is to lead the party to victory, in which case he may gain the political momentum for his presidential candidacy.Moon, on the other hand, faces a more complicated battle.His greatest plus-point as of now is that he has stayed out of the nomination dispute and the consequent negative public sentiment, which has let him keep his reputation relatively intact.According to most local pollsters in the third week of March, Moon had the highest support among potential presidential runners, maintaining a 10-week lead.But for his presidential bid to be competitive, he will need two things: incumbent leader Kim Chong-in’s cooperation, and a strong Minjoo Party presence in the Assembly.The interim chief Kim, who is listed as the party’s No. 2 candidate for proportional representation, has been seeking to erase the legacies of Moon’s leadership, as well as that of former President Roh Moo-hyun, who belonged to the party’s predecessor.People’s Party co-chairman Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo speaks during a rally held for the metropolitan constituencies at the National Assembly on Wednesday. Minor party representative Rep. Ahn faces a double whammy. Not only does he have to lead his new party into winning 40 seats as promised, but he also has a harder fight than Kim in his Nowon-A constituency, where he is closely rivalled by Saenuri candidate Lee Jun-seok.While the respective ranking figures face their battle, parties are striving to win an upper hand in the Seoul-Gyeonggi metropolitan region, which is often considered a central barometer of the nation’s political sentiment. In the 2012 elections, amid heightened public resentment against the former Lee Myung-bak government, the opposition bloc took a sweeping 61.6 percent of votes in Seoul-Gyeonggi. But in the 2008 elections, which came soon after Lee’s election, the then-Grand National Party won 72.9 percent, reflecting the support for the new administration.South Korea will elect new National Assembly members in a general election on April 13.

Won Yoo-chul  attend a campaign launch ceremony for Gyeonggi Province at the party office in Suwon on Tuesday.“But this year, frankly speaking, I have been so skeptical about voting that I even considered casting a void ballot.”Kim has long been a firm supporter of the now-opposition camp which is currently represented by The Minjoo Party of Korea, despite successive changes of its name and identity.“Though I didn‘t agree with every decision made by the Minjoo camp, I believed that the conservative-led politics needs to be challenged and changed,“ he said. Members of the “THE CUT” team, comprised of former preliminary candidates including Rep. Jung Cheong-rae who have been dropped from nominations, hold a press conference at the National Assembly on Tuesday declaring their support for the party’s election win. “But looking back on parliamentary history, I am no longer sure that the current opposition is a valid alternative after all.”Kim is among numerous young voters in their 20s and 30s who remain undecided on who to show political support for. “Over recent years, the public’s interest in elections has visibly faded, while its aversion has soared, which means that the voter turnout will continue its current downtrend,” said Bae Jong-chan, senior analyst at local pollster Research & Research.The official thus predicted that voter participation for this year’s general election is likely to dip lower than 50 percent.Other experts choose to look on the bright side.“The early voting system may pull up the turnout to a certain extent by allowing passive voters to head to the polls,” said Yoon Hee-woong, senior researcher at Opinion Live.Starting from this year’s elections, the National Election Commission is to adopt an early voting system, enabling voters to cast their ballot in advance, within a week prior to the voting day.However, few disagree that the public is showing a growing level of fatigue toward the election or politics in general.“The factional feuds that marred the recent candidate nominations rekindled the public’s chronic fatigue toward politics” said Lee Nae-young, professor of politics at Korea University.“But the rise of new alternatives, including a centrist third party, has also expanded the range of selection for swing voters with no specific party affiliation.”It is still uncertain whether the undecided swing voters and disappointed party supporters will turn to the new centrist People’s Party, but the two leading parties certainly lost some ground over the past weeks.According to a survey last week by local pollster Realmeter on 2,522 voters nationwide, the ruling Saenuri Party and the Minjoo Party’s general ratings stood at 38.3 percent and 24.9 percent, down 3.2-3.4 percentage points respectively.The greater impact was that both parties saw a decline in areas considered their unfaltering strongholds. Saenuri lost 14 percentage points in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province, while the Minjoo Party lost 6.1 percentage points in Gwangju and the Jeolla Provinces.What divided the solid conservative voter pool was the clash between non-mainstreamers and those close to President Park Geun-hye, which led to defections such as that of high-profile Daegu lawmaker Rep. Yoo Seong-min. Putting the Minjoo Party at peril has been the appearance of the People’s Party and the consequent defection of several Jeolla-based members.Though the immediate impact was more conspicuous for the conservative pool, observers noted that it is the opposition camp that may suffer a greater blow from voter apathy.“The unchanging rule is that the higher the voter turnout, the more beneficial for the opposition side,” said Yoon.In line with such a theory, the ruling Uri Party had won 41.99 percent support in the 2004 general election, beating the then-opposition Grand National Party, which is now the Saenuri Party. The voter turnout at the time exceeded 60 percent, reflecting the public‘s resentment toward the GNP’s impeachment of then-President Roh.In contrast, in the following elections in 2008, the turnout stood at a mere 46.1 percent, and the conservative camp succeeded in securing a parliamentary majority.By Bae Hyun-jung South Korea will elect new National Assembly members in a general election on April 13.

This was when TV sets were becoming popular in Korea and served as the center of home life.But times have changed and it is rare to come across such a scene nowadays. A man is eating alone at a restaurant specially designed for “honbobjok,” people who eat alone, in Sinchon, Seoul. YonhapShin Hyang-gi, 50, who lives in Seoul with her husband and three children, said she cannot remember the last time she watched TV with her family.“Even when all my children are at home, they spend time separately watching their favorite shows on streaming websites via smartphones,” said Shin.According to a survey released this week on 6,637 individuals who live with their family in Korea, one-third of them said they watched TV alone at home.Of the 2,190 respondents who watched TV alone, 67 percent cited lack of time with family members as the reason, while 27.2 percent prefer different channels and 5.6 percent do so in order to prevent children from binge-watching.South Korea has traditionally valued a family-oriented lifestyle largely influenced by Confucianism that highlights filial piety, however, modern-day Koreans now have different lifestyle patterns.Society these days centers on work and involves long commuting hours. The lifestyle of youths also has a heavy emphasis on studies. Such factors are gradually dissolving the definition of family here, experts said.“Koreans are living a dull monochromatic life. The young generation does not have enough time to spend with their family after studying or working late. Those in their 50 and 60s have worked for their entire life so they do not know how to spend quality family time,” said professor Lee Taek-gwang from Kyunghee University.According to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the average working hours for Koreans is the highest at 2,285 hours annually, about 30 percent higher than the average.  Data from Statistics Korea also stated that in 2015, just 43 minutes out of a total of 4 hours and 28 minutes of daily spare time was spent with other people including family members. Family bonds are also being reshaped by the soaring number of single-person households, who tend to eat meals or spend leisure time alone at home. This lifestyle trend has even led to a new word being coined in Korean, “honbobjok,” which directly translates to “people who eat meals alone.”“It’s actually more comfortable to eat alone. I think it’s better to save energy and time not having to talk with others while eating,” said 31-year-old worker Bae Chung-yoon. He added that he normally eats at home while listening to music on earphones, with his eyes fixed on his smartphone.According to statistics, single-person households made up about 26 percent, or 5 million, of the total households tallied in 2015. By 2035, this number is expected to swell to 7 million, or 34 percent of total households. Experts anticipate that this lifestyle trend will continue. “In fact, being alone in Korean society has its upside as it can help people to achieve high quality performance, since they do not have to unnecessarily worry about mingling or reading others’ emotions,” professor Gwak Geum-ju from Seoul National University told The Korea Herald.“Families are certainly a source of support and a medium for sharing emotions. But obsessive dependence on each other has also often become a bane for familial relationships in Korea,” she added.“Koreans should make use of their family in a wiser way, along with changing lifestyles and the social definition of family.”By Kim Da-sol","family while watching television ,alone at restaurant specially ,eating alone at restaurant ,meal with her family ,alone at restaurant","['Korea', 'Korea']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66585463 -0.41457921

The Education Ministry said the score of the College Scholastic Aptitude Test, or Suneung, will be invalid if test-takers do not sit for the Korean history exam. The new rule is part of the ministry’s guidelines and plans for the CSAT this year. The ministry annually releases the basic scheme for the national college entrance exam at the start of the school year. The test will be will held on Nov. 17 nationwide. The ministry decided in 2013 to make the Korean history test mandatory, upon the Park Geun-hye administration’s push to strengthen Korean history education. CSAT director Lee Chang-hoon of the Korean Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation speaks during a press briefing on this year’s CSAT rules in Sejong City on Tuesday. The move, however, sparked heated debate, with those who supported it citing the need for more emphasis on history education. Those who opposed the move said that it would put excessive academic burden on students. Proponents of the mandatory history exam highlighted the need to raise “national spirit” through history education. Others claimed that the move would only lead to the growth of the private education market. In 2013, only 7.1 percent of Suneung takers chose Korean history for their optional test courses, indicating lack interest in the subject.  In response to public concern that the new requirement would result in greater dependency on private education, the Education Ministry stressed that the mandatory Korean history test would be easy, with only 20 questions. The test will also be graded under absolute evaluation to reduce the burden on students, it added. The education authorities will come up with more details of the exam in July. The incumbent government’s emphasis on history education has often led to debates over its social, political and ideological implications.The latest controversy was the government’s decision in November last year to officially reinstate state-issued history textbooks for secondary education from next year. The government had argued that the majority of high school history textbooks are left-leaning. It will be the first time since 1974 that history textbooks used for secondary education will be authored by the government. The state-issued history textbooks have drawn fierce opposition from progressives over the decision making and publication process which has remained largely undisclosed. Opponents have also claimed the state’s direct involvement will lead to biased descriptions of modern history, including the past dictatorship.The government has so far finalized 47 members of the textbook review committee but only revealed the name of one of them -- Shin Hyung-sik, a professor emeritus at Ewha Womans University. They said the other names of others will remain undisclosed for security reasons. The government had initially vowed to keep the entire publication process transparent. In December last year, some civic groups, including Minbyun, or Lawyers for a Democratic Society, brought the textbook case to the Constitutional Court, claiming that reinstating state-authored history textbooks “infringed the impartiality of education.” The new history textbooks will be used in schools from March next year.

The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles on candidate agendas, election trends and notable runners leading up to the race. This is the ninth installment. --EdAt the April 13 general election, voters here will see a significant change in the balloting process, with an improved system to guarantee reliability and accuracy.The National Election Committee announced that it would be implementing new electoral rules that mandates polling stations use holographic technology to authenticate ballot boxes. This method to prevent counterfeit notes will be attached to the boxes and used to unlock them. The election watchdog said that the changes were designed to increase efficiency in managing votes compared to the previous use of near-field communication technology. According to officials, the NFC-based system had cost a huge amount of taxpayers’ money and was also time-consuming for public workers. “The use of NFC to verify ballot boxes was quite a complicated process,” said Lee Jae-yoon, a public relations official from the election watchdog group. Participants try casting ballots under the new system at the National Election Commission’s district office in Changwon on March 17. Yonhap    NFC chips were previously installed on the boxes to act as locks. Ballot counters had to verify them by downloading a mobile app to read the NFC code. The app was also only available for android phones.The authorities highlighted that the new system is as reliable as the previous one because the holographic images are only accessible via a digital watermark. Election officials will be assigned to the polling stations to oversee the process. The holographic images are also designed in a way that prevents duplication and reuse. They are also cheaper than the previous system by around 10 to 20 million won as they only require printing expenses. The use of holographic images is one of the measures that the election watchdog group is taking to address concerns among some progressive lawmakers and activists about the reliability and accuracy of the nation’s vote-counting system.Officials demonstrate the ballot-counting machine at the National Election Commission’s district office in Changwon on March 17. YonhapOther measures include the decision to remove wireless LAN cards from laptops used by the election watchdog. Lawmakers, such as Rep. Jung Chung-rae from the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea, had raised concerns that the laptops are vulnerable to hackers aiming to rig the elections. The election watchdog also changed the appearance of ballots to reduce undervotes. There will be spaces between the names of candidates on ballots so that voters will be less likely to cast nullified votes by marking on the boundaries. “Since the previous ballots did not have spaces between the names of the candidates, some votes marked on the boundary and were counted as null,” said Lee. “We are less likely to debate whether some ballots should be nullified or not,” she added. Other changes include the introduction of machines to count and sort ballots. There will also be a tool to assist those with difficulties in using their hands to cast ballots by using their wrists or mouth. An official demonstrates how to use equipment designed to help people who have difficulties using their hands to cast ballots at the National Election Commission’s district office in Changwon on March 17. YonhapThe election next month will also be the first parliamentary election in which balloters can vote in advance without having to preregister themselves as legitimate voters. Advance voting will take place from April 8 to 9. Those who will not be able to make it on the actual election date can visit designated polling stations, identify themselves and vote. In the past, balloters had to register themselves as legitimate voters beforehand to cast their ballots in advance. Sailors at sea will also be able to cast their ballots on board ships for the first time. They will mark their ballots on the vessel and send them to election authorities via telecommunication. The ballots will be sent to the NEC sealed, a measure to prevent the NEC from revealing the sailors’ votes.Such advanced electoral system has attracted attention from abroad. Earlier this year, the NEC signed memorandum of understandings with the election watchdog groups of other countries -- including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Maldives and Republic of Uzbekistan -- to share balloting technology.“The focus of cooperation is how to build an electronic voting system that can prevent vote-rigging and improve vote counting,” said Kim Young-tak, a NEC official dealing with the agency’s foreign aid programs. “They place more trust in an electronic counting system than manual ones,” he said. The official added that there are talks underway with the Kenyan and Ecuadorian governments to provide them with technical support in their upcoming elections. He highlighted that the Korean system appeals to these nations due to its accuracy and rapid process of vote counting. Kyrgyzstan, a nation that became independent country in 1991, was the first country to use Korea’s electronic voting system at its parliamentary election. Seoul provided the fledgling democracy with financial support to establish electronic voting machines and improve its electoral procedures.

The Saenuri Party plans to announce Monday a collective leadership that includes factional big shots and a former cabinet member. Its leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung, whip Rep. Won Yoo-chul, Reps. Rhee In-jae and Seo Cheong-won and former finance minister Kang Bong-kyun would serve as cochairmen. Faced with public pushback from the now-infamous clashes between the faction close to President Park Geun-hye and dissenters led by party leader Kim, the party renewed its pledge to recover its parliamentary majority. With the recent chain defections, the Saenuri currently holds 146 out of the 292 seats.The Saenuri Party’s Busan office holds a convention to launch an organization tasked with leading the election campaign. Yonhap“Our future would be at stake if the Saenuri lost a majority ,” said party chief Kim, who had set the goal for the upcoming April elections as winning 180 or more seats, a number required for the party to pass contentious bills without negotiating a deal with opposition parties.The Minjoo Party is expected to flock around interim leader Kim Chong-in, who will also lead solo the party’s election campaign. Kim has recently survived a leadership crisis over the proportional representation list, in which he had listed himself as a top-priority candidate.Defining the upcoming elections as a “judgment” of what it viewed as “flawed” economic policies of the Park administration, the main opposition party is set to focus its election pledges and party platform upon economic issues. While Kim publicly said that his goal is to keep the party’s current 107 seats, some key members suggested they could win up to 130 seats, if the opposition parties agreed to nominate a single candidate in battleground districts where several opposition candidates are set to compete with one another.    “Our goal is to win between 120 and 130 seats,” said the Minjoo Party’s former whip Rep. Woo Yoon-keun in a media interview. “ we have to send a single candidate to constituencies such as Seoul and its neighboring cities.”  Out of the 253 seats elected through direct votes in constituencies, 178 seats were being contested between a single candidate from the ruling party and multiple candidates from the opposition parties. Among them, 105 seats were in Seoul and nearby metropolitan areas. The Minjoo Party of Korea holds a convention at Gwangju to introduce its candidates to the voters. YonhapBut the prospect of building a coalition remains bleak as the minor opposition parties -- the centrist People’s Party and the more progressive Justice Party -- have refused to accept the offer, criticizing the Minjoo Party for “exploiting” its status as the main opposition during negotiation.  The Peoples’ party vowed to reprimand those candidates seeking to negotiate a deal without the approval of the party leadership. The 21-member party aims to win more than 20 seats, a number that allows the newborn party to secure government funding and exercise tie-breaking vote in the legislative process.   The Justice Party, which has been counting on building an opposition coalition, followed suit after the main opposition named its candidates in the constituencies of the minor party’s leader Rep. Shim Sang-jung and its whip Rep. Jeong Jin-hoo.By Yeo Jun-suk","leadership for election campaign ,april 13 parliamentary polls ,official election campaign period ,adjust leadership for election ,the official election campaign","['Saenuri Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.304629    0.25260079

The competition rate is 3.7 to 1, compared with 4.84 to 1 in the 2004 parliamentary elections.It also noted 158 candidates are vying for the remaining 47 seats, which will be allocated to political parties according to the numbers of votes that the parties receive overall under proportional representation.","for april parliamentary race ,official campaigns next week ,four years election organizers ,election organizers said sunday ,april parliamentary race",['Saenuri Party'],4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64444458  0.03618968

The election law requires candidates from political parties to be endorsed by their leaders and independent candidates to be endorsed by between 300 and 500 supporters.Since the law bans candidates from launching their election campaigns before March 30, they are not able to hold rallies until then. Instead, they can publicize themselves via text messages. Only the candidate can send such text messages to voters at a maximum of five times for each respondent. Candidates Rep. Lee Jung-hyun  of the Saenuri Party, Noh Gwan-gyu of The Minjoo Party of Korea and Koo Hee-seung of the People’s Party leave after registering themselves with the election commission office at Suncheon, South Jeolla Province, Thursday. “Those seeking to represent the people have to observe the laws on the campaign trail,” said Lee In-bok, the chairperson of the National Election Commission, urging a fair race up to April 13. “If the candidates violate the rules, they will be held accountable,” he said. The violations include slandering candidates by spreading false rumors, bribing voters and manipulating opinion polls. The candidates also have to make public their total assets, criminal, military and tax records, among others. The transition to the election campaign came after mainstream parties finished their nomination process. Some 33 percent of incumbent lawmakers were denied opportunity to run in the elections. Out of 288 incumbents, 96 were denied nomination by their parties. The Saenuri Party managed to replace about 38 percent of its incumbents with political rookies, while the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea and the People’s Party achieved turnout rates of almost 29 percent and 24 percent, respectively. But the parties were far from achieving the goals that they had set before the nomination battle. The Saenuri Party, who had promised to select all candidates through opinion polls and primaries among grassroots members and average voters, only chose 56.4 percent of the candidates through the process. Instead, the ruling party returned to old tactics – nominating political heavyweights supported by factions close to the president without preliminary competition. “It was the worst nomination process that stifles our democracy,” said Rep. Cho Hae-jin who defected from the party to run as an independent.  The same was true for the Minjoo Party. It had vowed to allocate 30 percent of parliamentary seats elected through proportional representation to female politicians, but only 12 percent of the applicants was included in the list. The main opposition’s pledge to attract more young politicians was overshadowed by the power struggle between the hawkish wing of the party and its interim leader Rep. Kim Chong-in. Some prospective candidates protested against what they view as an “unilateral” decision to exclude them from the list.Both parties’ No. 1 picks for the proportional seat were scientists, a move reflecting the country’s current infatuation with artificial intelligence sparked off by the Go match between Lee Se-dol and AlphaGo earlier this month.The rival parties, meanwhile, failed to embrace ethnic diversity in proportional nomination. Most foreign immigrants were either excluded from the list or ended up being placed far in the back with unlikely chances of winning. “It was a huge disappointment for people,” said Lee Jung-hee, political professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. “The parties have to show their political agendas through the nomination, but they didn’t. I am afraid that it could worsen peoples’ frustration with politics,” said Lee.

325,325,"Korea to dispatch 300 teachers, students overseas to share",South Korea on Wednesday announced its plan to dispatch a total of 300 teachers and university students overseas this year to share the experience of Korea's educational development.The education ministry and the National Institute for International Education (NIIED) said that 140 teachers and 160 students attending teachers' universities will be sent to 15 foreign countries for a project to engage in various educati...,"South Korea on Wednesday announced its plan to dispatch a total of 300 teachers and university students overseas this year to share the experience of Korea's educational development.The education ministry and the National Institute for International Education  said that 140 teachers and 160 students attending teachers' universities will be sent to 15 foreign countries for a project to engage in various educational programs, including teaching foreign students. The number of participants for this year will be the largest since the program was initiated in 2013, the ministry said. Previously, only 20 participants went overseas annually to help developing countries in their education programs as a project for Official Development Assistance  through the Korea International Cooperation Agency .Under the ODA project so far, South Korea has sent teachers to eight countries, mostly those that are developing such as Ethiopia and Swaziland. But this year, South Korea will dispatch some to non-ODA countries, according to the NIIED.As a long-term stay program, some 140 teachers will lecture at regular schools on such subjects as Korean language, mathematics, science and computers. However, 10 positions were open to retired teachers, university professors and educational administrators with more than 10 years of experience. They will be assigned to serve as advisers for the host countries' education-related divisions.During their one-year stay starting in August, the teachers going to the ODA countries will receive a monthly payment of 2.5 million won  in addition to monthly living expenses of 1 million won plus air fare.Those going to non-ODA countries will be paid a similar salary by the host countries with living expenses and air fare covered as well.The 160 university students will serve as teachers for roughly one month during their vacation period.The students to be dispatched overseas will have air fare and living expenses covered if they file education program proposals to NIIED.Long-term applications will be accepted until April 22 while short-term applications will be accepted by April 29. The results of the open selection will be announced in May on the NIIED homepage .","dispatch 300 teachers students ,300 teachers students overseas ,to dispatch 300 teachers ,dispatch 300 teachers ,korea to dispatch 300","['South Korea', 'Korea', 'the National Institute for International Education', 'NIIED']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.03179242  0.41068521

326,326,[ELECTION 2016] Parties brush voters aside in battle to win,"Decades of regionalism seem to have left South Korean voters with a certain political inertia -- one in which they continue to vote for a specific favored party, regardless of its policies or the candidate.It is this voter allegiance that often gives political parties the confidence, as well as the discretion, to freely move their candidates from one constituency to another, without sweating over its impact at the ba...","Decades of regionalism seem to have left South Korean voters with a certain political inertia -- one in which they continue to vote for a specific favored party, regardless of its policies or the candidate.It is this voter allegiance that often gives political parties the confidence, as well as the discretion, to freely move their candidates from one constituency to another, without sweating over its impact at the ballot box.But such arbitrary reallocation, though considered a useful deployment strategy in elections, may also backfire on the parties and candidates, should voters disapprove.Supporters of the Saenuri Party’s Rep. Lee Jae-oh protest the party’s decision to drop his nomination in Seoul on March 16.  A recent example is the ruling conservative Saenuri Party’s incumbent fifth-termer Rep. Hwang Woo-yea, who shifted his affiliation to a new neighboring constituency after failing to receive the party’s nomination for his current district.“Based on my experience of boosting the international city of Songdo, I will now work on developing the northwestern belt so as to create an economically powerful Incheon,” Hwang said.The lawmaker was granted candidacy in the Seo-gu-B constituency in Incheon last week, after being shoved out of his current Yeonsu-gu constituency, located just south of Seo-gu.The former deputy prime minister and minister of education had lost favor for his lukewarm support of state-authored history textbooks, a project strongly propelled by the party leadership and President Park Geun-hye. But by volunteering to run in the challenging new constituency, which is considered an opposition stronghold, he made his way back onto the candidate list.The Saenuri Party has also been blamed for designating former presidential officials to advantageous constituencies, regardless of their regional affiliation or the local voter sentiment.The exception was Cho Yoon-sun, a former gender equality minister and presidential secretary for state affairs, who declined to be sent to another constituency after losing the regional primary in her current Seocho-A constituency.A party member of The Minjoo Party of Korea is blocked while trying to enter the party chairman’s office to protest Kim Chong-in’s nomination on March 21. The main opposition party, too, is prone to shuffling candidates.Ever since it cut off popular activist figure Rep. Jung Cheong-rae and nominated the party’s chief publicist Sohn Hye-won to his Mapo-B constituency in Seoul, The Minjoo Party of Korea has been swamped with protests by Jung’s supporters and some local voters.The protests died down once Jung pledged his support for Sohn, but complaints persisted on the party’s centralized nomination process.Supporters of members who have been omitted from the People’s Party nominations clash with party officials at the National Assembly on March 21. Both rival parties also came under fire over their lists of proportional representation candidates, which in voters‘ eyes have turned into a fraternal list of who to share the next parliamentary seats with, rather than choosing candidates that represent the party’s main policy directions.The Saenuri Party’s list, for instance, includes controversial figures such as the former chief of the state-run railroad company KORAIL, who was accused of responding excessively to a strike by employees at what they called a move toward privatization. The list also includes President Park Geun-hye’s former aides at Cheong Wa Dae.The proportional candidate list of the Minjoo Party is no less controversial, the latest point being the disputed nomination of interim chief Kim Chong-in as No. 2 on the party list. The spot -- the highest available for a male candidate -- has usually been taken by a figure representing politically marginalized people.Political observers noted that parties may at some point lose sympathy with the public, should they neglect the voter sentiment.“In this year’s elections, parties are marked for their electoral engineering strategies, meaning that they will take any unconventional and controversial actions, if only to win,” said Choi Chang-ryul, professor at Yongin University.“The average voter may find such moves confusing and eventually disapprove of the party or the candidate.”Shin Yul, a political professor at Myongji University, was more critical of the constituency carousel.“Even veteran politicians are too preoccupied with the turf wars,” he said.“It seems that politics is no longer about noble visions of serving the people and improving the nation, but just a profitable vocation.”By Bae Hyun-jung South Korea will elect new National Assembly members in a general election on April 13. The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles on the candidates’ agendas, election trends and notable runners leading up to the race.

With the Saenuri Party’s Supreme Council and nomination committee failing to reach a consensus over whether to select Rep. Yoo Seong-min as a parliamentary candidate, the committee’s key members noted that the only way to solve this gridlock would be if the third-term lawmaker decides to quit the race. The Saenuri Party’s chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung receives questions from reporters at the National Assembly on Monday. Yonhap“I am waiting for Yoo’s decision ,” the committee’s chairman Rep. Lee Hahn-koo said, when asked about whether the body would exclude Yoo from the nomination. “I think it is the best way to help us minimize pushback.”The move was seen as an effort by the pro-Park faction -- which runs the nomination committee -- to avoid public criticism by tossing the decision over to Yoo, who has been laying low in recent weeks due to the nomination feud. It had been reported that Yoo would not drop his bid unless the party forced him to. They have to finalize the nomination list by Wednesday. The Saenuri Party leadership, meanwhile, indicated earlier in the day that it planned to put Cho Yoon-sun, a former presidential secretary for political affairs, back on the nomination list. Cho, however, refused to accept the proposal. If the former gender equality minister had been nominated, she would have competed with Rep. Chin Young at Yonsan district in Seoul. Cho had lost a nomination battle to fellow party member Lee Hye-hoon by a narrow margin the day before in Seocho constituencyApart from Cho, others working as top aides to President Park have also struggled to outperform those outside the pro-Park faction in the nomination contest. Reps. Kim Jae-won, Joo Ho-young and Yoon Sang-hyun, lawmakers who doubled as presidential secretaries for political affairs, were excluded from the nomination. As factional strife continued over the nomination battle, President Park blamed the legislative deadlock on the lawmakers who she described as “being preoccupied” with their own political careers, while setting aside legislative affairs such as passing pending business bills. “The legislative process has been left in limbo because of the election campaign,” said Park during a meeting with her top aides. “If the politicians continue to engage in their own politics, the Assembly will lose the opportunity .”By Yeo Jun-suk","party nomination committee ratcheted ,nomination committee failing ,next month general election ,and nomination committee failing ,nomination committee ratcheted","['Saenuri Party', 'the Saenuri Party ’s Supreme Council', 'Yoo Seong - min']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64495212 -0.18599583

The boats are updated versions of the Yoon Young-ha-class boats that are already in service with the armed forces.Seoul is expected to launch some 20 of these patrol killer guided B  boats in the coming years to replace the existing fleet of smaller and less capable Chamsuri-class patrol boats that entered service in the 1970s.""The new boats are a follow-up to the Yoon Young-ha-class PKG-As, with construction work to start this year,"" according to the official.The 440-ton Yoon Young-ha class patrol killers were first deployed along the Northern Limit Line, the de factor sea border with North Korea, in June 2009, under the Patrol Killer Experimental project. A total of 18 vessels have been launched. Yoon Young-ha, was named after a lieutenant commander who was killed in a maritime skirmish with North Korea in the western NLL in 2002. The planned deployment of the new boats in the NLL area could significantly enhance the military's operational mobility and ability to respond to North Korean provocations in recent years.In March 2010, North Korea torpedoed the South Korean Navy corvette Cheonan in the area and 46 sailors were killed or went missing in the incident. ""The new PKG-B vessels will carry lighter weapons and be able to move faster so they could maneuver in the front line area more easily,"" a Navy official noted. ""They will make it easier for us to carry out hit-and-run operations."" For the weapons system, the boats will carry guided missiles which are currently under development, according to the military. The forthcoming patrol killers will be half the size of the currently deployed vessels that measure some 63 meters in length and 9 m in width with a capacity to accommodate around 40 sailors.","launch new patrol boats ,new patrol boats toughen ,out new patrol boats ,new patrol boats to ,new patrol boats","[""South Korea 's"", 'Navy', 'North Korea', 'Navy', 'Seoul']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.30582348 -0.43034399

The student later filed a complaint with the NHRCK. He claimed that it was a violation of human rights to treat him like a criminal by forcing him to take a urine test. Participants pose for a photo at an event to celebrate the declaration of Student Rights Day on Jan. 26 in Seoul. YonhapThe school, however, refuted this by saying that such a test was necessary to prevent students from mixing the urine with water so as not to get caught. The school, which promotes anti-smoking programs, has taken various measures to curb teenage smoking. It allows urine tests to be conducted upon students’ consent whenever they are suspected of smoking in school. “The human rights of students must be better respected during smoking crackdown and anti-smoking measures. Although the school says it has conducted the test upon their consent, the consent itself is unlikely to have been voluntary,” said the watchdog. Incheon Metropolitan City Office of Education has recommended schools to use a carbon monoxide measuring instrument for smoking tests rather than urine tests, after a similar incident took place in another school in the city in 2013.South Korea has often faced criticism for placing discipline above the protection of the human rights of students, including banning students from growing their hair out, wearing makeup and expressing religious beliefs.“There’s a prevalent social perception that students are immature. The basic value of human rights is mutual understanding. If the way teachers treat students is applicable to adults, it is not human rights violation. They need to treat them the same as they treat adults,” said youth welfare professor Kim Yoon-na from Seoul Cyber University.In light of such criticism, municipalities have been moving to better ensure student rights, such as by enacting ordinances.Since 2010, starting with Gyeonggi Province, more than 15 cities and provinces have introduced human rights ordinances for students. These comprehensively cover issues such as freedom of expression, religion, physical punishment and regulations regarding hairstyle and attire. In January, the Seoul Metropolitan Government Office of Education declared Jan. 26 as Student Rights Day. It vowed to map out a set of measures to boost the rights of teenage students.

The meeting had convened despite being called off by chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung a day earlier in protest against the “unjust and top-down” decisions by the nomination committee chaired by pro-Park Rep. Lee Hahn-koo.Kim, who leads the pack of members critical of the pro-Park group, has been openly disgruntled by the nomination picks, which are favorable toward Park loyalists.Kim has been inveighing against Lee for abusing his power to make unilateral choices in favor of pro-Park members instead of people he described as “well-performing and renowned” incumbents, such as Rep. Lee Jae-oh.Saenuri Party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung He has also taken issue with what the nomination committee has called “strategic choices” in some of the constituencies that bypass internal primaries. Bottom-up selection of candidates through primaries and opinion polls have been among Kim’s key initiatives throughout his leadership since 2014. He has been strictly against resorting to the “strategic” nominations that have often been conducted in the past. The primaries were considered the only alternative for Kim to hold sway in the party, which is dependent on Park and her solid voter support.Sparking the all-out confrontation was Wednesday’s Supreme Council meeting, which Kim adjourned as the members butted heads over the remaining nominations. He also held a press conference in the afternoon, slamming Lee Hahn-koo for making poor choices and sidestepping due process.Lee called Kim’s remarks “stupid,” and pro-Park members including floor leader Rep. Won Yoo-chul demanded the next day that Kim apologize for his behavior that they said violated the nomination committee’s right to autonomy.Immediately, Kim retorted that there was “nothing to apologize for.” He then called a closed-door meeting with members of his faction and said it was the duty of the party chairman to uphold the party constitution and regulations. Kim only laughed when asked by the press if he would consider refusing to put his chairman’s stamp on the final nomination list, the last formal procedure required in nominations.Saenuri nomination committee chief Rep. Lee Hahn-koo Some other non-Park members also spoke out against the nomination committee. The committee meeting in the afternoon was suspended as some of members walked out in protest of chairman Kim’s remarks against them, demanding an apology. One of the non-Park members, Rep. Chin Young announced he would leave the party and said he was contemplating running as an independent. “Chairman Lee is acting as if he is the law, completely ignoring the nomination rules,” said Rep. Cho Hae-jin, who was dropped from the nominations.The confrontation among Kim, Lee and their cohorts was widely anticipated from the beginning. Kim had opposed Lee to head the nomination committee last month, but was pressured to accept the choice, which was strongly backed by the pro-Park members at the Supreme Council.Kim, a politician by profession since the 1980s when he was an aide to former President Kim Young-sam, has often clashed with four-term lawmaker Lee Hahn-koo, a former economist, over the party’s key policies and power struggles in the past.The tipping point of the ongoing feud is expected to be the nomination committee’s delayed decision on former floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min. Yoo, who represents one of the party’s stronghold constituencies in Daegu, is one of the members conspicuously disapproved of by President Park. Park had singled him out as “betraying” her policy initiatives last year, which eventually led to his resignation from the post. The committee has been holding back its decision on Yoo in apparent fear of a public backlash.Some observers also suggested the growing strife may lead to a mass defection of the non-Park members to form their own political group, as pro-Park members did in 2008 in protest to nomination selections made by the leadership loyal to then-President Lee Myung-bak.By Yeo Jun-suk","election next month thursday ,all out factional battle ,thursday morning supreme council ,out factional battle ,saenuri in nomination turmoil","['Saenuri Party', 'Supreme Council', 'Park Geun']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59502351  0.18157159

In 2009, South Korea enacted a law that grants citizens in foreign countries the right to cast ballots both for parliamentary elections and the presidential vote in their homeland.The NEC official said that the registration numbers were higher than the previous parliamentary election in 2012 thanks to the number of increased polling stations and easier registration process.Unlike in previous elections, applications were accepted not only in person, but also by mail, email and over the Internet, the NEC said. In previous elections, voters had to visit diplomatic missions to register their intention to vote.Voting for overseas Koreans is scheduled to kick off on March 30 for a six-day run at 198 polling stations.","watchdog said wednesday voter ,election watchdog said wednesday ,voter registration for korean ,wednesday voter registration for ,april 13 parliamentary election","['south korean', 'korean', 'natio']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34119806  0.44507179

The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles on the candidate agendas, election trends and notable runners leading up to the race. This is the sixth installment. --EdPark Jong-ung, a chief publicist for Korea’s Labor Party, stood with his coworkers at the front gate of the National Assembly on Tuesday to hold a press conference urging lawmakers to abandon the controversial counterterrorism bill.“It is one of the agenda items that we are pushing forward,” Park told The Korea Herald, referring to the much-disputed legislation that cleared the Assembly earlier this month.” ""Though we don’t have any elected lawmakers, we are trying to add different voices to the legislative process,” he added. Korea’s Labor Party, which was established in 2013, is one of several minor political groups aiming to have their own candidates elected as representatives to National Assembly in the April general election. As of Tuesday, the nation’s election watchdog has registered 23 groups as political parties and another 19 as preparation committees for creating new parties -- meaning that 38 new political groups, beyond the four already holding seats, are seeking to make inroads in the 296-member Assembly.The parliamentary seats are divided among the four major parties, with the ruling Saenuri Party and main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea having 129 and 86, respectively. The Peoples’ Party and the Justice Party claim 19 and 1, respectively. Caption: Prominent same-sex marriage activist Kim Jo Kwang-soo and fellow members of the Green Party Korea hold a press conference in downtown Seoul to protest against the court’s refusal to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Yonhap As with the Labor Party, which plans to send 10 candidates out on the campaign trail, groups outside the legislative process seek to emerge as relevant political parties by gaining at least one parliamentary seat. Green Party Korea, for instance, nominated five candidates for local constituencies and proportional representation, respectively. The 4-year-old party’s political platform is to advocate the right for minorities such as women, homosexuals and immigrants. Jung Soo-yeon, 28, who announced her bid as a candidate for the Peoples’ Union Party said, “We will make sure that voices of the young people are heard in the Assembly.” Established in February, the progressive party vows to address youth unemployment and improve labor workers’ lives. But the minor parties’ path to the Assembly appears to be a narrow one as they have never passed the electoral hurdle. To win parliamentary seats, the parties should either outperform mainstream parties in local elections or attract more than 3 percent of votes nationwide.Since the former is unlikely due to the current single-constituency system, the minor parties have strived to pass the 3-percent threshold. The Green Party and Labor Party earned 1.25 and 0.84 percent, respectively, in the 2014 by-elections.Peoples’ Union Party chairman Lee Seung-jae announces his bid to run in the April 14 general election at the National Assembly. YonhapFaced with such challenges, some minor political groups said that gaining seats in the upcoming election is not their priority. They instead focus on promoting their political agenda to the general public during the election season when attention to politics is relatively high. Pyeji Party, a political group that roughly translates to a party to cancel government policies, did not bother to register itself as a political party. The group’s officials said that instead, it would use the election as an opportunity to urge the government to overhaul policies for the disabled. Choi Yong-sang, who represents a political group that aims to provide assistance to Korean women forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese military, said, “Our party focuses more on helping the surviving family members than earning seats in the elections.” There are also some minor groups that are capitalizing on the popularity of political heavyweights and former mainstream parties. Four groups have named their parties after United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The names of former ruling parties such as Democratic Party and Grand National Party are also now being used by minor political groups.  By Yeo Jun-suk","candidate agendas election trends ,voter appeal south korea ,assembly on tuesday ,election on april 13 ,the candidate agendas election","['South Korea', 'National Assembly', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea ’s Labor Party', 'the National Assembly']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39803943  0.4222801

In February 2015, there were 16 political parties in the country. Except for the four parties currently holding seats in the National Assembly -- the ruling Saenuri Party, the main opposition Minjoo Party, the People's Party and the Justice Party -- 19 are extra-parliamentary, according to the commission.Another 19 organizations have enrolled preparatory committees to establish political parties, the NEC said.In South Korea, a political party can be registered when it has at least five municipal branches with more than 1,000 members enrolled at each one.In February, the People's Union Party, a coalition of parties comprised of young adults, farmers and laborers, held an inauguration ceremony. It has over 20,000 members, according to its spokesman Song Young-woo.The party promised to solve the issues of youth unemployment and non-regular employees.""Our goal is to make inroads into the parliament by winning votes in the polls,"" Song said.Some other parties are formed with an aim to voice their interests and enhance publicity without going through an official register process.A group of disabled people formed an organization under the name of a political party but did not enroll it with the election committee nor register it with a preparatory committee.Other unique parties include a group supporting the U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon or a group calling for compensation to wartime forced laborers.""The phenomenon seems to reflect people's distrust of the existing parties,"" said Lee Nae-young, a professor at Seoul's Korea University. He said such parties are being formed because people want to better voice their views and push forward certain agendas. Related to the increase in the number of parties, the election commission said the newly created parties must meet certain requirements, such as registering candidates in local elections, to keep their formal status.On April 6, 2012, a total of 25 parties were registered with the national election commission. The number shrank to seven right after the 2012 general elections took place on April 11, the commission said.","election watchdog said tuesday ,minor political parties spring ,the upcoming parliamentary race ,political parties spring ,watchdog said tuesday sign","['the National Election Commission', 'NEC']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54676068  0.14995517

So to pat himself on the back for surviving a difficult day or week, he occasionally heads to restaurants and bars -- alone.    ""It's like a self-comforting, self-healing moment of solace for me,"" he said. ""No need to keep up with the conversation with office co-workers, which usually end up being about work, anyway.""Lucky for Park, 35, more eateries and drinking places are opening up for customers like him. He was happy to recently discover a perfect place not far from his home in western Seoul where he can grab a bottle of beer with side dishes served in manageable single-person portions.  A common choice for solo consumers like Park would have been takeout to eat at home while watching television. But there are more people wanting to venture out to public places to eat and drink alone and not be embarrassed or feel sad about it.""I am not married. I have the evenings all to myself. I want to relish the time, and eating what I want there and then is very satisfying,"" Park said. ""If I had my way, every restaurant would have seating arrangements to accommodate people coming to eat alone.""  Shin Min-young, 29, works for an online shopping mall. She is practically on the phone all day, dealing with customers heavy with complaints. ""By the time I get off work, I have had more than my share of human interaction,"" she said. ""I need pampering. I need alone time. And I get it by treating myself to good food at a cozy restaurant from time to time.""Shin admits she is bolder than most women her age, eating at a restaurant without any companion. But there is definitely a change in perception about being and doing things alone.  Daumsoft, a data mining firm, and Innocean Worldwide, an advertising agency, put out separate reports in December last year that reflected a shift in how people view aloneness. Daumsoft counted more than 15,400 mentions in 2015 about eating and drinking alone, seven times the volume of the preceding year. Words associated with the mentions ranged from ""enjoy"" and ""tasty"" to ""awesome."" Analysis from 2011-2013 for similar mentions got reactions like ""afraid,"" ""don't like"" or ""hungry."" In the Innocean Worldwide report that analyzed the singles' consumption trend in 2015, 69 percent of office workers were highly receptive to being alone and doing things alone. Like in Daumsoft's report, words associated with ""alone"" were mostly positive -- ""tasty,"" ""enjoy,"" ""happy"" and ""healing.""Solos already have created a market. Convenience stores have increased menu options for boxed meals whose sales are now in the top rankings, outdoing alcoholic beverages that used to be the unshakable No. 1 seller. Records from Seven Eleven showed sales of boxed meals rose 90.2 percent in 2015, compared to 51 percent the year before. At CU, sales of boxed meals and other handy foods like sandwiches accounted for 11.5 percent of total sales in the first two months of this year, reaching double digits for the first time. The CU marketing team got the message. It opened a research office in Seoul to develop a wider range of products for solo eaters. Lotte Department Store earlier this month opened at one of its Seoul branches a food corner where a customer can pick the rice, soup and side dishes of his or her choice and box it. For those who want to eat in, the store has a bar nearby.    For single drinkers, retail superchain Home Plus sells select wines and traditional Korean alcoholic beverages in pouches. When they were packaged in assortments as a gift set for the Lunar New Year this year, they hit as high as 90,000 in single day sales. Lotte Chilsung Beverage Co. has been selling wine in smaller bottles, holding about two glasses, since summer last year. Complementing snacks, including cheese, are also easily found in smaller portions at supermarkets.It's no longer news that the number of one-person households is rising fast in South Korea. According to Statistics Korea and the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, there were 5.07 million such households in 2015, accounting for 27.1 percent of the total. Fifteen years ago, the percentage was 15.5 percent. Fifteen years from now, it is projected at 32.7 percent. As they grow in number, more voluntary soloists are bound to snap out of takeout and opt for mortar-and-brick restaurants.The restaurant choices for solo diners are widening, from what mostly were noodle-based or one-bowl gulp-and-go types to sit-and-savor places.One of the online jokes among lone diners is the level of bravery that roughly breaks down to nine tiers, higher the number, the harder to do it alone. The epitome of bravery is drinking alone or going to a barbecue restaurant alone. ""I have found places where I can go by myself to enjoy a glass of wine or a bottle of beer with hardly any discomfort,"" Shin said. ""The real challenge is going to a barbecue place and cooking the meat at a table that seats four people minimum.""Fret no more. ""Betjang,"" a small barbecue restaurant in western Seoul, gives you a mini grill, set up at your very seat, at a bar that takes up most of the restaurant space.       ""Older people may not feel so comfortable eating at restaurants alone,"" said Park.  They are so used to 'group culture,' having to fit into a mold and not acting differently or out of the group. But group culture is nothing but social pressure. I have friends. I go on dates. It's that sometimes, I choose to be alone. That doesn't make me a misfit or a loser.""","lone diners step out ,his fifth year working ,has his office routine ,occasionally heads to restaurants ,lone diners step",['Seoul'],4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32262951  0.64175367

Ahn's People's Party controls only 19 seats, one seat shy of forming a parliamentary negotiation bloc.The bill grants lawmakers the right to challenge executive enactments, such as the government's enforcement ordinance, and allows more assembly power in reviewing and modifying government legislation.The latest polls show that it will be difficult for the Saenuri Party to obtain 180 seats but it will keep its majority in the unicameral parliament.""The Saenuri Party was earlier expected to grab more than 180 seats but everything changed due to an internal feud over the nomination process,"" said Kim Choon-seok of Hankook Research.The main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea, meanwhile, is trying to reform itself by excluding scores of incumbent lawmakers deemed incompetent from being nominated for candidacy.The opposition party unveiled a list of applicants who had been screened in its so-called cutoff. The list includes high-profile lawmakers.The minor opposition People's Party, however, is still mired in an internal feud over a possible merger with the main opposition Minjoo Party ahead of the elections.Rep. Kim Han-gil, the head of the party's election planning committee, resigned from his post after he failed to persuade the party's co-chairman Ahn Cheol-soo to join forces with the Minjoo Party to win more seats in the upcoming polls.""The rival parties are still only interested in nominations when the general election is just 30 days away,"" said Lee Nae-young, a professor at Korea University, urging the parties to focus more on policy and issues related to the sluggish economy.Three potential presidential hopefuls-- Kim Moo-sung, Moon Jae-in of the Minjoo Party and Ahn -- are heating up the campaign to prove their appeal to voters.By law, Park is barred from seeking reelection after her single five-year term ends in early 2018.A poll released Friday showed 16 percent of people supported Moon in a potential presidential race, followed by Kim who received 11 percent of support. Ahn is trailing behind, receiving 10 percent of support in the poll. Political analysts forecast that Kim will mostly likely be nominated for his electorate but he still has a lot to prove to his party members due to the ongoing feud between the factions.Moon, who stepped down his chairman post earlier this year due to the strife, has not announced yet he will run for the election.Some political analysts believe that he may run for electorates usually favorable to the ruling party since a victory in the tough district may possibly put him on a direct path to declare his candidacy for president. Ahn, who has many supporters in the 20-40 age brackets, also has to focus on winning in his electoral district of Nowon in northern Seoul, where he will be running against Lee Jun-seok, a 31-year-old entrepreneur from the Saenuri Party.As presidential hopefuls prepare to drum up support in the run-up to the crucial political test, some districts have been highlighted as a battle for a bigger showdown. Oh Se-hoon, who stepped down from Seoul mayor in 2011, faces off against former veteran lawmaker Park Jin in the Jongno district in central Seoul. Another big match is expected in the Suseong district in the central city of Daegu, where former Gyeonggi Gov. Kim Moon-su, also considered a potential presidential contender from the conservative bloc, is campaigning against former lawmaker Kim Boo-kyum.","the presidential vote next ,candidates for tough battle ,presidential vote next ,battle the april 13 ,presidential vote next year",['Saenuri Party'],4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.69516188  0.39790365

The ruling Saenuri Party and main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea have rolled out series of election manifestos targeting voters over 60 years old -- a group projected to emerge as the most influential electorate due to its high demographic volume and turnout rate. According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, the number of voters over 60 in the upcoming elections is close to 9.75 million, the biggest number of all age groups. Their turnout rate for the previous 2012 general elections was almost 70 percent, the highest among voters categorized by age.“We need an election manifesto tailored to the era in which people can live to 100 years old,” said Rep. Kim Jung-hoon, who chairs the Saenuri Party’s policy committee, on Friday. “We believe that the older generation deserves better life after retirement because they play a crucial role in modern times,” said Kim. The Saenuri Party’s leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung shakes hands with older voters at a local senior center. Yonhap.The party’s top policymaker vowed to create a new state agency to manage welfare policies for senior citizens. The new organization is expected to spearhead the efforts scattered across various government organizations, the party said. The conservative party also promised to deliver more jobs and housing to the older generation, establish more senior centers across the nation, expand efforts to take care of senior citizens living alone and reduce the burden of medical bills. The main opposition pledged to broaden the scope of senior citizens who can receive national pension, by overhauling the government’s “basic pension” system -- one of the President Park Geun-hye’s key manifestos during the 2012 election campaign. “We cannot address the deepening poverty among the older generation by giving them 200,000 won per month” said the Minjoo Party’s interim leader Kim Chong-in on Wednesday, referring to the government welfare system that he believes is inadequate in addressing the issue. Kim, who had initially engineered the government scheme while working for the President Park’s election campaign in 2002, suggested that the monthly allowance should be increased to 300,000 by 2018 and paid to all citizens aged 65 and over, regardless of their income. The interim leader also highlighted that the nation’s poverty rate among the older generation is a “record high.” According to the Statistics of Korea, South Korea’s 2014 poverty rate among the senior citizens stood at 47.4 percent, almost four times as much as the average of the OECD members.The Minjoo Party’s former leader Rep. Moon Jae-in has dinner with female volunteers at a local senior center. YonhapSome critics attacked the liberal party for lacking details on how they would pay for the initiative, and said the government cannot afford to fund the expanded pension system in a rapidly aging society with low fertility rate. “It could be a disaster for the future generations,” said Yoon Suk-myung, a senior researcher at Korea Institute for Health and Social affair, in a media interview. “Given the speed at which the nation is becoming an aging society, even the current system is unsustainable,” said Yoon. Mindful of the criticism, the interim leader highlighted that the scheme would serve as a “growth engine” for the nation’s flagging economy by increasing the older generation’s purchasing power, and noted that it had secured the money need to fund the commitment. The liberal party noted that it would fund the project -- estimated to cost 18.7 trillion won of taxpayers’ money every year -- by levying more taxes on those with high-income.

The series was published last July.Each volume is 100 pages long and in a question-and-answer format.The volume on the North Korean military states that the country's ""byeongjin"" policy, adopted in 2013 to seek concurrent development of economy and nuclear arms, will never be altered.""The byeongjin policy is a strategic line designed to bolster the country's defensive capabilities with nuclear power and to help build a strong, prosperous socialist state, through economic construction,"" the book states. ""It's not a temporary countermeasure against fast-changing situations. We must stay on this strategic line permanently.""The book also paid tribute to the North's late founder, Kim Il-sung, for his policy of pushing for economic construction and national defense, and to Kim's son, late Kim Jong-il, for his ""songun,"" or military-first policy. It said the byeongjin line is an extension of these two earlier policies.Cheong noted that the publication of these volumes indicates that the regime under young leader Kim Jong-un, son of Kim Jong-il, has achieved at least some degree of stability with a clear policy direction.""The books show that North Korea, despite facing international sanctions, is unlikely to abandon its nuclear weapons,"" Cheong added.The series also discusses changes in North Korea since Kim Jong-un assumed power in 2011, including a rise in exports of clothing and marine products to China.The series claims that South Korea started the 1950-1953 Korean War and that the Central Intelligence Agency  was the mastermind behind the military coup on May 16, 1961.It criticized the U.S. economic sanctions on North Korea as ""a crime against humanity "" that hinders a sovereign state's right to develop and interferes with the people's enjoyment of human rights.","books showed sunday yonhap ,last july each volume ,the 10 volume series ,showed sunday yonhap news ,promotional books showed sunday","['North Korea', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'north korean', 'Cheong Seong - chang', 'Seoul']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.627868    0.58277845

Washington has repeatedly stressed that the system is purely defensive and aimed only at deterring North Korean threats.Ending the dilemma was North Korea's nuclear and missile tests in January and February. Immediately after the North's Feb. 7 long-range rocket launch, South Korea and the U.S. decided tolaunch official talks about THAAD deployment.","barack obama nominated scaparrotti ,friday president barack obama ,president barack obama nominated ,carter announced friday president ,obama nominated scaparrotti","['WASHINGTON', 'Yonhap', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'Curtis Scaparrotti', 'NATO', 'Defense', 'Ash Carter', 'Barack Obama', 'Scaparrotti', 'Philip Breedlove', 'NATO', 'NATO', 'Carter', 'NATO', 'Scaparrotti']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36223     0.49077213

The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles on the candidate agendas, election trends and notable runners leading up to the race. This is the fifth installment. -- EdAs evident from self-scorning buzzwords such a “hell Joseon,” the ever-widening social polarization has led to aggravating public discontent, posing a major challenge to political parties ahead of the April general elections.Their respective response has been different, depending on their stake.The ruling conservative Saenuri Party claims that such a social gap can be reduced only by promoting growth and creating new jobs. The Minjoo Party of Korea, on the other hand, underlined the importance of fair opportunities, blaming the Park Geun-hye government for unfair distribution of wealth and benefits. The Minjoo Party of Korea's interim leader Kim Jong-in  and the ruling Saenuri Party's policy committee chairman Kim Jung-hoon speak at their respective party meeting on Wednesday. Yonhap“The party’s No. 1 election campaign is the creation of new jobs,” said the Saenuri‘s policy committee chief Rep. Kim Jung-hoon last week, upon announcing the party’s election pledges.The president, too, has repeatedly called for a set of legislations to boost the employment rate.“We are all well aware that when the economy has met a growth limit, the answer is to turn attention to new industries which may create hundreds of thousands of new jobs for our youths,” Park said Tuesday in a meeting with service industry officials.She thus added pressure on the National Assembly to pass a series of pending bills on economic revitalization and labor reforms, which the opposition circles saw as infringing on workers’ rights and favoring employers’ interest.Cheong Wa Dae and Saenuri had every reason to put employment at the top of its economic agenda.The nation’s general employment rate, which the Park administration pledged to pull up to the 70 percent mark, stood in the mid-60 percent range over the past three years. Such underachievement was a key example of “economic maladministration” asserted by the opposition camp.While the presidential office and ruling party struggled to pursue their employment vision, the Minjoo Party countered that a blind pursuit of growth cannot be a universal solution to economic polarization.“Our goal is to build a virtuous circle so that the excessive profits of conglomerates may be distributed evenly to smaller firms and to households,” said the party’s election policy chief Lee Yong-sup last week.His plans included the establishment of a presidential committee to solve inequality, the gradual increase of minimum wages and strengthened regulations on conglomerates.Also, the party’s interim leader Kim Chong-in, who formerly served as the president’s economic advisor, has been focusing on pointing out the government’s economic underachievements.“The point of the April 13 elections will be to judge the economic failure of the Saenuri administration over the past eight years,” Kim said Wednesday at a party meeting.”The president, who is short of a proper understanding on economic circumstances, is continuing to mislead the people.“Kim, who drafted the idea of economic democratization back in 2012, also stressed that the key task for the South Korean economy is to create a fair distribution system, criticizing the Saenuri’s quantitative growth initiative.By Bae Hyun-jung","election 2016 inequality climbs ,election agenda south korea ,inequality climbs up election ,candidate agendas election trends ,climbs up election agenda","['South Korea', 'National Assembly', 'the Korea Herald', 'Joseon']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60913438  0.51523787

In stark contrast, people over 50 reached 2,284, or more than half of the local population. Yanggam village highlights challenges South Korea has been grappling with for years: an exodus of young people from the countryside coupled with a declining number of babies being born.""The biggest problem behind the declining population in rural areas is low fertility,"" said Kim Hee-dong, who has served as a deputy principal of Choungryong Elementary School in Osan. Kim's school saw only four students graduate last month. Kim was actually transferred to another school due to lack of students.The number of primary school students in South Korea came to more than 2.71 million in 2015, down from the peak of more than 5.8 million in 1971, according to statistics of the Education Ministry posted on its website.Sachang Primary School is a case in point. In 1973, a total of 111 students graduated from the school. That was the highest number of graduates since the school was established in 1940s.Fast forward to 2016.On Feb. 18, only six students received graduation certificates at the small auditorium attended by little over 30 junior students as well as some parents and local residents.Kim Eun-seo, one of the six students, said she was satisfied with the small number of classmates as they became closer as friends and there was no bullying.Still, Kim Tae-soon, who graduated from the primary school in 1968 along with more than 80 peers, said he feels a sense of loneliness when he visits his alma mater.""When I was a student, my fellow classmates played in the schoolyard, but now there are few children,"" the 61-year-old member of the school steering committee said after attending the commencement ceremony.The schoolyard was deserted. No passersby would think the ceremony even took place if a bright pink placard had not been hung at the school's entrance to greet visitors coming to the event.Lee Byoung-chil, the principal of the primary school, said in order to breathe new life into the school, he created an orchestra for students in 2014. He said the orchestra helped foster character education and had the added bonus of attracting students.The educator said forming an orchestra was a particular challenge in a school where almost all the students have neither heard the names of musical instruments nor read musical notes.He said a cultural foundation in Hwaseong provided a conductor and other music professionals to the school under an incubator program meant to support cultural education to children in rural areas.Lee's efforts seem to be paying off.All students at the school can play the violin, the cello as well as other instruments.""At first, I thought I could not play the clarinet as I could not read music, but it was a rewarding experience that I am good at playing it now,"" said Won Gyu-ri, another of the six graduates. ""We practiced a lot so we could harmonize.""The commencement ceremony ended as the students, including the six graduates, were playing Variations on Pachelbel's Canon, Beethoven Symphony No. 5 and Shostakovich waltz No. 2 as well other popular pieces.""When I first heard the student's version of Pachelbel's Canon, I thought they had no hope,"" said Kim Jun-ho, an Italian-educated conductor who has been in charge of the school orchestra since last year.""Now, I am very happy and the students are really cool.""Lee's emphasis on the school orchestra has proven to be effective in attracting students from nearby cities.Recently, 14 students have transferred to Sachang Primary School for the March semester, mostly driven by the free-of-charge music program.Still, five senior students left Lee's school and were transferred to another school in a nearby city where they can attend cram schools as their parents want their children to focus on their studies, not music.Lee said attracting students from other areas is a way to keep his school afloat.""What scares me the most is students opting to transfer out of my school,"" the principal said.

Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland. The council's latest session opened on Feb. 29 and will end on March 24.The council has adopted a resolution, handed in by the EU and Japan, in March each year to call international attention to the North's human rights situations. This year's draft resolution has drawn particular international attention as it followed on the heels of a U.N. Security Council's sanctions resolution that aims to punish the North for its recent nuclear weapons and long-range rocket tests.The sources said that related countries including South Korea would review the resolution around next Monday when Marzuki Darusman, U.N. special rapporteur on the North Korean human rights situation, is to deliver an official report on the reclusive state.The resolution is expected to be adopted near the end of the 13th session of the council -- on March 23 or 24.An official said that this year's resolution could entail new contents potentially including the situations surrounding North Koreans working overseas under poor conditions. More than 500,000 North Koreans are thought to work aboard mostly in China and Russia, earning around $200 million per year.The insider also noted that the issue of holding perpetrators in the North Korean regime responsible for rights abuses could be dealt with in the resolution.Apart from the council's resolution, the U.N. General Assembly has also adopted a resolution on the North's human rights each year. The Assembly's resolution, adopted in 2013 and the following year, called for referring the North Korean case to the International Criminal Court.","submission later this month ,government sources said tuesday ,next week before tabling ,tuesday in the latest ,recently drawn up draft","['the European Union', 'Japan', ""North Korea 's"", 'U.N.', 'the U.N.

The decision comes after a string of incidents that have dented the standing of the country’s most prestigious higher educational institution. Last year, some renowned professors at the mathematical sciences department, dentistry and business schools were sacked after being found to have molested female students for years. Early this year, a teaching assistant at the education college was expelled for having clandestinely taken pictures of female students’ bodies.

Bernie Sanders won Saturday in Nebraska and Kansas in the Democratic race, while front-runner Hillary Clinton took Louisiana, another divided verdict from the American people.Cruz, a Texas senator, claimed Kansas and Maine, and declared it ""a manifestation of a real shift in momentum."" Vermont Senator and Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Bernie Sanders speaks at a news conference in Cleveland, Ohio March 5, 2016. REUTERS-YonhapTrump, still the front-runner in the hunt for delegates, took Louisiana and Kentucky.In the overall race for Republican delegates, Trump led with at least 375 and Cruz had at least 291. Rubio had 123 delegates and Kasich had 33. It takes 1,237 delegates to win the Republican nomination for president.Clinton had at least 1,117 delegates to Sanders' 477, including superdelegates -- members of Congress, governors and party officials who can support the candidate of their choice. It takes 2,383 delegates to win the Democratic nomination. There were 109 at stake on Saturday.Cruz, a favorite of the ultraconservative tea party movement, attributed his strong showing to conservatives coalescing behind his candidacy, calling it a ""manifestation of a real shift in momentum.""With the Republican race in chaos, establishment figures frantically are looking for any way to derail Trump, perhaps at a contested convention if no candidate can get enough delegates to lock up the nomination in advance. Party leaders -- including 2012 nominee Mitt Romney and 2008 nominee Sen. John McCain -- are fearful a Trump victory would lead to a disastrous November election, with losses up and down the Republican ticket.Trump, at a post-election news conference in West Palm Beach, Florida, declared himself primed for a head-on contest between himself and Cruz, and called for Rubio to drop out.""I would like to take on Ted one-on-one,"" he said, ticking off a list of big states where he said Cruz had no chance. ""That would be so much fun.""Despite the support of many elected officials in Kansas, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio came up short, raising serious questions about his viability in the race. Cruz suggested it was time for some Republican candidates to quit the race.In Maine, Cruz won by a comfortable margin over Trump. On the Democratic side, meanwhile, Sanders won by a solid margin in Nebraska and Kansas officials said he'd won the state caucuses, giving him seven victories so far in the nominating season. Clinton, who's been doing well with African-American voters, had an easy win in Louisiana.Clinton hoped that strong support among African-Americans in Louisiana would propel her to victory. Vermonter Sanders, trailing far behind Clinton in the delegate count, had higher hopes of making progress in Nebraska and Kansas, where the Democratic electorate is less diverse.With Republican front-runner Trump yet to win states by the margins he'll need in order to secure the nomination before the Republican convention, every one of the 155 Republican delegates at stake on Saturday was worth fighting for.It was anger that propelled many of Trump's voters to the polls. ""It's my opportunity to revolt,"" said Betty Nixon, a 60-year-old Trump voter in Olathe, Kansas. She said she liked the businessman because ""he's not bought and paid for.""Overall, Trump had prevailed in 10 of 15 contests heading into Saturday's voting. Rubio had one win in Minnesota.Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich both pinned their hopes on winner-take-all contests on March 15 in their home states.","race for president ted ,bernie sanders won saturday ,primary voting bernie sanders ,party race for president ,voting bernie sanders won","['WICHITA', 'Kansas', 'AP', 'Republican Party', 'Ted Cruz', 'Donald Trump', 'Bernie Sanders', 'Nebraska', 'Kansas', 'democratic', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Louisiana', 'american', 'Cruz', 'Texas']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.07537047  0.06221061

Security Council resolution to punish North Korea for its recent provocations in a rare bipartisan move Thursday, echoing calls for the communist state to change its behavior.  The latest resolution unanimously adopted by the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday aims to punish Pyongyang for conducting its fourth nuclear test on Jan. 6 and subsequent launch of a long-range rocket on Feb. 7. The North claims the rocket was used to place a satellite into space, but most countries view it as a test to check related missile technology.Rep. Kim Young-woo, spokesman of the ruling Saenuri Party, issued a statement in which he defined the latest international sanctions imposed on Pyongyang as an ""inevitable step to be taken in response to the North's unacceptable provocations."" ""North Korea must come to grips with the gravity of the message from the international community and immediately suspend all programs for nuclear development and weapons of mass destruction,"" he said.The main opposition Minjoo Party followed suit in praising the U.N. sanctions, saying they are a ""display of the international community's firm and unified determination to deter the North from further provocations."" ""North Korea is solely responsible for the harsh international sanctions, and therefore it should not hold grudges about them,"" said Kim Sung-soo, spokesman of the Minjoo. He voiced hope that the latest sanctions could prevent the North from further advancing its nuclear and long-range rocket development and bring about stability in the region. The Saenuri and the Minjoo have often been at odds over the extent of punitive actions that should be applied to the communist state for its series of provocations.The minor opposition People's Party also expressed its support for the comprehensive sanctions.""We urge the government to take stern actions against any moves that pose a threat to the safety of the people and stability on the Korean Peninsula. The party will join hands for such efforts,"" said Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, co-chairman of the People's Party.The latest Resolution 2270 represents the harshest sanctions the UNSC has ever imposed on the North, as it requires, among other things, mandatory inspection of all cargo going in and out of the North regardless of whether by land, sea or air. It is the fifth Security Council resolution imposing sanctions on the North. The previous resolutions were adopted after the North's first nuclear test in 2006, its second nuclear test in 2009, its long-range rocket launch in late 2012 and its third nuclear test in early 2013.","bipartisan move thursday echoing ,rare bipartisan move thursday ,bipartisan move thursday ,its fourth nuclear test ,wednesday aims to punish","[""South Korea 's"", 'the U.N.

This is the fourth installment. -- EdWhen former Samsung Electronics executive Yang Hyang-ja announced in January that she would enter politics as a candidate for the main opposition party, the ...","South Korea will elect new National Assembly members in a general election on April 13. The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles on the candidate agendas, election trends and notable runners leading up to the race. This is the fourth installment. -- EdWhen former Samsung Electronics executive Yang Hyang-ja announced in January that she would enter politics as a candidate for the main opposition party, the high-school graduate tried not to hype up her past achievements in breaking the glass ceiling.“I don’t want to say to those who want to succeed that working like me will bring them success,” said the 49-year-old mother of two children. “We must build a society in which hard work is reciprocated by appropriate rewards and success,” she said. . Yang, who became the first female executive in the nation’s biggest conglomerate in 2012, is one of the potential candidates aiming to bring diversity to the stereotypical occupation profile of the established parties -- professional politicians with academic or legal backgrounds.“It is common to see that lawmakers coming from certain professions represent their interests. So it is fair to say that the more diverse the National Assembly becomes, the better it can represent diverse groups’ interest,” said Kim Min-jeon, a political science professor at Kyung Hee University The National Election Committee’s data shows that out of 300 lawmakers elected in previous 2012 general election, some 70 percent were those that have been making a trade of politics, followed by 8 percent of those with academic background and about 6 percent of those with legal career. A similar trend is expected to unfold in the upcoming elections. The election watchdog statistics showed last week that among 1,460 potential candidates, some 36 percent were professional politicians, followed by 9 percent and 8 percent of those with legal and academic background, respectively.The mainstream parties’ incumbents are also heavily lopsided toward members with legal expertise.Aside from professional politicians, former legal professionals are the most common occupations held by the members of the ruling Saenuri Party and the second most common jobs in the main opposition. The lawyers constituted 15 and 20 percent of the ruling and opposition party, respectively. “Our party’s chronic problem is that we have so many members with legal backgrounds,” said Rep. Lee No-keun of the Saenuri Party. “I am afraid that it would undermine the party’s efforts to achieve diversity and keep up with changes,” he said.Favored occupation has also varied slightly among the mainstream parties. While lawyers have been dubbed the most desirable professionals to join the conservative parties, liberal blocs have had their own favorite: civil activists who led the pro-democracy movements. The National Assembly saw a massive inflow of pro-democracy activists since 1992 when Korea held its general election after toppling the authoritarian government. The trend reached its peak in 2004 when the late President Roh Moo-hyun was in power. The number of activists who took the seats surged to 70, about seven times as many as those elected in previous elections.Yang Hyang-ja One of the most common ways to improve diversity is the proportional representative system. In the 2012 elections, 52 were elected through proportional representation and their job profile ranged from poet to naturalized immigrant.But those with unique backgrounds have struggled to join mainstream politics, mainly because they are first-termers with little say in legislative affairs. The main parties’ regulations mandate that proportional representation seats should only be given to those who have never been elected as a way of providing opportunity to fresh faces.Some of them, like Rep. Lee Jasmine of the Saenuri Party has constantly faced hurdles of racial and cultural discrimination in Korean politics and society which remains largely exclusive.Her legislative efforts, such as making laws to protect the education of illegal immigrants’ children have been ostracized by conservatives as an “attempt to help lawbreakers,” with some not hesitating to use insulting slurs against the minority politician.The parties’ dubious selection process of the proportional representatives have also shed light on the negative aspect of the decades-old system. In the 2008 election, a 30-year-old lawmaker elected through proportional representation lost her seat after being convicted of giving money to then fifth-term lawmaker Seo Chung-won. “One of the system’s biggest problems is that it fails to bring diversity. When it comes to choosing the candidates, the parties consider political calculations and factional interest, not the expertise the potential lawmakers could bring,” said Hyun Taek-soo, sociology professor at Korea University.Aware of the challenges, the political parties have been moving to compensate the shortfall with separate recruiting efforts to expand their political spectrum. The Saenuri Party and the Minjoo Party of Korea have lately competed to announce new faces with unique backgrounds. The Minjoo Party, for instance, recruited political aspirants whose job profile does not traditionally fit with the liberal party. Aside from former Samsung executive Yang, they brought in video company Webzen chairman Kim Byung-kwan and Hanwha Investment & Securities CEO Chu Jin-hyung. Its recruitment of current interim leader Kim Jong-in, a conservative economist and former campaign strategist for President Park Geun-hye, has also been perceived as the party’s fresh attempt to highlight economy, although the decision was also criticized both in and outside of the party for running counter to its liberal identity.The Saenuri Party is also trying to recruit high-profile figures to join the race to spruce up its image, although their efforts so far have been mediocre in the face of escalating in-house power struggles over nomination. They include 9-dan professional Go player Cho Hun-hyun, climber Um Hong-gil, and former labor union chief of Ssangyong Motor Kim Kyu-han. All three have reportedly turned the offer down.“I understand it won’t be easy, but the parties should have a system to train high-profile figures and teach them about politics. Those who are good at their jobs are not necessarily good at politics,” said Yoon Tae-gon, a senior political analyst at Moa Agenda Strategy.Lee Jasmine While acknowledging the outreach efforts, experts pointed out that lawyers would continue to be the most sought-after background for those who pursue political career due to their professional expertise and job flexibility. “Above all, the Assembly is the place where people make laws. The expertise from those with legal backgrounds can be put to a great use when they gather to propose, revise and enact the bills,” the Minjoo Party’s former lawmaker Choe Jae-chun wrote in an op-ed. Professor Kim Min-jeon noted that the widespread job transition from a legal professional to politician also reflects the reality of the Korean politics.“In South Korea, it is hard for politicians to return to their jobs if they lose elections. Since lawyers are relatively less worried about losing their livelihood, they are more likely to take the risk and enter politics than other professionals,” said Kim.By Yeo Jun-suk","candidate agendas election trends ,election rosters south korea ,election 2016 parties try ,the candidate agendas election ,she would enter politics","['South Korea', 'National Assembly', 'the Korea Herald', 'Samsung Electronics', 'Yang Hyang -']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4497945   0.20046912

Filibusterers, many of them within the hawkish wing of The Minjoo Party of Korea, urged the party’s whip Rep. Lee Jong-kul to rethink his decision to halt the marathon speech against counterterrorism bills they believe have gained popularity among liberal voters and moderates. “Though we started the filibuster, it is not up to us ,” Rep. Eun soo-mi said on her Twitter account. The first-term lawmaker had set the record for the longest-ever address in the National Assembly before fellow member Rep. Jung Chung-rae broke it. Rep. Kim Kwang-jin, who was the first debater for the filibuster that began on Feb. 23, also asked, “What are we supposed to tell the people now, after spending 150 hours describing how the bill poses problems?”The opposition’s dilemma over the filibuster was expected. While it consolidated its supporters and received praise for offering an encouraging alternative from confrontational policies, it also failed to dramatically spike support ratings, especially with pressure building to pass urgent bills such as for the new electoral map.Late Monday night, the party’s interim leader Kim Jong-in reportedly tried to persuade Lee Jong-kul for hours that the suspension of the filibuster is the way to go to prevent it from backfiring into an ideological fight, inviting blame for causing further election delays. Lee was the first to propose and push the filibuster as a way to block the majority ruling party from endorsing the controversial bills designed to give stronger surveillance power to the National Intelligence Service and fortify preventive measures against terrorist attacks.Lee consequently planned a press conference at 9 a.m. on Tuesday to declare the end of the filibuster, though it was delayed at the last minute.The party planned a general assembly later in the evening to further discuss their options.“We delayed the  in order to hear from the members who oppose the decision ... the decision to suspend it will not be overturned,” said chief deputy floor leader Rep. Lee Choon-suak.The ruling Saenuri Party, meanwhile, welcomed the decision, perceived as a triumph for the party in the drawn-out tug-of-war over the controversial counterterrorism bills.“While it is extremely regretful when we think about the hours wasted at the National Assembly through the filibuster, it is a relief that the Minjoo Party came to such decision,” said Saenuri’s chief spokesman Rep. Kim Young-woo.Saenuri floor leader Rep. Won Yoo-chul reiterated that no changes will be made to the counterterrorism bills that the opposition claims will seriously damage civil rights.“After the opposition’s filibuster is suspended, we will be voting on the antiterrorism bills tomorrow. ... There will be no further revision to the bills as we have reflected the demands from them over the past three months.” By Yeo Jun-suk","tuesday sparked intense pushback ,breaking filibuster tuesday sparked ,filibuster tuesday sparked intense ,breaking filibuster tuesday ,pushback from the party","['the National Assembly', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Lee Jo']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3362242   0.37163216

It was initially expected to be adopted Saturday, before Russia requested more time to study the resolution interdepartmentally. The draft resolution on North Korea includes a binding comprehensive arms embargo and freezing assets of any state or ruling party-related organizations involved in banned activities, and also suggests sanctions on all supplies of jet and rocket fuel. All U.N. member states will be mandated to conduct inspections on all shipments passing through their waters to or from North Korea to search for illicit items, and North Korean banks would be blocked from opening branches abroad or hosting offices in U.N. member states‘ financial institutions.Mineral exports by the North would be banned, except for “livelihood purposes.” China -- whose nod last week gave a boost to talks for sanctions -- said that the sanctions should not affect the livelihoods of North Koreans, as did Russia. Russia’s TASS news agency, citing the country‘s deputy permanent representative to the U.N. Pyotr Ilyichev, reported that delegations from Moscow will be ready to vote this week. The diplomat also said that Moscow has announced its agreement to an “adequate” resolution in response to Pyongyang’s recent nuclear test and long-range rocket launch. Some local observers have raised the possibility that Russia may be stalling the talks to reaffirm its global influence, taking issue with the U.S. and China seemingly leading the sanctions against the communist country.But government sources have said that they expect Russia will ultimately join the sanctions, adding that it will reflect a “resolute will by 15 members of the Security Council to punish the North.”U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power called the sanctions the “strongest imposed by the Security Council in more than two decades,” while South Korean officials have called it the “strongest nonmilitary sanctions ever” by the U.N.South Korea‘s Foreign Affairs Ministry said Sunday the finance ministers of Seoul and Washington met during the Group of 20 finance ministers meeting in Shanghai, China and agreed to boost bilateral cooperation on sanctions against North Korea. Chief six-party talks negotiators Hwang Joon-kook of South Korea  and Wu Dawei of China meet for their meeting in Seoul on Sunday. China’s top nuclear negotiator Wu Dawei visited South Korea on Sunday to discuss the countries’ responses to recent actions by North Korea. He met his South Korean counterpart Hwang Joon-kook later in the day, and was to hold a dialogue with Seoul‘s Foreign Minister Yun Byung-seo the next day.“I believe we  can discuss any kind of issue upon mutual respect,” Wu said upon entering the country. Hwang said he thought highly of China’s role during the process of negotiating for the U.N. resolution, and hoped that the two countries would continue “strategic communication” related to North Korea and its nuclear program.South Korean President Park Geun-hye has taken a hard-line approach toward North Korea, which has included a mention of the collapse of Kim Jong-un’s regime, while Beijing has called for holding peace treaty discussions in tandem with the North’s denuclearization talks.During the visit, Wu is also expected to discuss the possible deployment of the U.S.’ Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile system here against Pyongyang’s threats, which Beijing has openly opposed.

Regarding the economic sector, the president remains optimistic.“The global economic downturn and the recent military provocations from North Korea have posed challenges to our domestic market and national security,” Park said at a state seminar on Tuesday.“It is especially in these difficult situations that we should place focus on revitalizing the economy and creating jobs for the people.”But key economic indicators have been sending out warning signals during her time in office.South Korea’s total household debt hit a record of 1,207 trillion won  as of the end of last year, up 11.2 percent from the previous year, the central Bank of Korea showed Thursday.This obviously ran against Park’s election pledges back in 2012, when she had promised to “reduce household debt and revive ordinary people’s happiness.”The administration has also seen a steady rise in state debts, which soared to 595 trillion won as of the end of last year compared to 425 trillion back in 2012.This increased financial burden was mostly due to the extra budget allocation used in responding to the Sewol ferry sinking in 2014 and the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2015.The labor sector has also performed below expectations.One of the key policy slogans fielded by the Park government was to revamp the nation’s economic structure and to create jobs. It aimed to pull up the general employment rate to the 70 percent mark.Amid a sluggish global economy and increasing external threats, the youth unemployment rate here peaked at 9.2 percent last year, according to the Ministry of Employment and Labor.Cheong Wa Dae and the ruling Saenuri Party repeatedly claim that such circumstances are part of the reason why the pending labor reform bills should be approved. The opposition parties, however, say the government’s plan only focuses on boosting the number of jobs instead of improving the quality of the labor market.One positive aspect was that global credit rating agency Moody’s adjusted South Korea’s sovereign credit rating from “Aa3” to “Aa2” last December -- the highest-ever rate that the country has received from an international rating agency -- giving credit to the government’s structural reform efforts.By Bae Hyun-jung","third anniversary in office ,celebrates its third anniversary ,three years the park ,its third anniversary ,its third anniversary in",[],4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60438055  0.33620074

During the meeting, she also sighed and paused for about 10 seconds.In December, the government announced draft guidelines to allow companies to formally sack underperforming employees and amend employment rules more easily even without the consent of workers.Under current labor laws, companies can terminate employee contracts only when they are either involved in a corruption or an embezzlement case, or when the firm has to lay off workers due to serious financial difficulties.","2015 the highest reading ,highest reading since 1999 ,key priority president park ,in 2015 the highest ,wednesday that job creation","['Park Geun', 'South Korea', 'Park']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48755464  0.15596122

The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles on the candidate agendas, election trends and notable runners leading up to the race.

The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles on the candidate agendas, election trends and notable runners leading up to the race. This is the third installment. -- EdIn the weeks following North Korea’s long-range ballistic missile launch, national security has been on top of the agenda for all political parties here, overshadowing all other pending issues.But now, with less than two months left to the general elections, the opposition camp appears to be watering down the national security frame and focusing more on other bread-and-butter economic issues.The opposition bloc, mostly The Minjoo Party of Korea, have every reason to do so as the North’s repeated military provocations and growing tensions in the Korean Peninsula have given the conservatives an edge.According to a survey conducted by local pollster Realmeter on Monday, the ruling Saenuri Party’s approval rating stood at 41.7 percent last week, up 2 percentage points from the previous week. That of President Park Geun-hye, too, rose by 3.7 percentage points to 45.9 percent, data showed.“The national security situation has pushed conservative supporters to gain influence in the face of a potential crisis,” the pollster said in an analysis. The Minjoo Party of Korea’s leader Kim Jong-in  and floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul  survey the readiness posture near the border in Paju, Gyeonggi Province, on Feb. 9.YonhapTraditionally, the pacifist approach of the opposition camp during security crises -- that prioritizes peace and dialogue before pressure and sanctions -- has not worked in their favor, especially in times of major elections.Back in December 2012, with only a week remaining for the 18th presidential election, North Korea launched a long-range rocket, which heightened tension and drew voters to the Saenuri camp.The opposition’s counterclaim that the rival is using the cross-border tension politically has failed to persuade the majority of conservatives and centrists, instead turning into a worn-out ideological dispute before fizzling out.Apparently having learnt its lesson, the opposition party appears this time to be acting quickly to shift its policy focus away from security agenda to economic issues.“The forced closure of the Gaesong industrial complex will adversely affect the economy,” said floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul in a parliamentary speech last Wednesday. The floor leader’s speech is usually considered an outline of the party’s policies.“ should refrain from expanding the current national security crisis into the diplomatic and economic sectors as well,” he said. The joint industrial park in the North Korean city was shut down on Feb. 10 in response to Pyongyang’s Feb. 7 long-range rocket launch.Rep. Lee spent most of his speech proposing the party’s economic blueprint.“For the past eight years, conservative administrations have built up a debt-dependent economic model which now needs to be drastically corrected,” he said.The party’s policy committee, too, announced a set of key election slogans the following day, focusing on fair growth and adding momentum to the economic drive.Adding to the list of reasons for the Minjoo Party to avoid highlighting the security agenda is the disputed position of some of its members, including its current leader, over North Korean affairs. “I believe that the North Korean regime will one day collapse and that the Korean Peninsula will be unified,” said the party’s interim chief Kim Jong-in during his visit to an army division days after the recent rocket launch.His comments, which clearly contradicted the party’s identity which is largely based on its former leaders’ “Sunshine Policy” and the vision for inter-Korean engagement and dialogue, triggered immediate criticism, even giving room for the rookie People’s Party to cut in.“The president, the ruling party and even some of the opposition party members speak of the collapse of the North Korean regime, but this stance is of no help to promoting national security or to building peace in the peninsula,” said party chief Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo.As speculation mounted over the Minjoo Party’s security platform, former leader Rep. Moon Jae-in attempted to water it down.“From North Korea’s nuclear and missile , to the shutdown of Gaesong industrial park, it all comes down to a complete failure of the Park Geun-hye administration’s North Korean policies … But these defeated people are showing a bold front and blaming it all on the past governments,” Moon tweeted on Feb. 19. “Now with even some of the opposition members following the trend blindly by talking about reassessing the  of the sunshine policy, it is incredibly regretful.”In response to reporters’ questions about how he viewed Kim Jong-in’s remarks that were critical of the engagement policy, Moon shrugged, saying, “People do not have to see eye-to-eye all the time.”Meanwhile, the ruling Saenuri Party continues to capitalize on the North Korean issue, using it to rekindle its national security election agenda and to criticize the opposition camp.“The Minjoo Party acted as though it would for once take a firm stance against North Korean provocations, but its move turned out to be no more than a pretense to win support ahead of elections,” said the Saenuri floor leader Rep. Won Yoo-chul.“Its way of blaming the government over the recent situation reflects its lack of awareness and capacity when it comes to national security.”By Bae Hyun-jung","2016 minjoo party dodges ,election on april 13 ,candidate agendas election trends ,election 2016 minjoo party ,april 13 the korea","['South Korea', 'National Assembly', 'the Korea Herald', 'EdIn', 'North Korea ’s']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61686516  0.32426286

Despite this, tattoos have been growing in popularity among some young people. ""I have lived as a tattoo artist for nearly a decade ... And I might have been an outlaw here,"" Lee said in his candidacy statement.Lee said years of campaigning for the legalization of the tattoo business made him pay attention to social issues. Park Il-dong, a shoeshiner, has also registered his independent candidacy for Gwangju, a small city on the outskirts of Seoul. The 50-year-old man has gained attention for his campaign pledge that he would shine the shoes of his constituents to better listen to their voices if elected.Lee and Park are among more than 1,520 people who have registered their candidacies for the parliamentary election set for April.Of them, 792 have registered as ruling Saenuri Party runners while 337 seek to run on the ticket of the main opposition Minjoo Party. The rest have registered under the banners of the People's Party, Justice Party and other splinter parties.Kim Hyun-woo, a 34-year-old non-regular worker in the auto parts industry for more than a decade, is running in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province, as an independent on the platform that he will represent workers on temporary employment contracts.The issue of non-regular workers has become a key agenda of the government and management as some companies shun recruitment and instead rely on non-regular workers, who can be let go more easily.Under last year's landmark labor deal, the tripartite committee composed of labor, management and the government agreed to push for measures to improve non-regular workers' work conditions and increase the flexibility of the labor market.The unemployment rate for those between 15 and 29 jumped to a seven-month high of 9.5 percent in January from 8.4 percent tallied in December, according to government data.Kim Doo-sup, who is running in Gimpo, just west of Seoul, stands as the oldest candidate. The 86-year-old holds a record for running in the general election 15 times since 1960. Kim's decades-long endeavor for a parliamentary seat paid off in 1992 when he was elected. But ever since, he has failed to make it to a second term.""I have in-depth experience and know-how for the development of Gimpo,"" said the former lawmaker in his pledge statement.On the other end of the spectrum, Woo Min-ji, 24, is the youngest candidate and is running in Yangsan, South Gyeongsang Province as an independent.Cho Eun-bi, a 26-year-old college student, has gained attention on the Internet for her young and stylish appearance, earning her the reputation as the best-looking candidate. She is seeking to run as a candidate of the ruling Saenuri Party.She found herself at the center of growing questions over whether she has what it takes after a video was aired in which she fumbled to answer a question on labor reform.Political analysts say that candidates with colorful and unusual backgrounds are unlikely to make it into the National Assembly against all the odds.""It will be a high challenge for them to compete with established party members who have spent years trying to cement their support base on the local level,"" said Yoon Hee-woong, a senior analyst at the political consulting firm Opinion Live.","upcoming parliamentary election lee ,artist shoeshiner join race ,the upcoming parliamentary election ,upcoming parliamentary election ,race for parliamentary seats","['Lee Rang', 'Seoul']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24412315  0.03798999

Seoul’s U.N. representative Oh Joon brought up the issue at a UNSC meeting on Feb. 15, saying Pyongyang has shown “contempt and disregard for the functions and powers” of the top decision-making body through four rounds of atomic experiments and six long-range rocket firings which led to four resolutions. The point was reiterated one day later by Lee Ja-hyung, a counselor at the South Korean mission there, at a meeting of the Special Committee on the Charter of the U.N. and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization. “Twenty-five years ago, the DPRK solemnly pledged to comply with the obligations of the U.N. Charter as a new member, but during the past decade, it has persistently violated all Security Council resolutions on the DPRK,” Oh said, calling North Korea by its official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.“This is not only a direct challenge to the authority of the UNSC, but also a contradiction to both the letter and spirit of the pledge it made. This breach of obligation by the DPRK calls into question its qualification as a member of the United Nations.” South Korean Ambassador to U.N. Oh Joon In a media interview last Friday, Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se went further, saying it is “considerably noticeable that such talks are beginning to emerge,” though he cautioned against “over interpreting a claim raised by very few nations.” Though primarily intended to ratchet up pressure on Pyongyang and emphasize the need for much more powerful punishment this time given the ongoing UNSC discussions, the remarks sparked skepticism over the idea’s efficacy and use.  Any expulsion of a member state requires a recommendation of the council, which in the case of North Korea is extremely unlikely given the predicted opposition of China and Russia, the veto-wielding permanent powers and Pyongyang’s staunch backers. Even if they did agree to eject the North, it would do little, if anything, to resolve the nuclear issues, as the international community will virtually lose the means to punish the regime in future events, critics say. “Not only is it practically undoable, the idea would have no significance except to put North Korea to shame,” a senior Foreign Ministry official said, asking anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.  As controversy intensified, another senior official sought to dilute the U.N. diplomats’ comments on Monday, saying they were made in line with the context and purpose of the sessions and not aimed at calling for action. “It was not meant to urge any serious action and was born out of frustration and disappointment at the North’s persistent violations of UNSC resolutions,” the official told reporters on customary condition of anonymity. “Other countries also raised issue during the meeting with the ongoing charter breaches in similar contexts.” But others appeared more serious about the notion. Katharine Moon, the SK-Korea Foundation Chair in Korea studies at the Brookings Center for East Asia policy studies, even proposed ""throwing North Korea out of the U.N. membership"" in an op-ed published on the think tank’s website shortly before the U.N. gatherings.“Chapter II, Articles 5 and 6 of the U.N. Charter sanctions the suspension and restoration of ‘exercise of the rights and privileges of membership.’ Also, a member ‘which has persistently violated the Principles contained in the present Charter may be expelled from the Organization,’” she wrote.“Of course, this would involve a lot of controversy and politics … But the point is this: Disregarding and disrespecting club rules should have severe consequences.”The North, for its part, condemned Seoul for questioning its U.N. affiliation on propaganda website Uriminzokkiri on Monday, arguing that the South itself is disqualified to “mutter about someone else’s eligibility,” citing its dependence on the U.S. By Shin Hyon-hee","resolutions that ban nuclear ,korea last week questioned ,missile tests seoul representative ,on ending membership debate ,news focus debate heats","['South Korea', 'North Korea ’s', 'U.N.', 'Security Council', 'Seoul', 'U.N.', 'UNSC', 'Pyongyang']",4,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.03962167 0.31738368 0.34206149],KH디지털2,North Korea,2,2016,"interview last friday foreign minister ,south korea last week questioned ,media interview last friday foreign ,proposed throwing north korea out ,in media interview last friday","['South Korea', 'North Korea ’s', 'U.N.', 'Security Council', 'Seoul', 'U.N.', 'UNSC', 'Pyongyang', 'Lee Ja - hyung', 'south korean', 'the Special Committee', 'U.N.', 'Organization', 'U.N.', 'Security Council', 'North Korea', ""the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea"", 'UNSC', 'the United Nations', 'south korean', 'U.N.', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Pyongyang', 'UNSC', 'North Korea', 'China', 'Russia', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'Foreign Ministry', 'U.N.', 'North ’s', 'UNSC', 'Katharine Moon', 'Korea', 'North Korea', 'U.N.', 'U.N.', 'U.N.', 'Principles', ""the Organization , '"", 'North', 'Seoul', 'U.N.', 'Uriminzokkiri', 'U.S.', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",11,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.03962167 0.31738368 0.34206149]

The rival parties have agreed that they will finalize the rule before the Assembly plenary session Tuesday, a day before overseas Koreans start their voter registration. “If we fail to reach an agreement before Tuesday, we may have to postpone the general elections slated for April 13,” said Assembly Speaker Rep. Chung Ui-hwa on Friday. In Korea, general elections have never been postponed, although a delay was once discussed during the Syngman Rhee administration in the 1950s. The extraordinary session ends March 10. Officials stick identification hologram stickers onto ballot boxes at the election commission office in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province, Sunday. YonhapWhile the ruling Saenuri Party has raised the possibility of arranging another plenary session before the end of the month if the negotiation protracts, the election commission officials have warned that further delay could make it physically impossible to hold the election in time.Rookie politicians planning to run in the race have also been calling for a postponement as they say that the invalid electoral map and consequent delays in partisan nomination will hurt their competiveness against incumbents.While the parties have reached a broad compromise on election rules, its passage has been withheld on being sidetracked by other contentious bills related to business and security matters. This includes bills designed to boost government efforts to pursue counter-terrorism measures, overhaul labor market, relax business regulations on service industry and address North Korea’s human rights abuse.  The Minjoo Party has demanded the Assembly passes the election bill first before dealing with other pending legislations, but the Saenuri Party insists that it will not finalize the election bill unless the main opposition cooperates in passing business and security bills.Observers warned that if the 19th Assembly fails to redraw constituencies promptly, it will end up earning itself the infamous title of being the most late to finalize election rules in Korean history. Lawmakers have often been blamed for determining electoral rules at the last minute. The 18th Assembly passed the election bill 44 days before elections. The worst case was the 16th assembly which enacted the bill just 37 days prior to elections. By Yeo Jun-suk","electoral maps this week ,election rule this week ,over new electoral maps ,april 13 election date ,this week rival parties","['Saenuri Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.79543757  0.20763606

The three will be comprised of a single-justice panel, a group panel and an appeals panel.The move has been taken to reflect the growing societal concerns over violence against children, the court said.The number of child abuse cases in the country nearly doubled over the past 10 years, according to the Korea Institute of Criminology. In 2004, there were 6,998 cases of violence against children. In 2013, the number soared to 13,076 cases. Over the past decade, an average 15 cases of child abuse were reported every day.The Seoul court isn't technically the first South Korean court to create a panel dedicated to child abuse cases. In June, the Incheon District Court in Incheon, Gyeonggi Province, created a single-justice panel for child abuse trials, but it hasn't made a group panel, which handles more violent cases, or an appeals panel, like its counterpart in Seoul.Meanwhile, the National Police Agency  said Sunday they will create a special investigations unit for child abuse in a joint effort with the government to combat this nagging social problem.The unit will be housed under the division that manages violence against women and adolescents in the Public Security Bureau, the NPA said.The government and the police have said elementary and middle school-aged children who aren't enrolled in school or have been absent for an extended period of time will be checked in on regularly because these kinds of children are most vulnerable to abuse.The NPA will also add 350 more officials specializing in the investigation of domestic violence cases, including violence against children and senior citizens, and aims to have about 1,000 of them by next year.","abuse cases starting monday ,child abuse division seoul ,starting monday the three ,cases starting monday ,cases starting monday the","['Seoul', 'the Seoul Central District Court']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.12811974  0.39733261

She was 89.   A spokeswoman for Harper Collins in New York said Lee passed away peacefully late Thursday. The Pulitzer-winning author shunned the spotlight and spent her final years living in seclusion in Monroeville, Alabama, where she was born.   ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is considered one of the great classics of 20th century American literature, and is standard reading in classrooms across the world.   Published in 1960 and drawn from Lee's own experiences as a child, it came to define racial injustice in the Depression-era South.    It tells the story of a black man wrongly accused of raping a white woman and the courageous lawyer, Atticus Finch, who defies his community to defend him.   The novel sold 30 million copies and earned huge critical acclaim, winning Lee a Pulitzer prize in 1961 and thrusting her into an avalanche of publicity.   Her fame was sealed when the novel was adapted into a Hollywood film that won three Academy Awards in 1963, including an Oscar for Gregory Peck for his portrayal of Finch, one of the best-loved characters in American fiction.   Former US president George W. Bush, who awarded Lee the Presidential Medal of Freedom, America's highest civil honor in 2007, mourned the loss of ""a legendary novelist and lovely lady.""   ""Harper Lee was ahead of her time, and her masterpiece 'To Kill A Mockingbird' prodded America to catch up with her,"" he said.   ""Laura and I are grateful for Harper Lee and her matchless contributions to humanity and to the character of our country,"" he said of his wife. Harper Lee. AP-YONHAP   - Wit sharp as ever -   Harper Collins said Lee was not only a brilliant writer, but ""an extraordinary woman of great joyfulness, humility and kindness,"" who lived as she wanted -- ""in private -- surrounded by books and the people who loved her.""   In a rare insight, the novelist admitted in 1964 she had been completely caught off guard by being catapulted into the nation's consciousness by her novel.   ""I hoped for a little, but I got rather a whole lot and in some ways this was just about as frightening as the quick, merciful death I'd expected,"" she said, joking about her expectation the novel would be a critical flop.   For decades she stayed out of the public eye, claiming to have said all she wanted in ""Mockingbird"" and vowing never to publish another book.    But in 2015, she upended the literary world by publishing the unedited manuscript of ""Go Set a Watchman"" -- her first novel written in the 1950s which was essentially a first draft of ""Mockingbird.""   The manuscript was an instant popular bestseller but it was mauled by critics, and its release sparked torrid speculation that the author, who suffered a stroke in 2007, was not of sound mind.   ""When I saw her just six weeks ago, she was full of life, her mind and mischievous wit as sharp as ever,"" said Lee's agent Andrew Nurnberg on Friday. ""We have lost a great writer, a great friend and a beacon of integrity.""   Born Nelle Harper Lee in April 1926, she was the youngest of four children. Her father was a lawyer and a direct descendant of Civil War general Robert E. Lee.   Lee grew up during the Great Depression in a remote village where the few available books provided the only entertainment. She never married, and books remained forever her first love.   Known as a tomboy as a child, she counted author Truman Capote among her childhood friends -- and often stood up for him when he was picked on as a sissy. She would later work as an assistant on Capote's novel ""In Cold Blood,"" which examined a multiple killing in Kansas, and was dedicated to Lee.   - Summer backlash -   A precocious child, Lee learned to read early and had devoured all kinds of literature by the time she started school. She also showed an early flair for writing even though her family hoped she would follow her father into law.   After a spell as an exchange student at Oxford University in England, she quit law school at The University of Alabama and headed for New York in 1949 to follow her dream of being a writer.   She worked for a while as an airline reservation clerk, until one Christmas when friends gave her enough money to live for a year without working so she could concentrate on writing.   Completed before ""Mockingbird,"" the draft she released last year as ""Watchman"" tells a similar tale of small-town racism but recounted from a different perspective.   While her famous novel is told through the eyes of Finch's young daughter, Scout, ""Watchman"" is narrated from the perspective of a grown-up Scout living in New York and coming home to the South for a troubled visit.   But critics pointed to a number of troubling inconsistencies between the two -- most notably that the hero Finch is portrayed in the manuscript as a man who harbors racist opinions.   The manuscript's release sparked a furious backlash -- partly because so little was known of Lee, who lived in a nursing home with a strictly controlled visitor list and who refused any request for interviews.   She did however quietly attend annual award ceremonies held by The University of Alabama for a writing contest inspired by her work.   Her sister, Alice, who was her gatekeeper until she died two years ago aged 103, explained in 2002 why her sister never seemed to make headway with a new work.   ""I'll put it this way. When you have hit the pinnacle, how would you feel about writing more? Would you feel like you're competing with yourself?""","pulitzer winning author shunned ,died her publisher ,thursday the pulitzer winning ,author harper lee dies ,has died her publisher","['NEW YORK', 'Harper Lee', 'America', 'Harper Collins', 'New York', 'Lee', 'Pulitzer', 'Monroeville']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.73536634  0.24788769

For constituencies with stiffer competition, the screening process will take place in tandem with regional opinion polls.Related to the announcement, the party said that the overall screening process is being held up because lawmakers have yet to decide on a new electoral system, as the old one has been declared null and void.The ruling party and the opposition have been deadlocked on critical issues such as how to elect proportional representatives for the 300-seat National Assembly. Talks held Thursday again resulted in no headway being made.""Despite uncertainties, the goal is to pick candidates running for districts that may not be adjusted even if there is a change in the electoral system,"" he said.Rep. Lee Hahn-koo, who is chairing the candidate screening board, said earlier in the week that he will refrain from giving further impression that there is disagreement within the party on the how to pick candidates.Lee, who will not be running in the upcoming election, has sometimes been at odds with party leader Kim Moo-sung. The latter has insisted that the selection process should be made at the district level or the ""bottom-up process"" in accordance with party rules, while Lee has advocated greater flexibility in picking candidates.

Police officials from South Gyeongsang Province, who have been investigating the case, requested late Monday that the National Forensics Service check the body for the exact cause of death. The girl’s body was found earlier in the day, after her 42-year-old mother, surnamed Park, had confessed to tying up her then 7-year-old child and beating her to death in October 2011. Police exhumed the body in a mountain in Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province, where the woman had buried her daughter with the help of three accomplices. One of the accomplices who helped the mother bury the young girl is taken in for questioning at Goseong Police Station on Tuesday. Two of them have been arrested on the charge of helping to discard the body. The third was booked without detention. Investigators expect that determining the cause of death could take from three weeks up to a month. Police will conduct an on-the-spot inspection of the scene at the mountain where the body was buried and at the crime scene of Park’s apartment in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province.Officials will hold a briefing on the case at Goseong Police Station on Thursday.The investigators found Park in the midst of a nationwide search for the whereabouts and statuses of students who have been reported absent from school for a long time, or those who have never been admitted to school. The move was launched as part of the government’s efforts to curb child abuse amid a series of high-profile cases involving children.","autopsy of murdered girl ,run forensics service tuesday ,murdered girl the state ,forensics service tuesday ,forensics service tuesday carried","['South Gyeongsang Province', 'the National Forensics Service']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.14524779  0.51920187

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon would hold a substantial lead over South Korean politicians in the country's presidential race next year, a new poll showed Sunday, in the latest sign that he enjoys high popularity among South Koreans as a potential candidate.The poll, commissioned by Yonhap News Agency and public broadcaster KBS, found that Ban is a frontrunner with 28.3 percent of support.The former South Korean foreign minister is trailed by Moon Jae-in, a former leader of the main Minjoo Party, with 17.9 percent; Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon with 10.5 percent; Kim Moo-sung, head of the ruling Saenuri Party, with 8.6 percent; former Seoul mayor Oh Se-hoon with 7.9 percent and Ahn Cheol-soo, a co-leader of the minor opposition People's Party, with 7.8 percent.The poll is the latest indicator that Ban is the most favored potential candidate for the 2017 presidential election in his native country, though he has said repeatedly he is not interested in South Korean politics.Ban has said he wants to spend time taking care of his grandchildren after his retirement.Still, South Korea's ruling and opposition parties have a launched charm offensive toward Ban, believing that Ban could prevail in the presidential election.Ban's second five-year term at the U.N. is set to end at the end of 2016, a year before South Koreans go to the polls to elect a new president who will replace President Park Geun-hye.Park's single five-year term ends in early 2018, and by law, she cannot seek re-election.Park's job approval rating edged up slightly amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula over North Korea's recent nuclear test and a long-range rocket launch.The survey conducted by polling agency Korea Research Center showed 46 percent of participants approved of the job Park is doing, up 1.9 percentage points from the end of December.Those who disapproved of Park's job performance came to 48.7 percent, compared with 49.1 percent from the same period of last year.The survey also showed that candidates of the ruling Saenuri Party received 40.9 percent of the support for the April's parliamentary election.Candidates of the main opposition Minjoo Party trailed behind in a distant second with 23.1 percent and candidates of the minor opposition People's Party finished third with 10.6 percent.The telephone survey was conducted on 1,013 adults on Feb. 11-12 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.","korean poll for presidential ,lead in korean poll ,presidential race next year ,over south korean politicians ,poll for presidential election","['U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'south korean', 'South Koreans', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'KBS', 'Ban', 'south korean']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28258693  0.52605045

The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles on the candidate agendas, election trends and notable runners leading up to the race. This is the second installment. -- EdLee Dong-hak was 23 years old when he first got a taste of politics. He had enrolled in the then-ruling Uri Party, a precursor to The Minjoo Party of Korea, as a part-timer for a party event in 2003. Now, the 33-year-old is running in the April election as the main opposition party’s candidate to compete against the liberal heavyweight Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo in Nowon-gu, Seoul.“I want to add diversity to the politics dominated by the older generation,” Lee told The Korea Herald. He served on the party’s reform committee in recent years.“Even though there are many decisions being made that could impact the younger generation in the future, young people don’t have enough say in the process. I want to create a table where different generation sit down together and make political decision collectively,” he said. Lee and 11 other preliminary candidates for the Minjoo Party in their 20s and 30s announced their bid to run on Feb. 3. Young preliminary candidates of The Minjoo Party of Korea including Lee Dong-hak  hold a press conference announcing their bids at the National Assembly on Feb. 3. Lee is one of the younger candidates seeking to reverse Korea’s political climate, where young voters have remained indifferent to politics, frustrated by the old establishment’s failure to address their agenda post-election.According to statistics from the National Election Commission, the number of candidates in their 20s and 30s has been decreasing since reaching its peak of 206 in the 1996 elections. The 2004, 2008 and 2012 elections saw 160, 148 and 33 young candidates, respectively. The same is true for the number of young voters. The election watchdog’s data showed that the turnout among those in their 20s at the 2004 and 2008 elections were about 45 and 28 percent, respectively. The 2012 elections’ turnout was 40 percent, the lowest in all age groups. “It creates a vicious circle of political indifference among young people,” said Lee Nae-young, professor of comparative politics at Korea University. “As Korea’s aging society and older generation dominates politics, young people feel less likely to engage in the politics and cast their ballots,” he said. Rise and fall of activists-turned-politicians There was a time when the legislative branch was significantly populated with fresh-faced lawmakers. The 2004 general election saw a total of 187 first-termers in the 299-strong National Assembly. Of them, 129 were in their 30s and 40s and only 49 lawmakers were in their 60s or older. Most of those young lawmakers had built their reputations after spearheading college students’ democratic movements in the 1980s. However, as these activists-turned-politicians lost touch with average voters, the younger lawmakers did not constitute a new mainstream in politics. For instance, among the 108 first-term lawmakers with the progressive Uri Party, 73 lost their seats in the 2008 election.“Values coming from the student-led democratic campaigns of the past are less likely to resonate with young voters. Since the current generation didn’t go through that movement, they have become indifferent to the ideological agenda,” Lee said. The lack of youth participation in politics and decision-making has long been a common problem.“No one is born a good citizen, no nation is born a democracy. Rather, both are processes that continue to evolve over a lifetime. Young people must be included from birth. A society that cuts itself off from its youth severs its lifeline,” Kofi Annan, former U.N. secretary-general, had said.In the 2013 U.N. Development Program Report, it points out that young people between the ages of 15 and 25 constitute a fifth of the world’s population, and yet, while they are often involved in informal political processes, they are not formally represented in national political institutions, thereby hurting the quality of democratic governance.The report suggests considering youth as agents of change instead of a problem to be resolved by others. It also recommends that the young should not considered a homogenous block but should be viewed based on their social aspects, such as gender and background. Political participation of young people should extend across the electoral cycle such as by consistently developing young candidates’ capacity beyond the one-off election event, it said.Opening doors for the youthSouth Korea’s major parties have also been taking steps to galvanize young voters and political aspirants.The ruling Saenuri Party decided to give extra points to the young candidates when the party select candidates for the election. The candidates must be under the age of 45 and have no record of having run in past elections.The conservative party had brought in young politicians to put them in charge of reforming the party and competing against liberal heavyweights in key constituencies. Political rookie Son Su-jo, then 27, ran against former presidential candidate Rep. Moon Jae-in in the 2012 general election in Busan. Although her challenge failed, the relatively close race was considered a blow to the political heavyweight.The Saenuri Party’s Lee Jun-seok, 31, will also be going up against Lee Dong-hak and Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo in the Nowon constituency. Lee, the former chief of the party’s Innovation Committee, had spearheaded efforts to win young votes for then presidential-candidate Park Geun-hye’s presidential campaign in 2012. He has since built on his reputation as TV personality. The Saenuri Party’s Lee Jun-seok gets ready to announce his bid to run in the April 13 elections at the National Assembly on Jan. 24. “It is now time for the citizens, the true owner of this country, to lay the basis on which we can achieve generation change, before any  attempt to change the administration. … Although there are those who say I am too young, please pay attention to things that I can do because I am young,” he said on Jan. 24 while announcing his bid.The main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea, for its part, has been pushing to lower the voting age from 19 to 18. The country had lowered the age from 20 to 19 in 2005.The Minjoo Party asserts that the scheme would allow more young people to exercise their constitutional right to participate in politics. The Saenuri Party opposes the plan, dismissing it as being politically-motivated, in apparent fear of younger voters bolstering the progressive opposition camp.And their concerns are justified by the growing anti-government movement among the younger demographics, particularly upon the government’s repeated slipshod measures against recent crises including the 2014 Sewol ferry disaster and the 2015 MERS outbreak. Students have also taken to the street since last month over the Dec. 28 Korea-Japan agreement on World War II sex slavery.Among 34 countries from Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, South Korea and Poland are the only two countries with voting ages above 18 -- at 19 and 21, respectively. But experts remain skeptical of the major parties’ attempt to win back young voters, highlighting that the parties are still crowded with politicians who are reluctant to clear the table to let the youth in, particularly in the nomination process.“I don’t think there is a significant inflow of young politicians,” said Kim Min-jeon, a political science professor at Kyung Hee University. “The average age of incumbent lawmakers is 58 and the parties’ designated age limit of allocating proportional seats is 39. That explains a lot,” she said. “In order to encourage young generation to join the politics, the parties have to give them incentives. Given that young people are not on an equal footing with old establishment politicians, the parties could provide them with more benefits regarding their nomination process and financial support,” Kim said.By Yeo Jun-suk","young generation into politics ,election 2016 steering young ,candidate agendas election trends ,korea will elect new ,election on april 13","['South Korea', 'National Assembly', 'the Korea Herald', 'EdLee Dong - hak', 'Uri Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.04526984  0.48667273

The committee, in turn, is expected to propose sanctions to the council in early March, the sources said.The Security Council swiftly condemned the North's Jan. 6 nuclear test and has since been working on a new sanctions resolution. Adding to the international outrage, the North unveiled its plan this week to conduct a banned long-range rocket launch.The Radio Free Asia has reported the panel of experts plans to recommend sanctions against two main agencies responsible for the North's nuclear and missile programs -- the Munitions Industry Department of the North's ruling Workers' Party and the State Space Development Bureau.The panel is also expected to recommend sanctions against senior North Korean officials, such as Pak To-chun, a former secretary of the Munitions Industry Department; Ri Man-gon, director of the department; and Ri Pyong-chol, a deputy director of the department, the report said.So far, the Security Council has adopted six resolutions, six presidential statements and two press statements with regard to the North's nuclear and missile programs. Of the six resolutions, four included sanctions against the isolated nation. Chinese cooperation is key to putting together and implementing any meaningful sanctions resolution, as it is one of the five veto-holding permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and the main provider of food and fuel for the impoverished North.Beijing has condemned the North's nuclear test, but has been lukewarm about calls for stern responses. Analysts have long said Beijing fears that pushing Pyongyang too hard could lead to its collapse, instability on its border with China and the untimely emergence of a pro-U.S. nation.","council committee next week ,committee next week sources ,thursday the recommendations will ,committee next week ,said thursday the recommendations","['U.N.', 'North Korea', 'Security Council', 'the Security Council', 'Pyongyang']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.85042399  0.20403257

""Poverty isn't the only factor.

The health agency conducts the test for Zika virus along with dengue fever and chikungunya virus, as the three bring similar symptoms. The tests take a total of 24 hours to process, they said. Earlier last month, the Korean government included Zika on its list of priority diseases as part of its efforts to prevent the possible outbreak of the virus. This mandates medical institutions immediately report cases to health authorities. It also vowed to step up the monitoring and release guidelines for pregnant women, who are suspected to be most vulnerable to Zika.","six new suspected cases ,six more suspected cases ,seven cases tested negative ,tuesday afternoon to thursday ,six more zika suspected","['korean', 'the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.15823694  0.40105295

The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles on the candidate agendas, election trends and notable runners leading up to the race. This is the first installment. -- EdLeading a campaign based on welfare measures is certainly a tempting strategy for political parties in an election season.Progressive parties have used the strategy to distinguish themselves from conservatives and criticize excessive capitalist growth drives. The conservative camp, on the other hand, adopts welfare plans to prove a balanced policy portfolio.But in either case, such buoyant promises come with a critical question: How will these costly social support programs be financed?Indeed, several of the welfare pledges that have successfully won votes in recent years have boomeranged against the initiating party, mostly due to a lack of funds. Voters, too, have grown skeptical over the rosy promises of free child care, school meals and pension benefits.These side effects may explain why welfare agenda have been swept aside this year, as the nation heads toward a general election to pick National Assembly members for the next four years.Welfare, key election determinant in 2010-2012In the elections from 2010-2012, political parties had every reason to prioritize welfare in their campaigns in response to growing demands for stronger social protection.The education superintendent election in 2010, the Seoul mayoral by-election in 2011, the parliamentary elections and the presidential election in 2012 were all won by the party or candidate who took the lead in welfare issues.As progressive candidates swept the 2010-2011 elections with pledges of free school meals and halving college tuition fees, the ruling Grand National Party decided to undercut the liberal drive by taking the initiative.After replacing its supreme council with an emergency committee led by then-Rep. Park Geun-hye and changing its longtime name to the current Saenuri Party, the conservatives made the unconventional move to announce an extensive child care program, called the “Nuri” curriculum.Not only did it revise the infant care act to increase the state subsidies for child care, but it also pledged to expand the free child care beneficiaries to 3-year-olds, and eventually to all age groups.This was a drastic expansion of the original plan devised by the former Lee Myung-bak administration benefitting 5-year-olds before gradually moving on to younger age groups.These groundbreaking welfare policies caused a stir, as well as scornful counterattacks from the opposition, but they had their intended effect -- the Saenuri Party secured its majority in the assembly in 2012.  Park Geun-hye, the then-candidate for the ruling Saenuri Party, delivers her state-funded child care pledges to the audience during the presidential election campaign in November 2012. Leader Park Geun-hye, too, earned credit for saving the party from crisis and for redirecting the party’s interest toward people’s livelihoods. Her presidential campaign mantra was based on two key terms -- “economic democratization” and “welfare” -- which later contributed to her victory.Policy boomerangBut over recent years, the financial consequences of these generous welfare programs have gone out of control, with the government and ruling party are struggling to patch them up.The greatest problem for the ruling bloc is the strife between the central government and local education superintendents over the state-initiated Nuri curriculum.Due to the Park Geun-hye administration’s low-taxation stance, the program soon came to face a lack of funding, which then led to a standoff over who was to take financial responsibility.The central government claims local offices should allocate their share of the budget, as stated in the ordinance. But superintendents argue that child care centers are classified as nurseries, and thus supervised by the Welfare Ministry instead of the Education Ministry.This child care dispute brought criticism against the president for pushing ahead with an extensive welfare blueprint without a matching funding plan or sufficient consultation with local governments.A standout example of the trouble for the ruling camp is the ongoing war with progressive welfare-driven Seongnam Mayor Lee Jae-myeong.Late last year, the local assembly of Seongnam passed a series of welfare bills, providing free postnatal care for new mothers, free uniforms for middle school freshmen and special subsidies for young job seekers.The mayor claimed the measures were within legal boundaries, citing the duty of the central or local government to improve citizens’ welfare. But his bold actions have rubbed the presidential office and the ruling party up the wrong way. The administration, which once touted grand welfare pledges as a prerequisite responsibility of the state, started branding it as populism.“When a local government runs  businesses that it cannot afford, the  consequences will be borne by the state,” said President Park last month, as she also labeled Mayor Lee’s welfare policies “populist.”The president also passed through the Cabinet meeting an ordinance to cut back on the subsidy for local governments that introduced a social security system without consulting the central government in advance.“These populist policies that abuse people’s taxes for the sake of the mayor’s personal interest are like a sweet poison, leading the country and the people to breakdown,” were the words of Saenuri chief Kim Moo-sung.But Mayor Lee refuted, saying his actions would have been in line if only the president and ruling party had not reversed their earlier pledges for people’s welfare.“ promised welfare without extra taxation, which turned out to be a lie,” Lee said in a radio interview Monday.“President Park, too, spoke of a basic pension for all those aged 65 or above, but now she is taking back her words.”The ruling party made its rebuttal, but the dispute over welfare served as a reminder to voters that several of the party’s welfare vows remain unfulfilled.Parties dodge welfare talk in generalThe Saenuri chief may be known for his outspokenness, but his offense against the Seongnam Mayor’s welfare plans was by no means his personal opinion. It reflected the party’s growing reluctance to prioritize welfare amid limited financial resources and prolonged slow growth.A report by the party’s think tank the Youido Institute last year said that as a means to exit the low growth phase, the government should “increase the level of economic freedom and reduce welfare.”Quoting the cases of Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom, the report claimed that most advanced countries were held back in terms of economic development due to their “excessive welfare systems.”It is not just the ruling conservatives that have shied away from the welfare agenda. The progressive main opposition party, too, has toned down its stance.The New Politics Alliance for Democracy, which is now The Minjoo Party of Korea, issued an election strategy report last year and fingered “tolerant growth” rather than “universal welfare” as the top policy goal.Even former chief Rep. Moon Jae-in has been reiterating the concept of “income-led growth,” placing growth over welfare.This has led to suspicion that the opposition party has lost some of the progressive color it claimed to have, but some experts point out that welfare should not be considered a yardstick of progressiveness.According to the late Harvard historian Sydney Fay, the very concept of state welfare dates from German chancellor Otto von Bismarck and French Emperor Napoleon III in the 1870s. Both highly conservative rulers came up with insurance systems for the socially disadvantaged class so as to discourage them from turning to socialism.Libertarian economist Richard McKenzie, too, pointed out that “the welfare state is necessary for the continued collective acceptance of the free market system.” Without a soothing mechanism, workers may end up resisting a free economy, which will then cost more in terms of growth than in welfare costs, he explained in his book “Fairness of the Market.”“What really counts in welfare is the existence of a sustainable system,” said Ahn Sang-hoon, professor for social policy studies at Seoul National University.“We should pay more attention to whether welfare is forming a virtuous circle with the nation’s economy or whether the level of benefits is in line with the people’s tax burden, instead of disputing individual policy contents.”By Bae Hyun-jung","election south korea will ,election 2016 welfare promises ,candidate agendas election trends ,new 20th national assembly ,of election south korea","['South Korea', 'National Assembly', 'the Korea Herald']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52335066  0.2997272

The waters off the coast of Jindo, South Jeolla Province -- where the ill-fated vessel lies -- contain strong, volatile currents and murky water which hindered rescue efforts after the ship’s sinking on April 16, 2014. Divers from China’s Shanghai Salavage Co. and workers dispatched for the salvage operations of the Sewol ferry work on a barge off the coast of Jindo, South Jeolla Province, on Jan. 13. YonhapThe Sewol’s sinking left 304 dead or missing, most of whom were students of Danwon High School in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province, who were traveling to Jejudo Island for a field trip.“We are not yet sure when the salvage operations will conclude, but we are hoping to complete it before the storm season ,” said a ministry official.Officials said the time needed for the underwater investigation of the vessel alone was prolonged by nearly four weeks, as divers from the Chinese state-run Shanghai Salvage Co. -- which leads the consortium for raising the sunken ferry -- needed time to adjust to the strong currents.It also took nearly double the expected time to remove the residual oil, and triple the time to install the netting on the windows and doors of the ferry to ensure that the contents of the ship -- which may include nine bodies that remain unaccounted for -- do not get lost.The bereaved families of Sewol victims have strongly urged the government to salvage the ship and recover the bodies of those missing.

The system, which has long been considered a symbol of the nation’s dictatorial rule, will be officially scrapped Monday, when a legal revision comes into effect, the National Police Agency said. The riot police have gradually been replaced by police conscripts, who choose to serve their mandatory national service in the police rather than in the military, and whose role is not officially linked to North Korea. The riot police system was established in 1971 under the military-backed Park Chung-hee administration, officially to combat demonstrations led by North Korean spies. The riot police were randomly selected among military conscripts by the Defense Ministry.Amid the widespread anti-dictatorship sentiment, the riot police played a central role in cracking down on rallies in the name of maintaining public order. Their job also included managing traffic and guarding important facilities. The continued use of riot police, which runs as a paramilitary organization, to confront protestors with shields, clubs and tear gas has sparked criticism from activists. Amid the criticism and shrinking population, the National Police Agency set up a new scheme to recruit police conscripts upon application in 1983 to gradually replace the riot police system. The Defense Ministry stopped recruiting riot police in January 2012 and the last batch of riot police were discharged in September 2013. According to the police, the total number of riot police who completed their service stands at nearly 33,000. In South Korea, all the able-bodied men are required to serve the around two-year mandatory military service as the country technically remains at war with North Korea since the 1950-53 Korean War.By Ock Hyun-ju","scrapped monday when legal ,be officially scrapped monday ,end the riot police ,officially scrapped monday when ,officially scrapped monday","['the Defense Ministry', 'the National Police Agency']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49486944 -0.12410922

Chung Ui-hwa in a follow-up to their Thursday breakthrough to push forward some of the contentious bills. National Assembly speaker Rep. Chung Ui-hwa talks with representatives of the rival parties Thursday. YonhapThe Minjoo Party has yielded their position and agreed to put to a vote the bills on easing regulations on big conglomerates. The Saenuri Party, in exchange, agreed to make adjustments on the North Korean human rights bill.The parties have been locking horns over bills on labor reform, economic revitalization, counterterrorism and North Korea’s human rights.While the parties have neared a compromise on most of them, they remain at odds over three sets of bills. They include bills on expanding the scope of dispatched employment, fostering service industries and preparing an antiterrorism system. The Minjoo Party has opposed the bills citing increased job instability, concerns of commercialization of medical services and excessive civilian surveillance power for the National Intelligence Service, respectively. The parties are also required to renegotiate the election constituency map, which has been annulled since its expiration on Dec. 31. “We are doing our utmost to make visible progress no later than next week,” said the Minjoo Party whip Rep. Lee Jong-kul on Thursday. If the two parties manage an agreement, they would send the bills to the respective standing committees next week. In terms of the business bills, the parties agreed to grant the conglomerates an extended period of one year, up from six months, to reorganize their circular shareholding ownership and streamline their businesses.

Chung Ui-hwa in a follow-up to their Thursday breakthrough to push forward some of the contentious bills.The Minjoo Party has yielded their position and agreed to put to a vote the bills on easing regulations on big conglomerates. The Saenuri Party, in exchange, agreed to make adjustments on the North Korean human rights bill.The parties have been locking horns over bills on labor reform, economic revitalization, counterterrorism and North Korea’s human rights.While the parties have neared a compromise on most of them, they remain at odds over three sets of bills. They include bills on expanding the scope of dispatched employment, fostering service industries and preparing an antiterrorism system. The Minjoo Party has opposed the bills citing increased job instability, concerns of commercialization of medical services and excessive civilian surveillance power for the National Intelligence Service, respectively. The parties are also required to renegotiate the election constituency map, which has been annulled since its expiration on Dec. 31.  The Minjoo Party whip Rep. Lee jong-kul and Rep. Rhee Mok-hee brief the press after meeting with the ruling Saenuri Party`s leadership. Yonhap“We are doing our utmost to make visible progress no later than next week,” said the Minjoo Party whip Rep. Lee Jong-kul on Thursday. If the two parties manage an agreement, they would send the bills to the respective standing committees next week. In terms of the business bills, the parties agreed to grant the conglomerates an extended period of one year, up from six months, to reorganize their circular shareholding ownership and streamline their businesses.

The decision is seen as the government's determination to push for reform in the labor sector intended to make the market more flexible and help revitalize the sagging economy.The Federation of Korean Trade Unions, the country's major umbrella labor union that represented labor in the trilateral talks, said Tuesday it has decided to break the trilateral deal on labor reform, accusing the government of unilaterally releasing reform measures.The union also said it will not participate in future talks with management and the government to address major labor issues.","government sources said thursday ,said thursday public companies ,government plans to adopt ,thursday public companies ,thursday public companies and",[],4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50885487  0.59519047

Moon Jae-in Moon and Ahn failed to work out differences over how to reform their party, which led to Ahn’s departure.Moon has since changed the name of the main opposition party to the Minjoo Party of Korea in an apparent move to improve its image before the general elections in April.Ahn, who is seeking to create a new political party, is trailing behind by receiving 13 percent of support in the poll while Kim Moo-sung, head of the ruling Saenuri Party, received 12 percent of support.The survey was conducted on 1,005 adults between Tuesday and Thursday and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.","in potential presidential race ,front runner in poll ,presidential race it marked ,presidential race ,months main opposition leader","['Gallup Korea', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Minjoo Party', 'Moon', 'Moon']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.75427991  0.10481725

Kim Jong-in The entry of the distinguished public figure was also seen to indicate the party’s resolve to rise above the recent chain defections of senior party members and the growing competition with Ahn Cheol-soo’s new political party.“The party that will gain people’s support in the upcoming general elections is one that can solve inequality and realize economic democratization,” said Kim Jong-in, announcing his acceptance to take the party’s election committee chairman post.“People are already well aware of the harmful consequences of vague growth visions and irresponsible pump-priming policies.”Kim, chair-professor of economics at Konkuk University and former four-term lawmaker, is best known for designing “economic democratization,” a policy aimed at lessening the wide gap among different economic classes.The term was adopted as the top slogan by then-candidate Park Geun-hye, who struggled to build an image of reform and win over swing votes ahead of the 2012 presidential election.However, soon after taking office Park switched her economic keyword to “creative economy” and reduced the progressive tone from her policies. This led to conflicts between Kim and the leadership which ended with him leaving the party in late 2013.Kim had also led the enactment of Article 119 Clause 2 of the Constitutional Law in 1987, which obligates the state to maintain a balanced economic growth and to prevent the abuse of economic power.“The top priority for our nation is to resolve one of the world’s worst income inequality and Kim, a symbol of economic democratization, will play a crucial role in following such a goal,” said party leader Moon Jae-in on Thursday.Though the Park administration has given up on the idea, the concept of economic democratization should be carried forward, Moon claimed.By underlining this relatively progressive economic vision once again, the Minjoo Party posed a clear challenge against the conservative camp. The ruling Saenuri Party and Cheong Wa Dae have been pushing ahead with a set of labor bills, which the Minjoo Party denounced as “aggravating the current employment inequality.”The move also suggests that the main opposition party wishes to follow a progressive policy line, separating itself from the People’s Party, a forthcoming centrist party led by independent Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo.The ruling camp was taken by surprise but feigned indifference.“Having lost some half of its members, the opposition party should be in a rush to bring in outside figures by any means but we have no such need,” party chief Rep. Kim Moo-sung told reporters on Friday.Party spokesperson Rep. Shin Eui-jin also issued a statement, accusing Kim of political inconsistency and the Minjoo Party of playing shallow political games ahead of elections.Vice floor leader Rep. Cho Won-jin argued that the Minjoo Party has no say in economic policies as it has been holding back the pending reform and economic bills at the National Assembly.Meanwhile, the arrival of the former Park aide received varied responses from within the Minjoo camp as well.Back in 2014, then-floor leader and emergency council chief Rep. Park Young-sun attempted to recruit Chung-Ang University professor Lee Sang-don as economic strategist but was faced with a backlash due to Lee’s former affiliation with the Saenuri Party.Even for those who see no objection to Kim’s title as the Minjoo election campaign chief, his scope of authority is still uncertain.“I have consented on the precondition that I will be the sole and only head of the election committee,” Kim said.His comments seemingly contradicted party leader Moon’s earlier statement that a cochairmanship is under consideration. Moon later added that the issue is Kim’s decision to make.By Bae Hyun-jung","campaign by appointing president ,economic democratization kim jong ,election campaign chief ,appointing president park geun ,top policy keyword economic","['Park Geun', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Kim Jong - in']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45526284  0.27030703

South Korean President Park Geun-hye said during a New Year's news conference she will consider the issue according to national interests.It is no secret that the U.S. also wants to deploy a THAAD unit to South Korea, where some 28,500 American troops are stationed, to better defend against ever-growing threats from North Korea's ballistic missile and nuclear programs.But the issue has become one of the most sensitive for South Korea because China sees a potential THAAD deployment as a threat to their security interests and have increased pressure on Seoul to reject such a deployment.Seoul and Washington have maintained they have never held any formal consultations on the issue.Wolfsthal said that the U.S. will maintain a credible nuclear deterrent and regional security architectures with missile defenses and conventional capabilities so as to reassure its non-nuclear allies and partners that they do not need nuclear weapons of their own.""What we have worked with Japan and South Korea for many years through our treaty alliance is to say that, 'You don't need to rely on nuclear capabilities of your own because we are here and that commitment to you is unbreakable,'"" Wolfsthal said.""We believe and have laid out in the nuclear posture review in 2009 and 2010 that the maintenance of a credible nuclear deterrent is valuable not only for protecting the United States but also has a valuable nonproliferation role to play,"" he added.","remark during security seminar ,during security seminar ,security seminar in response ,during security seminar in ,house official said thursday","['the United States', 'White House', 'Jon Wolfsthal', 'the National Security Council']",4,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.31670627  0.22703454

The Defense Acquisition Program Administration, the country’s weapons procurement agency, picked Uconsystem in 2013 as the provider of small drones for a project to boost reconnaissance and preemptive strike capabilities of the Army and Marine Corps. The accident took place on Dec. 7-9 at five frontline divisions during a test aimed at improving the operators’ skills, inflicting damages on the drones’ wings and propellers, the officials said. Uconsystem's Remoeye Produced in September last year, the UAVs dubbed “Remoeye” were initially stationed at some frontline battalions two months later and scheduled to be gradually deployed in other areas by 2018. The devices, measuring 1.4 meters by 1.8 meters and weighing 3.6 kilograms, can fly as fast as 80 kilometers per hour. Operators should fly them by hand and then use the remote control, and landing takes place as a built-in air bag explodes and absorbs the shock on impact. The series of accidents spurned concerns that it may hamper the scheduled deployment. After an investigation, DAPA, the Defense Agency for Technology and Quality, and the Army have concluded that the main cause of the crash of five units was the soldiers’ inexperience and the other a defect in the equipment.“We’ve suspended the use of the drones and are trying to come up with measures to prevent another accident,” a military official said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issueBy Shin Hyon-hee","drones crash during test ,battalion level drones crash ,crash during test six ,level drones crash during ,drones crash during","['south korean Army', 'the Defense Acquisition Program Administration', 'Uconsystem']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34561488 -0.11568748

While seated, her job consists of taking phone calls and writing reports at the same time.

While seated, her job consists of taking phone calls and writing reports at the same time. About six months ago, Han worked in a different division which required her to stand most of the time greeting clients.“I don’t know which is better -- sitting too much or standing too much,” the 28-year-old told The Korea Herald. “But ever since I moved to my current division, I’ve been experiencing frequent indigestion and bloating. And I’ve also been gaining weight, especially around my belly.”Han’s experience reflects what’s been released in the nation’s latest government data Monday, which claimed Koreans spend too much time sitting down while making little efforts to exercise at the same time.  A single Korean person spends 7.5 hours each day sitting, according to statistics released by the Health and Welfare Ministry and the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.This, according to a 2009 study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, causes harmful health effects that even a 30-minute workout can’t counteract. However, the report showed that only 41.3 percent of Koreans walked more than 30 minutes a day at least five days weekly. Much research has linked sitting for long periods of time to a number of health concerns, including metabolic syndrome, excess body fat around the waist, obesity and abnormal cholesterol levels. It is also known to increase one’s risk of developing an inflexible spine, muscle degeneration and even heart disease and colon cancer.The report showed that Koreans who live in the cities, who are high-income earners and those in their 20s spent the most hours sitting down. Those aged 19-29 spent 8.7 hours each day sitting, while those in their 30s spent 7.6 hours daily, and those in their 60s spent 7.1 hours. Also, those in cities spent 7.7 hours each day sitting, whereas those in the country spent 6.8 hours sitting daily. In terms of income levels, those who belonged to the wealthiest 25 percent spent the longest -- 7.9 hours -- sitting each day, while those who belonged to the poorest 25 percent spent the least time -- 7.1 hours -- sitting daily.Meanwhile, a single Korean person on average slept 6.8 hours a night as of 2014, among the lowest of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations. South Korea is notorious for long work hours. In 2014, South Koreans worked the second-longest hours among the OECD nations, -- a total of 2,124 hours, according to OECD data. It was 354 hours more than the OECD average, which was 1,770 hours. Along with sitting too long, sleep deprivation is also linked to many health concerns, including obesity. Those who are consistently sleep deprived -- getting less than seven to eight hours a night -- are known to have a higher risk for depression, Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and obesity. As of 2014, 31.5 percent of all adult Koreans were obese, according to the government report.

Ahn Cheol-soo announced Friday that his new party would be named People’s Party , as preparations for the launch gained momentum.Earlier in the day, two cochairmen for the preparatory committee were named. Yoon Yeo-joon, a former health minister and senior conservative lawmaker, became the latest to join Ahn’s faction after accepting his request to head the preparation committee for a new opposition party to be launched early next month. Yoon, who has held various roles in both conservative and progressive parties for the past years, had refused to accept Ahn’s offer repeatedly citing his frail health, but finally accepted due to Ahn’s persistence, Ahn’s aide told reporters.  Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo , professor Han Sang-jin and Rep. Kim Han-gil attend a meeting in Seoul on Friday. YonhapYoon will cochair the preparation committee, which will be officially launched Sunday, with Han Sang-jin, professor emeritus at Seoul National University. The left-wing scholar reportedly accepted Ahn’s offer on Thursday over lunch. Earlier in the day, Ahn and other former members of the main opposition party including Rep. Kim Han-gil, Moon Byung-ho, Kim Dong-chul and Hwang Joo-hong gathered in central Seoul for their first meeting since leaving the party, to discuss their plans. Recruitment of new faces also continued as Ahn stepped up work to establish a third political party with floor negotiating power by next month. “The biggest problem facing Korea is that the nation’s top talents are not in the position to solve the nation’s crisis. I will try to change the current structure in which respectable figures are missing opportunities to serve the public in the face of the existing political force,” Ahn said in the meeting. Han, a cochair of the committee, also said that the most crucial task is to bring an era of cooperation and reconciliation in the society riddled with political strife and hostility.With Ahn’s camp picking up the pace, the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea was scrambling to contain the fallout following a series of defections by its lawmakers. Since Ahn left the Minjoo on Dec. 13, 10 other lawmakers including party cofounder Rep. Kim Han-gil have followed suit, reducing its number of parliamentary seats to 117 in a 300-member Assembly. The latest to join Ahn’s faction was Rep. Kim Young-hwan. “The Minjoo Party has lost its hope of change of the government for too long. I am leaving the party in accordance with my conscience,” he said Friday.In a survey by pollster Gallup of 1,021 adults nationwide on Jan. 5-7, the Ahn’s new party in-the-making took lead in the opposition bloc. It received a 21 percent approval rating, ahead of the Minjoo Party’s 19 percent. The ruling Saenuri party scored 35 percent, a drop of 4 percentage points.","his new party ,that his new party ,friday that his new ,names new party people ,ahn names new party","['Ahn Cheol', 'People ’s Party', 'Yoon Yeo - joon', 'Ahn ’s']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.82261002  0.45459941

I absolve you, all,” uttered Antonio Salieri in the 1984 film “Amadeus,” loosely based on the real life of the Italian classical composer and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.As Mozart’s less-capable archrival, the movie version of Salieri was forced to shudder in jealousy, marvel with wonder, and bear witness to the immortal genius of a man many consider to be one of the greatest musical talents of all time. Throughout history, tales of those with exceptional capacity of intellect and ability have sparked the awe of the general public, if not as fatal.In Korea, a country famous for its education fever, such longing for God-given talent is usually manifested in the form of education. Since 2000, the government had been promoting “the education for the gifted” in a bid to maximize the potential of child prodigies who demonstrate extraordinary abilities. There are currently over 2,500 classes for the gifted, with some 110,000 students receiving specialized educations.Standout youngsters have been labeled “prodigy” and became darlings of the media; Kim Ung-yong in the 1960s grabbed nationwide fame after solving differential equations on a Japanese TV show, and such fever was repeated decades later in the 2000s when science wiz teen Song Yoo-geun had emerged.The flip side to such adoration, however, is the pressure and even contempt for their failure to meet sky-high expectations of the public. When Kim returned to Korea with no visible accomplishments and entered a local college as a 21-year-old, the general public and the media were quick to label him a “failure.”Song got the short end of the stick of media attention when his was embroiled recently in a highly publicized plagiarism scandal. He has also said that being touted as a child genius was “lonely,” being singled out from everyone else.Experts have pointed out that heavy competition based on students’ academic achievement may be responsible for the “fall” of geniuses.Lee Sang-kyu, a psychiatrist from Hallym University Medical Center, pointed out that Korean society tends to only label students who excel in schoolwork as gifted.Parents tend to think that their children doing well in school is a task that affects the entire family. They say, ‘why can’t my child be a prodigy?’” said Lee, an expert in depression, child and adolescence issues. “A gifted individual is one in thousands, which means not all children are gifted. But in Korea, if you’re not a standout, you are a loser.”“Not all geniuses are perfect in every way. The problem is that some parents are trying to ‘create’ geniuses that do well in everything, when even the academic circles are uncertain of what defines a genius,” he said. A recent revelation by Song, who urged people not to praise him based on talent alone, demonstrates how being labeled “a genius” may be both a blessing and a curse.“People call me ‘a boy prodigy’ and it’s been somewhat of a pressure. I believe it is because they expect me to accomplish a lot of things,” said Song in a lecture, predating his scandal. “Genius is a word used to assess a person’s lifetime of achievements. Thus, I’m not a genius -- I’m just someone working hard in the field of astrophysics, which I like.”By Yoon Min-sik","amadeus mozart as mozart ,mozart as mozart less ,wolfgang amadeus mozart ,mozart as mozart ,1984 film amadeus loosely","['Antonio Salieri', 'italian', 'Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart', 'Mozart', 'Salieri']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56547487  0.35607412

399,399,Korean Gender Minister nominee blasted for views on sex slavery deal,South Korea's Gender Equality Minister nominee Kang Eun-hee was lambasted by opposition lawmakers for her views on the recent ROK-Japan sex slavery settlement during her confirmation hearing at the National Assembly on Thursday.　The former IT businesswoman and Saenuri Party lawmaker described the settlement between the two nations as “an outcome that came out as a result of South Korean government’s utmost efforts...,"South Korea's Gender Equality Minister nominee Kang Eun-hee was lambasted by opposition lawmakers for her views on the recent ROK-Japan sex slavery settlement during her confirmation hearing at the National Assembly on Thursday.The former IT businesswoman and Saenuri Party lawmaker described the settlement between the two nations as “an outcome that came out as a result of South Korean government’s utmost efforts” during the session. The agreement has been criticized for not clearly admitting Tokyo’s legal responsibility for the institutionalized sex slavery of women during World War II.  Gender Minister nominee Kang Eun-hee speaks during her confirmation hearing at the National Assembly in Seoul on Thursday. Yonhap“I understand that not everyone may be satisfied with the settlement,” she said, when she was asked by Rep. Nam In-soon of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea if she agreed with the government that women’s rights in Korea took a “major step forward” with the settlement.“Considering that Tokyo admitted the military’s involvement in the slavery, and that Japan offered its state funds for the establishment of a foundation to support victims, I think the settlement is a great step forward.”Earlier this week, the main opposition party demanded the Seoul government to renegotiate last month’s agreement with Tokyo, criticizing the Park administration for not discussing the matter with the victims before finalizing the deal. During the session, Kang said it was also important to “understand Japan’s position in the situation,” and that President Park Geun-hye has accomplished something “very brave” through the settlement. Kang also described the agreement as something that could not have been achieved by any previous South Korean government.To this, Rep. Lim Su-kyung said Kang’s views on the settlement prove that she has failed to empathize with the victims. “If the Gender Equality Minister cannot empathize with the victims of sex slavery and their pain, what can she really do for any women in this country?” she said.Kang has also supported Park’s controversial plan to replace middle and high school history textbooks with a single state-authored option in 2017. She has been serving on the Saenuri Party’s special committee to implement the textbook reform. During the confirmation hearing, Kang was asked by Rep. Nam In-soon if she planned to describe the recent settlement as an achievement that took a major step forward for justice and human rights. “I will have to see if Tokyo properly follows through on its promises,” Kang said.A graduate of Kyungpook University’s physical education program, Kang worked as a school teacher before founding her IT venture, Winitech, in Daegu in the late 1990s. She served as the CEO of the company for more than 10 years, and is currently the company’s biggest shareholder. Opposition lawmakers asked Kang to submit documents showing the company’s performance on gender equality, such as how many women workers had been hired and how many had been granted paternity or maternity leave. However, Kang had refused to submit the documents until Thursday morning, claiming they were confidential. She agreed to give the requested information during the morning session of the hearing, when lawmakers called her irresponsible for not cooperating with their requests. Meanwhile, Lee Joon-sik, who has been nominated as Education Minister and Deputy Prime Minister for Social Affairs, also attended a confirmation hearing on Thursday. Lee, a former professor at Seoul National University’s School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, also said the recent settlement on sex slavery was an “outcome that came out as a result of the South Korean government’s utmost efforts.” The former professor also said he thinks positively of the state history textbooks written during late President Park Chung-hee’s military regime, claiming the books “successfully combined research findings by historians and nationalistic values and perspectives.”During the session it was revealed that his second daughter, a former dual U.S.-South Korean citizen born in California in 1985, borrowed interest-free loans from Korean government entities for her university tuition even after giving up her Korean citizenship in 2007. Lee apologized during the hearing and explained that, as a dual citizen, his daughter automatically lost her Korean citizenship when she became 22. He said his daughter was willing to give up her U.S. citizenship and retrieve her Korean one.He was also asked about how her daughter, who was only 29 years old last year, purchased an apartment in Seoul that cost about 1 billion won , when she had only worked as a resident at a general hospital for a few years. Lee was accused of purchasing the property under his daughter’s name as a gift and evading gift tax in doing so. The nominee denied the accusations, claiming that both his daughter and her husband, who are both currently based in Hong Kong, have been employed as a physician and a banker for quite a while.

Less than a week later, the situation has reversed. Pyongyang declared it successfully carried out a hydrogen bomb test Wednesday, catching everyone off guard ― not just Seoul and Washington, but also Beijing, the communist country’s top political and economic patron. The fourth test marks the latest in a series of dogmatic and perplexing behavior by the young leader. Kim Jong-un. YonhapThe state media said the decision was made by Kim, who signed the order on Dec. 15, shortly after the Moranbong Band canceled a much-hyped sold-out concert in Beijing at the last minute without giving a reason, sparking international criticism and extensive rumors.Military officials here have said the North is ready to conduct nuclear tests at any time once it takes such a “political choice,” and related evidence can be detected up to one month ahead. But this time, there were no imminent signs of a test ― such as setting up a measuring device and screen fence or refilling the tunnel ― indicating the preparations were made in a highly clandestine manner. Covert preparations aside, the timing was unusual, defying the longstanding pattern of a long-range missile test leading to international sanctions followed by a new atomic test. Pyongyang’s provocations are chiefly aimed at nuclear talks with the U.S., and have in the past come at times of leadership transition or major political events. This time, however, it did not have much incentive, given that the Barack Obama administration has displayed little, if any, willingness to forsake its “strategic patience” approach and return to disarmament-for-aid negotiations, and the presidential election isn’t scheduled until November. On the cross-border front, the latest test will inevitably complicate Seoul’s calculations over Pyongyang’s demand for a restart of stalled tours to a North Korean mountain resort and lifting of bans on bilateral exchanges. With Kim’s birthday falling on Friday, the test could have been designed to elevate the occasion as a new major anniversary alongside those of his deceased father and grandfather, while consolidating the ruler’s legacy ahead of the ruling Workers’ Party’s first congress in 36 years slated for May, some observers say. They also called for the Park Geun-hye administration to refine its North Korea approach instead of shifting all the blame to the unpredictable leader, citing Kim’s claim last month of having developed a hydrogen bomb, which Seoul dismissed as a “rhetoric.” “Though Kim is mocked globally, I’m not sure if he is controlling the entire situation under a thoroughly crafted scenario, and when everyone undermines his remarks as a bluff, he strikes back with a surprising provocation contrary to widespread expectations,” a Seoul official said on customary condition of anonymity.

If not, she might lose the spotlight to potential presidential candidates and their campaigns.President Park Geun-hye The president’s advantage is that she has successfully allocated her close aides in key government posts while maintaining a sizable grip on the ruling party through a number of her bigwig associates. Also, her average approval rating has held firm in the 40 percent range despite several setbacks, reflecting an unwavering base of support.Her weakness, however, is that very few of her key campaigns on social and economic reform have produced tangible results. Her economic reform initiatives, touted as the only option to save the economy, have been dragged into political debate, with a challenging outlook for their implementation.The public backlash against her chief accomplishments last year, including the reinstatement of state-authored history textbooks and the recent deal with Japan on wartime sex slavery, are also boosting anti-Park sentiment.In her New Year address, Park underscored that she would dedicate this year to revitalizing the economy by boosting domestic demand and creating jobs.“I will achieve reforms in the labor, financial, education and public sectors and also complete the three-year economic innovation plan,” the president said.The first chance to build momentum is the last plenary session of the National Assembly’s extraordinary session Friday, by which time the administration and the ruling party had been pushing to pass the related bills. With negative external economic factors threatening to dent the economy, which is largely dependent on exports, Park emphasized the need for a contingency plan to prevent crisis.In a Cabinet reshuffle in late December, Park nominated former Land Minister Rep. Yoo Il-ho of the ruling Saenuri Party as finance minister and vice prime minister. Former head of the Korea Institute of Public Finance, Yoo is an expert in tax and financial affairs, but this was not the only reason for his nomination.He is also a close aide to Park, and therefore a predictable successor to Choi Kyung-hwan, who will soon step down from his current post and return to his parliamentary seat.“For the sake of consistency, I will mostly uphold Choi’s key policies,” Yoo said, implying that he, too, will act as guardian and executor of the president’s economic reform plans.But the task ahead of Park and her men appears more grueling than they would like, as Assembly strife means that passing the bills will not be straightforward.Another hurdle for Park is the public’s growing resistance toward the government following the recent deal with Japan on the surviving former sex slaves. In a “final and irreversible” agreement, Japan agreed to pay 1 billion yen  for Seoul to establish a fund for the victims, prompting angry opposition from victims and progressives, who said the agreement was made without their consent or consultation. In a Realmeter survey, 50.8 percent of surveyed adults nationwide disapproved of the agreement, while 43.2 percent approved, with the response varying dramatically by age and region. Meanwhile, Park’s approval rating has continued to remain steady, showing an unwavering level of support from her home city of Daegu and from elderly voters.Surveys by local pollsters Gallup Korea and Realmeter respectively showed Park’s rating at 43 percent and 42.1 percent, as of the end of 2015.On the diplomatic front, Park is expected to engage in bilateral exchanges with Japan and Russia this year. Both are countries to which Park is yet to make a summit visit. She held talks with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in November 2013, and with Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last November. Park had been withholding her visit to Moscow over the Ukraine conflict. News reports have predicted that Park may be participating in the 2nd Eastern Economic Forum to be held in September in Vladivostok.There is some speculation that Park will visit Tokyo around May, when Japan is hosting the G7 summit.By Bae Hyun-jung","next presidential race two ,next presidential race ,the next presidential race ,presidential race two years ,is ticking for president","['Park Geun - hye', 'Park']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.81384498  0.54683012
