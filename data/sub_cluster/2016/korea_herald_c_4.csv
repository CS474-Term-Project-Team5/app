The bill intends to force companies responsible for selling or manufacturing toxic humidifier disinfectant, namely Oxy Reckitt Benckiser and SK Chemicals, to make contributions to the envisioned 200 billion won  fund based on quotas allocated by the South Korean government. The legislation, if it passes the parliament’s plenary session early next year, will pave the way for some 300 more victims of the toxic sterilizers to receive state support. Families of toxic humidifier disinfectant victims and civic group members hold up placards showing the number of deaths attributed to the products at Gwanghwamun Square on Monday, pressing the government to expand the related investigation and legislate a special law for damages. According to the government’s current victim verification process, set in 2014, the scale goes from 1-4, with one being highly certain the health damage resulted from the use of toxic humidifier disinfectants.Based on personal clinical results, diagnostic images and the level of exposure, victims who suffered lung diseases are classified as category 1 or 2 victims, while those with other respiratory-related diseases fall into categories 3-4. The latest data in May showed that there were 309 victims of toxic humidifier disinfectants classified in categories 3-4, compared to 221 victims in categories 1-2.Self-claimed victims, their families and civic groups have been demanding the government broaden the scope of the victim recognition and compensation process to include non-lung related symptoms. Since July, the Environment Ministry has been providing government subsidies to humidifier disinfectant victims in categories 1-2 with monthly living costs and nursing fees.When Oxy Reckitt Benckiser -- formally renamed Reckitt Benckiser Korea since 2014 -- announced the final compensation plan in August, categories 3-4 victims were excluded from the compensation list. The company said it would compensate up to 350 million won to victims categorized upon government investigation as categories 1-2, but it was bitterly opposed by the victims’ group that the final plan does not cover all victims as it leaves out those classified category 3-4.RB Korea is responsible for some 4.4 million toxic humidifier disinfectants sold between 2000 and 2014, accountable for 62 percent of the total volume in the humidifier disinfectant market. In 2011, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officially confirmed the link between health damages of victims and the use of toxic humidifier disinfectant. So far, 189 deaths, mostly of lung failure, have been formally recognized as being linked to the products. Damage claims filed this year have reached over 3,400.By Kim Da-sol","south korean government the legislation ,million toxic humidifier disinfectants sold ,committee on thursday cleared bill ,government subsidies to humidifier disinfectant ,state support families of toxic","['south korean', 'the National Assembly ’s Environment and Labor Committee', 'Oxy Reckitt Benckiser', 'SK Chemicals', 'south korean', 'the Environment Ministry', 'Oxy Reckitt Benckiser', 'Reckitt Benckiser Korea', 'the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Kim Da - sol']",2,"[ 2.          1.          2.         ... -0.44571698  0.20186338

Seongnam mayor Lee Jae-myung holds an interview with Yonhap News Agency in Seoul on Dec. 28.Ban and Moon currently leads opinion polls on next year's election, with Lee taking up the third spot.""One of the key criteria  is their achievement from previous public posts, and whether they abused the posts for personal interests.

As the remark sparked widespread criticism, Trump doubled down on it, saying he would accept a visit by Kim and hold nuclear negotiations while ""eating a hamburger,"" instead of a state dinner. Donald Trump Lewis recalled a series of Twitter postings that Trump made in2013 and 2014 about former NBA star Dennis Rodman's trip to North Korea, saying Trump praised ""Rodman when it helped ratings of the Celebrity Apprentice, then trashed him when he didn't.""The expert also pointed out inconsistent remarks Trump made about the North. ""He called Kim Jong Un a maniac and suggested assassinating him, expressing only admiration for a 20-something stepping out of his father's shadow.

""But what will happen if he demands, as he has said he will do, that South Korea and Japan pay more for the privilege of being protected by the United States? Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Park Geun-hye are pro-American enough that they might agree,"" Boot said.However, Park is now in the process of being ousted in impeachment proceedings, the expert said, adding that the leading opposition candidates to succeed her include what he called the ""leftist Moon Jae-in and the populist Lee Jae-myung."" Moon and Lee ""are considerably less pro-American,"" he said.""If one of them wins the presidency, and Trump demands more payment for protection, South Korea just might let US troops leave without a fight. And if that were to happen, America’s standing in the Pacific region would plummet,"" the expert said.About 28,500 American troops are stationed in South Korea to deter North Korean aggression, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. Many agree that the troop presence is also in line with US interests in a region marked by China's rise.South Korea currently shoulders about half the cost of keeping the American troops in the country. But Trump argued during the election campaign that Seoul should pay up to even 100 percent of the cost or the US should be prepared to leave the country.Since his election, however, Trump has shown signs of retreat from his campaign rhetoric, making remarks reaffirming the alliance with South Korea during a phone call with President Park Geun-hye a day after election, and filling some key posts with people valuing the alliance.","donald trump demands seoul pay ,president donald trump demands seoul ,trump demands seoul pay more ,trump argued during the election ,korea could significantly weaken america","['South Korea', 'american', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'Seoul', 'US', 'Max Boot', 'the Council on Foreign Relations', 'Foreign Policy', 'South Korea', 'America', 'trump', 'american', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'US', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'the United States', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Park Geun', 'pro - american', 'Park', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Lee Jae - myung', 'Moon', 'Lee', 'pro - american', 'trump', 'South Korea', 'US', 'America', 'american', 'South Korea', 'north korean', 'US', 'China', 'South Korea', 'american', 'Trump', 'Seoul', 'US', 'Trump', 'South Korea', 'Park Geun - hye']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52168685  0.63921994

Some 23.28 percent of respondents identified their political inclination as liberal, compared to 21.84 percent who called themselves conservative. The liberal lead had widened to 24.60 versus 19.96 by the second week of this month, the data showed. As of the third week of this month, the figure is back up for the conservative respondents, who were slightly ahead of the liberal respondents by 0.96 percentage point. “It is the first time that progressive voters have surpassed conservative minds,” said Kwon Soon-jeong, head of the survey analysis department at Realmeter. “After nine years of a conservative administration, a sense of fatigue seems to be widespread in the public, leading to a change in their ideological dispositions.” Choi Soon-sil The analysis looked into poll findings over 20 weeks starting from the second week of August. Before the turning point in November, more people identified themselves as conservative voters, at one point, the conservatives held a 6.6 percentage point lead over liberal voters. The difference slowly declined in September when suspicions started to arise over the president and her confidante Choi Soon-sil. Park is suspected of allowing her close friend Choi to meddle in state affairs and colluding with her to extort funds from conglomerates. Park was impeached by the National Assembly on Dec. 9, and her fate awaits a final decision by the Constitutional Court. The approval rating of political parties have also witnessed a shakeup. The ruling conservative Saenuri Party, which was once on top of the polls, has ceded its spot to the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea. As of Monday, the Democratic Party’s approval rating stands at 36.1 percent, as compared to the 19.2 percent of respondents who support Saenuri.Among them are voters who decided not to support any parties. Fifteen to 19 percent of voters said they did not lean toward a particular political party in the third week of October, but the number hit a record high of 24.1 percent in the first week of December. The shifting public sentiment is changing the nation’s political landscape. Parties are busy trying to win over wavering voters. Some 30 members of the ruling Saenuri Party left the party Tuesday, vowing to create a new conservative party that will seek for more liberal economic policies.

The ministry also scrapped plans to mandate all schools to use the state-authored textbooks, effectively signaling the renunciation of one of the most disputed projects initiated by the Park Geun-hye administration.“Schools that wish to use the state-written history textbooks earlier  may start doing so in March ,” Lee Joon-sik, the education minister and deputy prime minister for social affairs said at a press briefing at the government complex in Sejong City. Education Minister Lee Joon-sik speaks during a press briefing at the Sejong Government Complex on Tuesday. YonhapThose who start using the history textbooks earlier will test them out before their official release.“Though there have been demands to discard the state-authored textbooks entirely, we also received some positive feedback and so decided to allow the usage of both the state-written and state-authorized textbooks,” Lee said. After the ministry’s announcement, the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae expressed disappointment over the decision.“It is regrettable  but there was nothing we could do under the current circumstances,” a Blue House official said.President Park, who has been in seclusion since her impeachment resolution on Dec. 9, is also said to have urged for the implementation of the textbook plan during a meeting with officials last week.Opposition parties, however, refused to embrace the ministry’s compromising solution and continued to push for the pending motion billed to ban state-authored textbooks. “Discarding all the state-authored textbooks is the only answer, not delaying the application date,” said Rep. Ki Dong-min, the floor spokesperson for the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea. The runner-up opposition People’s party also condemned the ministry, calling it “irresponsible” and “stubborn” for ignoring the public sentiments. The lawmakers and civic groups have criticized Park’s drive to mandate the state-written textbooks, accusing her of attempting to glorify the military dictatorship of her father. Park’s father, Park Chung-hee, was a military strongman who ruled the country for 18 years until his assassination in 1979. The Education Ministry had released three draft copies of the state-authored history textbooks and made them available to the public in order to gather opinions, up to last week.Some 76,949 citizens looked over the textbooks a total of 146,851 times, and 2,334 of them submitted their opinions on the textbooks, the ministry revealed. The Education Ministry said it will edit 21 errors pointed out by citizens, while another 808 errors will be discussed by experts. Pundits predict Park’s history textbooks might be abolished after the next presidential election, which is expected to take place earlier than scheduled, as Park’s impeachment charges are currently being examined by the Constitutional Court. If her impeachment is approved by the court, the next election has to take place within 60 days. The government released plans for the state-authored history textbooks in October last year, as the president showed concerns that the seven existing history textbooks contain some biased, left-leaning interpretation of history.

The main opposition Democratic Party of Korea has now emerged as the biggest political party with 121 seats. The People’s Party is third with 38 seats. The lawmakers defecting from the ruling Saenuri Party on Tuesday pledge to create a new conservative party. Behind them is a banner reading “starting anew as conservatives.“ The conservative party’s split marks a turning point for South Korean politics as it witnesses four major parties competing for power for the first time since 1990. At that time, there were two conservative and two liberal parties until they realigned into one big conservative and one minor liberal party. “We will begin our journey to play a pivotal role for the conservatives and provide them with orderly and stable reform. We will preserve liberal democracy, achieve social unification and create a warm community,” said the defectors in a statement. A total of 30 lawmakers joined the new party, including 29 defectors and Rep. Kim Yong-tae, who had already left Saenuri in late November. Last week, 35 Saenuri members vowed to leave the party, but some withheld their decision at the last minute to consult with their constituents.The lawmakers said that they will launch a new party named “New Conservative Party for Reform” on Jan. 24. Later in the day, the new party registered themselves as a parliamentary negotiating group, who can receive a government subsidy and exercise tie-breaking votes between the major parties.Their rebellion against Saenuri came after most anti-Park lawmakers joined opposition parties in passing the impeachment motion against the president earlier this month. Up to 62 Saenuri lawmakers are thought to have approved the motion in a secret ballot. Since then, they have clashed over control of the party with the pro-Park faction, who dominated leadership positions. The factional feud ended in favor of the pro-Park faction when one of Park’s loyalists was elected as the new floor leader on Dec. 16. “The mass defection which claims to advocate reform was in fact a pursuit of political ambition and a move to salvage  faction,” said Saenuri floor leader Chung Woo-taik, dismissing the defection as a “failure” because anti-Park lawmakers failed to attract the 35 lawmakers they had initially promised.The defection group includes a number of former Saenuri heavyweights, such as former Saenuri leader lawmakers Rep. Kim Moo-sung and former Floor Leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min. Both had clashed with Park over her welfare policies and nominations for the 2016 general election. There are other high-profile legislators working at parliamentary committees. Among them are third-term lawmaker Rep. Kweon Seong-dong, chairman of the Legislation and Judiciary Committee who will represent the legislative body during the impeachment trial against Park at the Constitutional Court. With the initiation of a new party by Saenuri defectors on Tuesday, the National Assembly turned into a five-party structure.  The Democratic Party of Korea, the Saenuri Party, the People‘s Party, the reformative conservative party , and the Justice Party. The defectors said that more Saenuri lawmakers would quit the party once UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon joins them to run for the 2017 presidential race. The world’s top diplomat has distanced himself from President Park and her loyalists since the corruption scandal erupted in October. “I don’t want to make a move until Ban returns to Korea,” said former Saenuri Floor Leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk, who is considered close to Ban, who is expected to return to Korea in mid-January. Chung succeeded Yoo for the post in 2016.It was not the first time that conservative parties have split up before presidential elections. In 1997, former Gyeonggi Province Gov. Rhee In-je left the then-ruling New Korea Party to rebel against Lee Hoi-Chang, a presidential candidate then. Lee also defected from his party to run for the 2007 presidential race. But their defections did not work out as they expected. Gov. Lee came in third in the 1997 presidential race, trailing behind Lee Hoi-Chang and late President Kim Dae-jung. Lee Hoi Chang also ended the 2007 presidential race at third place, behind liberal candidate Chung Dong-young and former President Lee Myung-bakFor the Saenuri defectors to avoid the same fate as their conservative predecessors, experts said, they have to move beyond opposition of the president and focus on showing conservative voters policies tailored to them.  “Being critical of Park and approving the impeachment of her is not enough,” said Lee Jung-hee, a political professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. “Currently, they appear to advocate a hawkish stance on national security and a liberal stance on economy issues. It is too naive. They need to be more specific.” Myongji University politics professor Kim Hyung-joon said that the anti-Park lawmakers’ defections could expand their appeal to independent centrists if they focus on political reform, rather than rallying behind establishment powerbrokers.By Yeo Jun-suk","tuesday over the corruption scandal ,after most anti park lawmakers ,2007 presidential race at third ,new party including 29 defectors ,dozens of lawmakers defected from","['Park Geun - hye', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park', 'Saenuri', 'the National Assembly', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'the People ’s Party', 'Saenuri Party', 'south korean', 'Kim Yong - tae', 'Saenuri', 'Saenuri', '"" New Conservative Party for Reform', 'Saenuri', 'anti - park', 'Saenuri', 'Park ’s', 'Saenuri', 'Chung Woo', 'anti - park', 'Saenuri', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'Floor Leader', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Park', 'Kweon Seong - dong', 'the Legislation and Judiciary Committee', 'Park', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Saenuri', 'the National Assembly', 'the Democratic Party', 'the Saenuri Party', 'the People‘s Party', 'the Justice Party', 'Saenuri', 'UN', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Park', 'Ban', 'Korea', 'Saenuri Floor', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'Ban', 'Korea', 'Chung', 'Yoo', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'New Korea Party', 'Lee Hoi - Chang', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Lee Hoi - Chang', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'Lee Hoi Chang', 'Chung Dong - young', 'Lee Myung -', 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'Lee Jung - hee', 'Hankuk University of Foreign Studies', 'Myongji University', 'Kim Hyung - joon', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.53962672  0.36591771

The Defense Ministry refuted the notion as a groundless suspicion. This newly raised allegation further kindled widespread speculation that President Park Geun-hye neglected her duty as state supervisor and was receiving cosmetic procedures on the day of the tragedy -- allegations the ongoing parliamentary probe committee and special investigators are still seeking to prove.A Facebook account named “Zaro -- Netizens’ investigation team” stirred the interest of the public and media as it released via YouTube a documentary eight hours and 49 minutes long, which it claimed to “contain the hidden, unbiased truth” behind the April 16, 2014 tragedy. A teaser image of ""Sewol X,"" a documentary film produced by a South Korean netizen and uploaded to YouTube. The anonymous online operator, said to be a man in his 40s, has been known for in-depth investigations into high-profile irregularity cases. The name “Zaro” came into the spotlight when the user came up with tangible evidence in 2013 that the nation’s spy agency had rigged online comments prior to the 2012 presidential election.“I refuted all four reasons the prosecution suggested as causing the Sewol ferry,” said the user Monday in a radio interview with CBS.“My only intention is to seek the truth, without taking sides with anybody or being swayed by any prejudice.”Prosecutors earlier announced the causes of the accident were overloaded freight, displacement of cargo, the staff’s lack of experience and the outdated facilities of the ship -- thus eschewing outside factors.The private investigator, however, claimed a misdirected submarine collided with the unfortunate ferry that day and the Navy attempted to conceal the truth for the sake of reputation.“The radar scope at Jindo’s vessel traffic service center caught sight of an orange object, which experts saw as a freight container ,” he said.But at the time, the ship was not tilted enough, so the unidentified object may have been neither a container nor any other structures on the scene, according to Zaro.He also pointed out that the sailing track of the sunken ferry did not match conventional tracks, pointing to an outside factor such as a submarine collision.“Several of the survivors testified to a crashing sound hitting on the vessel before it started tilting, and two of them were at the time located near the port, suggesting a physical shock on the outside of the underwater port,” Zaro said through his documentary clip.To back his submarine collision theory, the investigator quoted Kim Kwan-mook, a nanoscience professor at Ewha Womans University.The operator then added a hypothesis: the Navy may have concealed the submarine crash, so as to keep its safety record intact.The South Korean Navy, in the year following the ferry accident, established a new record of sailing 23 years without accident.“This unprecedented record and reputation leads to an economic effect of at least several trillions of won, and I couldn’t help but wonder if this was what delayed the rescue actions or what deterred the president from revealing further details of that day,” he said.Officials immediately denied the allegations, claiming there were no military operations or drills in the nearby waters on the day of the accident.“The waters were 37 meters deep on average and not suitable for submarine action,” said Defense Ministry spokesperson Moon Sang-gyun on Monday.But when requested to reveal the corresponding radar recordings, the official merely reserved his stance, saying he would “check whether the given records still exist.”Meanwhile, President Park Geun-hye and investigators remain gridlocked over Park’s actions during the seven hours during which she remained out of public sight on the day of the ferry’s sinking.The Constitutional Court, which is deliberating on Park‘s impeachment resolution, had demanded last week that the president submit a detailed timeline by Tuesday to answer the doubts.By Bae Hyun-jung","investigator however claimed misdirected submarine ,the ferry sinking the constitutional ,to back his submarine collision ,have concealed the submarine crash ,following the ferry accident","['the Defense Ministry', 'Park Geun', 'YouTube', 'south korean', 'YouTube', 'Zaro', 'Navy', 'Jindo', 'Zaro', 'Zaro', 'Kim Kwan - mook', 'Ewha Womans University', 'Navy', 'the south korean Navy', 'Defense Ministry', 'Moon Sang - gyun', 'Park Geun', 'Park ’s', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",7,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.43357483  0.37851107

About 30 Saenuri members, including former Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon and Jeju Province Gov. Won Hee-ryong, neither of whom hold parliamentary seats, will join them in defecting from the Saenuri Party and launching the new conservative party, they said. Former Seoul Mayor Oh-Se-hoon  joins a meeting of the preparatory committee for a new conservative political party, which is being pushed by a separatist group of the governing Saenuri Party, at the National Assembly in Seoul on Monday. “We will officially leave the party at 10 a.m.  and will thoroughly discuss the new party’s policies and appoint the new chief,” Rep. Oh Shin-hwan, the spokesperson for the would-be defectors told reporters after the group’s meeting Monday morning. While the exact number has yet to be confirmed, some 30 members are expected to quit and register with the National Assembly as a new negotiating bloc on the same day. The group aims to launch a new party, tentatively called “New Conservative Party for Reform,” on Jan. 24.  The separatists are seeking to recruit UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who topped the latest poll of potential presidential candidates and whose term at the UN ends later this week. Ban is to return to Korea on Jan. 15, a person close to him said Monday. The division of the country’s ruling party came as the internal feud deepened between its two factions after the Dec. 9 impeachment of President Park Geun-hye.  The group of dissenters, united over their criticism of the president, faces a key challenge ahead, as member lawmakers carry differing views on the new party’s principal policies.Rep. Yoo Seong-min, a bigwig Saenuri rebel, has revealed several times via media outlets that he will pursue a “warm and righteous” conservative party, hinting at a possible shift in conservative policies. While he basically agrees with the Saenuri Party’s stance on national defense and the recent diplomatic deals made with the US and Japan, economy and welfare policies need some “bold reforms.”“I believe conservative parties should also care for the society’s bipolarization and inequality problems and need to come up with some bold policies for social change,” Rep. Yoo said during a radio interview Monday. “Reforms in taxation and the labor industry are crucial.”The Park administration agreed with the US over deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system and signed a military intelligence-sharing pact last month with Japan. The two controversial moves have been criticized by the liberal parties on their legitimacy, citing the “hasty” decision-making process. As some lawmakers are reportedly hesitating on whether to join the new party, Rep. Kim Moo-sung, formerly a chief of Saenuri Party, said nothing has been decided about the new party platform and that the new party is open to diversity in opinions. For the party’s interim chief position, Rep. Na Kyong-won and Rep. Joo Ho-young are viewed as strong candidates. Rep. Na, a fourth-term lawmaker had previously been recommended for the floor leader position of the Saenuri ruling party, but lost to Park loyalist Rep. Chung Woo-taik. The remaining Park loyalists in the ruling party vowed to restructure the Saenuri Party.“A shake-up in personnel and the party’s platform policies is urgent. I will make sure citizens’ opinions are reflected in our party reforms,” said In Myung-jin, who was recently designated the chief of the Saenuri Party’s emergency committee. Regarding the defections, he expressed disappointment, but said they should reunite one day, as they have spent years together sharing the same conservative values.

Ban, the frontrunner among presidential hopefuls, will reach out to a wide range of political forces rather than enter an existing party, namely the ruling Saenuri Party, he told reporters, asking not to be named. ""Rather than joining an existing party, he will engage in activities for another leap of the Republic of Korea based on his accumulated experiences,"" he said.He indicated Ban, whose term at the world body ends at the end of this month, may create his own political party. ""I believe the chance for him to join the Saenuri Party is very slim. Just as he stressed inclusive leadership, he will try to realize new politics with various political forces as the pillars of his project,"" he added. Ban overtook former opposition leader Moon to top presidential polls last week after hinting he would run in next year's presidential election. The associate also said Ban will aggressively deal with ground allegations against him from his rivals and media, referring to a news report that Ban received a total of US$230,000 in cash in 2005 and 2007 from a Korean businessmen convicted of bribery. He was serving as South Korea's foreign minister in 2005 and UN chief in 2007. The aide said the report by The Sisa Journal, a weekly magazine published in Seoul, is groundless and that Ban could take legal action against any false accusations. He dismissed some criticism that Ban lacks knowledge of domestic politics due to his nearly 10 years of living abroad. That will prove if he holds a debate with Moon, former head and potential flag-bearer of the main opposition Democratic Party, he said. He emphasized Ban's on-the-spot experience in various places across the world plagued by war and famine, which he said will help him exert leadership at the time of national crisis. Ban was slightly ahead of Moon in opinion polls last week after hinting at his candidacy. In a survey by Real Meter released Monday, Ban garnered an approval rating of 23.3 percent, up 2.8 percentage points on week.He was virtually neck-and-neck with Moon who earned 23.1 percent, down 0.6 percentage point.","for next year presidential election ,in next year presidential election ,run in next year presidential ,moon to top presidential polls ,next year presidential election close","['UN', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'South Korea', 'Ban', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Republic of Korea', 'Ban', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Ban', 'Moon', 'Ban', 'Ban', 'korean', ""South Korea 's"", 'UN', 'the Sisa Journal', 'Seoul', 'Ban', 'Ban', 'Moon', 'Democratic Party', 'Ban', 'Ban', 'Moon', 'Meter', 'Ban', 'Moon']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.9233796   0.40410191

The main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, on the other hand, has stepped up its attacks against Ban’s presidential bid, casting the UN chief as an establishment politician without a blueprint for overhauling dysfunctional politics.“I think that Ban’s success was largely under the old-fashioned, established order. I doubt he would take the call for change seriously,” said Democratic Party’s former leader Rep. Moon Jae-in. A survey conducted by local pollster Realmeter showed Moon to be outrun by Ban in terms of approval rating for the 2017 race.The main opposition party’s criticism reflected the growing level of scrutiny faced by the 72-year-old career diplomat, who has recently become more vocal about his post-UN plans, but still remains ambiguous on his presidential bid.Supporters for UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon convene last Thursday at Sejong Center for the Performing Arts in Seoul. YonhapOn Friday, weekly magazine Sisa Journal reported that when Ban served as foreign minister in 2005 and UN chief in 2007, he received a kickback worth more than $230,000 from Park Yeon-cha, a businessman who had been arrested for giving illicit money to the late President Roh Moo-hyun. The Democratic Party urged prosecutors to investigate Ban, but the businessman Park and Ban’s aides denied the accusation, saying the report was an attempt to slander them. They also vowed to take legal action against the magazine. A day earlier, Stephane Dujarric, a spokesperson for the UN chief, said in a statement the report against Ban was “completely false and groundless” and that Ban will demand the media outlet issue an apology and drop the story. “Ban never met Park at that time and has never seen him since. During his tenure as a public official, Ban has never taken any bribes. It’s regrettable to see such a malignant report,” said officials working for Ban in a statement distributed to reporters Saturday. With less than a week left before Ban finishes his term at the UN, speculation has been rife about which political parties he would represent if he confirms his bid for the presidential election after his term ends Saturday.  Long considered a favorite for Park and her loyalists for the 2017 race, Ban has set himself apart from the pro-Park group since public outrage erupted over the corruption scandal tied to Park’s confidante Choi Soon-sil.Instead, Ban has drawn support from anti-Park Saenuri bigwigs, who have vowed to leave Saenuri this Tuesday and form a new conservative party in January. They had clashed with the pro-Park faction over control of the party after they joined the opposition parties in impeaching the president earlier this month. “If Ban comes to Korea, we will introduce him to our party and have him compete with other candidates by holding a fair primary,” former Saenuri Floor Leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min, a leading figure among Park’s dissenters, said when asked about whether the new party would work with Ban for the presidential election. Polls conducted by Joongang Ilbo also showed Saturday that Ban would choose the new conservative party over Saenuri, with 32.7 percent of respondents saying that Ban would join the new party. Only 19 percent said he would select Saenuri, while 4.3 and 6 percent said he would choose the Democratic Party and People’s Party, respectively.“I don’t think Ban would join political parties immediately upon his return to Korea,” said Realmeter Director Lee Taek-soo. “Ban’s choice will determine the outcome of rivalry between Saenuri and the new conservative party.” By Yeo Jun-suk","next year presidential election rival ,year presidential election rival parties ,presidential election rival parties ,year presidential election rival ,presidential election rival","['the United Nations', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party ’s', 'Park ’s', 'Park', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'Ban ’s', 'UN', 'Ban', 'Democratic Party ’s', 'Moon Jae - in', 'realmeter', 'Moon', 'Ban', 'post - un', 'UN', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Seoul', 'YonhapOn', 'Sisa Journal', 'Ban', 'UN', 'Park Yeon - cha', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'the Democratic Party', 'Ban', 'Park', 'Ban ’s', 'Stephane Dujarric', 'UN', 'Ban', 'Ban', 'Ban', 'Ban', 'Ban', 'UN', 'Park', 'Ban', 'Park', 'Ban', 'Saenuri', 'Ban', 'Korea', 'Saenuri Floor', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Park', 'Ban', 'Joongang Ilbo', 'Ban', 'Saenuri', 'Ban', 'Saenuri', 'the Democratic Party', 'People ’s Party', 'Ban', 'Korea', 'Lee Taek', 'ban ’s', 'Saenuri']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.14894116  0.51188409

An Hee-jung, who also served in the former liberal Roh Moo-hyun government along with Moon, claimed the idea of an immediate constitutional revision is “irrational.”Some minority party candidates, however, have claimed that a revision of the basic law is needed to fundamentally reform the nation’s political system. Among them are former Democratic Party Chairman Sohn Hak-kyu and Rep. Kim Boo-kyum, a fourth-termer in the conservative stronghold city of Daegu.The central point of dispute is the adoption of a runoff election in the upcoming presidential race.The idea of putting two finalists to a second round, in case neither attains a majority vote in the first round, has recently been suggested as a way to assure the public’s approval of the winner.It was mostly runner-up candidates who called for such reinforced competition, in an apparent move against Moon’s lead among opposition hopefuls.“Only by adopting a runoff election may we properly reflect the people’s will in the election result,” Seongnam Mayor Lee Jae-myung wrote via his Twitter account.Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo of the People’s Party, one of the strongest advocates of the runoff system, even accused Moon of dismissing the competitive system out of fear of losing his upper hand in the race.Although Moon admits the need for a runoff election, he said a constitutional revision is first needed to introduce a system that is not currently in place under current law.He also expressed disapproval of the idea of reducing the term of the incoming president from five years to three years, so as to let the following presidential election take place in 2020 along with the general election.“The reduction of the  term should be based on a constitutional revision into a Cabinet government system,” he said last week, effectively dismissing the issue for the time being.But Mayor Lee and Rep. Kim, along with Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon, all argued that given the current political situation, the next president’s term should be shortened.All three runner-up figures are considered to have relatively low chances of winning against Moon in next year’s race.By Bae Hyun-jung","upcoming presidential race the idea ,two finalists of presidential election ,in the upcoming presidential race ,the upcoming presidential race ,upcoming presidential race the","['Park Geun', 'Chun Doo - hwan', 'Park', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'South Chungcheong', 'an Hee - jung', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Moon', 'Democratic Party', 'Sohn Hak - kyu', 'Kim Boo - kyum', 'Daegu', 'Moon ’s', 'Seongnam Mayor', 'Lee Jae - myung', 'Ahn Cheol', 'the People ’s Party', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Cabinet', 'Lee', 'Kim', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Moon', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.80723131  0.37604558

It marked Thae's first public appearance since his defection to South Korea in July.North Korea conducted two nuclear tests this year alone following those in 2006, 2009 and 2013. Seoul's spy agency has said that Pyongyang is ready to carry out a sixth nuclear test at any time.Thae's comments illustrated Pyongyang's commitment to keep advancing its nuclear programs in defiance of growing UN sanctions and pressure.Thae added that the North's leader Kim Jong-un wants his country to be recognized as a nuclear state, such as Pakistan or India, a status rejected by South Korea and the U.S.""After being recognized as a nuclear state, North Korea hopes to resolve pending issues through international dialogue,"" Thae said.The nuclear talks on ending North Korea's nuclear program were last held in 2008.

But I think anyone can help out depending on their financial status,” said Song, who has been making a 5,000 won  monthly donation to children living in makeshift homes since his college days in 2009. Salvation Army volunteers appeal for donations at a kettle installed in Myeong-dong, a shopping and fashion district in Seoul. Once associated mainly with deep-pocketed big names, donating in Korea is evolving into a culture that all citizens can participate in. Some allocate part of their income to a cause via organizations such as UNICEF, Community Chest of Korea or Good Neighbors. “When I first came to Seoul, I saw the village of makeshift homes in Gangnam Province right next to the luxurious apartments. It was such a shock that I was prompted to help out,” said Song, who made his contributions via a volunteer group called Peace Camp. What individual citizens lack in personal wealth, they make up in numbers. As of last week, donations made by individuals to World Vision Korea for this year stood at around 159.2 billion won , while donations made by corporates reached about 16.9 billion won. According to the CCK, about 34.5 percent of the 471.4 billion won donation made last year was by individuals. One of the distinct advantages of small-scale donations by the public is that it is less inclined to be affected by outside factors, such as a recession or a nationwide scandal.A recent survey by the International Council for Nonprofit Managements showed that 70 percent of the respondents thought that the recent corruption scandal surrounding President Park Geun-hye and her confidante Choi Soon-sil had a negative impact on donations.“While we cannot definitively comment on the matter, the ongoing situation --- the economic slump -- is seen to be affecting the amount of overall donations,” said an official from the CCK. But while individuals’ donation to World Vision Korea took a relatively smaller hit -- about 3.6 percent compared to last year -- companies’ donations was logged at about 19.1 percent of last year. Accessibility is another factor that encourages people to participate, which owes its debt to technological advances. Many cases of donating in the digital age occur via smartphone apps, mobile crowdfunding and digital payments. The century-old Red Kettle of Salvation Army is recognized around the world as a symbol of charity, but people can now chip in digitally via a mobile application provided by Salvation Army Korea. Sometimes a financial transaction is not even required, as mobile apps like Big Walk allows users to convert their walks into funding. A 10 meter walk is translated into one Korean won; minuscule in one, massive in many.For those with a particular set of skills, even their talent can be an object of sharing. Around 2010, the word “talent donation” rose to popularity, subsequently growing into a fad adopted now by companies and individual citizens alike. While celebrities with big paychecks often make headlines with sizeable donations, their fan base can sometimes serve as a rallying point for raising funds for a cause.Fans of the actress Moon Geun-young donated 7 million won for the underprivileged in Malawi via Good Neighbors, which they raised after Moon did voluntary work in the African country.In June, the media reported that Lee Min-ho’s fans donated 11.8 million won to Holt Children’s Services to celebrate his birthday. Despite the increasing number of citizens sharing, reports indicate that donation among Koreans is still relatively low. A report released earlier this year by the Hyundai Research Institute shows that only 34.5 percent of Koreans donate, which was 25th among the 35 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.The report, however, did show that the amount of accumulated donation as of 2013 marked a consistent increase from 8.1 trillion won in 2006 to 10.3 trillion won.A study has hinted that in addition to helping others, donating may actually help the benefactor’s well-being, namely via the “warm fuzzy feeling” attested to by people who have pitched in for those less fortunate than themselves.According to a 2014 paper by the US-based National Bureau of Economic Research, emotional benefits of those who donated large sums outweighed the emotional costs, which the researchers said indicated that donation opportunities boost their well-being.

It's unclear what made him take on the issue, but he met with a group of Pentagon officials a day earlier. The remark suggests the incoming administration would provide active support for the Pentagon to modernize nuclear weapons, an expensive project that reportedly could cost as much as $1 trillion over the next 30 years.Earlier Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin also called for bolstering ""strategic nuclear forces,"" especially those capable of penetrating ""existing and future missile defense systems."" US media said the remarks by Trump and Putin suggest a new nuclear arms race.Trump's remark represents a stark departure from Obama's policy on nuclear weapons. Obama has championed a nuclear-free world, seeking to make the initiative a key legacy of his presidency. He launched the Nuclear Security Summit of world leaders aimed at reducing the stockpile of fissile material and keeping it out of the hands of terrorists, and the fourth and last Nuclear Security Summit was held in Washington earlier this year.Obama even considered officially declaring the US won't use nuclear weapons first, even though he dropped the so-called nuclear ""no first use"" proposal in the face of concerns and objections from allies and senior officials.On the contrary, Trump even suggested at one point during the campaign that South Korea and Japan could be allowed to develop their own nuclear weapons for self-defense so as to reduce American burden of helping defend the key Asian allies.The remarks had been one of the biggest sources of criticism for Trump, fueling calls in South Korea for nuclear weapons development that have arisen in the wake of North Korea's fifth nuclear test in January.Since the election, however, Trump has denied ever making those remarks.","new nuclear arms race trump ,nuclear arms race trump ,weapons obama has championed nuclear ,elect donald trump said thursday ,outgoing president barack obama championing","['US', 'Donald Trump', 'Barack Obama', '""The United States', 'trump', 'Pentagon', 'Pentagon', 'russian', 'Vladimir Putin', 'US', 'Trump', 'Putin', 'trump', 'Obama', 'Obama', 'Washington', 'US', 'Trump', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'american', 'asian', 'Trump', 'South Korea', ""North Korea 's"", 'Trump']",12,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.82413352  0.75484079

On Monday, the dissenters group proposed that Yoo should head its emergency committee and warned they would leave if the proposal is not accepted by those loyal to the president.Saenuri has been suffering from the factional feud amid Park's alleged corruption scandal, which led to her impeachment earlier this month.While the dissenters group says Saenuri should seek a full reshuffle to regain the public's trust, Park loyalists have countered that now is not the time to engage in infighting and said those that disagree should leave.""If our main goal was just to leave, we can always find excuses. But that's not our goal,"" Yoo said. Yoo served as the party's floor leader in 2015 and was forced to step down over disagreements with the president.Political pundits said the dissenters group will also need time to win the support of more lawmakers, as South Korean parties must secure at least 20 lawmakers to establish a negotiation body at the National Assembly.Yoo said he is also open to staying in the party and reforming it.""But if Park loyalists, including new floor leader Chung Woo-taik, only chase their political interests and remain reluctant to reform, there will be no hope,"" Yoo said.Chung, a Park loyalist, was elected the new whip through an in-house vote, which came as a disappointment for impeachment supporters. His predecessor Chung Jin-suk, who is viewed as neutral, stepped down in response to the passage of the impeachment.The new whip, meanwhile, said Yoo need to come up with detailed plans on how he will resolve the factional feud.""I do not intend to side only with the pro-Park faction,"" Chung said, adding he will seek to persuade both factions on the designation of the emergency committee chief.Chung has been claiming that the factional feud could actually escalate once Yoo heads the committee.

While the Saenuri’s reformist members demanded clarification, the opposition circle argued that the disputed members should be ousted immediately from the related parliamentary committee.The ruling Saenuri Party’s Reps. Chang Je-won, Ha Tae-keung and Hwang Young-cheul, all members of the parliamentary committee probing into the Choi Soon-sil scandal, demand Monday for clarification on the perjury allegations of some committee members. Korean media outlet Monthly JoongAng revealed Sunday that Rep. Yi Wan-young, a Park loyalist of the ruling party, directed K-Sports Foundation’s former Chairman Jeong Dong-chun to give a false testimony over a key piece of evidence -- a tablet PC which had allegedly belonged to Choi. According to the media outlet, Choi’s former associate Ko Young-tae claimed that Yi had told Jeong to testify that the PC containing confidential documents from the presidential office belonged to Ko, not Choi.“A Saenuri lawmaker and a K-Sport official will say  that they saw me carry around the disputed PC,” Ko was quoted as saying. Two days after the release of the interview, Rep. Lee Man-hee of the Saenuri Party questioned Park Heon-young, an employee of the foundation, at the National Assembly. Park answered that the PC was Ko’s, just as he had predicted, raising suspicions that Rep. Lee was also involved in the conspiracy.However, the Saenuri members denied all charges.“I have never told anyone to falsify testimonies. I did hear from Jeong that the tablet PC may be Ko’s, but I did not think of it as credible information,” he told reporters at an emergency press conference Monday. “I did not prepare any questions on that issue for the hearing.”Parliamentary hearing committee Chairman Rep. Kim Sung-tae held an emergency investigation to clear up doubts, as some reformist figures of the Saenuri had also called for a thorough probe earlier in the day. Members of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, however, did not attend the emergency investigation, lashing out at the ruling party instead. It demanded the two lawmakers be ousted from the parliamentary inquiry committee on the Choi scandal.“It would clearly constitute a criminal act, if the committee members colluded with witnesses to make false testimonies, instead of finding out the truth on behalf of the people, as they should,” said the party’s Floor Leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho in the morning. He also said that the two Saenuri lawmakers should reveal the conversations they allegedly had with key witnesses.The committee decided to summon the two lawmakers to the upcoming hearing Thursday. “If they fail to offer a valid explanation, the two should resign ,” said Rep.

The Constitutional Court is currently reviewing the legitimacy of the motion and has up to 180 days to deliver a ruling. Park was accused of allowing Choi to exert undue influence on state affairs.The president then said the motion itself violated clear rules that ban ""guilt by association"" as well as ""presumption of innocence,"" strongly suggesting a media bias and that lawmakers carried out the impeachment without actually checking evidence.Park, moreover, claimed she was not aware of any wrongdoings committed by those around her, and referred to Choi as a ""kitchen cabinet"" member or informal adviser, which is commonplace in countries like the United States.""Any attempt to delay the Constitutional Court's proceedings will not be tolerated,"" Rep.

The trial of Choi will kick off this week, with the Seoul Central District Court holding official preparations for her trial on Monday. Legal discussions between the prosecution and Choi’s lawyer -- who claimed that the charges were “not facts, but stories” -- is expected, but it is unclear if the accused will appear at the court.Rep. Kwon Sung-dong , head of a special parliamentary team for President Park Geun-hye's impeachment trial, presides over the first meeting of the team's nine lawmakers and about 20 legal professionals at the National Assembly in Seoul on Sunday. Choi, Park’s long-time friend, is suspected of using her relationship with Park to meddle in state affairs -- including having state projects allocated to people related to her -- and coerce local corporations into making donations to the Mir and K-Sports foundations, which authorities believe were used to channel funds to her.The investigation led by an independent counsel Park Young-soo is also to officially kick off this week. The team’s spokesman Lee Kyu-chul hinted the actual probe can start during the preparation period that ends on Tuesday.When asked if the team may summon its first witness this week, Lee said “there is a possibility.” He added that conglomerate chiefs -- that made donations to causes related to Choi -- can “of course be summoned if necessary.”Suspicions that the donations made by the companies are actually bribes for Park and Choi’s inner circles are considered to be key in the independent counsel’s investigations. President Park was impeached by the parliament on Dec. 9 for the scandal. In her first legal argument made to the Constitutional Court, which was revealed to the public Sunday, she claimed to have done nothing that deserves impeachment. She claimed to have no knowledge of Choi‘s alleged wrongdoings and said she may have consulted with Choi on a personal level, but never undermined the democratic value because it was her who made the final decisions regarding state affairs.Litigation process on Park’s former aide An Chong-bum -- suspected of working with Choi under the president’s orders -- and key figures in favoritism allegations Cha Eun-taek and Song Sung-gak are also to take place Monday.While not yet indicted, Park’s former aides Woo Byung-woo and Kim Ki-choon are suspected of knowingly condoning, or even helping Choi in her wrongdoings. Woo is expected to be the main feature in Thursday’s parliamentary hearing, as he has snubbed the National Assembly’s repeated subpoenas. The past four hearings have been disputed as “pointless,” with key witnesses like Woo, An, Choi, Choi’s family members, including daughter Chung Yoo-ra, all failing to show up.Woo in particular, has gone “missing” after the parliament formally summoned him, which roused suspicion that he is abusing a loop in the law that states a parliamentary summon on a person takes effect only after the cited person has received the documents.Woo last week told the National Assembly that he will appear before the lawmakers. Another person slated to make her first appearance is a medical officer surnamed Cho, currently in a training program in Texas, US. Cho was an officer stationed at Cheong Wa Dae during the 2014 sinking of the Sewol ferry, and her presence was requested by the lawmakers for questioning on what Park had been doing during the worst maritime disaster in Korean history.Park’s mysterious seven-hour absence from public has sparked suspicion that she was partaking in actions not related to the rescue operation. The Constitution states that the president is obliged to protect the lives and safety of the people during a national crisis.Repeat witnesses like Ko Young-tae, considered the closest confidant of Choi Soon-sil, will also be making an appearance. Ko touched off another controversy by telling local media last week that Saenuri lawmaker Lee Man-hee -- a Park loyalist -- had conspired with an official from the K-Sports Foundation to falsify testimonies at the hearing. According to Ko’s interview, which took place on Tuesday but was published Saturday, Rep. Lee told the official that he will ask him about Choi’s tablet PC -- a key piece of evidence in the scandal that held classified presidential and governmental documents. The official reportedly was instructed to say that he had seen Ko carry the tablet PC in question, supposedly to back Choi’s claim that the device is not hers.The actual conversation between the two had occurred as implied in the interview. Rep. Lee has denied the allegations. In a press conference Sunday, Lee claimed not to have personally contacted the official in question or instructed him to state a false testimony.He vowed to take legal actions against Ko and the media outlet that published the interview.

Here's a look at five ways the country that has now been ruled by three generations of Kim -- starting with grandfather Kim Il-sung -- has changed since the ascension of its 30-something ""respected marshal.""    THE MAN HIMSELFKim Jong-un is in some ways a lot more like his charismatic and gregarious, albeit brutal and megalomaniacal, grandfather than Kim Jong Il. He has gone out of his way to milk that resemblance, right down to adopting his trademark haircut from a seemingly bygone era. While his father almost never spoke in public, Kim Jong-un has done so on any number of occasions, including a four-hour address at his ruling party's congress in May. On the flip side, one of his most important moves to consolidate power -- the execution of his powerful uncle and the purges that ensued -- demonstrated both his personal independence and his willingness to employ the same kind of oppressive tools that were the hallmarks of both his father and grandfather. And, despite a short-lived friendship with former NBA bad boy Dennis Rodman, he has yet to travel abroad or meet a foreign head of state.  People bow to portraits of the late leaders, Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, at the Kim Il-sung Square in Pyongyang, North Korea, Saturday, to mark the fifth anniversary of Kim Jong-il's death. NUKES, MISSILES AND ROCKETSTurning North Korea into a nuclear power wasn't Kim Jong-un's idea -- it almost certainly originated with Kim Il-sung himself -- but it's defined his first five years. Of the five nuclear tests North Korea has conducted, three have been under his watch and two, including its most powerful to date and its first of what Pyongyang claims was an H-bomb, were this year. Kim Jong-un's North Korea has been sprinting to the finish line of a viable nuclear arsenal and the advanced missile technology needed to attack South Korea, Japan and the 50,000 US troops it hosts, the key US military outpost of Guam and the US mainland itself. At the same time, and some argue for largely the same reasons, the North under Kim has also joined the space race, putting satellites into orbit and aiming to reach the moon within the next decade.  SHIFTING PRIORITIESNorth Korea's main motto under Kim Jong Il was ""Military First."" Under Kim Jong-un, the focus is now on building more and better nukes and bolstering the national economy, in large part through developing science and technology. To suit his goals, Kim has shifted more power to the ruling party and to his Cabinet and put the nation on collective overtime with repeated ""loyalty campaigns.'' It remains to be seen how sustainable his two-pronged nukes-and-butter policy will be in the face of international sanctions and internal, systemic weaknesses. So far, it has been at least workable. The North is already a de-facto nuclear state and its economy, though fragile and no doubt underperforming, is showing small but persistent growth. FOSTERING MARKETS AND ENTREPRENUREURSProbably more out of pragmatic necessity than anything else, Kim Jong-un has allowed capitalist-style markets and entrepreneurialism to expand, invigorating the domestic economy and creating new revenue streams for the government, which profits by either taking a cut or by directly supporting such enterprises. Changes in farming policy that let individuals personally benefit from bigger harvests have boosted agricultural output. The relatively affluent capital of Pyongyang -- home to the North's most fortunate -- has seen a significant increase in everything from taxis to coffee shops and streets stalls. But the rise of the ""cash masters,'' an empowered middle class more open to capitalist ideals, or just more determined to acquire material wealth, could prove to be a problem for Kim down the road.     KEEPING THE MASSES ENTERTAINEDKim Jong-un has on several occasions vowed to make North Korea a ""more civilized'' nation. His signature development projects include an equestrian center and sprawling water park in Pyongyang and a luxury ski resort near the port city of Wonsan on the east coast. He has tried to give his regime something of a softer face through the all-female Moranbong Band, which sings its odes to him in a decidedly pop, and vaguely titillating, manner. Kim also generated a major national sensation by ordering a Disney-quality update to the ""Boy General'' anime series originally commissioned by his father. On another major front, Kim has made a big shift toward sports -- vowing North Korea will become a major international sports power -- presumably as a means of bolstering health and national pride and providing the masses with a relatively innocuous diversion from their daily lives.","megalomaniacal grandfather than kim jong ,five years since north korean ,years since north korean leader ,death of his father kim ,brutal and megalomaniacal grandfather","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Kim Jong - il', 'Kim', 'Kim Il - sung', 'Kim Jong Il', 'Kim Jong - un', 'NBA', 'Dennis Rodman', 'Kim Il - sing', 'Kim Jong - il', 'Kim Il - sing', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', ""Kim Jong - il 's"", 'North Korea', ""Kim Jong - un 's"", 'Kim Il - sing', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', ""Kim Jong - un 's"", 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'US', 'US', 'Guam', 'US', 'Kim', ""PRIORITIESNorth Korea 's"", 'Kim Jong Il', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Kim', 'Cabinet', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Pyongyang', 'Kim', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Wonsan', 'Moranbong Band', 'Kim', 'Disney', 'the "" Boy General \'\'', 'Kim', 'North Korea']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67783254  0.72577107

In the eighth Saturday rally in central Seoul against the embattled president, rally organizers said they would also call for the resignation of acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, denouncing him as an “accomplice” to Park.An association of 1,500 civic groups plan to stage a candlelight vigil at the Gwanghwamun Square starting from 5 p.m., with several pre-rallies planned in the afternoon to call for the abolishment of the controversial police pushed by the Park administration. As in previous rallies, they plan to march toward Cheong Wa Dae, as close as 100 meters from it through 11 routes. The protestors will march near the Constitutional Court building to step up pressure on it to make a ruling rapidly and near the prime minister’s office to demand he resign. A left-wing news outlet had reported on allegations that Hwang peddled influence over the prosecution when he was serving as justice minister in April 2014. He allegedly forced investigators not to charge maritime police officers, who failed to save passengers from the sinking ferry Sewol, with professional negligence. Hwang denied the allegations in a statement. Protesters hold up slogans asking for President Park Geun-hye's ouster on Dec. 10, the day after the parliament passed the impeachment bill. YonhapSouth Korean lawmakers on Dec. 9 voted to impeach Park, with the approval of 234 lawmakers from the 300-seat National Assembly. Park was stripped of presidential authority and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn is serving as acting president. Now, the fate of her presidency is left to the Constitutional Court as the impeachment requires its final approval, which could take up to 180 days.As the police have banned the rallies near the acting president’s office and the court, rally organizers are awaiting a court’s decision on the ban.

There are possibilities for clashes as some 50 conservative groups supporting President Park plan to stage a large-scale rally from 10 a.m. near Anguk Station and march toward the presidential office. South Koreans have taken to the streets relentlessly and lit candles across the nation for the past seven weeks to call for Park’s ouster, with cumulative participation standing at about 7 million, according to the rally organizers.Despite the passage of the impeachment vote, many of the protesters vowed to hold up candles until Park voluntarily resigns and those who assisted her in committing wrongdoings are held accountable.President Park has been criticized for colluding with Choi Soon-sil, who has neither an official government post nor policy background, to extort money from conglomerates and let her meddle in state affairs.By Ock Hyun-ju","after lawmakers impeached president park ,week after lawmakers impeached president ,lawmakers impeached president park geun ,lawmakers impeached president park ,protestors holding anti park rallies","['Park Geun', 'South Koreans', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Seoul', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Park', 'Constitutional Court', 'Hwang', 'Park Geun', 'YonhapSouth korean', 'Park', 'National Assembly', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'the Constitutional Court', 'anti - park', 'Park', 'Anguk Station', 'South Koreans', 'Park', 'Park', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.20464247  0.4122532

Chung Jin-suk resigned as floor leader taking responsibility for the impeachment of Park last Friday over alleged corruption.Pundits said the victory of Park allies despite the impeachment may prompt their rivals to leave Saenuri in droves and establish their own party.The new floor leader is set to serve as an acting chief if party chairman Lee Jung-hyun and other members of the Supreme Council, mostly pro-Park figures, resign on Friday.Former Saenuri head and anti-Park leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung earlier expressed his willingness to found a new party. Former floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min also said he will ponder his future path, hinting at a possible defection from the party.Some pundits bet they may end up choosing to stay as their division would hurt conservatives' election prospects. The presidential election, originally slated for December, may take place earlier if the Constitutional Court finalizes Park's ouster.One of the challenges looming over the new Saenuri whip is its relationship with opposition parties. The opposition bloc has been delaying talks with Saenuri on normalizing state affairs, dismissing Park loyalists as their counterparts.""We cannot accept them as counterparts for discussion,"" the main opposition Democratic Party said in a statement after the election.""There will be no dialogue and exchanges,"" Rep.

The businessman-turned-politician has a broader boundary of his behavior than that of his predecessors, including Barack Obama, who has clear Chinese and North Korean guidelines and moved accordingly.But Trump has been acting in a totally different way, said Cho.

He downplayed concerns that South Korea backtracking on the plans would cause tension with the United States, which he said was the ""most important country'' for South Korea in face of nuclear-armed, rival North. ""The issue of whether or not to deploy THAAD should be pushed to the next government,'' Moon said in a news conference.""Reconsidering THAAD would have to be preceded with diplomatic efforts, including diplomatic efforts with the United States. I don't think that the reconsidering of THAAD would harm the South Korea-U.S. alliance,'' he said. Recent opinion polls have shown Moon as a presidential favorite amid the popular anger over conservative President Park Geun-hye, whose powers were suspended after lawmakers last week voted to impeach her over an explosive corruption scandal. South Korea's Constitutional Court has up to six months to decide whether Park should permanently step down. If Park is formally removed from office, the country would hold a presidential election within 60 days.Moon, who conceded the 2012 presidential race to Park, said he expected the court to rule on Park's impeachment sometime between late January and early March, setting up a presidential election around April or May. ""It would be a huge honor for me if I can take part in the next presidential election,'' Moon said. South Korean military officials in September picked a private golf course in the country's southeast as the site for THAAD, which was slated to be deployed by the end of next year. They originally chose a nearby artillery base in the rural farming town of Seongju as the site for the system, but changed locations following fierce protests from locals who expressed concern over potential health hazards they believe the system's powerful radar might cause.The plan to deploy THAAD in South Korea has angered not only North Korea but also China, which suspects that the system would allow U.S. radar to better track its missiles. Russia also opposes the deployment.Moon also argued that Seoul should put dialogue over sanctions in persuading Pyongyang to give up its nuclear ambitions. He rated the Park government's hard-line stance against North Korea as a ``complete failure'' because it ``didn't function in any way'' to prevent the North from expanding its nuclear weapons and missile programs. ""It has been confirmed that pressure and sanctions alone would not be enough to influence North Korea to give up on its nuclear weapons,'' said Moon, calling for a ""two-tack approach'' of sanctions and talk. ""We need strong punitive measures against North Korea's nuclear tests and missile launch tests, but the purpose of such strong pressure and sanctions should be bringing North Korea to the negotiation table for denuclearization.'' Moon, a former human rights lawyer and aide to late liberal President Roh Moo-hyun, also pledged to fight income inequality and push business reforms to curb excesses of ``chaebol,'' or family-owned conglomerates that dominate the country's economy, to create a level playing field for smaller companies. The opposition Democratic Party's primaries could shape into a showdown between Moon and Lee Jae-myung, the outspoken mayor of Seongnam city whose popularity rose rapidly in recent months amid rage over the Park scandal. The conservatives appear to be pinning their hopes on outgoing U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon after Park's scandal complicated politics for her Saenuri Party. In a visit to South Korea in May, Ban told reporters that he would ""think hard about what to do as a citizen'' after he returns home on Jan. 1, which was seen by the local media as a clear hint on a presidential bid.","korean presidential contender said thursday ,south korean presidential contender ,anger over conservative president park ,possible south korean presidential contender ,korean presidential contender","['SEOUL', 'South Korea', 'south korean', 'U.S.', 'north korean', 'Washington', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Terminal high - Altitude Area Defense', 'China', 'Russia', 'South Korea', 'the United States', 'South Korea', 'Moon', 'the United States', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Moon', 'Park Geun - hye', ""South Korea 's"", 'Constitutional Court', 'Park', 'Moon', 'Park', 'Park', 'Moon', 'south korean', 'Seongju', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'China', 'U.S.', 'Russia', 'Moon', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'Moon', ""North Korea 's"", 'North Korea', 'Roh Moo - hyun', ""Democratic Party 's"", 'Moon', 'Lee Jae - myung', 'Seongnam', 'U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Park', 'Saenuri Party', 'South Korea', 'Ban']",14,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.50374287  0.57292855

Lee is among the three justices of the Constitutional Court chosen to lead preparations for the impeachment trial. Lee Jin-sung President Park, embroiled in a cronyism scandal involving her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil, was impeached by the parliament last Friday amid public fury and reproach. While nearly 8 in 10 South Koreans want her gone, the embattled president is determined to fight for her job and name at the court. She denies all eight criminal charges that state prosecutors investigating her scandal has raised against her. Right now, Park is exempt from criminal liability as sitting head of state, but she will become subject to, once the top court confirms her impeachment. The phase that Justice Lee used -- “in the name of the people” -- appears to be a theoretical reference to the Article 1 and Clause 2 of the Korean Constitution: “The sovereignty of the Republic of Korea shall reside in the people and all state authority shall emanate from the people.” Justices of the Constitutional Court are meeting daily this week, with Lee and two others preparing to set dates for pretrial hearing sessions next week. They are waiting for written statements from two related parties -- the sanctioned president and the National Assembly -- plus the Justice Ministry, in order to get a grip on their key arguments and opinions on the case.

February, April, June and AugustThe race to choose President Park’s successor was originally set for Dec. 20, 2017, but this election day is likely to be moved to somewhere between February and August.According to the Public Official Election Act, presidential elections are to be held on the first Wednesday within 70 days ahead of the incumbent president’s end of term.Since the 13th presidential race in 1987, which was the nation’s first-ever experience of electing a state leader through a democratic vote rather than a coup, the corresponding date has been the third Wednesday of December.The most conservative scenario at this point in time is that the Constitutional Court will finalize its decision -- whether to uphold the impeachment or reject it -- by the legal deadline of June 6, 2017, or 180 days after the passing of the parliament’s impeachment bill.Then, presuming the minimum period required for election campaigning, the vote could happen in August at the latest.With mounting public pressure and concerns of a state affairs vacuum, however, it has been speculated that the top court will act quickly and come up with a ruling as early as January, in which case the presidential poll could be moved forward to March or April.There had previously been talks of Park’s voluntary resignation, whether in immediate effect or by April next year, which would have led to a February or June election, but Park has now said she will not step down, impeachment or not.Front-runners losing momentumIronically, it is the leading presidential hopefuls who seem to have suffered a blow from the likelihood of an early election.Among them is Moon Jae-in, former chairman of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea. According to a survey conducted by local pollster Realmeter last week, Moon maintained his lead for six weeks straight, with his support standing at 23.1 percent, the highest in the past six months.But it was also precisely due to his uptrend that Moon has found it hard to raise his voice during the period of impeachment rallies. Lest his claim be seen as reflecting his ambition in a presidential bid, Moon refrained from making aggressive remarks against Park or her ruling Saenuri Party, an attitude perceived by many as lukewarm and timid.Another uncertain variable in the top tier is outgoing UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.The international figure has so far never gone further than a vague promise to “serve” his country after his current term ends, but has kept his spot within the top three all throughout the year.Realmeter’s survey last week showed him to have 18.8 percent support, which was down from his former lead but still ahead of the second-tier runners, such as Ahn Cheol-soo and Lee Jae-myung.Ban’s dilemma is contrary to Moon’s. While Moon may possibly enjoy the lasting aftermath of the widely cheered impeachment, Ban could use more time to resettle himself in domestic political circles and gear up for campaigning.He is also left to decide whether he would stay independent and build up a new power group, or unify with one of the standing entities -- given that he will no longer join the Saenuri Party’s pro-Park Geun-hye faction, as had largely been speculated.The rise of minority candidatesThe president’s impeachment, in fact, opened the door to a number of second movers who found a chance to speak up during the weekslong state confusion leading up to the parliamentary vote last Friday.The most conspicuous star was Lee Jae-myung, the outspoken liberal mayor of Gyeonggi Province’s Seongnam City.A survey conducted by pollster Gallup Korea last week showed Lee to be the third-strongest presidential candidate, with 18 percent support, quickly catching up to Moon and Ban. This was a jump of 13 percentage points from his 5 percent in October, before the presidential aides’ corruption scandal broke out.His straightforward way of speaking especially appealed to young liberal voters who were seeking an alternative to the more reserved Moon.But due to his relatively volatile support base and limited political career, Lee is also said to be considering unity with other minority liberal figures, such as Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon, South Chungcheong Gov. An Hee-jung and Democratic Party lawmaker Rep. Kim Boo-kyum.In contrast to the Democratic Party, which seems to be crowded with candidates, the Saenuri Party is concerned over a lack of them. The situation is particularly desperate for the pro-Park faction, which has been driven into a corner upon Park‘s impeachment.With Ban likely to be out of the picture, some are said to be turning their eyes to Hwang Kyo-ahn, the prime minister filling in for the suspended president.Hwang, with his close affiliation with the president and low popularity, has never been counted as a relevant figure for the race.But voices are increasing from the ruling camp that if he succeeds in proving himself a valid alternative state chief, Hwang may possibly rise to the qualification.Overseas voters counted outMeanwhile, the voters too face multiple challenges in case of an early presidential election, one of them being the exclusion of overseas voters.Under the current Public Official Election Act, nationals residing abroad may only participate in regularly scheduled elections, a rule to undergo a change only in 2018.This means that the 158,000 overseas voters who cast ballots in the 2012 elections will not be part of the next presidential selection, regardless of what month it is to be held in.By Bae Hyun-jung","ambition in presidential bid moon ,augustthe race to choose president ,next presidential election likely to ,ambition in presidential bid ,next presidential election","['Park Geun', 'AugustThe', 'the Public Official Election Act', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Park', 'Park', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'realmeter', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Park', 'Saenuri Party', 'UN', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Lee Jae - myung', 'Ban', 'Moon ’s', 'Moon', 'Ban', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'pro - park Geun - hye', 'Lee Jae - myung', 'Gyeonggi Province ’s', 'Seongnam City', 'Gallup Korea', 'Lee', 'Moon', 'Ban', 'Moon', 'Lee', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'an Hee - jung', 'Democratic Party', 'Kim Boo - kyum', 'the Democratic Party', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Ban', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Hwang', 'Hwang', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62108618  0.42632431

Woo is among the witnesses being summoned for a parliamentary inquiry session on Dec. 22. Woo Byung-woo The former prosecutor who served the now-impeached Park as senior secretary for civil affairs had previously nixed repeated calls for his attendance at a parliamentary hearing and went into hiding. Some opposition lawmakers had even promised a cash reward for tips on his whereabouts.  Woo was allegedly handpicked by Choi Soon-sil, President Park’s infamous friend at the center of the corruption scandal, for the powerful job of overseeing the inspection of many government agencies, including the prosecution. Park was impeached by the parliament last week on allegations that she allowed Choi, who holds no public positoin and has no policy background, to meddle in state affairs. While many of Park’s former aides are under arrest and facing criminal charges, Woo has remained unscathed so far.Woo claimed that was not able to testify “due to rules that bar him from making public comments related to his job at the presidential office.”Opposition lawmakers serving at the bipartisan inquiry committee said that he has yet to notify them of his attendance. “He has not told us that he will attend the inquiry,” said Rep. Kim Kyung-jin, who represents the runner-up opposition People’s Party at the committee. “He just said to a reporter close to him. I don’t think it is his official position.” Woo also faces other allegations, including an accusation he embezzled money from a real estate company run by his family and that he abused his power to help his son secure an easy assignment during his mandatory military service. Woo has denied all allegations. Now that Woo has decided to step up to the plate, the bipartisan committee has set their focus on the allegations surrounding the president that could prove to be crucial during her upcoming impeachment trial: Park’s missing seven hours during the Sewol ferry tragedy. The partisan committee is to hold a parliamentary inquiry Wednesday to find out whether Park neglected her duties to oversee rescue operations for seven hours during the 2014 Sewol ferry disaster which saw more than 300 people killed or missing. Even though the presidential office claimed Park oversaw the situation at her private residence, rumors are rife that Park might have been doing something else. Once such rumor is that she was receiving plastic surgery with assistance from military medical officers during the nation’s worst-ever maritime disaster. Cheong Wa Dae said last month that Park received briefings or issued directives related to the rescue operation. But it showed the president was not briefed by anyone in person and did not hold a meeting while the nation watched the ferry slowly sink on live TV, with hundreds of students on a class trip trapped inside.“Given that the president was only briefed by paper, not in person, the president was not aware of the situation. It means that the president neglected her constitutional duty to protect the people’s lives and safety,” said the impeachment motion drafted by the opposition parties. The committee summoned top presidential aides and presidential medical staff, who had worked at Cheong Wa Dae during the Sewol tragedy, in the hopes that they would provide exact information about the president’s whereabouts during the seven hours. Among the listed witnesses are Kim Jang-soo, former chief of Presidential National Security Office, and Kim Seok-kyun, former chief of the Coast Guard who handled the rescue operation.

Adding more chaos to the conservative camp, which is on the verge of a breakup, the party’s Floor Leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk called it quits, saying he wanted to take responsibility for the president’s impeachment. “The governing party bears the same amount of responsibility as the president, when the president is suspended from office,” Rep. Chung said. The party’s chief policymaker Kim Gwang-lim also expressed his intention to quit. Infighting over control of the party has been raging at Saenuri, following the parliamentary impeachment of President Park last week. A group of lawmakers opposing the current leadership led by Rep. Lee Jung-hyun singled out eight party members, including the party chief, as “the entourage” of the president’s now-infamous confidante Choi Soon-sil, calling for their immediate ouster from the party. Choi, a friend of Park for 40 years, is alleged to have manipulated power from behind the scenes. “They have manipulated the government system, betrayed the people’s mandate and neglected the Choi Soon-sil scandal,” said Rep. Hwang Young-chul, a second-term lawmaker who represents the dissenting group. “They have to leave the party immediately.” Rep. Hwang Young-chul of the Saenuri Party. YonhapThe eight accused are: Saenuri Chairman Lee, two Supreme Council members, Reps. Cho Won-jin and Lee Jang-woo, and Reps. Seo Chung-won, Choi Kyung-hwan, Hong Moon-jong, Yoon Sang-hyun and Kim Jin-tae. They are key figures representing the party’s mainstream faction loyal to President Park. Dominating leadership positions in the party, they had previously wielded influence over the party’s decisions, but have recently been under mounting criticism, with the president’s fall from grace. Yet, throughout the presidential scandal, they stood steadfastly behind Park and refused to give up leadership positions in Saenuri. Party chief Lee, along with the others, refused to step down from their positions or leave the party. Instead, they demanded the departure of Reps. Kim Moo-sung and Yoo Seung-min, the two bigwigs of the rebels’ group who were once the president’s key allies. “I think they are the epitome of betrayal and treason,” said Rep. Lee Jang-woo who sits on the party’s top decision-making Supreme Council. The conservative party’s factional feud was evident, when the parliament passed the motion to impeach Park in a surprising 234-56 vote. This means that at least 62 Saenuri lawmakers voted for the motion in a secret ballot, which almost doubled the expectations of the faction that supported the opposition-mounted bill. The three opposition parties and independents control 172 votes in the 300-seat National Assembly. It was not the first time that Saenuri’s factional strife has made headlines. In the lead-up to the general election that took place in April, they clashed over how to nominate candidates for the election. After the pro-Park faction refused to nominate anti-Park lawmakers, they decided to quit and run as independents. But some experts say that neither faction will bolt from Saenuri and form a new political entity. “I don’t think we will see the party split,” said Lee Sang-hui, a political analyst who worked as a presidential aide during the previous Lee Myung-bak government. “Building a new party requires massive money and legitimate cause. I don’t think both factions have them.” By Yeo Jun-suk","president impeachment the governing party ,following the impeachment of president ,the president now infamous confidante ,the president impeachment the governing ,president impeachment the governing","['Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'Chung', 'Kim Gwang - lim', 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'Choi', 'Park', 'Hwang Young', 'Hwang Young', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri', 'Lee', 'Supreme Council', 'Cho Won - jin', 'Lee Jang - woo', 'seo Chung - won', 'Choi Kyung - hwan', 'Hong Moon - jong', 'Yoon Sang - hyun', 'Kim Jin - tae', 'Park', 'Saenuri', 'Party', 'Lee', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'Yoo Seung - min', 'Lee Jang - woo', 'Supreme Council', 'Park', 'Saenuri', 'National Assembly', 'Saenuri', 'anti - park', 'Saenuri', 'Lee Sang - hui', 'Lee Myung - bak']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.7067349   0.3252936

Eight of the nine justices -- all except Kim Yi-su who is visiting Peru -- turned up at the court during the weekend. They are expected to discuss the deliberation schedule, the planned operation of a task force and other related issues. Kang Il-won, the chief justice on the case, cut short his business trip to Venice and returned home Saturday. Upon his arrival, he met with the court’s president, Park Han-chul, to review the case, officials said. “I am well aware of this case’s meaning and significance,” Kang told reporters as he appeared at the court in central Seoul late Saturday. “I will do my best so that the court will make the correct, righteous decision in a speedy manner according to the Constitution and law.” Shortly before entering his office Sunday, he said he came to finish examining records and sorting out materials for Monday’s session. Soon after the bill’s passage Friday, the court convened a meeting and asked the president to submit answers to its questionnaire within a week, shorter than the 10 days given to President Roh Moo-hyun in 2004.  “During the first gathering, which seven of the nine attended, they agreed on the need to process the case impartially and promptly for the safeguard and upkeep of the Constitution,” court spokesperson Bae Bo-yoon said. For the motion’s ultimate approval, at least seven judges must attend a trial and six must give consent. The court is required to provide its verdict within 180 days, or until June 6, but it might come earlier given high public and political demand. Opposition parties are ramping up pressure for an early ruling. While urging Park’s voluntary resignation, Rep. Choo Mi-ae, chairwoman of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, has said the decision should be made no later than the end of January to “avoid uncertainties” and put state affairs back on track as soon as possible. Her remarks apparently reflect concerns over the forthcoming retirements of two justices, scheduled for January and March. But whether acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn is entitled to nominate their successors remains in question. If they are not replaced, the motion would require the endorsement of six of the remaining seven judges, thus lowering the chances of its approval. “For an early normalization of state governance, the Constitutional Court should give advanced approval,” Choo wrote via her Facebook account Sunday. “It has been revealed that President Park has made a grave violation of the Constitution and thus is no longer qualified to protect it. ... The purpose of the impeachment trial is to swiftly restore the constitutional government.” Other opposition big shots echoed her view, including former chiefs of the minor opposition People’s Party, Reps. Ahn Cheol-soo and Park Jie-won, and Democratic Party Floor Leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho. A rapid court process is essential to minimize a vacuum in state leadership and stabilize the situation in line with the people’s wishes, they said. Protest organizers reiterated Sunday their pledge to continue mass rallies until Park is ousted, stressing the need for stringent monitoring of the court’s activities. But the ruling Saenuri Party displayed discomfort with the opposition calls, urging the other parties to refrain from making any attempt to influence the justices. Saenuri Floor Leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk also said the trial should be wholly left to the court and politicians ought not to present any “direction or guideline” one way or another. “The opposition would face the people and Constitution’s merciless judgment should it attempt an anti-constitutional offensive and rash presidential race, capitalizing on public anger,” party spokesman Rep. Kim Sung-won said in a statement later in the day. Meanwhile, Hwang moved ahead with his takeover of state affairs during the weekend, as he was briefed on various government tasks and held meetings with a focus on security. His emphasis on security is deemed a bid to veer away from internal issues, wary of the opposition and public’s criticism of his failure to keep the Choi Soon-sil scandal at bay throughout his four years in government, including as the justice minister. Concerns are growing over stalled summit diplomacy and a possible vacuum in foreign and security policy leadership at a delicate time. A presidential transition is taking place in Washington and China appears to be continuing to retaliate for Seoul’s plan to station a US missile shield. On Saturday, the acting president and prime minister met with Park’s Chief of Staff Han Kwang-ok, Office for Government Policy Coordination Minister Lee Suk-joon and other top officials from Cheong Wa Dae and the Prime Minister’s Office. They consulted on how to divide functions and protocol and escort issues, among others. Hwang then convened his second Cabinet meeting since the impeachment motion was adopted. Singling out national security as the “most important and urgent matter at this point,” he once again cautioned against North Korea’s possible military and cyberattacks aimed at taking advantage of the South’s nationwide uproar.  On Sunday, he visited the headquarters of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Seoul. “A small ant hole may tear down a great embankment,” Hwang told military commanders during the visit. “I want you to maintain a solid security posture such as by tightening vigilance so that the North could not miscalculate our domestic situation and commit a reckless provocation.”  With Park unable to attend a weekly meeting with top presidential secretaries, the acting president plans to preside over a ministerial gathering to oversee the current situation Monday, his office said.

A tough legal battle looms, as the president, embroiled in a corruption and nepotism scandal involving her secret confidante Choi Soon-sil, is determined to defend her job and name. Legal issues aside, observers say the court itself is stacked against forces that want Park gone as soon as possible. Two factors come into play: The ideological makeup of the justices and the expected departure early next year of two of them. In a survey of six Constitutional law experts, conducted by The Korea Herald last month, three said the court was likely to approve Park’s impeachment. Two refrained from making predictions, while one said the impeachment could be overturned by the court due to the two factors. Chief Justice Park Han-chul  and Justice Kang Il-won enter the Constitutional Court in Seoul on Sunday. Conservative judgesPark’s ultimate removal from office requires consent from at least six of the nine judges of the Constitutional Court. Of the nine, seven are considered to be right-leaning and pro-government. They are those appointed by President Park, her predecessor Lee Myung-bak, the conservative governing party, or the chief justice of Supreme Court, who was named by Park or Lee. Such a composition -- different from the equivalent system in other democracies like Germany where lawmakers elect all the judges -- presents an uphill battle to forces campaigning to unseat Park. On top of that, the court’s independence and political neutrality have been thrown into question recently. A memo left behind by a now deceased presidential aide claimed that Kim Ki-choon, Park’s chief of staff until last year, gave a directive to the chief justice of the Constitutional Court in 2014, ahead of the court’s ruling to dissolve a small leftist party accused of supporting North Korea. Kim has denied any interference with the judiciary branch. The Constitutional Court has taken a conservative stance on other divisive issues. In 2012, the judges ruled that punishment of medical professionals who performed an abortion was constitutional. More recently in 2015, it upheld a lower court’s decision to strip a union of some 60,000 liberal-minded teachers of its legal status, saying it has eight members who are no longer teachers. Because of this, even opposition lawmakers who wanted Park gone were at first reluctant to campaign for her impeachment. “I’m not fully confident that the court will approve the impeachment,” said opposition People’s Party Floor Leader Rep. Park Jie-won. “If the conservative judges reject the motion, it would be like giving Park immunity.” The Constitution states that the approval of the parliamentary impeachment of the president requires consent from six, not two-thirds, of the nine judges. This is important because two of the justices are slated to retire early next year and are unlikely to be promptly replaced, with the president standing trial and suspended from work. There is a legal dispute as to whether acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn can appoint new judges. How likely is Park’s impeachment? The aforementioned factors, however, are not the core issue. The real question is whether the allegations listed in the parliamentary impeachment bill warrant Park’s removal. This is why some experts predict the Constitutional Court may deviate from its previous conservative stance in the country’s second presidential impeachment trial. They say Park’s violations of the Constitution and laws are serious and grave and that the majority of the public want her gone, pressuring the judges to decide against the president. The impeachment bill, drafted by opposition parties, says that Park violated her Constitutional duties to preserve democratic values by allowing her confidante Choi Soon-sil to meddle in state affairs. Park’s is also accused of committing abuse of power, bribery and extortion when she colluded with Choi and others to force private businesses to make donations to the Mir and K-Sports foundations run by Choi and give contracts to certain companies. “Park’s scandal is not about the political ideologies of conservatives and liberals. It is about the very basic ethics of a president and the core democratic values of the nation,” said Shin Pyung, a professor at Kyungpook National University School of Law and chairman of the Korean Constitutional Law Association. Constitutional scholars agreed that only if the court finds those allegations substantial and convincing, then they would find it warrants a dismissal.In a previous presidential impeachment trial in 2004 against President Roh Moo-hyun, the Court reinstated the liberal president. It said that the president had indeed violated the election law, but it was not a grave enough offense to remove him. “Compared to other public officials subject to impeachment, the effect of impeaching the president is far more serious. Thus, when trying to impeach the president, there needs to be some grave violations of the Constitution or law that can override the expected negative effect,” the court has said. The court gave examples of what constitutes as “grave offenses.” Among them are abusing presidential authority to engage in bribery, undermining the country’s core national interests, infringing upon people’s basic rights and manipulating election results. Unlike Roh, who admitted to a breach of political neutrality before the court reviewed his case, Park denies any wrongdoing. Since the nepotism scandal erupted in late October, Park has apologized three times but rejected the notion that it was her who committed corruption. Her only fault was dropping her guard down with longtime friend Choi Soon-sil, who used her closeness to Park to interfere in state affairs and win business favors. Due to their contrasting attitudes, the duration of the trial could differ, some experts warn. In Roh’s case, the verdict was out on the 63rd day after the impeachment bill was passed. This time, the court’s deliberation could take longer. By law, the court is required to deliver a verdict within 180 days. Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk said that the 180-day-limit could be compromised, depending on case. The court could suspend its deliberation process to see what lower courts decide on the criminal cases brought against Park’s allies and foes involved in the scandal. Prosecutors named Park an accomplice to them, but couldn’t press charges against her due to her non-indictment privilege as the sitting president. Some experts say the court, if it wants, can speed up the process. “Regardless of how pending criminal trials related to this scandal end, the Constitutional Court can finish their own proceedings independently,” said Lim Ji-bong, a constitutional law professor at Sogang University Law School.

Nearly 7 million cumulative participants. And President Park Geun-hye is impeached. Yet South Korean protesters say this is not the end of their fight. Braving the sub-zero temperatures, some 800,000 people bundled up in thick jackets and flocked the Gwanghwamun Square in central Seoul in their seventh Saturday rally, this time to celebrate Park’s impeachment.“It is a triumph of the people. We have fought hard to defend our democracy,” Kim Yool-gu, 47, told The Korea Herald. “But we are only halfway through until she steps down. It is only a beginning to root out corrupt political and economic systems.”South Koreans have taken to the streets and lit candles across the nation ever since a scandal broke out late October revealing how President Park’s friend Choi Soon-sil, who has neither an official government post nor policy background, had been meddling in state affairs and used her ties to the leader to extort money from conglomerates. The latest protest was the first since the parliament impeached Park on Friday for the scandal, with the approval of 234 lawmakers from the 300-seat National Assembly.Protesters let off fireworks to celebrate the parliamentary impeachment of President Park Geun-hye during a rally near the presidential palace of Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul on Saturday. Now, the fate of her presidency is left up to the Constitutional Court as it requires final approval from it, which could take up to 180 days.Many of the protesters vowed to hold up candles until Park is gone and those who assisted her in committing wrongdoings are held accountable. “I am happy, but it is not the end to making a society that can be ruled by the people. We need to take this as an opportunity to remove corrupt links between the prosecution, family-owned conglomerates and powerful politicians,” said Cho Jong-joo, who was giving out free coffee and tea at the square.Sixty-two-year-old Cho Min-koo came to the protest with his family. “The Constitutional Court should make a decision as quickly as possible to uphold the public calls,” he said. On Saturday evening, the boulevards surrounding Gwanghwamun Square turned into a festive outdoor concert venue, with citizens taking to the stage to make speeches and local singers performing. At the peak of the event, fireworks let off, participants hugged strangers next to them and waved candles.Many protesters said the outcome taught them the meaning of democracy.“I cannot believe that we made this impeachment happen. I am so touched and excited. I learned that I can change society if I participate,” said 18-year-old student Kwon So-yoon. “I am not even cold, because of the people around me.” Others demanded a thorough probe and stern punishment of Park, her friend Choi Soon-sil and ex-presidential aides such as Woo Byung-woo and Kim Ki-choon, who are also implicated in the scandal.“Park Geun-hye and her friends in the political and economic circles who assisted her to commit crimes should all be arrested and punished so that such corruption can never happen again,” said 21-year-old student Kim Na-jin. Earlier in the day, some 15,000 people, mostly in their 60s or older, from right-wing civic groups and President Park’s fan club staged a rally near the square, calling for the impeachment to be canceled. They carried banners reading, “Don’t cry. Don’t be sad. Be confident,” slamming the parliament for passing the impeachment motion.

Thus, when trying to impeach the president, there needs to be some grave violations of the Constituent or law that can override the expected negative effect,” the court has said. The court gave examples of what constitutes as “grave offenses.” Among them are abusing presidential authority to engage in bribery, undermining the country’s core national interest, infringing upon people’s basic rights and manipulating election results. Unlike former President Roh who admitted to a breach of political neutrality before the court reviewed his case, President Park denies wrongdoings. Since the nepotism scandal erupted in late October, Park has apologized three times but rejected the notion that it was her who committed corruption and all the irregularities. Her only fault was dropping her guard down with longtime friend Choi Soon-sil who used their relation to interfere in state affairs and win business favors. Due to their contrasting attitude, the duration of the trial could differ, some experts warn. In Roh’s case, the verdict was out on the 63th day after the impeachment bill was passed. This time, the court’s deliberation could take longer. By law, the court is required to deliver a verdict within 180 days. Saenuri Party’s floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk said that the 180-day-limit can be compromised, depending on case. The court could suspend its deliberation process to see what lower courts decide on the criminal cases brought against Park’s allies and foes involved in the scandal. Prosecutors named Park an accomplice to them, but couldn’t press charges against her due to her non-indictment privilege as the sitting president. Some experts say the court, if it wants, can speed up the process. “Regardless of how pending criminal trials related to this scandal ends, the Constitutional Court can finish their own proceedings independently,” said Lim Ji-bong, Constitutional law professor at Sogang University Law School.  By Yeo Jun-suk","trying to impeach the president ,dismissal in previous presidential impeachment ,the country second presidential impeachment ,this scandal ends the constitutional ,the president embroiled in corruption","['Park Geun - hye', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'the Korea Herald', 'Park ’s', 'Kweon Seong - dong', 'Legislation and Judiciary Committee', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Seoul', 'Park ’s', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Park', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Supreme Court', 'Park', 'Lee', 'Germany', 'Park', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'Park ’s', 'the Constitutional Court', 'North Korea', 'Kim', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Park', 'People ’s Party', 'Park Jie - won', 'Hwang Kyo', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Park ’s', 'Park ’s', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Park', 'Park ’s', 'Choi', 'K - Sports', 'Choi', 'Shin Pyung', 'Kyungpook National University School of Law', 'the Korean Constitutional Law Association', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Court', 'Roh', 'Park', 'Park', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Roh', 'Saenuri Party ’s', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'Park ’s', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Lim Ji - bong', 'Sogang University Law School', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67039084  0.00261673

From now on, I will calmly response to the Constitutional Court’s impeachment trial and the independent counsel’s investigation  in accordance to the procedures outlined by the law,” she said. All of Park’s authorities as a president were suspended at 7:03 p.m. Friday, upon the Constitutional Court accepting the Assembly’s motion to dismiss the president. The court will now deliberate the case to determine where Park’s alleged actions constitute impeachable offenses, a process that can take up to 180 days.“I hope that each minister -- with the prime minister and acting president  playing the central role -- will do their best to minimize any government vacuum, including in the economic and security fields,” Park said at the Cabinet meeting. Park is suspected of conspiring with Choi Soon-sil, her friend of 40 years, and her former aides on a series of wrongdoings, which include pressuring local conglomerates to donate funds to two nonprofit organizations controlled by Choi. Investigators suspect the money has actually been a bribe for Park and Choi’s inner circle.The embattled president denies the allegations. She insists that everything she did was for the sake of the country and she had no knowledge of the alleged wrongdoings of Choi and her former aides. By Yoon Min-sik","resign immediately she called cabinet ,accept parliamentary impeachment with heavy ,her impeachment yonhap truly sorry ,parliamentary impeachment with heavy heart ,she would accept parliamentary impeachment","['Park Geun', 'Cabinet', 'the National Assembly', 'the Constitutional Court ’s', 'Park', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Assembly', 'Park', 'Park', 'Cabinet', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Choi', 'Park', 'Choi ’s', 'Choi', 'Yoon Min - sik']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47481117  0.02899474

Some Saenuri reformists even claimed that the conservative party has no other choice but to disband itself and form a new entity that represents revamped conservatives after the demise of Park. Rep. Suh Chung-won  of the Saenuri Party participates in Friday`s impeachment vote on President Park Geun-hye at the National Assembly. Among the 300 legislative members, 299 participated in the plenary session to participate in the impeachment bill vote. Of them, 234 voted in consent, while 56 objected, two abstained and seven were counted as invalid.The prime focus prior to the floor vote was whether or not the number of consenting ballots from the Saenuri will make it past 28, the minimum needed for the opposition to attain the quorum to have the bill passed.But the 234 consents indicated -- on the premise that all 172 opposition and independent lawmakers voted in favor as pledged -- that a total of 62 Saenuri figures advocated impeachment.This not only exceeded the 35-40 mark which Saenuri rebels had earlier claimed but also constituted a near majority in the 128-seat ruling party.“If the  votes exceed 220, it will mean that a considerable amount of pro-Park members decided to stand with us, which will fundamentally change the political map hereafter,” Rep. Lee Choon-suak of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea said in a radio interview earlier in the day.The parliamentary floor‘s 78 percent approval for impeachment largely came in line with the recent set of public polls.According to a survey conducted by local pollster Gallup Korea in the week running up to Friday’s vote, Park’s approval rating stood at 5 percent, with 81 percent of the respondents giving a negative assessment on her state affairs capacity.The voting result also meant that a significant number from those classified as pro-Park secretly casted their ballot in favor of driving out the president.In particular, it was the junior first- and second-termers who are rumored to have broken from the leadership’s leverage and casted a secret vote in favor of impeachment.Most of them, owing their April general election candidacy to the pro-Park leadership, have so far refrained from clarifying their stance over the bill, but have alluded some discontent over the disgraced president.The secret vote system, once considered a loophole which may let undecided figures slip away from the impeaching group, thus turned out to have acted in favor of the bill, allowing reserved pro-Parks to express their disapproval.As if aware of the growing sense of division, the pro-president group had urgently called for the rejection of the impeachment bill, especially during the last few days before voting.“We must at all costs prevent impeachment, which will not be the end of confusion but only the start of greater chaos,” said Rep. Choi Kyung-hwan at an urgent party meeting which was allegedly summoned by the pro-Park cluster.Choi, along with party chairman Rep. Lee Jung-hyun and eighth-termer Rep. Suh Chung-won, is deemed a leading Park loyalist. He was also the only one who did not appear in the session, thus making it clear not to vote for impeachment.Despite all these desperate efforts to rescue the embattled president from forceful ouster -- and thus to safeguard their own political career -- the pro-Park group failed to hold its members together.“It is only right that floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk and I should take responsibility and step down,” Chairman Lee said in a press conference following the voting result announcement.“I am ready to resign as soon as a minimum level of measures are made to prevent a power vacuum within the party.”What now lies ahead for political parties is an earlier-than-expected presidential election next year, which is likely to take place between April and June.All political parties are to readjust their political clock to have their presidential candidates selected in time and gear up for campaigning.Another key issue is the Constitution of an interim power which will take over the suspended president’s authority until the Constitutional Court‘s impeachment decision.While incumbent Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn has come in charge, opposition camps have been denouncing his role, citing his close political affiliation with the president.By Bae Hyun-jung","friday impeachment vote on president ,impeachment bill in landslide vote ,disgraced president the secret vote ,impeachment vote on president park ,the impeachment bill in landslide","['Park Geun - hye', 'the National Assembly', 'Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'Suh Chung - win', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun - hye', 'the National Assembly', 'Saenuri', 'Saenuri', 'Saenuri', 'Lee Choon', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'Gallup Korea', 'Park ’s', 'pro - Park', 'pro - Parks', 'Choi Kyung - hwan', 'Choi', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'Suh Chung - won', 'Park', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'Lee', 'Constitutional Court‘s', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28752434  0.31997889

The impeachment was a victory for many of South Koreans who have taken to the streets for the past six weeks in massive street rallies to demand her resignation.It was the candle-holding protesters who unwaveringly demanded Park’s immediate removal ever since the scandal broke in late October and pushed lawmakers to cast ballots to impeach her. The National Assembly in Seoul, a day prior to the impeachment. “Parliamentary impeachment of Park wouldn’t have happened if citizens didn’t light up their candles,” said former Rep. Moon Jae-in of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, referring to the large-scale candlelight vigils held nationwide every Saturday demanding Park’s resignation. “South Koreans are writing a new history today, with the candles. The parliament’s impeachment of Park is the beginning of a great civil “candle” revolution that will lead our country into a better future.” The first anti-Park candlelight vigil was relatively small, but grew with each passing week as more Koreans became enraged by the series of revelations implicating Park in the scandal and her refusal to step down.The first protest was held on Oct. 29, a few days after local TV channel JTBC found a discarded tablet PC, supposedly owned and used by Choi, which contained files of Park’s photos, presidential speeches and policy drafts. Protestors hold placards reading ""President Park Geun-hye, resign!"" during an anti-Park rally. The president made an apology a day later, saying she sought advice from Choi, who had previously helped her through difficult times, on public speeches. She rejected other accusations, saying she knew nothing about Choi’s alleged influence-peddling and embezzlement of public funds. As her apology fell short of clarifying suspicions, the first protest in central Seoul drew about 30,000 people. They voiced anger towards Park’s friend Choi Soon-sil who, despite holding no government post and having no policy background, manipulated power from behind the scenes.At that time, the protestors, mostly unaffiliated citizens who came with their family and friends, demanded the truth from the president. Only a few called for her resignation. The following week, Park reshuffled her Cabinet and presidential staff to diffuse public anger. But such actions were only seen as clinging to power amid the spiraling scandal. A day before the second rally on Nov. 5, Park made a second apology, saying she would accept prosecutorial questioning and an independent counsel investigating her. But she insisted that all she did was for the sake of the country’s economy and people’s livelihoods. At that time, the opposition bloc didn’t campaign for Park’s departure from office. Its stance was that a new, neutral Cabinet should be formed and Park should relinquish some of her presidential power to it. The second protest on Nov. 5 saw a nearly ten-fold increase in participants. Some 200,000 flocked to Gwanghwamun Square, vehemently calling for Park’s resignation. Startled by the massive outpouring of public fury, opposition parties leaned towards removing Park from office.The third rally came on Nov. 12, attracting up to 1 million people in central Seoul. It was the biggest rally in decades since the country’s democratization in the late 1980s. It was also the first time that protestors were allowed to get as close as 200 meters to the presidential palace of Cheong Wa Dae. Since the Nov. 12 rally, politicians from opposition parties have joined protesters on the streets, calling for Park’s ouster. The ruling Saenuri Party started to falter, with the pro-Park leadership and defiant rebels clashing over what to do with the embattled leader. Despite the large-scale rally, Park was still seen fighting back resignation calls, appointing a new culture minister and ordering the prosecution to thoroughly investigate a lobbying scandal involving a real estate development project in the southern city of Busan. Then came the fourth weekend rally on Nov. 19, which attracted 960,000 people at 60 locations across the nation. Protestors were further angered by signs of President Park refusing to step down and a remark by Rep. Kim Jin-tae, one of the staunch loyalists of Park in the ruling Saenuri Party: “The candles are blown out when wind blows.”A day after the rally, public prosecutors investigating the scandal named the president a suspect in the influence-peddling scandal and accomplice to Choi Soon-sil and her presidential aides on charges of extorting donations from local conglomerates. Breaking her earlier promise, the president refused to respond to the face-to-face questioning by the prosecution through his lawyer, saying it is politically “biased.”Days before protestors gathered again for the fifth anti-Park rally, all three opposition parties -- the Democratic Party of Korea, People’s Party and Justice Party -- declared a campaign to impeach Park. Then the rally on Nov. 26 set a new record -- 1.9 million participants across the country. By this day, Park’s approval rating had slipped to an abysmal 4 percent, according to a Gallup Korea poll. Stung by the undying public censure, pro-Park loyalists within the ruling Saenuri Party came up with a plan in which the president steps down in April, allowing the next presidential election to be held in June. The emboldened opposition set Dec. 2 as the impeachment vote day. About 1.9 million people packed the Gwanghwamun area during the sixth weekend rally against President Park Geun-hye held on Dec. 3. In her third apology on Nov. 29, just days before the crucial vote on her fate, the president offered to give up her presidency, but only in accordance with a schedule and legal procedure that the rival parties agree on. Park’s offer was a veiled jab at her foes and it did succeed to an extent in shaking the pro-impeachment coalition. The impeachment vote was delayed, as Saenuri lawmakers who had earlier supported the opposition-led motion changed their mind. It was again the people who showed up in even bigger numbers to lash out at both Park for refusing to resign and the lawmakers for so far failing to remove her from office. An estimated 2.32 million people poured onto the streets in the sixth rally on Dec. 3, making it the largest protest in the nation’s history. The rally forced the grey-zone lawmakers within the ruling Saenuri Party to switch sides again and rejoin forces to oust Park. The decision led to the passage of the impeachment motion on Friday, which many see as a triumph of people’s power. “If the public had not taken to the streets in large numbers like this, the lawmakers would have not moved to pass the impeachment motion,” Lee Byoung-hoon, sociology professor from Chungang University, told The Korea Herald.“It was South Korean people who forced lawmakers to end their political power game, listen to the public and join forces to remove President Park from office,” he said, adding it was an opportunity for South Korean democracy to mature. “From now on, rallies should evolve into a platform for the public not only to vent anger, but to reveal problems and find the solutions in society,” he said.

According to the National Assembly on Thursday, no lawmakers have requested time to address the floor ahead of the ballot during a plenary session slated for 3:00 p.m. Friday. “Traditionally, the motion related to the seat of public officials does not require additional debate among those that approve and those that disapprove,” an official from the National Assembly dealing with legislative process told The Korea Herald. The lawmakers could make last-minute requests for speeches during the session and take the stand if the National Assembly Speaker Rep. Chung Sye-kyun allows them to, the official added. The impeachment motion against President Park, proposed by 171 lawmakers on Dec. 3, is the only issue on the agenda for the upcoming session. Protesters hold up candles outside the National Assembly in Seoul on Tuesday, as they continue their daily rally demanding the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye. Since Friday is the last day of the Assembly’s current term, the bill will automatically die if the vote does not take place before midnight Friday. The Assembly official said secret ballots usually take more than 30 minutes, but the impeachment vote -- to be held in an old-fashioned and secret manner using ballot papers -- could take even longer. “Lawmakers may hesitate until the last minute given the seriousness of the matter,” the Assembly official said. In 2004 when lawmakers voted to impeach then-President Roh Moo-hyun, the voting session lasted for about an hour. Lawmakers will be given one ballot paper as well as one plate with their names engraved on it, which is designed to prevent multiple or illegal voting. If there is a mismatch between the number of ballots and plates, the voting is declared invalid and held again. The ballot, which is slightly bigger than a name card, includes a space where lawmakers can mark their vote for or against the motion, using symbols in Korean or Chinese. Other symbols -- such as O or X -- are counted as invalid. Wary of potential dissenting votes from those who had vowed to support the motion, some liberal politicians and civic groups suggested that the lawmakers should take a “proof picture” to show the voters that they had followed through on their commitment.The leadership from the main opposition Democratic Party and runner-up People’s Party voiced concerns that the move would clash with the principle of a secret ballot and decided to leave the decision to the lawmakers.“It seems to me that if the lawmakers refused to take the picture, they would be labeled as those who oppose the impeachment,” said People’s Party floor leader Rep. Park Jie-won. “I am hoping that fellow lawmakers make their decision by themselves.” The ruling Saenuri Party leadership, however, dismissed the idea as “unconstitutional,” claiming that the measure would undermine the rule of modern democracy. “Each lawmaker is required to cast their ballots in accordance with their conscience and political faith,” said Saenuri floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk.” Taking the picture of the vote and posting it online is an absurd request that I don’t need to respond to.”By Yeo Jun-suk","thursday no lawmakers have requested ,assembly on thursday no lawmakers ,on thursday no lawmakers have ,thursday no lawmakers have ,on thursday no lawmakers","['Park Geun', 'the National Assembly', 'the National Assembly', 'the Korea Herald', 'the National Assembly', 'Chung Sye - kyun', 'Park', 'the National Assembly', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Assembly', 'Assembly', 'Assembly', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'korean', 'chinese', 'Democratic Party', 'People ’s Party', 'People ’s Party', 'Park Jie - won', 'Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57021648  0.342702

Hong Moon-jong Thursday in a radio interview on YTN.“Even some among those who claim that  should participate in the vote  do not necessarily advocate impeachment.”The pro-Park faction, which still accounts for the majority of the ruling party, including its leadership, says party members should participate in the secret ballot, but vote against it.The party leadership thus seems to anchor its hope on “shy Park” figures -- those who have been concealing their allegiance to Park, aware of the public’s fury against the scandal-ridden president.South Korean President Park Geun-hye “Shy” voters are those that conceal their intentions until the actual ballot, creating a mismatch between polls and the final result of a vote.But public opinion experts expressed skepticism over the existence of such supporters.“The current corruption scandal makes it difficult for supporters to justify the president in any way,” said Bae Jong-chan, chief director at local pollster Research & Research.He also described the general sentiment of silent Park proponents as “ashamed” rather than “shy,” suggesting the Saenuri Party members would not easily slink away from sanctioning the president.The anticipation of the nonmainstream group standing against the president, on the contrary, is that the secret vote will encourage neutral lawmakers to break from the leadership’s pressure and uphold impeachment.Rep. Chang Je-won, in a radio interview with CBS on Thursday, optimistically speculated the number of consenting votes could go as high as 220-230, which means that at least 48 Saenuri Party figures will back impeachment. This figure is even higher than the 35 earlier confirmed by another non-Park member, Rep. Hwang Young-cheul. The number of Saenuri votes required to pass the impeachment bill is 28. The three opposition parties and independent lawmakers, all united for Park’s ouster, currently control 172 votes, 28 short of the required 200.Rep. Hwang, who speaks for the nonmainstream group, also referred to the possibility of going public with the names of consenters, in case the bill is voted down Friday, aggravating the already agitated public sentiment.Within the opposition camp, calls are increasingly being made for lawmakers to post their ballots -- approving the impeachment -- to their social media accounts, effectively turning the secret vote into an open one.The current National Assembly Act states that the floor vote on impeachment should proceed anonymously, though the given clause has been criticized for impeding on the public's right to know.But Saenuri reformists are still hesitant to bend to the pressure and go fully public with the names.“I hope that the rights of our lawmakers  as individual constitutional organs are not hindered by illegitimate means,” Hwang said.By Bae Hyun-jung","their ballots approving the impeachment ,party figures will back impeachment ,pro president faction alluded thursday ,lawmakers to advocate impeachment may ,ballots approving the impeachment","['Park Geun - hye', 'Saenuri Party ’s', 'Saenuri', 'pro - Park', 'Hong Moon', 'pro - park', 'Park', 'south korean', 'Park Geun', 'Bae Jong - chan', 'Research & Research', 'Saenuri Party', 'Chang Je - won', 'CBS', 'Saenuri Party', 'non - park', 'Hwang Young', 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'Hwang', 'National Assembly Act', 'Saenuri', 'Hwang', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",19,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.78775746  0.40421465

In their full-fledged efforts to push to remove Park from office, the three main opposition parties -- the Democratic Party of Korea, People’s Party and Justice Party -- pledged to resign from the National Assembly if the motion is rejected. “We are determined to pass the motion to take Park down from office, and tendered our resignations to the party leadership in case it is voted down,” floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea said after a general meeting of lawmakers Thursday. The party decided as its official stance that all of its 121 lawmakers would abandon parliamentary membership if impeachment fails. A flag reading ""impeachment Park Geun-hye Resignation,"" set up bya civic group, flutters in the air in front of the National Assembly in Seoul on Thursday. “This is a watershed moment in history,” said Rep. Choo Mi-ae, the party’s chief, calling on all members to think only about the nation and its citizens and make sure Park is removed from office.  The runner-up opposition People’s Party and Justice Party followed suit, also announcing that all of their respective 38 and 6 members would give up their parliament seats if the conservative president survived the vote. The Justice Party went further to call for the complete disassembling of the National Assembly in that case. “The impeachment train has departed. Nothing can stop the train,” floor leader Rep. Park Jie-won of the People’s Party said. Public opinion is overwhelmingly supportive of the opposition coalition’s campaign to oust Park over a corruption scandal involving her confidante Choi Soon-sil. According to local pollster Realmeter on Thursday, 78.2 percent of the surveyed 1,511 citizens agreed with impeaching the president. The impeachment bill against Park lists multiple violations of the Constitution and laws. The president is also accused of “neglecting her constitutional duty to protect the lives of the people when the Sewol ferry sank in 2014, killing nearly 300 people.” Supporting her ouster are some members of the governing Saenuri Party. In fact, the fate of Park depends on a group of the Saenuri rebels. According to a poll conducted by a local daily, only 23 Saenuri lawmakers surveyed said they would vote for impeachment, while others either did not reply or express their stance.To pass the parliament, the bill needs all of the 172 lawmakers from the three opposition parties and independents, plus 28 votes from the Saenuri Party. “Just one vote can change the results. We will continue to push for the passage of the bill,” Rep. Hwang Young-chul of the ruling Saenuri Party said.If the impeachment motion passes Friday, the assembly speaker has to deliver the impeachment resolution to the parliament‘s Legislation and Judiciary Committee and send the copies to the Constitutional Court and President Park. At that moment, she would be suspended from her presidential power and the prime minister would take over.The beleaguered president is on the verge of ending her presidency after a swirling scandal revealed she had allowed her confidante and longtime friend Choi to meddle in state affairs. Choi is suspected of using her ties to the president to extort money from conglomerates and secretly intervene in government appointments.Despite the public’s strong call for the immediate resignation of the president, Park hinted she would face impeachment “according to legal procedures” in her meeting with the loyal conservative leadership of the ruling Saenuri Party on Tuesday.

The opposition parties handed in the motion to parliament last week, saying that Park violated the Constitution and other laws by allowing her confidante Choi Soon-sil to exert power in state affairs and enjoy unlawful benefits. State prosecutors have accused Park of being Choi's accomplice.A successful passage calls for approval from at least 200 lawmakers from the 300-seat National Assembly. Accordingly, at least 28 lawmakers from the ruling Saenuri Party must give it a nod, even if every single opposition and independent lawmaker votes for the impeachment.A group of non-Park lawmakers in Saenuri said it has secured support from around 40 lawmakers, but uncertainties remain, with some casting doubts on the level of support.While the group earlier asked the opposition parties to exclude the sinking of the Sewol ferry, which left more than 300 dead or missing, as one of the grounds for Park's impeachment, the main opposition Democratic Party said it has no intention to do so.The opposition parties claim Park failed to protect the safety of the people as stipulated by the Constitution.The Park dissenters' group said it will continue to persuade the opposition parties, adding the issue remains one of the major hurdles for Saenuri's participation in the motion.Lawmakers of the Democratic Party said they will resign en masse if the impeachment fails to pass the parliament on Friday.Rep. Woo Sang-ho, the Democratic Party's floor leader, said the announcement reflects its members' determination.Members of the splinter People's Party also said they will step down if the vote is rejected.Park loyalists at Saenuri continued to protest the motion, adding the parliament should instead seek a peaceful resignation for Park.""It is still not too late to stop the impeachment, and have Park step down in April and hold the presidential election in June,"" Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, the Saenuri chief emphasized.National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun said the parliament will not be open to the public Friday as requested by some opposition lawmakers, but said he will allow protests at the front gate. Once the motion is passed, Park will be barred from the management of state affairs and her powers will be handed over to Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn.Among the key authorities of the president as stipulated by the Constitution are the control over the military, the right to clinch treaties with other countries, and the power to exercise vetoes.Following the passage of the impeachment motion, the Constitutional Court will then review its legitimacy, with the proceedings to take upwards of 180 days. Park earlier said she will wait for the outcome, ruling out the possibility that she will step down voluntarily. In 2004, the National Assembly passed an impeachment motion for late former President Roh Moo-hyun, although it was later turned down by the Constitutional Court. Park, who was then a lawmaker of the Grand National Party, the predecessor of Saenuri, also participated in the motion. Rep. Choo Mi-ae, the head of the Democratic Party, voted for Roh's impeachment, although Rep. Chung Dong-young of the People's Party took a leading role in the campaign against his ouster. Both of them support the impeachment of Park at present.During the Constitutional Court's proceedings, Park will still receive the same protection and support as president. Her paycheck will also remain unchanged, although some duty-related expenses will be cut. If the impeachment is approved by the court, Park will not be able to receive the benefits provided to former presidents. By law, former presidents are provided with pension, secretaries, drivers and medical coverage. An impeached chief executive, on the other hand, would only receive security protection.A local pollster Real Meter, meanwhile, said 78.2 percent of South Koreans approved the impeachment poll this week, up 2.9 percentage points from a week earlier. The survey was conducted on1,047 South Koreans with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.","the impeachment poll this week ,koreans approved the impeachment poll ,korea national assembly on thursday ,impeachment poll this week ,parliament on friday rep woo","[""South Korea 's"", 'National Assembly', 'Park Geun', 'Constitutional Court', 'Choi', 'National Assembly', 'Saenuri Party', 'non - park', 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'Democratic Party', 'Park', 'Saenuri', 'the Democratic Party', 'Woo Sang - ho', ""the Democratic Party 's"", ""People 's Party"", 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'Saenuri', 'National Assembly', 'Chung Sye - kyun', 'Park', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'the Constitutional Court', 'the National Assembly', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'the Constitutional Court', 'the Grand National Party', 'Saenuri', 'Choo Mi - ae', 'the Democratic Party', 'Roh', 'Chung Dong - young', ""the People 's Party"", 'Park', ""the Constitutional Court 's"", 'Park', 'Park', 'Real Meter', 'South Koreans', 'on1,047 South Koreans']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23774607  0.6630277

Jang Si-ho, the niece of Choi Soon-sil Currently, the 37-year-old Jang is suspected of embezzling some 1.1 billion won  from Samsung Group’s donation of 1.6 billion won to Korea Winter Sports Elite Center, an organization which she and Choi founded in an alleged attempt to make undue profits ahead of the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics.When questioned over the accused embezzlement, Jang partly denied the given charges.“The suspected amount of embezzlement is wrong. There is still a sufficient amount in the center’s account,” she said, in answer to Rep. Kim Han-jung of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea.“From what I know, the center received 600 million won from the Culture Ministry and 1.6 billion won from Samsung Group. They are used for students.“Speaking for the Samsung Group was Kim Jae-yeol, president of Samsung Sports Business of Cheil Worldwide Inc.“Samsung Electronics’ Global Marketing Group made the decision ,” Kim said. As for the operation of the Korea Winter Sports Elite Center, Jang claimed that it was her aunt Choi‘s idea to create the center.”When I was on Jeju Island, she suggested that I come and work . I wasn’t in a position to disobey her orders as she is my aunt,“ she said. After filling in the application and establishment plans of the center, she turned it in to former Vice Culture Minister Kim Chong, she added. While shifting the liability upon her aunt, Jang claimed that her mother and Choi’s elder sister Soon-deuk were not involved in the series of allegations.”My mother has never visited , nor has she visited Cheong Wa Dae to meet with the president,“ Jang said.Over the suspicion that she used her ties with Choi to enter Yonsei University, Jang argued that she won her acceptance upon her own ability as a student equestrian rider.Just like Choi‘s daughter Chung Yoo-ra, Jang has also come under fire for excessive benefits when entering university in 1998.Rep.

From this perspective, we are gonna see initially the development of relationships among and between leaders rather than addressing of issues,"" John Park, adjunct lecturer in public policy, said in an interview with Yonhap News Agency.    The lecturer is currently in the country leading a delegation of next-generation security and diplomacy experts from the U.S. to take part in a week-long program hosted by the Korea Foundation.    ""So from that , we will get to see more of the context in terms of what issues will be prioritized and how this type of issue will be negotiated,"" Park, who is also a faculty affiliate with the Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, said.   The Trump administration's leader-to-leader approach would mark ""a distinct departure"" from the past where policy decisions have been made in a multilateral setting or at the government-to-government level, Park noted.    ""I think we are gonna see something of hierarchy, specifically with decisions and conversations happening at the leader-to-leader level and then filtering down of those decisions,"" he said of the businessman-turned-president-elect.    How Trump would reshape the U.S. policy toward North Korea's nuclear development has been of keen interest as the international community gears up for the implementation of a fresh set of United Nations sanctions over North Korea's recent nuclear test on Sept. 9.   Last week, the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 2321, slapping a strict ban on North Korea's coal exports to China, in a bid to deplete the North's foreign currency holdings.    From China's perspective, their primary focus would be on potential negative fallout from the resolution on economic development in three Chinese provinces bordering with North Korea, Park said. ""There will be great focus to make sure that unintentionally Resolution 2321 doesn't affect or hurt the economic development activities of these Chinese provinces.""   At the same time, however, Beijing is concerned about North Korea's illicit procurement in China, which benefits the North's nuclear and missile program, he said, adding that ""So there will be a fine management in term of implementation.""   Still, there are important policy opportunities to influence China's implementation efforts, he said, citing Beijing's punishment of Chinese company Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development for selling nuclear weapons components to North Korea.The decision was made on revelations from information provided through a joint research by South Korean and U.S. think tanks.   ""There's an opportunity to do more of that type of research and provide that kind of information to Chinese authorities,"" he noted.    Overall, South Korea and the U.S. need a strategy broader than sanctions in dealing with North Korea's nuclear program, he also pointed out. ""What you see is that the North Korean regime finds ways to get around sanctions measures ... Sanctions, if applied more and more, forces the North Korean regime to develop better ways to procure, better ways to do things they need and we need to factor that into our calculus as well,"" he said.","turned president elect how trump ,elect donald trump will kick ,diplomatic landscape korean american lecturer ,president elect how trump ,businessman turned president elect how","['Donald Trump', ""North Korea 's"", 'Kim Jong - un', 'korean', 'Harvard Kennedy School', 'John Park', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'U.S.', 'the Korea Foundation', ""the Harvard Kennedy School 's"", 'Belfer Center', 'Trump', 'Park', 'U.S.', ""North Korea 's"", 'United Nations', ""North Korea 's"", 'the U.N.

Unscathed, Kim repeated he was sorry, could not remember or did not know. A master of ideological tension and media manipulation, the former prosecutor general, justice minister and three-term lawmaker had earned the nickname “the king of secretaries” while serving Park for about one year and a half until February 2015.  Kim Ki-choon, former chief of staff for President Park Geun-hye, arrives at the National Assembly in Seoul on Wednesday, as a witness in a parliamentary investigation. None of his predecessors, successors or any other senior aides at Cheong Wa Dae could beat Kim in reading the secluded president’s thoughts and wishes, sources say. Now critics are suggesting this was thanks to behind-the-scene discussions with Choi, whom Park relied deeply on for various state affairs, though he rejects the claim. Among the 14 witnesses attended, Kim drew most questions from both ruling and opposition lawmakers. But he refuted most of them or said he was not aware, apparently being watchful of an upcoming probe of an independent counsel that would designate him as a suspect. They argued Kim, then the chief of staff, had allowed or assisted Choi to interfere with high-level appointments at the Culture Ministry and the operations of the horseback riding sector in the run-up to the launch of two culture and sports foundations which effectively served as Choi’s slush funds. Kim said he does not know Choi and has no involvement in the issues. He also took flak for failing to grasp Park’s whereabouts for seven hours on the day of the Sewol ferry sinking in April 2014. The Hankyoreh daily reported Tuesday that the president spent 90 minutes doing her hair before visiting the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters, while more than 300 people, most of them high school students, were drowning inside the ship. Cheong Wa Dae on Wednesday acknowledged the visit of stylists that day but argued it took only 20 minutes. “I am extremely ashamed and sorry for letting this disaster happen because I failed to advise the president properly,” Kim said, when given time to comment on the seven missing hours.By Shin Hyon-hee","opposition lawmakers but he refuted ,high school students were drowning ,when he dies unscathed kim ,reading the secluded president ,failed to advise the president","['Park Geun - hye', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'unscathed', 'Kim', 'Park', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'Park Geun - hye', 'the National Assembly', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'Choi', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Choi', 'the Culture Ministry', 'Choi', 'Kim', 'Choi', 'Park', 'Hankyoreh', 'Dae', 'Kim', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55691499  0.56532782

Park’s approval rating has risen to 10.5 percent, the latest Realmeter survey shows. According to the local pollster, Park’s weekly poll reading marked its first uptick in eight weeks, rising by 0.8 percentage point. Daily figures reveal a clear rebound over two days -- Nov. 29 when Park made her third national address and Dec. 2 when the ruling Saenuri Party’s adopted Park’s early departure in April as its official stance. Support of Park numbered 10.9 percent on the former date and 11.9 percent on the latter. “Park’s address and the Saenuri Party’s official adoption of Park’s early departure schedule seem to have consolidated support for the embattled president,” Realmeter explained. The increase came mainly from conservative regions such as Daegu, Busan and Chungcheong provinces and Park’s core support base of senior voters aged 60 or older.  The Saenuri Party, whose leadership has steadfastly stood behind Park despite the major scandal, also saw public support rebound. Its popularity was 17.8 percent, up 1.6 percent from a week earlier, behind the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea’s 32.5 percent. Among potential candidates for the next presidency, Moon Jae-in, the former Democratic Party leader, was still in the lead with 20.8 percent.

Since 2008, the yearly size of the fund has remained at near 1 trillion won.Meanwhile, the government newly allocated 13.5 billion won to implementing a new law aimed at improving North Korea's human rights situation.Under the law, which went into effect in September, Seoul set up an agency tasked with compiling North Korea's human rights abuses.The law also calls for the establishment of a foundation to support the relevant civic groups' activities to improve Pyongyang's rights situation.But the formation of its board has yet to be finalized, as rival political parties have not yet recommended any candidates.","unification ministry dropped 20 percent ,two nuclear tests this year ,ministry dropped 20 percent from ,korea unification ministry dropped 20 ,ministry dropped 20 percent","[""South Korea 's"", 'inter - korean', ""North Korea 's"", 'inter - korean', 'inter - korean', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'inter - korean', 'South Korea', 'inter - korean', ""North Korea 's"", 'Seoul', ""North Korea 's"", 'Pyongyang']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4765265   0.81228328

It had requested Park to come up with a decision by 6 p.m. Wednesday.The Presidential Office of Cheong Wa Dae on Sunday continued its silence on the proposal, despite earlier reports that Park was mulling such a move.The nonmainstream group of Saenuri lawmakers -- former Park allies who have now turned critical of the president -- can make or break the impeachment. They had earlier vowed to join forces with the opposition to oust Park, but appeared to have changed their stance after the embattled president offered Tuesday to step down according to a schedule and legal process to be agreed by the parliament. After an emergency meeting on Sunday, they vowed to take part in the voting regardless of Park’s decision while adding that they will not meet the president even if she requests it.Park has been subject to a criminal investigation on allegations that she conspired with her civilian friend Choi Soon-sil and her former aides on series of wrongdoings such as abusing authority to raise funds for nonprofit organizations -- suspected of being a cover for embezzlement -- and leaking confidential documents. On Saturday, an estimated 2.3 million people took to the streets in a resounding “I don’t think so” to Park’s controversial offer. The largest protest ever snubbed expectations that the anti-Park sentiment would die out, including Saenuri Party Rep. Kim Jin-tae’s prediction that the “candlelight  will be blown out.”In addition to how, when the embattled leader will step down is another thorny issue in bipartisan negotiation. The opposition’s timeline has Park exiting Cheong Wa Dae around late January, assuming her impeachment in set in motion this month. Depending on how much time the Constitutional Court will take to deliberate, the next presidential election could take place as early as March.The election is considered a main motive behind the Saenuri Party’s calls for Park’s April resignation. Last week’s poll by Gallop Korea showed the ruling party’s support at 15 percent, less than half the 34 percent of its main rival Democratic Party and just one point ahead of the People’s Party.In addition, former Democratic Party leader Moon Jae-in has been a solid front-runner among all presidential hopefuls. According to local pollster Realmeter, he has led the race for the sixth week running with 20.7 percent.With the exception of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, all other possible candidates --such as Seongnam Mayor Lee Jae-myung and Ahn Cheol-soo of the People’s Party -- are from the opposition bloc. Observers are saying this is the unspoken reason behind the quarrel about the timing of Park’s resolution.This week will also host a parliamentary audit on the special governmental committee of the Choi Soon-sil scandal, starting Monday. One of the focuses of the hearing is the donations by local corporations to the Mir and K-Sports foundations.The donations are suspected of being bribes for Park and Choi’s inner circles. Testimonies at the hearing are expected to affect the public’s already ill feelings toward Park and possibly the prospect of the upcoming impeachment vote.By Yoon Min-sik","demanded park immediate dismissal saturday ,the upcoming impeachment vote ,park immediate dismissal saturday but ,afternoon to support the impeachment ,to impeach park last friday","['the National Assembly', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Park', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Park', 'Park', 'Ki Dong - min', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'the People ’s Party', 'Justice Party', 'the Democratic Party', 'Park Geun', 'Gwanghwamun', 'Seoul', 'Saenuri ’s', 'Park', 'the Presidential Office of Cheong', 'Park', 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'Park', 'Park ’s', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Park', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Jin - tae', 'Park', 'Cheong', 'the Constitutional Court', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'Park', 'Gallop Korea', 'Democratic Party', 'the People ’s Party', 'Democratic Party', 'Moon Jae - in', 'realmeter', 'UN', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Seongnam Mayor', 'Lee Jae - myung', 'Ahn Cheol', 'the People ’s Party', 'Park', 'K - Sports', 'Park', 'Choi ’s', 'Park', 'Yoon Min - sik']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.10189058  0.15559144

The vote will take place as scheduled, they confirmed, regardless whether Park announces her plan for early departure. The president said on Tuesday that she is willing to resign if the political parties offer her a time frame and legal process for it, but the opposition parties rejected the call. According to their agreement, the three parties -- the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, the runner-up People’s Party and minor Justice Party -- will gather signatures from lawmakers beyond the required count of 150 by no later than Saturday and submit it to the floor next Thursday. The lawmakers are required to vote within 72 hours of an impeachment motion being submitted.“There will be no faltering in our commitment to impeaching Park,” said the parties in a statement. “We were supposed to see Park suspend her duties today, but apologize for failing to uphold the people’s resolution.” The motion contains the allegation that Park violated the Constitution by allowing her civilian friend Choi Soon-sil to meddle in state affairs. It also states that Park committed crimes of abuse of power, bribery and extortion when she colluded with Choi to force private businesses to make donations.The agreement came a day after the parties bickered over the voting schedule amid concern that they had yet to secure enough votes to pass it. The Democratic Party and Justice Party demanded prompt action, but the People’s Party urged them to wait until they secured enough votes from the ruling Saenuri Party. The opposition parties said that passing the motion on Dec. 9 is the most “viable timeframe” for them to convince as many Saenuri lawmakers to approve the motion. They had pushed to hold the voting session next Monday, but the move was rejected by Saenuri lawmakers. Saenuri lawmakers critical of Park --  whose votes are crucial to meeting the two-thirds majority required at the 300-seat National Assembly to pass an impeachment -- said that they would support the impeachment unless Park clarifies when she will step down by 6 p.m. on Dec. 7Rep. Park Jie-won , head of the People's Party, Woo Sang-ho , the floor leader of the Democratic Party and Roh Hoe-chan of the Justice Party meet at the National Assembly in Seoul on Friday. The three parties agreed to vote on an impeachement motion on President Park Geun-hye on Dec. 9 “The president needs to clarify her plan to leave office and transfer her powers to the prime minister,” said Rep. Hwang Young-chul, who represents the group. At least 28 Saenuri lawmakers must approve to pass the motion, assuming that all opposition and independents vote in favor of impeaching Park. In a surprise announcement Tuesday, Park said she was leaving everything to the National Assembly, including the timing of when her own presidency will end. She asked the legislative body to decide the time frame and legal process of her early departure from office. Her term officially finishes in February 2018.The dissenting group also pressured the opposition parties into coming up with a unified plan to remove her from office. In a general assembly on Thursday, Saenuri lawmakers officially decided to recommend that the president leave office this April and hold a presidential election two months later. Until now, the opposition coalition has rejected the call, demanding Park resign immediately and unconditionally. Pointing to the fact that Park did not offer any specific timeline for her resignation, opposition lawmakers dismissed the proposal as a stalling ploy aimed at luring back her opponents in Saenuri Party.  “ is the most rational plan for us,” said Saenuri floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk. Earlier in the day, Chung said that Saenuri members are willing to abandon ther parliamentary seats if the president refuse to accept her resignation plan offered by political parties. But it is still unclear how many of them would stick to their commitment in a secret ballot. In a survey released by local daily JoongAng Ilbo on Friday, Among 31 Saenuri lawmakers supporting impeachment in its previous poll, 21 said they would change their mind if Park decided to step down next April. Rep. Kim Moo-sung, the former Saenuri leader who had vowed to spearhead the effort to impeach her, told reporters on Friday that if the president set a date for her resignation, the lawmakers would not have to impeach her. Other Saenuri impeachment supporters said that if the political parties failed to come up with a unified plan for Park’s resignation, they would push ahead with her impeachment, even if the president said that she would resign next April. “There are no changes to our plan for impeaching her,” said Rep. Yoo Seong-min of Saenuri Party, another key Park opponent. “If the political parties fail to reach an agreement when opposition parties rejected Park’s April resignation plan, we would join in impeaching Park.”By Yeo Jun-suk","an opposition coalition decided friday ,her resignation opposition lawmakers dismissed ,floor next thursday the lawmakers ,for her resignation opposition lawmakers ,parliamentary impeachment of president park","['Park Geun', 'Park', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'People ’s Party', 'Justice Party', 'Park', 'Park', 'Park', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Park', 'Choi', 'the Democratic Party', 'Justice Party', 'the People ’s Party', 'Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri', 'Saenuri', 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'National Assembly', 'Park', 'Park Jie - won', ""the People 's Party"", 'Woo Sang - ho', 'the Democratic Party', 'Roh Hoe - chan', 'the Justice Party', 'the National Assembly', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'Hwang Young', 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'Park', 'the National Assembly', 'Saenuri', 'Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'Chung', 'Saenuri', 'Ilbo', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Saenuri', 'Saenuri', 'Park ’s', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park', 'Park', 'Park', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.74275458  0.17742062

The ultimatum was issued during a meeting of the non-Park loyalists in the Saenuri Party that morning.  They said they will join the opposition in the impeachment vote on Dec. 9 should the president refuse to accept their demand.  The Saenuri dissenters rejected minor opposition parties' proposal to vote on the impeachment motion Monday. Instead, they offered to negotiate with the opposition to hammer out a bipartisan agreement by Wednesday to push for Park's voluntary resignation. Ruling and opposition parties remained divided over how to remove President Park Geun-hye from office due to an influence-peddling scandal. Park loyalists have suggested a voluntary resignation whereas the opposition prefer an impeachment. In the middle are the Saenuri lawmakers opposed to Park, who hold the key to determining the fate of the embattled leader.The opposition's plan to vote on the impeachment motion on Friday was delayed as the parties diverged in reaction to the president's announcement Tuesday that she would let parliament decide her fate as president.The splinter People's Party declined to hand in the impeachment motion to the parliament on Thursday, as Saenuri dissenters faltered after her speech. They called for more time get enough votes from the governing party.In order for the impeachment motion to pass, 200 lawmakers of the 300-seat National Assembly need to vote for it. The opposition and independent lawmakers are 28 seats short of the necessary two-thirds majority and therefore must persuade the non-Park faction in the ruling Saenuri Party to join forces as well.The Saenuri group supporting the impeachment said Friday it will continue talks with the opposition parties on the president's voluntary resignation.They earlier agreed with Park loyalists to push to let the president step down voluntarily by April and hold the presidential election in June.

James Mattis for defense secretary, and a formal announcement is expected by early next week, The Washington Post reported Thursday.Mattis, a former commander of the Central Command, has been widely considered the No. 1 candidate for defense secretary as Trump said last month that he had a ""very impressive"" meeting with him and lauded him as ""the real deal"" and ""a true general's general."" The Washington Post said the decision will be announced by early next week. It cited unidentified people familiar with the matter. CNN carried a similar report. US President-elect Donald Trump  shakes hands with retired US Marine Corps General James Mattis at the clubhouse of Trump International Golf Club, in Bedminster Township, New Jersey, USA. Mattis, 66, retired in 2013 after serving 44 years in the military. Nicknamed ""Mad Dog"" because of his tough talk and eagerness to fight, he is considered something of a legendary figure and is well-respected not only in the Marine Corps but also throughout the US military.As Central Command leader, Mattis oversaw all US forces in the Middle East. But his hard-line views on how to deal with Iran were at odds with the administration of President Barack Obama. He has also been an outspoken critic of the Iranian nuclear deal.Mattis is considered a supporter of alliances with foreign countries, a departure from Trump who has accused allies of relying on the United States for their defense without paying enough. Having allies pay more for American troops was one of his top campaign pledges.During a discussion at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in April, he reportedly said that he was troubled by President Barack Obama's remarks in a media interview that there were ""free riders"" accepting US help without reciprocating.Mattis is expected to seek a hard-line policy on the North.The Washington Post said Mattis favors a tougher stance against US adversaries abroad, especially Iran. He called the Middle Eastern nation ""the single most enduring threat to stability and peace"" in the region, and said the Iranian nuclear deal won't stop its acquisition of nuclear weapons.His blunt statements have caused controversy, including his 2005 remark, ""It's fun to shoot some people.""Should Trump decide to nominate Mattis for defense secretary, the nomination would need a waiver from Congress because it would run counter to the regulation that a retired officer can become defense secretary only seven years after leaving the military.

Jeong Dae-chul of the People’s Party was quoted as saying. The 71-year-old veteran diplomat, who has been with the UN for the past 10 years, was once considered the conservatives’ best shot at winning the next presidential election. Ban, though considered to be leaning center-right, has never publicly made clear his political inclination. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon attends a press interview in New York, Monday. The UN chief has not yet declared his run for the presidency, although he has made several remarks that were taken as hints for such an ambition. South Korean conservatives are in disarray, with President Park, who won the election on the ticket of the Saenuri Party, deeply unpopular in the wake of a humiliating political scandal. Speculation is rife that Ban may team up with Park’s now-estranged allies and some center-left politicians to forge a new political force that stands in the center of the country’s polarized political spectrum.  Rep. Kim Moo-sung, a key figure representing the anti-president conservatives, also said recently that there is no reason for Ban to join the foundering pro-Park faction of Saenuri Party. Ban had a flurry of meetings with politicians this year, which some suspect may have been related to his presidential ambitions. In May, during his visit to Korea, the UN official encountered several political bigwigs of the Saenuri Party, including floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn.In September in the US, he met with the floor leaders of the ruling Saenuri Party and two major opposition parties. Ban is reported to return to Korea in mid-January after his term as UN secretary-general ends on Dec. 31. With President Park and Saenuri Party’s approval ratings plummeting to all-time lows, Ban’s popularity has also declined.According to a Realmeter survey released Thursday, Ban continued to rank as the second-strongest presidential hopeful, and is closely followed by a rising presidential hopeful from the Democratic Party of Korea, Seongnam Mayor Lee Jae-myeong, by 3 percentage points. Since the scandal ensnaring the president broke in late October, Ban has been outpaced by the former leader of the Democratic Party, Rep.

The conservative ruling Saenuri Party, in a general assembly of its lawmakers, officially decided to propose the schedule, in response to the president’s call Tuesday for rival parties to decide the fate of her presidency.It was a surprise agreement because the party is deeply divided into two factions: the over 40 lawmakers moving to join the opposition-led campaign to impeach Park and the rest who remain loyal to the president. “For a safe and smooth transition of power and preparations for a presidential election, party lawmakers unanimously agreed that the end of April would be the best timing ,” Saenuri floor leader Rep.

Calling it the “Park Geun-hye textbook” after the incumbent president who initiated the drive to mandate state-authored history textbooks, they called for a complete abolishment of the plan. “The textbooks are not just partly wrong, but need to be retracted as a whole,” said Rep. Yoo Sung-yeob of the People’s Party, who heads the parliamentary culture and education committee. Lee Joon-sik, education minister and deputy prime minister for social affairs, formally unveils the three draft versions of controversial state-authored history textbooks at the government complex in Seoul on Nov. 28, 2016.On Monday, the Ministry of Education and National Institute of Korean History unveiled draft copies of three history textbooks stipulated by the state, which they claimed were designed to assert the country’s legitimacy and remove political bias. Opposition politicians and some civic groups suspect the move to introduce state-compiled books is an attempt by President Park to glorify the military dictatorship of her father. Park’s father, Park Chung-hee, was a military strongman who ruled the country for 18 years until his assassination in 1979. One of the newly released history textbooks is 286 pages, about 100 pages shorter than the current books, according to Rep. Do Jong-hwan of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea. An education ministry official distributes the pilot editions of controversial state-authored history textbooks to journalists at the government complex in Seoul on Nov. 28, 2016. There are eight publishers producing different textbooks that schools can choose from. The government plans to replace these options with one state-authored book.“While the pages were cut by a third, the modern history part has only been reduced by 0.4 percent. It is thought that the part about the former President Park Chung-hee administration increased,” he said. Rep. Yoo Eun-hye of the Democratic Party of Korea also pointed out errors in the draft copy.“In the high school history textbook, a picture of a performance in Paris is described as if it was taken in Korea,” Yoo said at the party’s special committee against the history textbook Tuesday. “Even the smallest facts are wrong.”The nation’s superintendent of education association released a statement Monday denouncing the textbooks, calling for the ministry to immediately discard them.“The whole process of the project and the intention was against the Constitution and cannot be justified. It does not even deserve the public’s review,” the statement said. A union of some 2,000 middle and high school history teachers echoed the statement Tuesday, saying the government’s unilateral distribution of history textbooks is not appropriate for the subject, which should be taught to nurture diverse thinking and critical points of view of students. “The textbook is poorly made without considering the current status of history education,” the group added.The conservative Korean Federation of Teachers Association also stated they cannot accept the history textbook as designated by the government. “The political stances of the writers are not balanced and it had stipulated wrong information, such as the date of establishment of the nation,” the group said. Education Minister Lee Jun-sik said Monday that the Ministry of Education and the National Institute of Korean History will confirm after Dec. 23 whether or not the introduction of the textbook in schools in March will go as planned.  He mentioned a possible delay in the adaption of the books, adding they may only be tested in a small number of schools first. The Education Ministry previously revised the education law last December to use the state-authored textbooks from March, at least a year earlier than the previous plan.

The disgraced leader expressed her willingness Tuesday to give up the presidency, due to end in February 2018, if the National Assembly secures a “stable pathway” for its handover.At the heart of the discussions are the time frame of Park’s dismissal and the vote, as well as whether to let Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn take over reign or appoint someone else in that position. As a way out, the ruling Saenuri Party has floated afresh an amendment to the Constitution to be carried out in tandem with the ongoing impeachment campaign. Leaders of the ruling Saenuri Party, including Chairman Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, watch TV as President Park Geun-hye makes her third national address on the corruption scandal involving her confidante Choi Soon-sil. Floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk said the amendment could result in reducing Park’s term by seven to eight months while sating ever-growing demands to decentralize power away from the president. “Once complete, the constitutional amendment would make possible the president’s orderly, early resignation,” Chung told reporters after Park’s news conference. “We have to wrap up the lackluster debate on the constitutional amendment and move to the next stage.” He also reiterated calls for talks on the formation of a neutral Cabinet as a follow-up step to the impeachment vote. Some leading opposition politicians, including main opposition Democratic Party of Korea Chairwoman Rep. Choo Mi-ae, argue Hwang should not be made acting president and should also take responsibility for his failure to advise the president in the run-up to the Choi Soon-sil scandal. “If the impeachment motion is passed under the current circumstances, the prime minister will take over the job and then questions may arise as to whether his leadership would live up to the people’s will,” Chung said. “To minimize the administrative impasse, I will negotiate with the opposition on the issue of the creation of a neutral Cabinet.” But the opposition camp has rebuffed the idea, calling it an attempt to divert attention ahead of a looming vote on the impeachment motion. Some Saenuri members, such as Reps. Na Kyung-won and Ha Tae-keung, also warned the party leadership against distracting the discussions. “Now is not the time to talk about a constitutional amendment, but to concentrate on unseating the president,” the party’s former chair and leading presidential contender Moon Jae-in said in an interview with JTBC late Monday. “Whether it be an impeachment or the president’s resignation, an early presidential election is unavoidable, and what matters is when,” he said ahead of Park’s news conference Tuesday. Rep, Park Jie-won, interim chief and floor leader of the minor opposition People’s Party, also urged Saenuri lawmakers to focus on the impeachment initiative, which he said is the “right way to uphold the citizens’ will.” As part of efforts to prepare for uncertainties, the two opposition parties held a seminar Monday to explore ways to better steer a post-impeachment administration. Many participants have raised concerns about the lack of clear documents on the role of the acting president, including whether it includes personnel appointment power, which may lead to an administrative vacuum. “There are no specific rules on the authority and status of the acting president due to past imperfect lawmaking,” co-host Democratic Party Rep. Min Byung-doo said during the event, raising the need to enact related legislation. Among the hotly debated topics was whether the acting president would be able to appoint the successors to two constitutional justices who are slated to finish their terms in January and March. Once the Assembly approves the impeachment motion, the Constitutional Court is required to deliberate on it within 180 days of the submission.  Another co-host, People’s Party Rep. Kim Kwan-young, said the acting president should be given authority to name new judges, given the responsibility for state affairs and urgency of the issue.

The ministry and National Institute of Korean History revealed three history textbooks for middle school and high school students, called the “Correct History Textbook,” which they said were designed to assert the country’s legitimacy and remove political bias.“We developed these textbooks to help our students gain a balanced view on the country and its history without leaning toward any particular ideology,” said Education Minister Lee Jun-sik during a press briefing at Seoul Government Complex. “It is difficult to anticipate a bright future if students doubt the legitimacy of the country without feeling proud of our history,” he said, adding that existing textbooks issued by private publishers have been biased.  But the official introduction of state-issued textbooks next March is likely to face a tough road ahead in the face of massive rallies against the scandal-hit President Park and her signature policies. Following the unveiling of the book, civic groups heavily criticized the textbook for “beautifying” dictators, including President Park Geun-hye’s late father and former president Park Chung-hee, and their economy-focused policies. “The unveiled textbook is unilaterally glorifying benefits from economic growth by stressing roles of authoritarian governments and family-owned companies,” an association of some 480 civic groups opposing state-issued history textbooks said in a statement. “We are not going to recognize it as an official textbook.”The government, which has refused to reveal the full list of writers, released the names of 31 of 46 writers for the history textbook. The move is likely to further stoke dispute as it included mostly right-wing scholars and teachers left-wing scholars accused of justifying pro-Japanese activities during the colonial era and glorifying dictatorships.“Prominent scholars, experts and teachers in the field participated in producing the textbooks to base it on historical facts and constitutional values,” the ministry said. A third of the writing staff are from state-run organizations. Four out of seven writers of Korean modern history belong to neo-conservative organizations. There is not a single scholar who majored in modern history among them. The new textbooks cover some of the most disputed parts of the nation’s history, from its foundation through its depiction of economic achievement by former dictators to the pro-democracy movement.  The reinstatement of state-issued history textbooks has sparked resistance from who opponents who claim Park is attempting to rewrite history.In the revised version, the textbooks describe South Korea as being founded on Aug. 15, 1948 -- three years after Korea’s liberation from Japan’s 1910-1945 colonial rule. That is the day of “foundation of the Republic of Korea,” or South Korea, instead of the “establishment of the ROK government,” according to the books. Right-wing politicians and historians see the country as having been officially launched in 1948 by former President Syngman Rhee. Leftists, on the other hand, say the country was established in Shanghai in 1919 in the form of the government-in-exile to fight against Japan. They accuse the new state-authored history books of undermining the independence fighters’ activities to win independence from Japanese colonial rule.The ministry also said that it stressed North Korea’s human rights violations, military provocations, nuclear development and how its leader Kim Jong-un uses its self-reliance ideology to justify its regime. The “establishment of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,” or North Korea, was revised to the “establishment of the North Korean government,” the ministry said. It also stipulated that the 1950-1953 Korean War was sparked by North Korea’s invasion on June 25, 1950. The government had criticized some privately published history textbooks for claiming both countries shared blame for the war. The government announced its plan to revise the current textbook publication system in October last year, criticizing the previous textbooks for being biased against leftists and highlighting the need for “balanced” state-authored history books.Park had emphasized the necessity of state textbooks to “normalize history education,” and recently said that failure to learn history “in a correct way” can cause one’s soul “to become abnormal.”Currently, South Korean middle and high schools use history textbooks that are published by eight private publishing companies and approved by the government. Primary schools already use a single set of state-authored history textbooks.The ministry plans to make public the draft version and receive feedback from experts and the public by Dec. 23, by releasing the textbooks in e-book form at http://historytextbook.moe.go.kr. Taking into account the opinions, the final version will be confirmed in late January next year, the ministry said. The final version of the history textbook is slated to be used at middle and high schools nationwide starting from the next semester, which begins in March. Lee dismissed speculation that the ministry is considering delaying the introduction of the textbooks or allowing both state-authored and privately published books to be used at schools in the wake of the massive anti-government protests.“We are going to adopt the state-authored textbook as planned. We don’t consider at all scrapping it, but we review ways for schools to better use them in the field,” Lee said.By Ock Hyun-ju","three history textbooks for middle ,controversial state authored history textbooks ,history revealed three history textbooks ,high schools use history textbooks ,revealed three history textbooks","['the Ministry of Education', 'Park Geun', 'National Institute of korean History', 'Lee Jun - sik', 'Seoul Government Complex', 'Park', 'Park Geun - hye ’s', 'Park Chung - hee', 'pro - japanese', 'korean', 'Park', 'South Korea', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'the Republic of Korea', 'South Korea', 'ROK', 'Syngman Rhee', 'Shanghai', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'North Korea ’s', 'Kim Jong - un', 'the Democratic People ’s Republic of Korea', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'North Korea ’s', 'south korean', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",7,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.3409386   0.34950095

Michael Yahuda, professor emeritus of international relations at the London School of Economics and Political Science, said that the incoming US leader’s unpredictability has uprooted the stability of the existing world order based on American influence.Micahel Yahuda“His election showed that people throughout the world have taken for granted that American alliance will stand, for specific things. He has thrown that into doubt,” he said. “Even if he doesn’t change anything , his election and the way he addressed things suggest we can’t take this for granted anymore. So I think American allies will begin to reduce their reliance on America. Because today it’s Trump, but tomorrow it will be someone else.”Among the numerous questions raised by Trump’s election, one of the biggest concerns in South Korea has been the uncertainty surrounding national security. Trump’s talks of possibly pulling US troops out of the peninsula has sparked South Koreans to talk about arming themselves with nuclear-powered submarines or even nuclear weapons.“I think what most people are expecting to see is the beginnings of debates on how much -- let’s say -- Koreans need to rely on themselves. What do they need?” posed Yahuda. As it is realistically impossible to substitute the entire defense capacity of the US troops, Yahuda said there has to be a debate about choosing which aspects South Koreans will need to focus on for self-reliance.“All of this has deepened whatever uncertainty there is ...  not only needs conventional weapons, but also a high-tech military system,  relies on America,” he said. South Korea has two Aegis-equipped destroyers and recently agreed with the US to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system on the peninsula next year, which has an advanced AN/TPY-2 radar with a potential range of up to 2,000 kilometers. But many of the country’s detection and counterattack abilities rely on US assets. The country’s homegrown missile defense system is expected to be completed in the early-2020s in the best-case scenario.The prospect of less US military presence on the peninsula also raises concerns about China and Russia, who have opposed stationing the US THAAD system within a relative stone’s throw of their borders.“Because the pressing issue is whether South Korea is going to go in for the THAAD system, especially with  Chinese and Russians ... now, if there is a feeling that the Americans are not reliable, then why antagonize the Chinese? It’s very difficult,” Yahuda said.On the issue of THAAD, he highlighted the challenges presented for smaller powers like South Korea when dealing with greater powers like the US and China. “When the bigger power senses some sort of conflict that is not in the interest of  smaller power, they nevertheless drag the smaller power into it. That’s the kind of trouble you get in alliance,” Yahuda said.He also predicts that Trump, who said he is open to a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, may take what he will see as a more pragmatic approach toward Pyongyang’s nuclear programs.“One idea is putting a cap on it . ... Because Trump is not ideological, he is not going to ‘make a fuss’ about human rights. That’s another kind of change,” Yahuda said. Yahuda, who taught Chinese State Councilor Yang Jiechi in the 1970s, said China appears to believe the current situation is giving them an advantage in terms of regional influence. In terms of international trade, he said that China’s recent actions suggest they are trying to establish an economic group with Asian neighbors, as the future of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal seems uncertain.Trump has openly expressed his disapproval of the TPP, though Yahuda suspects that Republicans in the US Congress might come up with some “face-saving” device.But the danger lurking for China amid all the uncertainty is that they may “overplay their hand,” Yahuda said. “If he  wants to make America great again, he can’t start by suddenly withdrawing from this part of the world . Nor can he start by making it look as if  Chinese are benefitting. That’s why I think  Chinese may have overreached,” he said.By Yoon Min-sik","raised by trump election ,questions raised by trump election ,business mogul donald trump ,business mogul donald trump as ,raised by trump election one","['Donald Trump', 'US', 'UK', 'America', 'Michael Yahuda', 'the London School of Economics', 'US', 'american', 'Micahel', 'american', 'american', 'America', 'Trump ’s', 'South Korea', 'trump ’s', 'US', 'South Koreans', 'Koreans', 'US', 'South Koreans', 'America', 'South Korea', 'US', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'US', 'US', 'China', 'Russia', 'US', 'South Korea', 'Chinese', 'Russians', 'Americans', 'Chinese', 'South Korea', 'US', 'China', 'Trump', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Pyongyang', 'Chinese', 'Councilor Yang Jiechi', 'China', 'China', 'asian', 'the Trans - Pacific Partnership', 'TPP', 'Yahuda', 'Republicans', 'the US', 'China', 'America', 'Chinese', 'Chinese', 'Yoon Min - sik']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61343616  0.38523293

Lee reiterated that the ministry is intent on gathering opinions from experts and the public to come up with a more ideal way to introduce the textbooks, not to abolish them. He was seeking to clarify his remarks made Friday during a parliamentary hearing, which had given rise to speculations that the ministry may scrap the textbook plan, depending on public and academic reactions to a preliminary version of the governmental compilations to be unveiled Monday. He had said then: “After seeing reactions to the draft version, we will consider how to proceed.” Opponents of the state-authored history textbook plan hold a rally at Gwanghwamun Square in Seoul on Sunday. Opponents of the plan have been putting pressure on the government to annul the unified textbook plan, which is a project of President Park Geun-hye, riding on the overwhelming public disapproval of the conservative leader amid a major political scandal involving her confidante. They claim that the plan to replace history textbooks at schools with ones that are authored by government-chosen scholars is an attempt by Park to glorify former dictators, including her own father. Park’s father -- President Park Chung-hee -- seized power through a military coup and ruled the country for 18 years with an iron fist until his assassination in 1979.   Currently, South Korean middle and high schools use history textbooks that are published by eight private publishing companies and approved by the government. Primary schools already use a single set of state-authored history textbooks.The Presidential Office wants the new ones to be taught at classrooms nationwide from the coming academic year that starts in March. On Friday, the ministry had revealed its guidelines for the textbooks, which touch on some of the most sensitive disputes in the country’s modern history. It said the ruling principle of the textbooks must “reflect the latest academic theories in order to describe historical facts without errors and keep impartiality.”By Korea Herald staff","plan to replace history textbooks ,history textbook plan hold rally ,replace history textbooks at schools ,sunday opponents of the plan ,authored history textbooks the presidential","['Lee Jun - shik', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Park Chung - hee', 'south korean', 'the Presidential Office', 'Korea Herald']",13,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.71842122  0.09721568

This is the fifth week of major anti-Park protests since the scandal surfaced in late October. It appears to be the largest in scale since the pro-democracy protests in the 1980s. The police put the turnout number in Seoul at 270,000.Protesters hold a candlelight rally calling for President Park Geun-hye's resignation at Ghwanghwamun Square in central Seoul, Saturday. As in previous rallies, most of the participants were unaffiliated citizens who came with their family and friends. Many of them wore thick winter jackets and rain coats to keep warm, as Saturday saw the first snow fall of the season.  Participants sit in front of the makeshift stage at Gwanghwamun Square in central Seoul ahead of the main event to begin in the evening during anti-Park Geun-hye rally, Saturday. “It is difficult to take care of my children on the street during the rally, especially because it’s snowing and cold, but it is peaceful, so it’s OK,” Jung Young-hoon, a 36-year-old father of two, told The Korea Herald. “I had to come to show my kids that this is democracy. My children are young, but it is them who will lead the future of this country.” Jung Young-hoon and his family in front of Sejong Art Center in central Seoul during the anti-Park Geun-hye rally, Saturday. “I am afraid nothing will change despite the rallies, but I will still come to contribute even a little to making a change,” he said. Cheerful songs calling for Park’s ouster blared from loudspeakers. Street vendors sold candles, mats, raincoats and heat packs. There were also stalls selling hot snacks such as chicken skewers, sausages and fish cakes.   Protestors march towards the presidential office during the anti-Park Geun-hye rally held in central Seoul, Saturday. “I thought this kind of mass protest was only possible in the past. I am proud and touched that we are showing the people’s power,” said Hwang Yoon-sun, a 20-year-old university student. “I will hold up a candle until she steps down.”Ahead of the main event in the evening, nearly 400,000 protestors flocked to four locations within a kilometer from Cheong Wa Dae, surrounding the presidential office. The marching rally was made possible after a local court ordered police to withdraw a ban that had previously sought to prevent protestors from doing so. Upon the court order, protestors were able to get closer to the presidential office than past rallies, gathering in front of Cheongwoon-dong community center, just 200 meters from Cheong Wa Dae.  Protestors are barred from marching to the presidential office by police bus barricades during the anti-Park Geun-hye rally held in central Seoul, Saturday. As protestors were blocked from further access by police buses forming a barricade, they confronted police for hours, peacefully, singing and making impromptu speeches from the top of vehicles.“I am so proud that I am raising my voice against President Park Geun-hye as near as possible to Cheong Wa Dae. I will tirelessly speak alongside others to call for her resignation,” said Kang Geum-sook, 50, who came with her daughter. “We elected Park Geun-hye to represent us, not for her to abuse her power.”Protesters were careful to prevent violence. When signs of a possible flare-up appeared, protesters chanted, “No violence!” There were no clashes or arrests reported.  A protestor attaches a flower sticker to a police bus during the anti-Park Guen-hye rally held in central Seoul, Saturday. They also attached some 100,000 flower stickers to the police buses parked near the presidential office. The stickers appeared last week, paid for through arts crowdfunding website 7Pictures. The stickers were artist Lee Gang-hun’s idea to resist the police by turning the wall of buses into a “wall of flowers.”After the rally, some protesters volunteered to remove them. Korean National Police Agency chief Lee Chul-sung said last week he would tolerate the use of flower stickers, citing the title of a book -- “Don’t hit People, Even With a Flower.”“Many people are joining the rally, but are blocked by police buses. I thought putting flower stickers on the police buses is a beautiful and peaceful way to show our resistance against violence by the government,” said Jang Jong-ho, a 27-year-old office worker. As the sun set and people lit candles, the eight-lane boulevard of Sejongno turned into an outdoor concert hall. The protest reached its climax when legendary folk singers Ahn Chi-hwan and Yang Hee-eun took to the stage and sang their signature songs.  A sea of candlelights in central Seoul during the anti-Park Geun-hye rally, Saturday. Some were even seen shedding tears while singing along to Yang’s “Evergreen Tree” when the lyrics went “Although we do not have much, we shed tears hand in hand. Although our road is a long way to go and even precipitous, we shall overcome and be victorious.”At 8 p.m., demonstrators blew out their candles and chanted “Park Geun-hye, resign” in one voice. They relit them a minute later to show they would continue to hold candles until Park leaves her post. The crowd started to shrink at around 10 p.m. with people heading home. Some of them stayed until the early hours of Sunday, making impromptu speeches and enjoying musical performances.The first anti-Park rally held in late October was relatively small in scale, drawing about 30,000 people. But the protest has grown bigger as more Koreans have become enraged by the series of allegations implicating Park in the corruption scandal and her refusal to step down.Prosecutors suspect President Park of letting her longtime confidante Choi Soon-sil, who holds no government post, meddle in state affairs and helping her extort donations from local conglomerates for foundations Choi controls. Choi was arrested for fraud and abuse of power this month. Park made two apologies in the face of public anger, but has refused calls for her resignation. The parliament is taking steps to remove Park from her post, with a vote for impeachment likely to take place as early as Friday.Park’s approval rating has slipped by 1 percentage point to reach 4 percent, the lowest for any sitting South Korean president, according to a Gallup poll released Friday. On Saturday, staunch supporters of President Park rallied at Seoul and the southern city of Daegu from 1 p.m. to counter the anti-Park protests. Some 100 gathered at Seoul Station, while in Daegu, Park’s political home turf, about 400 -- mostly senior citizens -- showed up.By Ock Hyun-ju","anti park protests some 100 ,park protests since the scandal ,central seoul saturday as protestors ,major anti park protests since ,seoul at 270 000 protesters","['Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'Park', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Jung Young - hoon', 'the Korea Herald', 'Jung Young - hoon', 'Seoul', 'Park', 'Seoul', 'Hwang Yoon - sun', 'Cheong', 'Cheong', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'Kang Geum - sook', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Seoul', 'Lee Gang - hun', 'Korean National Police Agency', 'Lee Chul - sung', 'Jang Jong - ho', 'Sejongno', 'Ahn Chi - hwan', 'Yang Hee - eun', 'Seoul', 'Yang', 'Park Geun - hye', 'anti - park', 'Koreans', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Park ’s', 'south korean', 'Gallup', 'Park', 'Seoul', 'Daegu', 'Seoul Station', 'Daegu', 'Park ’s', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",15,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.34341228  0.37106264

The guideline compilation has drawn attention from the public, as it serves as a preview of the preliminary version of the government-written history textbook set to be revealed on Monday. The Education ministry said the ruling principle of the textbooks must ""reflect the latest academic theories in order to describe historical facts without errors and keep impartiality.""Regarding Korean Liberation Day on Aug. 15, 1945, the ministry said the textbooks will describe the day as ""the day of the foundation of the Republic of Korea."" This has been one of the most fiercely disputed parts of the state-authored textbooks, as many historians have claimed that the day should be called ""the establishment of the government of the ROK"" instead based on the reasoning that the country already existed in the form of the provisional government in Shanghai before the liberation day. The provisional government fought for Korean liberation against imperial Japan.Consequently, the dispute ultimately intensified over the question of who to credit as the true founder of the ROK, the provisional government or the first South Korean President Rhee Syng-man.The history textbooks for high schools will present the development of the foundation of the ROK in the aftermath of Korean Liberation Day.The state-authored textbooks will also detail the process of the state-led economic development plans and the resulting economic development. In the latter part, the textbooks will touch on the country's rise to become a global economic power in the present day.The Education Ministry said it stressed the exclusion of subjective evaluations by the authors in order to secure impartiality. The description of the current Park Geun-hye administration will be limited to its key political drives. The upcoming state-authored history books are planned to replace the current history textbooks that are published by eight private publishing companies and approved by the government for use. Primary schools already use a single set of state-authored history textbooks.The compilation of state-authored history textbooks has ignited nationwide protests from opponents who say it could lead to the glorification of former dictators of the country, including late President Park Chung-hee, the father of President Park Geun-hye.","authored history textbooks on friday ,history textbooks on friday ,controversial state authored history textbooks ,history textbooks on friday which ,textbooks has ignited nationwide protests","['the south Korean Ministry of Education', 'the Education ministry', 'Korean Liberation Day', 'the Republic of Korea', 'ROK', 'Shanghai', 'korean', 'Japan', 'ROK', 'south korean', 'Rhee Syng', 'ROK', 'Korean Liberation Day', 'the Education Ministry', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Park Geun - hye']",2,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.29550499  0.63355279

Making her fall from grace even more humiliating has been the barrage of revelations that the country’s first female president may have undergone all sorts of anti-aging medical procedures -- even at Cheong Wa Dae when she should have been attending to her official duties.  President Park Geun-hye On Thursday, Cheong Wa Dae officially refuted the speculation, saying it is not possible to perform plastic surgery at Cheong Wa Dae’s medical clinic. It also said the purchase of some of the disputed medicines by the office was not to augment Park’s appearance, but for the health and well-being of all staff members working at its secretariat and security service at the presidential office. “It is simply not possible to do cosmetic skin care here at the Blue House medical unit,” Lee Sun-woo, head of the Presidential Office’s medical unit, said in a statement. A controversy has flared up this week after Cheong Wa Dae’s list of drug purchases was revealed to have contained injection doses of human placenta extract and vitamin shots commonly used for anti-aging and fatigue treatment, as well as pills to treat erectile dysfunction, including Viagra. According to the list made available by Rep. Kim Sang-hee of the opposition Democratic Party of Korea, Park’s office purchased 323 kinds of medicine worth more than 20 million won  between March 2014 and August this year. Among them was Laennec, for administration via intravenous injection, which is made of human placenta extract and known to improve the function of the liver, remove wrinkles and whiten skin. There were also Fursultiamine, known to help prevent vitamin deficiency, aging and fatigue, and Emla 5 percent, a numbing cream widely used for Botox treatments, laser facial rejuvenation treatments or dermal filler injections. “Such injections are not prescribed to patients at university hospitals because their safety and efficacy have not been verified,” Oh Sang-woo, a family physician from Dongguk University, said. The presidential office purchased etomidate-lipuro injections, which are intravenous anesthetic agents and known to have similar effects as propofol. Since propofol was designated as a psychotropic drug in 2011, imports of etomidate-lipuro injections have increased more than six times.On Viagra and the generic version of the drug in the list, Cheong Wa Dae said a day earlier that it was to ease possible mountain sickness during Park’s visit to high-altitude nations in Africa. In May, Park went on a trip to Ethiopia, Uganda and Kenya, whose capitals are some 1,000 to 2,000 kilometers above sea level. In regard to the purchase of the topical narcotic cream, the main doctor at the presidential office said: “It is to relieve pain of injuries staff members suffer.” Even before the Cheong Wa Dae medicine provision list was exposed, Park’s secrete anti-aging formula had been the talk of the town. Photos of her taken between 2004 and 2016 have circulated online, with online users alleging she looks years younger now, with less wrinkles and brighter skin than 12 years ago. A series of local media outlets reported that Park received expensive medical care at the Chaum Clinic, at costs of 150 million won a year, before she was elected president. She was found to have used a bogus name -- Gil-la-im, the name of a female lead in a local TV series in 2011, and is suspected to have not paid for the services. It was additionally reported that she even visited Chaum Clinic twice in 2013 during the day while serving as president. One of the medical treatments was reportedly for anti-aging by Dr. Kim Sang-man. Kim, a doctor who worked at Chaum Clinic, is suspected of prescribing vitamin shots to President Park under the name of her confidante Choi Soon-sil. Kim admitted he treated the president on 12 occasions at Chaum Clinic or at the presidential office. Kim even tested Park’s blood under Choi’s name at his clinic without the knowledge of the official presidential medical staff. Rep. Kim took issue with the nation’s top leader, whose health information is considered a national secret, having been examined and taken care of by a civilian doctor who holds no government post. “I doubt that the medical system at Cheong Wa Dae properly worked. I think that President Park’s civilian confidants peddled influence even over the official medical system,” said Rep. Kim in an interview with local media. Lee Byung-suk, head of Severance Hospital, who served as the first official doctor for Park, said that all the medical staff members from the presidential office were asked not to be present when the doctor Kim treated Park. Kim had been a family doctor for Choi and her family members since 2011. He was later appointed as one of the president’s medical advisers in 2013. Since he left Chaum Clinic in 2014, he has headed Green Cross I-Med.But speculations grew that Kim received special favors from the government for the dubious prescriptions for Park, as most of the injection drugs and vitamin shots were found to be made or imported by Green Cross. The prosecution said Tuesday it will investigate why Park received her prescriptions under Choi’s name at private medical clinics. Kim’s qualification as a doctor have been suspended for 75 days.

In an interview with CNN on Tuesday, the outgoing UN chief said that he would “think about” his role in South Korea after his term ends on Dec 31. Ban also noted that he has “grave concern” over the nepotism scandal tied to Park’s longtime confidante Choi Soon-sil. “I will think about what would be the best for me to serve for my country” Ban said. “As one of the citizens of Korea, I would say that I have been closely following this situation with grave concern. I know that people are frustrated. I know that sometimes they are very angry for what had happened.”Ever since Ban hinted at a potential bid for the 2017 election for the first time in May, there have been rumors that he might be elected as the Saenuri candidate under the auspices of President Park and her loyalists inside Saenuri.  United Nation’s Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon But the looming scenario has been challenged by the public’s outrage over the Choi scandal. With President Park and Saenuri Party’s approval rating plummeting to an all-time low, Ban’s popularity has also declined.According to Realmeter survey released Thursday, Ban was picked as the second favorite presidential hopeful behind Democratic Party’s former leader Rep. Moon Jae-in. Since the scandal broke out in late October, Ban has been outpaced by Moon. Beforehand, Ban was often picked as the most favorite presidential candidate. Based on Realmeter polls on a hypothetical 2017 race released in August and September, Ban defeated Moon and other contenders outside a margin of error. Such records have put conservative power brokers supporting Ban at unease. Former Prime Minister Kim Jong-pil, who had urged Ban to play a “bigger role” in Korea’s politics, reportedly told his aides that “things would work against Ban.” Pointing to the growing risk over Ban’s potential run on a Saenuri ticket, analysts said that he would forge alliances with Saenuri heavyweights critical of Park and moderate wings of opposition parties. Former Saenuri leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung, who has campaigned for impeaching the president, said on Thursday that he is “willing to work” with Ban for the 2017 election.

It hovered below the People's Party, which garnered 17.9 percent, becoming the third player in terms of public approval. The main opposition Democratic Party posted 33.4 percent, up 2.9 percentage points. The ruling party has been dogged by an internal feud among Park-loyalists and their opponents, sparked by the scandal surrounding Choi Soon-sil, who allegedly exerted power over state affairs and enjoyed various illegal benefits. On Wednesday, Rep. Kim Moo-sung, former head of Saenuri, announced he will push for Park's impeachment, which is widely seen as a catalyst to rally party members behind the suprapartisan campaign to unseat the president. Three opposition parties joined forces to seek a parliamentary impeachment of Park.Earlier this week, Gyeonggi Gov. Nam Kyung-pil and third-term lawmaker Kim Yong-tae announced their decision to leave Saenuri.Moon Jae-in, former head of the main opposition, stood as the most favored presidential contender for next year's race with 21.2 percent approval, up 0.8 percentage point from last week. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon followed with 17.4 percent, down 0.7 percent.The survey was conducted this week on 1,519 South Koreans, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.","illegal benefits on wednesday rep ,democratic party posted 33 percent ,unseat the president three opposition ,her confidante poll showed thursday ,party posted 33 percent up","[""South Korea 's"", 'Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun', ""the People 's Party"", 'Democratic Party', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'Park', 'Gyeonggi', 'Nam Kyung - pil', 'Kim Yong - tae', 'Saenuri', 'Moon Jae - in', 'UN', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'South Koreans']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.16860713  0.22793683

It has a mandate to investigate the high-profile case for a period of up to four months.Meanwhile, the presidential office renewed calls for media prudence, arguing there are many erroneous reports on its purchase of medicine.A local media outlet reported that in June 2014, Cheong Wa Dae purchased ""EMLA Cream 5%,"" a medicine to numb the surface of the skin before certain medical procedures. The report came amid rumors that the president underwent plastic surgery during a ferry disaster on April 16, 2014, that left more than 300 passengers dead or missing.""When there is a cut on your skin, you can apply it to anesthetize the area,"" Jung said, dismissing the speculation that the cream was purchased to carry out cosmetic surgery.Amid controversy over a list of medicine Cheong Wa Dae has purchased over the past several years, the medical office said those drugs were bought to provide timely medical services to all employees working under the president.Among the drugs was Viagra, a drug for men with erectile dysfunction, which the presidential office said is effective in preventing and treating altitude sickness. Park traveled to Mexico in March and Ethiopia in May, which are located 2,200 meters and 2,400 meters above sea level, respectively.The medical office also dismissed the rumors about cosmetic surgery, stressing there was no equipment to carry out any surgery.","office also dismissed the rumors ,hye over the corruption scandal ,president who is denying string ,the medical office also dismissed ,due to conflict with president","['Cheong', 'Park Geun', 'Justice', 'Kim Hyun - woong', 'Choi Jai - kyeong', 'Jung Youn', 'Park', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Jung', 'Cheong', 'Dae', 'Mexico', 'Ethiopia']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50550896  0.56089938

Local parties have been seeking the formation of a neutral Cabinet, with a new prime minister amid the leadership crisis brought on by the scandal.It will mark the first time in 12 years for the parliament to hand in a motion to impeach a president. In 2004, the National Assembly sought to impeach late former President Roh Moon-hyun, which was later turned down by the Constitutional Court.Political pundits expect 172 lawmakers to support the proposal of the motion, while the number could increase if Saenuri lawmakers from the non-Park faction join the move.For the successful passage of the motion, at least 28 Saenuri lawmakers must vote for the impeachment. While 32 lawmakers from Saenuri expressed support, pundits said there could be some lawmakers in the opposition parties that may vote against it.Once the motion is passed, the result will be reviewed by the Constitutional Court. Experts estimate the process will take some three to four months.","opposition democratic party said thursday ,motion to impeach president ,the impeachment while 32 lawmakers ,president park geun hye impeachment ,to impeach president in 2004","[""South Korea 's"", 'Democratic Party', 'Park Geun', 'Woo Sang - ho', ""South Korea 's"", 'Park', 'Cabinet', 'the National Assembly', 'Roh Moon - hyun', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Saenuri', 'Saenuri', 'Saenuri', 'the Constitutional Court']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46587655  0.3554894

His angry impromptu remark drew cheers from participants. But his use of “miss” -- an English loan word with sexist connotations -- led many to question whether being an unmarried woman should be a point of criticism.A presenter from the candlelight vigil event issued an apology in the face of feminist groups’ complaints, reminding the public that, “We are all citizens with equal rights. We are angry about President Park because she manipulated society, not because she is a woman.”As South Koreans take to the streets every Saturday in large numbers to demand scandal-hit President Park Geun-hye resign, rallies in recent weeks were touted as paving the way for the expansion of peaceful protests. A protestor, who wanted to be identified as Lili, poses during an anti-government rally in central Seoul on Saturday. At the forefront of the anti-government protests were women, young people and families with children, who have not previously been seen as a major presence in anti-government protests. What brightened up the protests were performances, impromptu speeches and chanting by citizens to lampoon the embattled leader. Some called her “chicken head” to attack her intelligence or a “puppet” controlled by a shaman. But behind the festivities and peace were some uncomfortable remarks -- both online and offline -- that were criticized for disparaging women in general and discriminating against them. “I heard a middle-aged man calling Park Geun-hye a crazy bitch. I continued to hear gender-focused slurs at rallies for the past month,” Lee So-yeon, 23-year-old university student, told The Korea Herald. “At that point, I felt like the anger toward Park could translate into misogyny.”“The rally was neither peaceful nor safe,” she added. The feminist group Burning Femi Action told The Korea Herald that it had received 20 complaints from those who joined Saturday’s rally about gender-insensitive or sexually harassing remarks. Some of them were “You are pretty and speak well too” and “Even ajummas who cook and raise children at home are here.”“During rallies, women are often treated like people who are special and need to be protected,” said a feminist activist Mihyun. “But we are just pursuing our civic rights like men to raise our voice in the rally. I don’t know why women have to feel intimidated during rallies.” Some alleged that they were sexually harassed during the rally. Police said they had caught a man in his 50s, who was drunk, for allegedly groping a 20-something female protester’s breasts during a Nov. 12 rally. “A guy in his 40s groped my waist and buttocks while asking me to step aside and pretending to swing his arm. It was very unpleasant, but I got scared because I was alone,” said a 20-something twitter user. Some women said they did not participate in the rally because of what they saw as the blatant sexualization of the female participants. A student at Sookmyung Women’s University posted a statement titled “Why I didn’t go to a rally,” denouncing some of the male protesters for secretly filming women and commenting on their looks. She also took issue with the “rampant sexual harassment” at the events.With allegations over sexual harassment, gender-insensitive remarks and acts going viral online, some women are taking action to fight gender discrimination.“When people talk about Park Geun-hye‘s irregularities, they say it is because she is a woman,” said a 28-year-old protestor who wanted to be identified by Lili. “I believe, without using words of hatred, we can still call for the president’s resignation.”High school students hold a placard reading “Association of Korean Princesses“ during an anti-government rally in central Seoul on Saturday. An 18-year-old student held up a banner saying “Association of Korean Princesses” with two of her friends. ”People began to use the term ‘princess’ to ridicule President Park Geun-hye,” she said. ”The term ‘princess’ itself carries a misogynist message.” Lee Na-young, a sociology professor from Chung-Ang University, pointed out that derogatory remarks and behavior during the rally revealed the underlying sexism in society. “Misogyny might have been largely ignored before in society, but it came to the fore this year along with the young generation rising awareness of gender equality,” Lee said. “Addressing problems and discussing them in public will help to gradually curb prejudice about women in society.”By Ock Hyun-ju  Intern reporter Son Ji-hyoung contributed to this article.","term princess to ridicule president ,saturday rally about gender insensitive ,princess to ridicule president park ,sexually harassed during the rally ,protesters for secretly filming women","['Park Geun', 'Miss Park', 'South Koreans', 'Park Geun', 'Lili', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Lee So - yeon', 'the Korea Herald', 'Burning Femi Action', 'the Korea Herald', 'Mihyun', 'Sookmyung Women ’s University', 'Park Geun - hye‘s', 'Lili', 'Association of Korean Princesses', 'Seoul', 'Association of Korean Princesses', 'Park Geun', 'Lee Na - young', 'Chung - Ang University', 'Lee', 'Ock Hyun - ju', 'Son Ji - hyoung']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22148213  0.13626832

Nam Kyung-pil and third-term lawmaker Kim Yong-tae -- called on other Saenuri members to break away from a clearly wrongful past and join the opposition-led campaign to impeach Park over the scandal involving her confidante Choi Soon-sil.“A president who undermines the values of the Constitution and violates the law for the sake of personal interests does not deserve the mandate granted by the people,” Gyeonggi Gov. Nam, formerly a five-term lawmaker, told a press conference at the National Assembly.  “A political party exists to serve public interests and realize its democratic values. Saenuri has lost its raison d’etre as a political party,” he added. Gyeonggi Province Gov. Nam Kyung-pil  and thrid-term lawmaker Kim Yong-tae, both affiliated with the ruling Saenuri Party, attend a press conference at the National Assembly in Seoul on Tuesday to announce their decision to leave the party. With Nam and Kim out, Saenuri now has 128 lawmakers, and is still the second-largest negotiating bloc in the 300-member parliament. Nam’s Gyeonggi Province is a key political battleground along with the capital Seoul, whose mayor is an opposition politician. The Saenuri feud is deepening, with the faction that was less loyal to Park before the scandal having turned increasingly critical of the president. The faction of Park loyalists, led by party Chairman Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, dominates the party’s leadership council. It is resisting growing calls from within the party to step down to allow new leadership to win back voters. With Park’s poll numbers down to record lows, public support for Saenuri has also plummeted. According to Gallup Korea, Saenuri’s popularity is at 15 percent, the lowest for the conservative camp under Park’s leadership. Its main rival, the Democratic Party of Korea, has 31 percent support. Whether Tuesday’s defections would trigger mass defections of other anti-Park members or lead to an eventual split of the party remains to be seen, political pundits said. On the same day, Reps. Kim Moo-sung, Yoo Seong-min and other bigwigs in the anti-Park faction either refrained from commenting or ruled out the possibility of them following suit, at least in the short term. Yet, with the opposition gathering signatures for the impeachment motion and the president gearing up for a legal battle to oppose the move, it will not be long before Saenuri lawmakers make their choice between Park and the public. Rep. Choung Byoung-gug said, “Right now, Saenuri looks like Park’s private organization. We can’t go on like this.” By Lee Sun-young","impeach park over the scandal ,heavyweight members on tuesday quit ,increasingly critical of the president ,president who undermines the values ,tuesday quit the ruling saenuri","['Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun', 'Nam Kyung - pil', 'Kim Yong - tae', 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'Nam', 'the National Assembly', 'Saenuri', 'd’etre', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Nam Kyung - pil', 'Kim Yong - tae', 'Saenuri Party', 'the National Assembly', 'Seoul', 'Nam', 'Kim', 'Saenuri', 'Nam ’s Gyeonggi Province', 'Seoul', 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'Park', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'Park', 'Saenuri', 'Gallup Korea', 'Saenuri ’s', 'Park ’s', 'the Democratic Party of Korea', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'Choung Byoung', 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'Lee Sun - young']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48489484  0.52582151

The WJP, a U.S.-based independent group working to advance the rule of law globally, compiles the index every year by providing scores and rankings organized around eights factors, including constraints on government powers, absence of corruption, civil justice and criminal justice, through surveys of 1,000 respondents per country and local legal practitioners and academics. Scores range from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating strongest adherence to the rule of law. South Korea took up the post with 0.73, the lowest since 2014, when the country was ranked 14th out of 99 countries with 0.77, the index said. Last year, the country was 11th out of 102 with 0.79.  The country was rated relatively low in the factors of constraints on government powers, absence of corruption and open government, with their scores marking below 0.7, the report showed. For absence of corruption, in particular, the country was ranked 35th. On the other hand, South Korea earned high scores of over 0.8 for order and security, civil justice and criminal justice, according to the report.

He even suggested allowing South Korea and Japan to develop their own nuclear weapons for self-defense so as to reduce US security burdens.About 28,500 American troops are stationed in South Korea to deter North Korean aggression, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.

The move comes as the president, apparently determined to face her biggest crisis head-on, prepares for a legal battle that may determine the fate of her presidency. In a major humiliating blow to the scandal-ridden conservative leader, prosecutors on Sunday named her an accomplice to crimes allegedly committed by her now-infamous friend Choi Soon-sil and two former presidential secretaries. Park is accused of colluding with them to force large conglomerates to donate billons of won to two nonprofit foundations controlled by Choi. The investigators also suspect that Park pressured some of the firms to give contracts to companies run by Choi or Choi’s close associates. The president, through her attorney Yoo Yeong-ha, strongly rejected the allegations and openly pledged not to cooperate with the ongoing prosecutorial probe in the future. “The president will cooperate with an impartial probe led by an independent counsel,” Yoo said. As Park faces more scrutiny from the independent counsel and the parliament, the president is preparing to form a team of legal representatives.  The opposition lawmakers are moving to set in motion a campaign to impeach Park. Once the parliament passes the impeachment motion, it is the Constitutional Court that decides whether Park’s alleged misdeed warrants her removal. The Constitution states that a sitting president can be impeached when he or she is found to have violated the Constitution or law.

101,101,Opposition moves to remove Park,"Major opposition parties Monday moved to begin impeachment proceedings against President Park Geun-hye, raising pressure on the beleaguered leader who is refusing to quit despite mounting calls for her resignation over a nepotism scandal tied to her long-time confidante Choi Soon-sil.

The main opposition Democratic Party of Korea and runner-up People’s Party officially decided to push for Park’s impeachment at their respective general assembly of lawmakers. The Democratic Party has also decided to install an organization to strategize on the impeachment process.“The reason why we decided to seek impeachment is that we believe it is the only measure left for the opposition parties and the people to bring the nation back on track,” said Democratic Party leader Rep. Choo Mi-ae. But the opposition parties have not yet clarified when they will submit an impeachment motion to the National Assembly.Democratic Party floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho said that the party would submit the motion when they “feel confident” about getting it through the legislative hurdle. The passage of the motion requires consent from more than 200 lawmakers of the 300-member National Assembly. Currently, three opposition parties and liberal-minded independents have 171 votes, 29 short of the required quorum. This means assuming there are no dissenting votes from the opposition bloc, at least 29 lawmakers from the president’s governing Saenuri Party must cast their votes across the aisle.Though a group of Saenuri lawmakers critical of the president -- such as its former leader Rep. Kim Moo-dung -- have demanded the impeachment of Park, it is still unclear whether they would cast their votes for a motion and how many Saenuri members would join them. “I think we have to wait and see until we figure out what  are talking about. I don’t know whether they would join us in proposing the impeachment motion or agree with us on beginning proceedings for impeachment,” said Woo. On Sunday, a total of 32 Saenuri lawmakers agreed on the proceeding for an impeachment, but refrained from suggesting they would vote for the motion. A poll released Monday by a local daily said at least 31 Saenuri lawmakers are willing to vote for Park’s impeachmentGiven that the Assembly law states that the impeachment motions should be put to a secret vote, opposition parties rushed to come up with a measure to ensure that dissenting Saenuri members would vote across the political spectrum. The People’s Party said Monday that they would launch a campaign to gather the signatures of more than 200 Saenuri lawmakers approving the impeachment. Democratic Party’s former leader Rep. Moon-Jae echoed the move, saying that the measure can help constituents convince their representatives to join the impeachment and prevent hesitant lawmakers from changing their mind during the voting session. “We have to make sure that the lawmakers reveal to the public whether they will approve or disapprove the impeachment. If some lawmakers refuse to do that, the voters can protest against their decision and help them change their mind,” said Moon during press conference Monday. Another concern lingering among the opposition bloc is on the Constitutional Court: Even if the impeachment motion gained bipartisan support and subsequently cleared the Assembly, the measure would eventually be scrapped unless six out of nine judges in the court approve it.The judges are dominated by conservative scholars appointed by President Park, her predecessor Lee Myung-bak and their governing Saenuri Party. And they are known to have applied strict standards when reviewing an impeachment motion. The Constitution stipulates that a sitting president can be impeached by the Assembly when he or she is found to have violated the Constitution or other laws. When the Assembly passed the motion against the late President Roh Moo-hyun and referred it to the Constitutional Court in 2004, the judges rejected the motion for the reason that the allegations were not “grave enough.”But opposition leaders have noted that the charges facing President Park, who prosecutors say played a key role in the influence-peddling and bribery scandal tied to Choi, is more serious than that of her predecessor Roh, who was subject to impeachment for violating political neutrality.“If the Assembly passes the impeachment, the investigation result indicating the president’s criminal act is compelling enough to convince the Constitutional Court of delivering a rational decision,” said Democratic Party leader Rep. Choo Mi-ae on Monday. People’s Party leader Rep. Park Jie-won warned against the possibility that the impeachment motion would face a stricter quorum in the Constitutional Court --  six out of seven judges -- as two of the incumbent judges are to retire early next yearTo avoid such a scenario, Rep. Keum Tae-sub, a lawmaker from the Democratic Party, urged lawmakers to seek options to promptly finish the impeachment procedure by Jan 1, 2017, before the two outgoing judges leave office.

Park has about 15 months left in her term. “ was included in the statement made by  legal representative and myself yesterday,” Presidential Spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk told reporters Monday, avoiding further questions on the allegations involving the feud-ridden president. He stuck to his earlier announcement that Park would no longer cooperate with the prosecution and would face the forthcoming independent counsel investigation instead. This also meant that the president would rather face impeachment than voluntarily give up power. “We hope that the current argument is solved through a legitimate procedure to judge the president’s liability on a constitutional and legal level,” Jung said Sunday, after Park’s lawyer Yoo Yeong-ha vowed to no longer comply with the prosecution’s investigation.While highlighting her disapproval over the probe, in which she was named as a suspect, Park did loosen up on her earlier attempts to retain her grip over state affairs.“President Park will not be chairing the Cabinet meeting tomorrow . Deputy Prime Minister for Economy  Yoo Il-ho will take charge instead,” said a Cheong Wa Dae official.This remark came in answer to the growing speculation that Park, after weeks of seclusion from the public, may at last make an official appearance as administrative chief.The president has recently engaged herself in a number of state actions, such as offering certificates of appointment to new ministers and secretariat officials and meeting with her Kazakhstani counterpart. None of the occasions, however, included an official keynote speech.It had been anticipated that if Park were to chair the Cabinet meeting Tuesday for the first time since the scandal broke out, her words at the meeting would effectively reflect her views on the situation. But by crossing out such a scenario, the president apparently leans toward the strategy of keeping the status quo, choosing to hold out until a possible turnaround in public sentiment.Such unyielding actions by the presidential house left the opposition political circles with few options other than impeachment -- the only binding legal action to force a state chief out of his or her elected position.The three opposition parties -- the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, runner-up People’s Party and progressive minority Justice Party -- on Monday called for an impeachment motion.Their intensified reaction came in the wake of the prosecution’s decision Sunday to include the president as a suspect, instead of a mere witness, in the corruption charges involving her aides.But in consideration of the time-consuming and challenging process of impeachment -- which not only requires a parliamentary consent but also the approval of the Constitutional Court -- the parties also vowed to continue their calls for Park’s voluntary resignation as part of a two-pronged strategy.By Bae Hyun-jung","political battle to remove president ,her impeachment the embattled president ,battle to remove president park ,battle to remove president ,president would rather face impeachment","['Park Geun', 'Blue House', 'Dae Cheong', 'Dae ’s', 'Park', 'Jung Youn', 'Jung', 'Park ’s', 'Yoo Yeong - ha', 'Park', 'Park', 'Cabinet', 'Park', 'Kazakhstani', 'Park', 'Cabinet', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'People ’s Party', 'Justice Party', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Park', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63165116  0.24043906

On Sunday, prosecutors first mentioned Park's alleged ""complicity"" in the scandal involving her friend Choi Soon-sil and her former key secretaries -- Ahn Chong-bum and Jeong Ho-seong -- among others. The prosecution said Park colluded with Choi, Ahn and Jeong in ""considerable parts"" of the alleged criminal acts, effectively turning the president's status to a suspect from a witness in the high-profile case that has rocked the country over the past several weeks.  The prosecution vowed to continue its probe into the president, though it said it cannot indict Park due to a constitutional clause that stipulates a president is immune from prosecution except in cases of insurrection or treason.The interim investigation result is expected to further infuriate citizens, who have been calling for Park's immediate resignation through massive street rallies across the nation, and spur political discussions for her impeachment. Park now faces allegations that through her aide, she allowed Choi to gain access to some 180 presidential speeches and government documents, some of which included classified information. The allegations raise the possibility of Park violating the law governing the handling of official secrets. The president is also alleged to have directly or indirectly pressured major conglomerates into donating large sums of money to two nonprofit foundations, which legal experts say could constitute an abuse of authority. Through her addresses to the nation on Oct. 25 and Nov. 4, the president admitted to handing over some of her speech drafts to Choi to get her advice, and claimed that her role in raising funds for the two foundations was based on ""pure motives"" to benefit the country.","regrettable presidential official told yonhap ,political discussions for her impeachment ,regrettable presidential official ,very regrettable presidential official ,is very regrettable presidential official","['Cheong', 'Park Geun', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'Cheong', 'Park', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Ahn Chong - bum', 'Jeong Ho - seong', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Ahn', 'Jeong', 'Park', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Park', 'Choi']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51641822  0.26397854

The prosecution has been calling for a face-to-face interview with Park before prosecuting Choi -- the deadline for which is Sunday -- to build grounds that the president had allowed or assisted her longtime civilian confidante in creating slush funds and meddling in state affairs. Yet Park’s lawyer Yoo Young-ha delayed the questioning, saying it was “physically impossible” and that he needed more time to prepare.  “Our position has been that the probe should be held no later than Friday, but given the lawyer’s remarks and the overall situation, this would not be possible,” an official of a special investigation team told reporters. The prosecution’s aim was to look into Park’s role in the scandal through the questioning and reflect it in an indictment against Choi and two former presidential secretaries who are also under arrest, An Chong-bum and Jeong Ho-seong, whom it seeks to prosecute this weekend alongside Choi. Even without the meeting, the team is capable of addressing Park’s alleged role to Choi’s indictment given the evidence it has secured so far. The official said it would make an “objective, reasonable decision” based on testimonies by the suspects and witnesses as well as materials seized during raids and from elsewhere.“We pushed for the interview to provide the president a chance to testify before defining criminal facts involving the arrested three suspects,” the prosecutor said. “ is a key witness regarding crimes committed by them, and she faces possibly problematic criminal charges herself.” The official’s first-ever mention of “criminal charges” may signal the possibility of the prosecution changing Park’s status from “witness” to “suspect” when the questioning takes place. The investigators are predicted to focus on whether Park was behind the fast launch of two culture and sports foundations with corporate donations totaling 77.4 billion won , over which Choi and An allegedly have peddled influence. Other allegations include the president instructing Jeong to pass confidential documents to Choi and facilitating her intervention in personnel management and other areas of state governance.Jeong was arrested on charges of leaking state secrets, while An faced charges of abuse of authority, interference with rights and attempted coercion. The Constitution exempts the president from being prosecuted, but Park has publicly said she would meet with the prosecutors, including those of an independent special prosecution to be organized by the National Assembly. But criticism is mounting as Park and Yoo seek to postpone the interview, with opposition lawmakers and legal experts branding it an “attempt to buy time” and shift defense logic after examining the to-be-unveiled indictments against the three suspects. By Shin Hyon-hee /","arrested three suspects the prosecutor ,postpone the interview with opposition ,before prosecuting choi the deadline ,friday but given the lawyer ,prosecute this weekend alongside choi","['Park Geun - hye', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Choi', 'Park', 'Yoo Young', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Chong', 'Jeong Ho - seong', 'Choi', 'Choi ’s', 'Park ’s', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Jeong', 'Choi', 'Jeong', 'Park', 'the National Assembly', 'Yoo', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51066059  0.3785772

This was a rare confirmation of the president’s official schedule, considering the Blue House’s common practice of replying vaguely when asked about Park’s next moves or plans to reinstate state affairs.It also reiterated Foreign Affairs Minister Yun Byung-se’s statement made the previous day.“ will suffer losses, if it misses  for domestic reasons, especially since it was Japan that had set the date,” the minister said.The trilateral meeting, which kicked off in 2008, was once halted after a historical dispute which heated up the 2012 meeting in Beijing. Last year, the three Northeast Asian states gathered in Seoul to resume talks for the first time in three years.Park’s move to join this trilateral summit was a contrast to her nonparticipation in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit to be held in Peru this weekend. Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn is to attend the event as the presidential representative.The official reason behind the prime minister’s participation, according to the government, was that the state chief could not afford an overseas trip amid the escalating nuclear threats from North Korea and that the decision had been made in September -- before the Choi scandal broke out.It had therefore been speculated that Park would refrain from other external activities as well, including the Korea-China-Japan summit.Her approval ratings, which has remained in the record-low 5 percent range, further added credence to the speculation that the president would not show up at international occasions to meet with key counterparts.According to local pollster Gallup Korea on Friday, Park’s rating remains unchanged at 5 percent, with the disapproval rating standing at 90 percent.Despite the low ratings, she has apparently shifted her stance from passive to slowly gearing up to resume state affairs. In line with this move, Park also conferred certificates of appointment to new members of the secretariat and letters of credence to foreign ambassadors in the afternoon.Among the participants were the Presidential Chief of Staff Han Gwang-ok and Vice Foreign Minister Ahn Chong-ghee. The latter was tapped for the post Wednesday, amid the heightening tension over the prosecution’s pledge to question Park over her alleged connection to the Choi scandal.The afternoon’s event was the state chief’s first public appearance in front of the camera since her summit with Kazakhstani counterpart Nursultan Nazarbayev last Thursday.It was also her first official schedule since the record-breaking protest in central Seoul last Saturday, an occasion said to have gathered more than 1 million participants.One key point of concern is whether Park will chair a regular Cabinet meeting next Tuesday, in which case her political reinstatement signal would be finalized.Since Park’s last attendance on Oct. 11, the Cabinet meeting has so far been led by Prime Minister Hwang who, due to the APEC summit, will only return late on Tuesday evening.“Nothing has been decided yet and I will let you know, should there be any schedule ,” the spokesperson told reporters, refraining from confirmation yet leaving room for the possibility.If Park indeed chairs the meeting, her keynote address is likely to be taken as an effective address to the nation, following her two earlier public apologies over the state scandal.As for the reasons why the embattled president is seemingly taking the bull by the horns, despite the sluggish polls and growing pressure, political observers highlighted her reliance upon hidden strongholds, referred to as the “shy Park” group.There have been ongoing speculations that even amid the lowest-ever approving ratings Park may have unseen supporters who may eventually step out. This was reflected in remarks by Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, chief of the ruling Saenuri Party and a leading pro-president figure.“The ratings may be reeling under the current circumstances but may possibly recover, depending on the president’s efforts,” Lee said.By Bae Hyun-jung /","candlelight rally slated for saturday ,protest in central seoul last ,rally slated for saturday park ,pollster gallup korea on friday ,cabinet meeting next tuesday","['Park Geun - hye', 'chinese', 'japanese', 'Tokyo', 'Jung Youn', 'the Blue House ’s', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Japan', 'Beijing', 'northeast asian', 'Seoul', 'Park ’s', 'Peru', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'North Korea', 'Choi', 'the Korea - China - Japan', 'Gallup Korea', 'Park ’s', 'Park', 'Han', 'Ahn Chong - ghee', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Kazakhstani', 'Nursultan Nazarbayev', 'Seoul', 'Park', 'Cabinet', 'Park', 'Cabinet', 'Hwang', 'APEC', 'Park', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4020431   0.40500835

The Korea Craft and Design Foundation, a state-run organization located in Insa-dong, Seoul, had initially provided office and research space to craftsmen for a fee. Designed to help individual craftsmen and the industry, the foundation has exhibited traditional crafts like fans, wooden masks and folk dolls in the gallery. The Korea Craft and Design Foundation in Insa-dong, SeoulIn 2015, the foundation suddenly changed the policy on space for craftsmen and allowed a nation brand development team affiliated with the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism to use it for free, a person familiar with the deal told The Korea Herald.The team until recently worked with public relations firm Creative Arena, which is under suspicion of being controlled by Cha Eun-taek, a close associate of Choi Soon-sil. Choi, a longtime confidante of President Park, is at the center of a widening corruption and influence-peddling scandal. It remains unclear whether the nation brand development team has had any direct links with Cha or Choi. The Culture Ministry’s nation brand project came up with the “Creative Korea” slogan, which ironically sparked a heated controversy over alleged plagiarism. A Culture Ministry official told The Korea Herald that the decision to let the brand team use the office area for free was made in consideration of the public nature of the project. A local craftsman, however, claimed that artists were “completely excluded from the decision making” on the space of the foundation. “We have fallen victims to the government’s lack of attention to the industry,” he said.

But Cheong Wa Dae has so far shown little response to such moves, only claiming to have “embraced the public sentiment with a heavy heart.”So when the spokesman heralded an emergency press briefing Wednesday afternoon, the Blue House press room began speculating whether the president would at last reveal her stance on the probe. Some anticipated that the spokesman might reiterate the president’s earlier stance that she would neither admit to the given allegations, nor step down from power.But as soon as the keyword “Busan LCT” came out, groans emerged from a number of reporters, possibly out of disappointment or anger.Either way, the negative mood that swept across the press was no more than a reflection of the nation’s public sentiment -- resentment against the president’s continued lack of response. This sudden intervention in an ongoing investigation was made by a president who, since her last public apology, has been taking a backseat in state affairs.This is a president who, by putting off an imminent prosecutorial questioning, effectively contradicted her earlier pledge to “fully cooperate in the related investigation.”This is a president who, despite the escalating circumstantial evidence, has been refusing to explain her lack of action during the crucial seven hours following the sinking of the Sewol ferry which resulted in hundreds of deaths back in 2014.Cheong Wa Dae defensively claimed that the statement on the LCT probe was no more than a response to the burgeoning suspicions from the opposition circles.What is really required of the Blue House, however, is to answer to other doubts, the unanswered suspicions which gathered over 1 million citizens in protest last Saturday.By Bae Hyun-jung","public apology over the corruption ,the president complete resignation with ,apology over the corruption scandal ,an imminent prosecutorial questioning effectively ,heightening tensions between the presidential","['Park Geun', 'Park ’s', 'Jung Youn', 'Park', 'Park ’s', 'Choi', 'Park', 'LCT', 'Blue House', '2014.cheong', 'Dae', 'LCT', 'the Blue House', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.71706575  0.29614234

In a poll by Realmeter of 1,525 Koreans from Nov. 14 to 16, a mere 9.9 percent of respondents gave a positive view over Park’s state governance, marking a 1.6 percentage point drop from a week ago. The figure marks the first-ever single-digit approval rating from the Seoul-based pollster since its initial survey following the president’s swearing-in in February 2013. The announcement also followed other record-low grades -- 5 percent shown in a poll by Gallup Korea and 9.2 percent by the Naeil daily and the Opinion, both released early this month. Negative opinions on Park also hit a fresh high of 85.9 percent, up 2 percentage points from the same period. The latest survey’s margin of error is 2.5 percentage points.South Korean President Park Geun-hye Public sentiment toward Park apparently continues to sour despite two rounds of public apologies for the scandal, which further sparked criticism for her lack of sincerity and failure to come clean about her involvement. The ratings for the ruling Saenuri Party also remained in the 10s for a third straight time at 18.2 percent, outstripped on a daily basis for the first time on Monday by the minor opposition People’s Party. “The results reflect the president’s refusal to step down despite the 1 million-strong candlelight vigil last weekend,” Realmeter said on its blog. “The fall in Saenuri’s support came amid increasingly extreme internal strife over the fate of Park and party chair Rep. Lee Jung-hyun.”By region, the president’s approval ratings in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province -- her traditional political turf -- slightly rebounded to 19.8 percent. The Saenuri Party, too, saw its support plunge to an unprecedented 36.9 percent there. But the numbers for the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea also dropped by 1.5 percentage points to 30.5 percent, capping its recent upward trend. The People’s Party, for its part, managed to garner 17 percent, up 1.7 percentage points from the previous survey a week before. The minor opposition Justice Party also witnessed a 1.5 percentage point rise in its approval rating, reaching 7.7 percent. On the future of Park, 73.9 percent of respondents said Park should resign or be impeached by the parliament, up 13.5 percentage points. Among potential presidential contenders, Moon Jae-in, a former leader of the Democratic Party of Korea, topped the poll with 18.4 percent, despite a 1.4 percentage point drop. The ratings of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, another potential candidate, stood at 18.4 percent, up 1.2 percentage points. Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, the People’s Party‘s former head, soared 1.7 percentage points to 11.9 percent.By Shin Hyon-hee","latest poll showed thursday ,percentage points south korean president ,the latest poll showed thursday ,latest poll showed thursday in ,president swearing in in february","['Park Geun - hye', 'Koreans', 'Park ’s', 'Seoul', 'Gallup Korea', 'Naeil', 'Park', 'south korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Saenuri Party', 'People ’s Party', 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'Daegu', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'the People ’s Party', 'Justice Party', 'Park', 'Park', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the Democratic Party of Korea', 'UN', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Ahn Cheol', 'the People ’s party‘s', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",19,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.56047648  1.04491436

111,111,Questioning of Park unlikely to come soon,"President Park Geun-hye will face prosecutors next week, her lawyer said Thursday, effectively forcing them to indict her confidante Choi Soon-sil, who is at the center of an influence-peddling and corruption scandal, without the president’s testimony.Investigators have been looking to question Park directly over her alleged involvement in a scandal involving her civilian friend Choi.

It concerns evidence that Choi was allowed to meddle in state affairs and misappropriate public funds. “If it can help wrap up the investigation on allegations related to the president, I will finish preparing for my defense as soon as possible and cooperate so that investigation on the president can take place next week,” said Park’s lawyer Yoo Yeong-ha.Earlier in the day, the prosecution had delivered a virtual ultimatum on calling in Park for an interview, saying it would be nearly impossible for them to question her over the weekend. “I think it will be physically difficult  during the weekend. If I were to compare it to a newspaper company, today is actually the deadline for stories. After tomorrow, it’s absolutely impossible to make changes,” said an official from the prosecution.President Park Geun-hye When asked if the indictment of Choi would have to take place without questioning Park, he answered “logically, there is a possibility that will be the case.”Under Korean law, the prosecution has to indict Choi by Sunday before her arrest warrant expires. This forced the prosecution to consider Friday as the absolute deadline for questioning Park.Prosecutors originally intended to do so on Wednesday, but Yoo said via a press conference Tuesday that it was impossible because his client needed “considerable time” to prepare.This sparked criticism from the opposition that Park was evading justice. However, Yoo denied this and said that he and his client simply needed more time.The official from the prosecution dismissed the possibility of conducting an interview with Park via written questionnaire, saying, “If we were to do it, it would have to be face-to-face.” He said that Choi would be indicted Sunday, when Park’s former aides An Chong-bum and Jeong Ho-seong are also “likely” to be indicted.An is accused of pressuring local conglomerates to raise money for the Mir and K-Sports foundations -- allegedly used to channel money to Choi -- while Jeong is suspected of leaking Park’s documents to Choi. Prosecutors are reportedly seeking to indict Jeong on charge of leaking secrets related to public service, but have said it would be difficult to accuse him of leaking presidential documents as most of them were incomplete or had not been registered in the Cheong Wa Dae database.Investigators did not rule out the possibility of interviewing Park after the indictment, but indicated the possibility of doing so was not high. It left the door open for revising charges on Choi later on, but also indicated that it was not probable.The prosecution has been closing in on the president, particularly on her aides accused of playing a part in the scandal that has shaken the country to its very core.It has requested an arrest warrant for Vice Culture Minister Kim Chong on charge of abusing authority. Kim is suspected of being involved in the establishment and operation of the K-Sports Foundation, while providing favors to it and Choi’s daughter Chung Yoo-ra.Cho Won-dong, senior economic secretary to Park from 2013 to 2014, appeared before the Seoul Central Prosecutors’ Office in southern Seoul for questioning. He was to face questions over allegations that he pressured food and entertainment conglomerate CJ Group to dismiss its vice chairwoman, Lee Mie-kyung.Cho said that he “did not know” what allegations he was facing, and said he felt “miserable for being here,” while the country’s economy was facing difficulties. The minutes of his conversation with CJ Group co-Chairman Sohn Kyung-sik showed that Cho urged the move in 2013, saying it was the will of the president. Lee did not resign from her post but left the country for the US and has not returned since.Lee at the time had been heading the entertainment section of the company, which produced content including the period piece “Gwanghae: the Man who Became the King ” and “The Attorney,” which reflected the life of late liberal former President Roh Moo-hyun. The films had been accused of having a left-leaning political bias.A former CJ executive told the JoongAng Daily newspaper that Lee had left for the US because she felt it was impossible to come back during the Park administration.Cha Eun-taek, a TV commercial director with links to Choi, has been involved in various CJ-related projects since Lee’s departure. This has fueled suspicion that pressure was put on the CJ leadership to benefit Cha.By Yoon Min-sik","prosecutors next week her lawyer ,sunday before her arrest warrant ,interviewing park after the indictment ,lawyer said thursday effectively forcing ,week her lawyer said thursday","['Park Geun', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Park ’s', 'Yoo Yeong - ha', 'Park', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Choi', 'Park', 'korean', 'Choi', 'Park', 'Yoo', 'Park', 'Yoo', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Park ’s', 'Chong', 'Jeong Ho - seong', 'K - Sports', 'Choi', 'Jeong', 'Choi', 'Jeong', 'Choi', 'Kim Chong', 'Kim', 'the K - Sports Foundation', 'Choi', 'Chung Yoo - ra', 'Cho Won - dong', 'Park', 'the Seoul Central Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Seoul', 'CJ Group', 'Lee Mie - kyung', 'Cho', 'CJ Group', 'Sohn Kyung - sik', 'Cho', 'Lee', 'US', 'Lee', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'CJ', 'JoongAng Daily', 'Lee', 'US', 'Cha Eun - taek', 'Choi', 'cj', 'Lee', 'CJ', 'cha', 'Yoon Min - sik']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.25258264  0.3876448

Starting this year, all test-takers must take a separate Korean history exam during the social and natural sciences test time. A test-taker arrives on police patrol bike. The test started at 8:30 a.m. with a plan to run through 5:40 p.m., including lunch and breaks, the ministry said. As in previous years, the government imposed various traffic control and anti-noise measures as part of its efforts to ensure that the test be executed without any problems. Subways and trains in the capital area extended their rush hour services by two hours to help all exam-takers arrive at the test sites on time. Bus operations were also expanded during the commuting time. The stock markets will open for trade one hour late, while government offices and enterprises in nearby areas also plan to open an hour later than usual to keep the roads clear for students on their way to the test centers, it said.Police said they will mobilize 14,000 officers to support the ministry running the exam, while offering to transport students in need of a ride by patrol cars or on the back of motorcycles. Test applicants were banned from having electronic devices, including mobile phones, digital cameras, MP3 players, electronic calculators and smartwatches, at their desks to prevent possible cheating, the ministry said. The applicants will be individually notified of their test results on Dec. 7, according to the ministry.","annual college entrance exam thursday ,606 000 high school seniors ,college entrance exam thursday ,annual college entrance exam ,college entrance exam thursday as","['South Korea', 'College Scholastic Ability Test', 'the Ministry of Education', 'the American Scholastic Aptitude Test', 'korean', 'korean']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.18590154  0.75515521

Lee Jung-hyun, has been facing a backlash from party members.A growing number of Saenuri members are demanding a complete overhaul of the party leadership which is chaired by Lee and dominated by his fellow Park loyalists. Some members are even fasting while calling for Lee to step down immediately. Yet, the three-term lawmaker is refusing to budge.  Saenuri Party leader Rep. Lee Junyonhap)“I’m an elected Saenuri leader whose term ends on Aug. 9, 2018,” Lee told reporters Wednesday, marking his 100th day in the party’s top office. “No one can ignore average members’ votes that chose me.” Instead of bowing out, he pledged to retain his position at least until late December, a month before the party elects new leadership on Jan. 21, 2017. Rep. Lee’s insistence on his own timeline has pushed Saenuri to split. Earlier in the day, those critical of the embattled President Park, Lee and other pro-Park loyalists formed their own leadership organization and held their first meeting. A heavyweight figure, Rep. Kim Moo-sung, even mooted possible impeachment of Park. They cite Lee’s “special relationship” with Park as the rationale for his reluctance to leave the top office. Lee may be helping the president who is facing the biggest crisis in her political career but not the Saenuri Party. The chairman is hampering efforts to revamp the conservative bloc and win back voters, they say. “He is like a cult member worshipping President Park,” said Gyeonggi Province Gov. Nam Kyung-pil, one of Saenuri’s presidential hopefuls, on Tuesday. “He is unqualified to lead a political party.”Lee’s “extraordinary” allegiance to Park is well known in political circles. Since running for parliamentary election for the first time in 2004, Lee was considered to be a “mouthpiece” for Park, who then led the main opposition Grand National Party, a precursor to Saenuri. He worked as a senior spokesman until Park was defeated in the party‘s primary for the 2007 presidential ticket. Though most GNP members who supported Park switched sides and worked for Lee Myung-bak, who went on to win the presidential election, the politician decided to stay with Park. Lee once told Park that he would leave politics if he lost the opportunity to work for her. Such a loyal attitude has earned the trust of Park, who observers say has commitment issues after seeing her father, the late President Park Chung-hee, assassinated by his long-time confidant. “I have never seen Lee say what I didn’t say,” Park famously said in 2013 when she served as GNP leader. After Park was elected president, Lee worked as senior presidential secretary for political affairs, and later, as senior secretary for public relations. Even after being elected as the Saenuri Party leader in August, Lee’s relationship with Park changed little. “What the president thinks and what the Saenuri Party thinks should not be different,” said Lee during his first party meeting after taking office on Aug 10. “If you think that confronting the president is the right thing to do, you don’t deserve to be Saenuri member.” Now, with Park’s approval rating at a record low of 5 percent and the public’s call for her ouster growing, Lee looks determined to be in the same boat with the beleaguered president. By Yeo Jun-suk","been facing backlash from party ,presidential ticket though most gnp ,since running for parliamentary election ,backlash from party members growing ,facing backlash from party members","['Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'Saenuri', 'Lee', 'Park', 'Lee', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee Junyonhap)“I’m', 'Saenuri', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'Lee', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Park', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Nam Kyung - pil', 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'Lee', 'Park', 'Grand National Party', 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Park', 'Park', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Lee', 'Park', 'Lee', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Lee', 'Saenuri', 'Park ’s', 'Lee']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28806779  0.04554123

We  said it was necessary to do it today. ... We plan to tell them that if we were to concede beyond the ‘Maginot Line’ , Friday would be possible,” a high-ranking official from Seoul Central Prosecutors’ Office said.Park is suspected of being directly involved in the scandal, which includes allegations that Choi had meddled in state affairs and siphoned off public funds.The official said that the prosecution remains unchanged on its position that Park will be probed not as a suspect, but as a key witness in the case. This makes it impossible for the investigators to forcibly question her, as it would not be permitted to take her into custody.If the president chooses not to comply with the prosecution’s questioning, it will be forced to reach a decision accordingly, he said.Suspicions that Park is directly involved in the Choi scandal have been further fueled in the past few days, with evidence uncovered from her former aides.An Chong-bum The prosecution’s investigation into former presidential secretary An Chong-bum reportedly found that he had received orders from Park about raising funds for the Mir Foundation and K-Sports Foundation. The two nonprofit organizations are suspected of being used as a cover to channel money to Choi.According to local media outlet Munhwa Ilbo, An’s notebook confiscated by the investigators showed that Park had given direct instructions about the foundations from day one, requesting regular updates on their progress. It even specified how a company effectively owned by TV commercial director Cha Eun-taek -- an associate of Choi -- should produce much of state-related advertisements.  Cha is currently being investigated on charges of using his relationship with Choi for illegal gains, such as pressuring another company to give up majority shares of an advertisement company.An has already testified to the prosecution that he was just following Park’s orders on the fundraising.Jeong Ho-seongLast week, the prosecution found text messages on a phone of another former presidential aide, Jeong Ho-seong, related to Park’s private meeting with the chiefs of seven of Korea’s largest corporations. Park is suspected of pressuring the company heads to donate to the foundations.The confiscated phone also showed that Park had given specific instructions about Choi, prosecutors said.According to the investigators, one of the messages showed Park asking if he had received confirmation from Choi. She had referred to Choi as “a teacher,” which in Korean is also used as a term of respect.A voice recording from Jeong’s phone also showed that Choi gave specific instructions on a variety of reports being sent to Cheong Wa Dae.Rep. Moon Jae-in, a former leader of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, said Wednesday that the prosecution should treat Park as a suspect if she continues to not cooperate with the investigation.“She was the one who promised . Complying with the investigation is the first step to uncovering the truth.

It marks the 12th straight year for the General Assembly to adopt a North Korean human rights resolution.In particular, it is the third consecutive year for the General Assembly to adopt a resolution calling on the Security Council to refer the North's human rights situation to the ICC. That underlines the seriousness with which the international community views the situation.This year's resolution blamed the North's ""leadership"" for human rights abuses. The Third Committee of the U.N. General Assembly holds a meeting to adopt a resolution on North Korea's human rights situation on Nov. 15. ""The General Assembly ... encourages the Security Council to ... take appropriate action to ensure accountability, including through consideration of referral of the situation in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the International Criminal Court and consideration of the further development of sanctions,"" the resolution said.The resolution also expresses ""very serious concern"" at ""the exploitation of workers sent abroad from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to work under conditions that reportedly amount to forced labor."" It is the first time a General Assembly resolution has mentioned the North's labor exports, which have become an increasingly important source of hard currency for Pyongyang amid concern that the funds could be used for its nuclear and missile programs.About 50,000-60,000 North Koreans are believed to be toiling overseas, mainly in the mining, logging, textile and construction industries. The average wage was stated as $120 to $150 per month, but in most cases employing firms paid salaries directly to the North's government.The North reportedly receives more than $100 million from this system per year.The 2014 General Assembly resolution is considered a watershed moment in international efforts to improve the North's human rights situation as it marked the first time for the Assembly to call for the North's referral to the ICC.That resolution led to the UN Security Council holding consultations on the issue for the first time later that year. In addition, a similar resolution was adopted last year and the Security Council also held discussions on the North's human rights situation for the second time.North Korea has long been labeled as one of the worst human rights violators. The communist regime does not tolerate dissent, holds hundreds of thousands of people in political prison camps and keeps tight control over outside information.But the North has bristled at such criticism, calling it a US-led attempt to topple its regime.After Tuesday's passage, Amb. Kim In-ryong, deputy chief of the North's mission to the UN, told a news conference that the country ""categorically rejects"" the resolution, claiming it has ""political purposes to defame and eliminate the DPRK as well as it is based on lies and fabricated information.""North Korean officials were also asked about the results of the US presidential election.""We don't care about who becomes US president,"" said Kim Yong-ho, a North Korean Foreign Ministry director in charge of human rights issues. ""The fundamental issue is whether the US has a political will to withdraw its hostile policy toward the DPRK.""Asked whether the North would allow the UN special rapporteur on North Korea's human rights situation, Tomas Ojea Quintana, to visit the country, Kim said Ojea Quintana is welcome to visit as a law professor from Buenos Aires, but his visit as special rapporteur won't be granted.South Korea welcomed the latest resolution on human rights in the North, calling it the ""toughest-ever"" one aimed at sending strong warnings to Pyongyang bent on missile and nuclear weapons while turning a blind eye to its people's livelihood. ""The government urges  to take detailed and practical measures immediately in accordance with the UN resolution to improve human rights conditions for its citizens,"" Seoul's foreign ministry said in a comment issued in the name of spokesman Cho June-hyuck.","korean human rights resolution tuesday ,general assembly meeting next month ,assembly meeting next month ,topple its regime after tuesday ,assembly meeting next month as","['the Third Committee', 'the UN General Assembly', 'north korean', 'the International Criminal Court', 'Pyongyang', 'General Assembly', 'the General Assembly', 'north korean', 'the General Assembly', 'the Security Council', 'the Third Committee of the U.N.

Making good on their pledge, the three groups -- the Democratic Party of Korea, People’s Party and Justice Party -- decided to submit a parliamentary motion to recommend the minister’s dismissal on Nov. 30 and put it to vote at a plenary session slated for Dec. 2.Its passage is likely, since the opposition bloc controls more than a majority of seats in Parliament.  Defense Minister Han Min-koo. A provisional deal was reached in Tokyo on Monday evening on the General Security of Military Information Agreement, which aims to enhance cooperation in coping with North Korea’s growing nuclear and missile threats. It does not require parliamentary ratification. A previous effort to sign the deal was derailed in 2012 in the face of strong public disapproval in Seoul. The opposition parties have threatened to unseat the defense minister if he pushes through the deal this time, without public consensus. The tentative signing came less than two weeks after talks reopened between the two countries on military intelligence sharing. The first working-level meeting was held on Nov. 1. Seoul and Tokyo had made official the negotiation’s resumption on Oct. 27. In 2012, many South Koreans had viewed a military cooperation deal with Japan, which had formerly colonized Korea, as inappropriate, particularly as the neighbor, with a history of imperialism, was seeking to boost its military posturing in the region. The necessity of military information sharing has increased, Defense Minister Han asserted, as North Korea is apparently racing toward nuclear armament. In 2016, Pyongyang conducted two nuclear tests and test-fired over 20 missiles, including its first successful launch of the intermediate-range Musudan and a submarine-launched KN-11.The ministry has been emphasizing the benefits South Korea will gain from Japan’s superior intelligence assets, namely its six Aegis destroyers, advanced radar technology and numerous anti-submarine reconnaissance equipment.The two countries have been indirectly sharing information via the Trilateral Information Sharing Arrangement signed by South Korea, the US and Japan in 2014. But military officials have cited the need for faster and more direct exchange of information.The US Defense Department on Monday welcomed the provisional signing of a military intelligence sharing agreement between South Korea and Japan.“We noted the recent media reports that the Governments of the Republic of Korea and Japan reached a provisional agreement on a bilateral General Security of Military Information Agreement,” Cmdr. Gary Ross, a Pentagon spokesman, told Yonhap News Agency. “A potential ROK-Japan GSOMIA could strengthen cooperation between our two closest allies in Northeast Asia, particularly in light of the growing threat posed by North Korea,” he said.From news report","opposition parties tuesday set in ,opposition parties tuesday set ,opposition parties tuesday ,the minister dismissal on nov ,tuesday set in motion campaign","['Defense', 'Han Min - koo', 'Japan', 'the Democratic Party of Korea', 'People ’s Party', 'Justice Party', 'Parliament', 'Defense', 'Han Min - koo', 'Tokyo', 'the General Security of Military Information Agreement', 'North Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'South Koreans', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Defense', 'Han', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Musudan', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'US', 'Japan', 'the US Defense Department', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'the government of the Republic of Korea', 'Japan', 'Cmdr', 'Gary Ross', 'Pentagon', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'ROK', 'North Korea']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62124926  0.03414783

They include the accusation US allies are “freeloading” on defense, and he even seemed to toy with the prospect of pulling US forces out of South Korea unless the host country shoulders more of the financial burden.Karl W. Eikenberry, a director of the US-Asia Security Initiative at the Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center at Stanford University, highlighted that presidential candidates often have a history of making pledges with little or no intent to follow up.“Such talks did begin to disappear this summer and fall. And two-thirds of the Americans surveyed have said that they support the  alliance and forward-stationing of the US forces in peninsula,” he said during “The New US Administration’s East Asian Policy and the Korean Peninsula” session jointly hosted by think tanks Sejong Institute and APARC.Eikenberry -- formerly US ambassador to Afghanistan -- stressed that as of yet, Trump is not likely to have detailed plans about the issue of defense strategies, as he lacks aides considered part of the traditional national security establishment.“He knows he has to rely on the experiences of others. The selection of Vice President-elect Mike Pence to lead his transition team indicates that this is the case,” he said, indicating the selection of the seasoned politician Pence shows that Trump will be open to the wisdom of his trusted aides.“We should expect  President Trump who has a defense strategy that is informed and implemented by the expertise of those cabinet and agency officials.”Michael McFaul, director of the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford, assessed Trump “would not have the slightest grasp” of many of the foreign policy and security issues, and that professionals could fill in the blanks.A panel discuses the likely policy directions of the incoming US administration led by Donald Trump at a forum in Seoul on Tuesday, jointly organized by Korea’s Sejong Institute and the Asia-Pacific Research Center of Stanford University in the US. Former US Ambassador to South Korea Kathleen Stephens said there have been concerns during previous transitions of administrations about policies being uprooted. This was particularly the case with Jimmy Carter, who had an “explicit platform” of withdrawing all troops from South Korea. “But my general observation here is this, that we survived all this. And our alliance did indeed continue to mature. So I think that gives us some grounds for optimism,” Stephens, a William J. Perry distinguished fellow at the APARC, said.She added that more talks related to defense arrangements in South Korea are likely to occur in the future. This includes costs related to the upcoming deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system, and possibly accelerating the transfer of wartime operation control from US to South Korea. But Stephens stressed it is “truly unpredictable what kind of president he would be,” as the panels agreed Trump’s administration will likely spark many questions. McFaul said he was worried a Trump meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin without sufficient preparation would bring unintended negative consequences, as he may attempt to cut a deal while disconnected from advisers. Negotiating as a businessman, he said, is very different from negotiating with world leaders.By Yoon Min-sik","at seoul symposium tuesday trump ,tuesday trump who beat democratic ,symposium tuesday trump who beat ,seoul symposium tuesday trump ,us presidential election last week","['US', 'South Korea', 'Donald Trump', 'US', 'Seoul', 'Democratic Party', 'Hillary Clinton', 'US', 'US', 'US', 'South Korea', 'Karl W.

""If we are ready, we would, of course, respond to the request, but I was just appointed yesterday.""The attorney also expressed his preference for the prosecution carrying out the inquiry in written form, though saying ""if it is inevitable,"" a face-to-face questioning session will also be accepted. Yoo, in addition, said that the unprecedented probe into the sitting president must be carried out in a way that ""minimizes"" any impact on her official duties. He also cited a constitutional clause that stipulates the president is immune from prosecution except in cases of insurrection or treason.""The investigation or trial for the president, while he or she is still in office, could paralyze state affairs and divide public opinion,"" he said. ""Thus, there are minimal constitutional safeguards and an investigation into the president is inappropriate unless he or she is involved in certain serious crimes""  Earlier in the day, the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae announced Yoo, a former member of the standing committee of the National Human Rights Commission, as the president's legal representative.Park faces suspicions that she played some sort of role in pressuring major conglomerates into donating large sums of money to two nonprofit foundations, which legal experts say could constitute an abuse of authority.She is also suspected of allowing her confidante, Choi Soon-sil, to gain access to advance drafts of presidential speeches and documents, some of which reportedly include classified information. This suspicion raises the possibility of Park violating the law concerning the handling of presidential records or official secrets.Yoo's relations with the president date back to 2010 when he served as a legal advisor to Park, who was then a member of the Supreme Council of the Grand National Party, a precursor to the ruling Saenuri Party.After passing a bar exam in 1992, Yoo served as prosecutor for some seven years in district offices in Seoul, Changwon, Cheongju and Incheon.

Park appears to have this plan in mind, having asked the opposition to field a new prime minister. Doubts, however, persist that Park may continue to remain the effective president, especially as she has so far refrained from clearly defining the intensified role of an incoming prime minister.Skeptics have also pointed out that a fill-in prime minister would not be able to exert actual power on state affairs, which would eventually lead to a power vacuum -- a situation no better than the possible political upheaval caused by impeachment, or even an earlier-than-expected presidential election.Another challenge is that the selection of a new prime minister is still up in the air.With her earlier appointment of Kim Byong-joon thwarted by the opposition, Park proposed that rival parties recommend an alternative candidate, an idea unlikely to pick up momentum due to the ongoing partisan divide.ImpeachmentImpeachment, the official sanction which the legislature is entitled to impose upon the state chief, has so far been shelved due to risks of backfiring.Based on Clause 65 of the Constitution, the National Assembly may vote on a motion of impeachment, if the president has breached the Constitution or other laws. Once the motion obtains the legislature’s approval, its final effectuation is to be decided by the Constitutional Court.Some opposition figures, mostly those from the People’s Party, have claimed that such a forceful procedure has now become inevitable given the president’s apparent refusal to step down.But it was former Saenuri Chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung who rekindled talks of impeachment on Sunday, becoming the first ruling party official to call for the legal penalty upon the president.The ruling party bigwig’s move gave momentum to the stalled impeachment gesture, as the opposition camp, despite its parliamentary majority, would need some dozens of extra votes in order to pass the motion.The three opposition parties together hold 165 seats on the floor, short of a quorum of 200, which is two-thirds of the 300-seat Assembly.But ironically, as binding as the impeachment may be, this may be a less harmful solution for Park, considering the precedent of the late President Roh Moo-hyun.The then-opposition conservative party had motioned for the impeachment of the liberal president in 2004, but soon was hit by political backfire as the Constitutional Court dismissed the motion.It is, in fact, the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea that is refraining from suggesting impeachment, as it claims the months-long procedure would only buy more time for the distressed president and ruling party.Voluntary resignationDifferentiating themselves from the main opposition, the two minority opposition parties -- the runner-up People’s Party and progressive Justice Party -- assert that immediate resignation is the only acceptable response from a president who has utterly lost the nation’s trust.If Park decides to resign, though the choice seems unlikely, the Constitution states that a by-election be held within 60 days to elect a successor, who would take office not for the remaining of the predecessor’s term, but for a full five-year term. Until then, the prime minister would fill in.The only plausible reason Park may resort to this scenario -- and become the nation’s first democratically elected president to step down mid-term -- is that she has already reached a political dead end, only facing harsher consequences otherwise.The president’s approval rating, since recording a record-low of 5 percent on Nov. 4, still remained in the 5-11 percent range as of Monday, depending on the pollster.This unseen near zero public support, combined with a series of massive protests held each weekend, has already posed critical challenges for the president’s state operations.It has, however, been the consistent stance of the Blue House that a state leadership vacuum would only further intensify the current political chaos, as well as increase risks on the nation’s economy.Park’s resignation has also been shunned by the ruling conservative Saenuri Party, which has no leading presidential hopeful other than UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, whose affiliation with the party remains speculative.By Bae Hyun-jung","current political deadlock the presidential ,corruption scandals involving her close ,political upheaval caused by impeachment ,partisan divide impeachmentimpeachment the official ,presidential election another challenge","['Park Geun', 'Cheong', 'Park ’s', 'Cabinet', 'Park', 'Park ’s', 'Choi ’s', 'Jung Youn', 'Seoul', 'the Blue House', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Cabinet', 'Park', 'Kim Byong - joon', 'Park', 'ImpeachmentImpeachment', 'the National Assembly', 'the Constitutional Court', 'the People ’s Party', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Assembly', 'Park', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'Voluntary', 'People ’s Party', 'Justice Party', 'Park', 'the Blue House', 'Saenuri Party', 'UN', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53134334  0.11939269

125,125,Park faces prosecutorial questioning this week,"An unprecedented prosecutorial probe of an incumbent state leader seemed just around the corner Sunday, as prosecutors vowed to carry out a face-to-face questioning session with President Park Geun-hye, and Cheong Wa Dae, for the first time, gestured compliance.This development came amid the ongoing probe on the president’s confidante Choi Soon-sil and in the wake of a record-breaking candlelight vigil held Saturday...","An unprecedented prosecutorial probe of an incumbent state leader seemed just around the corner Sunday, as prosecutors vowed to carry out a face-to-face questioning session with President Park Geun-hye, and Cheong Wa Dae, for the first time, gestured compliance.This development came amid the ongoing probe on the president’s confidante Choi Soon-sil and in the wake of a record-breaking candlelight vigil held Saturday night to demand Park’s resignation.“We have delivered our stance to Cheong Wa Dae, that we will question  on Tuesday or Wednesday this week,” said an official of the special prosecution team in charge of the extensive influence-peddling scandal surrounding Choi.“We are waiting for a sincere reply .”As for the detailed method and schedule of the questioning, the prosecution is still in talks with Choi Jai-kyeong, the recently-appointed senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, according to officials. Choi was a former prosecutor himself, having served as chief of the Incheon District Prosecutors’ Office.“For now, the president will be questioned as a witness,” the official also said.“Though details such as the time and place  are yet to be discussed, the questioning will basically take place in a face-to-face format.”The Blue House, which had so far kept silence over the talks of prosecutorial questioning, replied this time.“ will be able to confirm its stance on the day after  at the earliest, due to consideration of the president’s schedule and the appointment of a legal representative,” the presidential spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk said in a text message distributed to reporters.The spokesperson’s remarks came shortly after news reports quoted the prosecution as pledging to question the president by Wednesday. The given timeline largely comes in line with the fact that the Choi’s detention period is set to expire on Nov. 20.The questioning, if it takes place, is to be the first time in South Korea’s history that a standing president has faced a prosecutorial probe.“I am ready to accept prosecutorial probe, even one by an independent counsel, if necessary,” Park vowed earlier in her address to the nation on Nov. 4, her second one since the Choi scandal broke out in late October.Speculations have risen that investigators, in recognition of the unique circumstances, may choose to meet Park in a place other than the prosecutors’ office or Cheong Wa Dae.Meanwhile, it yet remains unclear whether the embattled president will indeed defect from the ruling Saenuri Party, resign from her post or hand over all practical power to an incoming prime minister.“ agreed that we should humbly accept the people’s voice and take it gravely,” said a Cheong Wa Dae official, after an urgent senior presidential secretaries’ meeting chaired by Chief of Staff Han Gwang-ok in the morning.The meeting, which went on for an hour from 10 a.m., was originally scheduled for later in the afternoon but was moved forward following the nationwide candlelight vigil the previous night.But regarding more details of the forthcoming countermeasures, the Blue House continued to remain reserved.“We gathered the opinion of each  and are pondering various measures,” the official said.The presidential office’s worry, however, is that neither defection nor withdrawing to take a backseat in state affairs will appease the public.Despite Park’s actions so far -- including two public apologies, a shake-up of the Cabinet and of the presidential secretariat and her consent to let parliament appoint a prime minister -- her approval rating has remained in the record-low 5 percent range over the past two weeks.It was amid such lackluster responses from the president that an hours-long protesting rally was held in central Seoul and throughout the nation Saturday, gathering up to 1 million participants.

Despite the embattled president’s second apology last week, calls have continued to grow for Park to take responsibility for the state crisis. Some 1.1 million angry citizens took to the street Saturday. News agency Reuters reported that Gwanghwamun Square was flooded with citizens of all ages, ranging from “students to families including young couples pushing strollers and protesters in wheelchairs.” It said that the peaceful march “contrasted with the violence of some previous rallies dominated by militant unions and civic groups that clashed with police.”Students in school uniform hold banners demanding Park’s resignation.  Many foreign media outlets highlighted the peaceful atmosphere of Saturday’s well-organized rally, while analyzing how citizens taking to the street for three consecutive Saturdays would change the situation of the beleaguered president. American newspaper Washington Post said that Saturday’s protest was “no small feat in a country with a vibrant protest culture” and that it “increased the pressure on Park over a widening corruption and influence-peddling controversy.”“Although South Korea is no stranger to corruption scandals, this one has infuriated people who think that democracy has been circumvented and wonder whether the country was being run by a ‘shadow president’ with no experience.” Washington Post added that South Koreans are “angry that the institutions of government -- from the prosecutor’s office to the presidential Blue House itself -- not only did not intervene, but seemed to have helped Choi.”British broadcaster BBC’s Stephen Evans reported from the scene that “the protesters are more raucous than they were last week -- still peaceful but there’s more chanting than there was then.” Gyeongbokgung Station is crowded with protestors. The sound of citizens shouting was loud enough to reach the Blue House and the BBC said “if she  is at home there, the noise will be inescapable.”American broadcaster CNN’s reporter Paula Hancocks said Saturday’s uprising was “not expected to be big,” however, it turned out to be a massive rally with one simple message: President Park Geun-hye should voluntarily resign.She said that despite President Park’s second apology, public frustration lingers since “they feel they have been lied to and that their president has not told them the truth.”Public frustration and disillusion with this government have grown over the past few years, due partly to a number of scandals including the Sewol ferry sinking in 2014 when “collusion  was partly a cause for lack of measures to save more people,” she added.A protestor holds a placard that reads, “Target complete, Park Geun-hye Out!” Japan’s Asahi News Network said that Saturday’s protest came from frustration toward the Park administration. China’s government-run Xinhua News Agency said that Park has already lost trust and authority here. News agency AP reported that “there is also a possibility that prosecutors will eventually investigate Park, who in a televised apology last week said she would accept a direct investigation into her actions.”By Kim Da-sol","candlelight vigil calling for president ,president second apology last week ,on park over widening corruption ,president park second apology public ,banners demanding park resignation many","['Park Geun', 'Park', 'Reuters', 'Park ’s', 'american', 'Washington Post', 'Park', 'South Korea', 'Washington Post', 'South Koreans', 'Blue House', 'Choi', 'BBC', 'Stephen Evans', 'the Blue House', 'BBC', 'CNN', 'Paula Hancocks', 'Park Geun', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Japan', 'Asahi News Network', 'Park', 'China', 'Xinhua News Agency', 'Park', 'AP', 'Park', 'Kim Da - sol']",0,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.15537059 0.27290174 0.09012207]

But regarding more details of the forthcoming countermeasures, the Blue House continued to remain reserved.“We gathered the opinion of each  and are pondering various measures,” the official said.It is thought that the presidential aides contemplated Park’s defection from the ruling conservative Saenuri Party and her handing over all practical power to the incoming prime minister.The presidential office’s worry, however, is that neither defection nor withdrawing to take a backseat in state affairs will appease the public.Despite Park’s actions so far -- including two public apologies, a shake-up of the Cabinet and of the presidential secretariat and her consent to let parliament appoint a prime minister -- her approval rating has remained in the record-low 5 percent range over the past two weeks.The candlelight rally to demand Park’s resignation gathered up to 1 million participants in central Seoul and in various cities across the nation. Organizers said 1 million people attended the Seoul rally, whereas the police figure was 260,000.“We are working non-stop to find a way to settle the aggravated public sentiment but nothing has yet been decided for sure,” another Cheong Wa Dae official admitted.During the hours-long protest on Saturday, the presidential staff remained in an emergency stand-by mode, reporting the situation to the president on a real-time basis, according to officials.With protestors holding the streets from City Hall through Gwanghwamun Square to Anguk Station, the rallying cries were said to be audible in Park’s presidential office and beyond.On such circumstances, political observers are speculating that Park, with few options left to choose from, may deliver another address to the nation as early as within the week.Amid this speculation, there is also rising talk of the prosecution questioning of the president, in line with the imminent indictment of Choi Soon-sil, the presidential confidante at the center of the corruption and influence-peddling scandal.Should it take place, is it would be the first time in South Korea’s history that a standing president has faced questioning by investigators.Prosecutors said earlier that they were considering opening a probe into Park around Nov. 20, which is when the legal period for Choi’s detention is due to expire.By Bae Hyun-jung","breaking candlelight vigil demanding president ,candlelight vigil demanding president ,vigil demanding president park geun ,vigil demanding president ,silence sunday over the president","['Park Geun', 'Park', 'Han', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'Blue House', 'Park ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park ’s', 'Cabinet', 'Park ’s', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Park', 'Park', 'South Korea ’s', 'Park', 'Choi ’s', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.05486482  0.3477481

Park’s talk with Trump started at 9:55 a.m., about 1 1/2 hours after Japan’s state chief was reported to have had his call.The fact that the direct call took place less than a day after Trump won his ticket to the White House reflected the significance both nations place on their bilateral partnership, observers noted.In 2008 when Barack Obama was elected US president, his phone call with then-President Lee Myung-bak took place two days after election results came in. Following Obama’s re-election in 2012, the corresponding diplomatic call came a week after the election.

President Park’s governing Saenuri Party on Thursday stressed the need for strong leadership to navigate the security and economic uncertainties presented by the results of the US election, urging its dissenting members and opposition parties to stop attacking the embattled Park.  Opposition parties, on the other hand, used the US election surprise as an opportunity to up the ante against President Park, saying the scandal-ridden president is incapable of shaping Korea’s response. They demanded Park give up her power as head of nation as soon as possible.Since the allegation surfaced that President Park’s confidante Choi Soon-sil could have been involved with her economic and security initiatives, the president’s governing ability has been thrown into question and demands for her resignation have ensued. But Park has appeared to maintain her grip on state affairs despite the call to yield her power to the legislative body. Earlier in the day, she made a call to President-elect Trump and elicited his commitment to the bilateral security alliance. Trump had advocated the withdrawal of troops in South Korea on his campaign trail. “We are faced with a crisis at home and abroad as Trump’s winning the election has increased security and economic uncertainties,” said Rep. Lee Jang-woo, a member of Saenuri’s decision-making Supreme Council. “Opposition parties should help us bring the nation back on track.”Hours before Trump was elected Thursday, Saenuri leadership called an emergency meeting with relevant government agencies to come up with strategies. Earlier in the day, ranking Saenuri members held a series of seminars with foreign affairs experts to discuss the Trump agenda. The main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, meanwhile, stepped up their attack on the president, warning that Park and her governing party should stop using the Trump issue as a rationale for the beleaguered president to return to power. “People will be outraged if the president takes advantage of Trump issues to justify herself, “said Democratic Party’s leader Rep. Choo Mi-ae. “The president has been mocked overseas by her scandal. How could she attend a summit ?”Referring to the New York Time’s satirical cartoon published Sunday -- which depicted Park being “operated” by Choi -- the Democratic Party leader insisted the president continue to refrain from attending international events. Park has cancelled her scheduled visit to an Asia-Pacific leaders’ summit next week.By Yeo Jun-suk","bickering over scandal involving president ,as trump winning the election ,president park saying the scandal ,before trump was elected thursday ,call to president elect trump","['Donald Trump', 'US', 'South Korea', 'republican', 'US', 'Korea ’s', 'Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'US', 'Park', 'US', 'Park', 'Korea', 'Park', 'Trump', 'South Korea', 'Trump ’s', 'Lee Jang - woo', 'Saenuri ’s', 'Supreme Council', 'Trump', 'Saenuri', 'Saenuri', 'Trump', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'Park', 'Trump', 'trump', 'Democratic Party ’s', 'Choo Mi - ae', 'the New York Time ’s', 'Choi', 'Democratic Party', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48222223  0.34047407

Lee Sun-jin attended the meeting, the ministry said. ""We are planning to set up a task force to help push forward major defense agreements with the U.S. despite the change in the U.S. administration,"" a defense ministry official said. The official said the ministry will make utmost efforts to ensure that existing agreements between the allies will be carried out as planned. ""We will seek a close communication with U.S. lawmakers in charge of defense policies toward the peninsula and the Asia-Pacific region in the Trump administration,"" he said.    A photo taken Nov. 10, 2016, Rep. Kim Young-woo  a ruling Saenuri Party lawmaker who heads the National Defense Committee in parliament, and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Lee Sun-jin walk into the JCS headquarters in Seoul to attend an emergency meeting to discuss defense issues. The agreements involve the conditions-based transfer of the wartime operational control of South Korean forces from Washington to Seoul, the planned deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system in South Korea, and permanent deployment of its strategic assets to the divided peninsula. On Tuesday, Trump was elected as the 45th president of the United States in a stunning victory that reflects deep voter resentment against the establishment.His remarks during the campaign caused deep concerns from longtime U.S. allies such as South Korea, Japan and Europe. Trump, a businessman turned politician, has sometimes referred to allies as a cumbersome burden sucking up taxpayer dollars.

The 70-year-old has also argued that South Korea must 100 percent pay for the cost of maintaining the 28,000 American troops stationed in the country, warning Washington could pull out of the Asian alliance unless Seoul agrees to pay more.

He stressed that the opposition parties should also try to work together to deal with potential challenges.Political pundits said Saenuri's push to have Trump as the main agenda comes as the ruling party has been rocked by the Choi Soon-sil scandal. Park's confidante of 40 years is accused of behind-the-scene meddling in state affairs and using her ties to accumulate wealth.""South Korean politics cannot always be caught up with the scandal,"" another party official said, adding Saenuri must focus efforts on preparing for a Trump administration.The scandal has become a major problem facing Saenuri as it gets ready for next year's presidential race. According to a survey conducted by pollster Real Meter last week, the main opposition Democratic Party, garnered an approval rating of 33 percent, beating the ruling party's 21.4 percent for a second consecutive week.Opposition parties, on the other hand, said the U.S. election cannot cover up the Choi scandal, adding Park must promptly step back from state affairs to help South Korea better prepare for the future.""I hope people are not excessively anxious about the election result,"" said Rep Woo Sang-ho, the floor leader of the Democratic Party, adding Trump's victory will not conceal the scandal in the country.Rep. Park Jie-won, the floor leader of the splinter People's Party, on the other hand said Trump's victory will rather be an opportunity since the president-elect is a businessman who will seek practical approaches.","democratic party adding trump victory ,entrepreneur turned politician donald trump ,party adding trump victory ,for trump administration the scandal ,on preparing for trump administration","[""South Korea 's"", 'u.s.presidential', 'Park Geun', 'Donald Trump', 'the United States', 'Hillary Clinton', 'the Saenuri Party', 'South Korea', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Saenuri', 'Lee Jang - woo', 'Saenuri', 'Trump', 'Park', 'korean', 'Saenuri', 'Trump', 'Saenuri', 'Meter', 'Democratic Party', 'U.S.', 'Choi', 'Park', 'South Korea', 'Rep Woo Sang - ho', 'the Democratic Party', 'Trump', 'Park Jie - won', ""People 's Party"", 'Trump']",12,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56245637 -0.12886214

In a commentary released a day after Trump was elected president, the North's official media reaffirmed the communist country will not give up its nuclear weapons program. ""Washington's hope for North Korea's denuclearization is an outdated illusion,"" the Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the ruling Workers' Party, said.The newspaper condemned U.S. President Barack Obama's ""strategic patience"" policy with North Korea, saying the policy has only left bigger burdens to his successor as Pyongyang has become a nuclear state.The U.S. focuses on applying pressure and sanctions against North Korea for its nuclear and missile provocations, saying that Pyongyang should first show sincere commitment to denuclearization if dialogue is to proceed.North Korea has claimed that it needs to develop and maintain a nuclear arsenal as a deterrence against what it calls Washington's hostile policy toward Pyongyang.Trump has not clearly unveiled his vision for the North Korean policy, but he expressed his willingness to hold talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un during his election campaign period.In June, North Korea's propaganda website hailed Trump's claim that South Korea should pay more for the upkeep of American troops on its soil.Experts said that North Korea may refrain from conducting another nuclear test or launching a long-range rocket until it can gauge the direction of Trump's North Korea policy.""North Korea would seek to have dialogue with Washington as long as the next U.S. administration does not take a hawkish stance toward the North's nuclear issue,"" said Kim Dong-yup, a professor at the Institute for Far East Studies of Kyungnam University.There had been speculation that the North could conduct nuclear or missile tests around U.S. Election Day, but the repressive regime did not take such a step.But some analysts said that North Korea would push ahead with nuclear and missile provocations around its key anniversaries in December.Dec. 17 marked the fifth anniversary of the death of Kim Jong-il, father of the current leader Kim Jong-un. The country's incumbent leader will also mark the fifth anniversary of him assuming the supreme commandership of the military on Dec. 30.""North Korea may conduct a nuclear or missile test around Kim Jong-un's 33rd birthday, which falls on Jan. 8,"" said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior researcher at the Sejong Institute.A source familiar with North Korean affairs said that North Korea is likely to make provocative acts as it will need to hone nuclear and missile technology, and wants to take an upper hand ahead of possible talks with Washington.""Next year will be the prime time for the North's leader to maximize the personality cult of his family lineage,"" the source said. ""The climate is favorable to the North's provocations.""North Korea conducted two nuclear tests this year alone following its detonation of nuke devices in 2006, 2009 and 2013.Pyongyang also launched a long-range rocket in February, which outside experts viewed as a covert test to check its long-range ballistic missile technology.An official at Seoul's unification ministry said Tuesday that North Korea would not feel safe about the results of the U.S.election as Washington is surely to place top priority on its security whoever wins the White House.","thursday the incoming donald trump ,newspaper condemned president barack obama ,condemned president barack obama strategic ,after trump was elected president ,condemned president barack obama","['Pyongyang', 'Donald Trump', 'North Korea', 'Trump', 'Washington', ""North Korea 's"", ""Workers ' Party"", 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'U.S.', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', ""North Korea 's"", 'Trump', 'South Korea', 'american', 'North Korea', 'Trump', 'North Korea', 'Korea', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'Kim Dong - yup', 'the Institute for Far East Studies', 'Kyungnam University', 'U.S.', 'North Korea', 'Kim Jong - il', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Korea', ""Kim Jong - un 's"", 'Cheong Seong - chang', 'the Sejong Institute', 'north korean', 'North Korea', 'Washington', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'Washington', 'the White House']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62734216  0.53589958

Lee Jung-hyun, the head of Saenuri, said it would be unconstitutional for Park give up control entirely, adding Moon has made a hasty remark.""Moon is a lawyer and also formerly worked as a presidential secretary.  presidents vow to follow the Constitution when they take oath of office,"" Lee said, adding Moon needs to explain himself in regards to his demands.Lee said Moon should make it clear if he is trying to bring about a paralysis of state affairs.The Saenuri head also requested opposition parties to hold discussions on the selection of a new prime minister to head the neutral Cabinet.Park earlier said she would withdraw the nomination of Kim Byong-joon, a prime minister designate, requesting the parliament to recommend another candidate amid the opposition parties' criticism that they cannot accept a designation that did not reflected the voice of the National Assembly.Opposition parties have distanced themselves from starting discussions about a new prime minister, adding the president should first clearly define her role for the remainder of her term in office that ends in February 2018 and hand over most of her powers to a neutral Cabinet.","opposition call for president park ,the military is unconstitutional ,the opposition call for president ,unconstitutional for park give up ,opposition call for president","['Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the Democratic Party', 'Choi soon - sil', 'Cabinet', 'Park', 'Saenuri', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'Moon', 'Lee', 'Moon', 'Lee', 'Moon', 'Saenuri', 'Cabinet', 'Kim Byong - joon', 'the National Assembly', 'Cabinet']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24815893 -0.0088701

Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn also summoned related ministers in an urgent meeting, in which he largely echoed the president’s remarks.The ruling Saenuri Party added that the opposition wing should offer its cooperation, hinting that it should stop obstructing government moves in response to the recent series of corruption scandals involving her key aides.“The National Assembly should play its due role to normalize state affairs and contribute to improving the Korea-US alliance,” the party said in a statement.Chairman Rep. Lee Jung-hyun also asserted that the key task is to maintain a tight allied defense against the North’s nuclear and missile threats, announcing a government-ruling party meeting on the following day so as to discuss more detailed countermeasures.Floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk, considered to be more centrist than Lee, let out some concerns over Trump’s “America First” policy.“It is likely that the US will no longer show tolerance upon dealing with other countries, which will consequently result in our loss in the national security and economic sectors,” Chung told reporters.He thus urged the government to immediately organize a task force to contact Trump’s incoming presidential transition team and make sure that South Korea’s policies move in line with the US interests.Opposition parties, in contrast, described the US election outcome as referendum of the public’s resentment toward establishment politics, which was largely represented by Democratic candidate Clinton. This perspective appeared to align with the ongoing attack against corruption scandals involving President Park, her ruling party and conglomerates.“We view the surprise outcome as the climax of mounting disappointment toward the establishment and the peoples’ desire for change,” said Rep. Park Kyung-mee, spokesperson of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, in a press briefing.Lee Jae-myung, the DPK-affiliated mayor of Seongnam City whose outspoken remarks have increasingly resonated with progressive voters, also referred to the election result as the public’s rebuke of elitism.The runner-up opposition People’s Party interim chief Rep. Park Jie-won, on the other hand, asserted Trump’s presidency may be a good opportunity for Korea in the diplomatic sense.“Being the businessman that he is, Trump will make a highly pragmatic approach ,” Park said.“We may also use  as an opportunity to free our diplomacy from its long dependency on the US.”The US president-elect had often spoken of a fair burden-sharing for the US troops in South Korea, going as far as calling South Korea and Japan to arm themselves with nuclear weapons, in case the US withdraws its forces from the region.By Bae Hyun-jung and Yeo Jun-suk","trump incoming presidential transition team ,trump incoming presidential transition ,president elect past controversial remarks ,contact trump incoming presidential transition ,outrunning his democratic rival hillary","['US', 'republican', 'Donald Trump', 'Korea', 'US', 'democratic', 'Barack Obama ’s', 'North Korea', 'Park Geun - hye', 'US', 'Trump', 'Pence', 'Korea', 'US', 'Cheong Wa Dae', 'Jung Youn', 'trump ’s', 'the Blue House', 'US', 'Trump', 'the United States', 'democratic', 'Hillary Clinton', 'the Blue House', 'National Security Council', 'North Korea', 'US', 'Park', 'NSC', 'Korea', 'US', 'US', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Defense', 'Han Min - koo', 'Seoul', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Saenuri Party', '“the National Assembly', 'Korea', 'US', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'North ’s', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'Lee', 'Trump ’s ""', 'US', 'Chung', 'Trump ’s', 'South Korea ’s', 'US', 'US', 'democratic', 'Clinton', 'Park Kyung - mee', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'Lee Jae - myung', 'Seongnam City', 'People ’s Party', 'Park Jie - won', 'Trump ’s', 'Korea', 'Trump', 'Park', 'US', 'US', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'US', 'Bae Hyun - jung', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.79367077  0.54621267

That means if this trend holds, Trump will end up winning more than the 270 votes needed to take the White House.Clinton was leading only in Pennsylvania, Maine, Minnesota and Nevada, whose combined vote total is 40.The results belie the late-minute pre-election polls that had widely suggested the 69-year-old former first lady, senator and secretary of state is likely to become the first female president in America's history, though her lead over Trump has significantly narrowed after the FBI's recent reinvestigation of her email scandal.The unexpectedly close race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump has also been watched closely by South Korea and other US allies as the results can have profound impacts on their security and economic relations with the most powerful nation in the world.Clinton and her husband, Bill Clinton, cast their ballots in Chappaqua, N.Y., Tuesday morning.""It is the most humbling feeling. I know how much responsibility goes with this. So many people are counting on the outcome of this election, what it means for our country. And I'll do the very best I can if I'm fortunate enough to win today,"" she told reporters after voting. Trump voted in Manhattan later in the day.""It's looking very good. Right now it's looking very good. It will be an interesting day. Thank you,"" Trump said after casting his ballot. Earlier in the day, he told Fox News, ""I see so many hopes and so many dreams out there that didn't happen, that could have happened, with leadership, with proper leadership. And people are hurt so badly.""More than 200 million people have registered to vote, a record that reflects strong interest in a race marked largely by the rise of the 70-year-old real-estate developer and former reality TV show host as well as questions about his qualifications to be commander-in-chief.Trump has repeatedly come under fire for a series of unrefined remarks and far-fetched proposals, such as his accusations of Mexican immigrants as ""rapists"" and his idea of building a massive wall to keep them out. Still, he has enjoyed solid ratings in what is dubbed a ""Trump phenomenon"" that underlines voter anger against the establishment.The new president, set to be sworn in on Jan. 20, will take over at a time when the US is grappling with the militant group Islamic State, an increasingly provocative North Korea and a host of problems to solve at home, including immigration reforms, job creation and economic inequalities.The results could also have deep repercussions not only in the US, but also elsewhere in the world as Clinton and Trump differ sharply in the ways they look at security relations with foreign countries, especially allies, and trade deals around the world.Clinton praises alliances as a ""source of strength"" that makes the US safer, while Trump views the relations as well as US security commitments to them as a cumbersome burden sucking up taxpayer dollars, something that the country should abandon unless they make economic sense.Trump even suggested arming South Korea and Japan with nuclear weapons so as to reduce US security burdens.South Korea has watched the election more closely than ever due to its potential impact on the alliance with the US, a big departure from past elections, when no candidates questioned the value of the alliance with Seoul, and a focus in Korea policy was mostly on how to deal with North Korea.Trump has also argued that South Korea should pay 100 percent of the cost for 28,000 American troops stationed in the Asian ally to deter North Korean aggression. Many agree that the troop presence is also in line with US interests in a region marked by China's rise.Seoul currently pays about half the costs, about US$900 million a year.A Trump victory could also upset the landmark free trade agreement between the two countries as he has denounced the 2012 pact as a ""job-killing"" deal and a ""disaster."" Clinton has not disputed existing free trade deals, but expressed negative views of the Trans Pacific Partnership , a 12-nation free trade pact awaiting legislative approval, even though TPP is one of President Barack Obama's foreign policy legacies.","tuesday us presidential election winning ,900 million year trump victory ,us presidential election winning one ,presidential election winning one battleground ,biggest upsets in american election","['Donald Trump', 'US', 'american', ""Hillary Clinton 's"", 'Florida', 'North Carolina', 'Ohio', 'Wisconsin', 'Michigan', 'New Hampshire', 'Iowa', 'Utah', 'Arizona', 'Trump', 'the White House', 'Clinton', 'Pennsylvania', 'Maine', 'Minnesota', 'Nevada', 'America', 'Trump', 'FBI', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Donald Trump', 'South Korea', 'US', 'Clinton', 'Bill Clinton', 'Chappaqua', 'N.Y.', 'Manhattan', 'trump', 'Fox News', 'trump', 'mexican', 'US', 'Islamic State', 'North Korea', 'US', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Clinton', 'US', 'US', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'US', 'South Korea', 'US', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'North Korea', 'trump', 'South Korea', 'american', 'asian', 'north korean', 'US', 'China', 'Seoul', 'trump', 'Clinton', 'the Trans Pacific Partnership', 'TPP', 'Barack Obama']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64452207  0.55395424

Park Jie-won, floor leader and interim chief of the second-biggest opposition People’s Party.“According to a notice from the speaker’s office, the president is coming to visit the Assembly at 10:30 a.m. today. I am not going,” the fourth-term lawmaker wrote.The senior opposition lawmaker’s remark reflected the political strife over the president’s prime ministerial nomination of Kim Byong-joon, a former chief policymaker for the late liberal President Roh Moo-hyun.Though Kim was considered a likely figure, embraced by both the ruling and opposition camp, his surprise designation came under fire for lacking prior consultation with political parties.It was also taken as a sign that the president would neither accept a reinforcement of prime ministerial power nor heed public calls for her resignation.Standing by their earlier position, the three opposition parties -- the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, the People’s Party and the progressive minority Justice Party -- staged a protest upon Park‘s arrival.Their consensus was that the president’s visit to the Assembly in spite of the obvious conflict was just a political show.“The president did not mention a single word on renouncing her power, which is the most crucial issue at hand,” said Democratic Party spokesperson Rep. Park Kyung-mee.People’s Party chief spokesperson Rep. Son Kum-ju even suspected the president had deliberately made an unheralded visit so as to make it look like the opposition was cutting off communication.The more outspoken Justice Party stepped up its calls for the president’s resignation.“The only way to express apologies to the people and to restore state affairs is for the president to step down,” said the party’s spokesperson Rep. Chu Hye-seon.The ruling Saenuri Party -- especially its President Park supporter Chairman Rep. Lee Jung-hyun -- was alone in giving a positive appraisal of the president’s move.“The president has understood and responded to the opposition’s call for a neutral Cabinet,” Lee told reporters.“Also, her visit implies a strong determination to break through the current political deadlock by all means.”Some of the party’s nonmainstream members also claimed the president‘s decision, though not fully sufficient to the public’s eye, was a significant gesture.“The president admitted the fault in the process of prime minister nomination and provided a clue in solving the current circumstances,” said Rep. Yoo Seong-min through a press release.“It is now time for rival parties to work together in discussing the range of prime ministerial power and the incoming Cabinet, as well as the independent counsel .“By Bae Hyun-jung","resignation the president surprise visit ,tuesday requested the legislature recommend ,legislature recommend new prime minister ,president resignation the president surprise ,tuesday requested the legislature","['Park Geun - hye', 'Kim Byong - joon', 'Park', 'Chung Sye - kyun', 'Park Geun', 'National Assembly', 'Chung Sye - kyun', 'the National Assembly', 'Cabinet', 'Cabinet', 'Cabinet', 'Han', 'Hur Won - je', 'Chung', 'the Blue House ’s', 'Jung Youn', 'Park Jie - won', 'People ’s Party', 'Assembly', 'Kim Byong - joon', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Kim', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'the People ’s Party', 'Justice Party', 'Assembly', 'Democratic Party', 'Park Kyung - mee', 'People ’s Party', 'Son Kum - ju', 'Justice Party', 'Chu Hye - seon', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'Cabinet', 'Lee', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Cabinet', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55200225  0.19237909

When she arrived at around 10:30 a.m., everything seemed to be business as usual. The Assembly’s Secretary-General Woo Yoon-keun and the governing Saenuri Party’s floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk were among the first to greet her. Clad in a red jacket and black trousers, Park smiled as she was escorted into the main assembly hall, leading an impressive entourage. Inside the Assembly, however, the mood was drastically different. Dozens of opposition lawmakers and their aides held up placards and chanted slogans, demanding her resignation. No Saenuri lawmaker was there to welcome the president. Reps. Cho Won-jin, Min Kyung-wook and Ju Sang-ook showed up at the elevator near the entrance hall, but turned back after seeing the crowd of protestors. “It is an order from the people: Park Geun-hye must stay away from state affairs,” read the placards held up by lawmakers of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, including Reps. Sul Hoon and Woo Won-shik. Another banner, carried by first-termer Rep. Chae Yi-bae and other members of the runner-up opposition People’s Party, read: “The president should step down.” President Park Geun-hye walks past protesters to hold an one-on-one talk with National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun at the parliamentary building in Yeouido, Seoul, Tuesday. Six lawmakers from the minor Justice Party, including its leader Rep. Shim Sang-jeung, held a sign reading, “Resignation for Park.”“Stop giving a hard time to the people. Please resign,” a group of staffers from the Democratic Party shouted. The words “resignation” reverberated across the hallway until the president took the elevator to meet Speaker Chung Sye-kyun. Park, not losing her smile despite the palpable hostility, made no comment or gestures.After a 13-minute one-on-one meeting with Speaker Chung, hurriedly arranged to salvage her embattled presidency, Park faced the same protestors as she made her way out of the building. They continued to chant “resignation for Park” until well after she left. No Saenuri lawmakers were there to send her off. It was a far cry from her last visit to the Assembly on Oct. 24, when she dropped a political bomb -- a proposal to revise the Constitution and modify the country’s single-term, five-year presidency. Refusing to be a lame-duck in her fourth year in office, she had thrust herself into the center of political talk. Then, not only did Saenuri lawmakers line up to greet and escort her in and out of the Assembly, some loyalists had given her a standing ovation during her speech. The reason for Park’s fall from grace in just over two weeks’ time -- her misguided reliance on embattled friend Choi Soon-sil. By Yeo Jun-suk","assembly on tuesday was filled ,standing ovation during her speech ,seoul tuesday six lawmakers ,yeouido seoul tuesday six lawmakers ,people party read the president","['Park', 'the National Assembly', 'Assembly', 'Woo Yoon - keun', 'Saenuri Party ’s', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'Park', 'Assembly', 'Saenuri', 'Cho Won - jin', 'Min Kyung - wook', 'Ju Sang - ook', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'Sul Hoon', 'Woo Won - shik', 'Chae Yi - bae', 'People ’s Party', 'Park Geun', 'National Assembly', 'Chung Sye - kyun', 'Yeouido', 'Seoul', 'Justice Party', 'Shim Sang - jeung', 'the Democratic Party', 'Chung Sye - kyun', 'Chung', 'Saenuri', 'Assembly', 'Saenuri', 'Assembly', 'Park']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.58213377  0.42903465

President Park Geun-hye leaving after addressing Assembly ""If the National Assembly recommends a new premier, I will appoint him and let him control the Cabinet.""Later in the day, Chung plans to hold a meeting with the floor leaders of the three major parties, including the ruling Saenuri Party, to discuss the nomination of a new prime minister.On Wednesday, Park tapped Kim Byong-joon, chief policy advisor to the late liberal President Roh Moo-hyun, as new prime minister in a government reshuffle aimed at placating escalating public anger over the political scandal involving Park.The surprise designation came without consulting political parties, drawing intense criticism from opposition parties, which have demanded that a new premier be picked based on bipartisan agreement.During his talks with Park, Chung urged the president to ""uphold public opinion"" in her efforts to find a way out of the current political crisis.""The crisis facing the president is a crisis in state governance and a crisis of the nation as a whole, and thus people are very worried,"" Chung told Park.""Therefore, what is most important is placating public concerns,"" he added.The embattled president, then, urged the legislature to muster up efforts to overcome economic challenges, pointing to sluggish exports and the fallout from the ongoing restructuring of the shipbuilding and shipping industries.In the wake of the unprecedented scandal, opposition parties, as well as some ruling party members, have pressured Park to take a back seat in state affairs and delegate her executive power to a ""neutral"" Cabinet formed based on bipartisan agreement.To address the political deadlock, Park on Friday proposed holding talks with the heads of ruling and opposition parties. But opposition parties rejected the proposal, demanding Park first cancel her premier nomination and agree to the creation of a bipartisan Cabinet.  At the center of the scandal is Choi Soon-sil, who has been accused of abusing her longtime friendship with the president to meddle in state affairs and gain financially.The scandal has sent her approval ratings plummeting and left state governance in disarray, with her detractors calling for her to step aside.","clamoring for her resignation president ,her resignation president park geun ,lawmakers clamoring for her resignation ,her resignation president park ,park first cancel her premier","['Park Geun - hye', 'National Assembly', 'Chung Sye - kyun', 'Park', 'Cabinet', 'Chung', 'Park Geun', 'Assembly', 'the National Assembly', 'Cabinet', 'Chung', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park', 'Kim Byong - joon', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Park', 'Park', 'Chung', 'Chung', 'Park', 'Cabinet', 'Park', 'Cabinet', 'Choi Soon - sil']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59047395  0.47994441

Her freefall in popularity has stopped, a recent survey showed, with an uptick in the president’s core support base of older and right-wing voters. According to local pollster Realmeter, Park’s daily approval ratings have gone downhill, dropping from around 30 percent, before a scandal involving her close confidante Choi Soon-sil broke out, to just 10.2 percent last Wednesday. The conservative president, however, stopped her losing streak in polls Thursday, registering a slight uptick -- 0.7 percentage point -- in approval ratings to reach 10.9 percent. Then on Friday, after her nationally televised mea culpa, the daily reading inched further up to 12.7 percent. “Park’s second apology, in which she expressed her willingness to undergo investigation, appears to have consolidated support behind her,” Realmeter explained. The president saw her support among voters aged 60 or older rise by nearly 5 percentage points after the apology -- from 23.5 percent on Thursday to 28.4 percent on Friday. Among supporters of the conservative Saenuri Party, those who approve of the job Park is doing rose from 36.9 percent to 42.6 percent. On a weekly basis, however, the Realmeter result also showed that Park has become the least popular of all democratically-elected presidents in South Korea. Her approval rating for the first week of November stood at 11.5 percent, down 7.5 percentage points from the previous week. The previous record was 12.6 percent held by former President Roh Moo-hyun. Last week, Gallup Korea put Park’s approval rating at 5 percent, the lowest ever for any Korean president. By Korea Herald staff /","losing streak in polls thursday ,after her emotional apology friday ,her losing streak in polls ,last wednesday the conservative president ,president however stopped her losing","['Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park', 'Park', 'South Korea', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Gallup Korea', 'Park', 'korean', 'Korea Herald']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.74718142  0.42988506

As preconditions for the talks, they demanded Park withdraw the “unilateral” nomination, declare she will step back from state affairs and give up her ruling party membership.""The meeting can take place only when the nomination of Kim Byong-joon is canceled and other conditions are met. A meeting for the sake of a meeting is meaningless,"" Choo Mi-ae, the leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, told reporters.Choo Mi-ae, leader of the main opposition Democratic Party Odds are growing that Park will dump the premier pick in the face of strong objection from the opposition parties. A Cheong Wa Dae official said “Time is running out. We have to discuss even the option of discarding Kim Byong-joon.” The president named Kim and Han last Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, in a government reshuffle aimed at coping with the fallout from the so-called Choi Soon-sil gate. Kim’s nomination was a surprise to many as he served as senior presidential policy adviser under the liberal administration of the late President Roh Moo-hyun, who ruled the country from 2003-2008.But it was far short of defusing her political crisis.Opposition parties and her rivals in the ruling party lambasted the president for not consulting with political parties. The opposition bloc has also demanded that Park take her hands off politics and delegate her executive authority to a neutral Cabinet formed on bipartisan agreement.During his meeting with Saenuri leader Lee Jung-hyun, Han appealed for bipartisan cooperation in coping with the negative repercussions the scandal has brought on state governance. ""Talks are held even during a war,"" Han said. ""The role of the legislature is crucial in this difficult situation.""The ruling party leader echoed the need to promptly hold the top-level political meeting to discuss a range of issues, including setting up a nonpartisan Cabinet -- a key demand by the opposition parties. Han also met with Park Jie-won, the interim leader of the minor People's Party, who repeated the demand that Park cancel her nomination for a new prime minister.Amid growing calls for the president to play only a nominal role in running the country, the presidential office said that if approved by the legislature, Prime Minister-designate Kim will be given the ""entire scope of authority"" allowed under the current law."" will give the new prime minister powerful authority,"" a presidential official told reporters, declining to be named.The official, however, showed reluctance over the opposition parties' demand that Park clearly state she would ""take a back seat"" to a new prime minister.""The question is whether the prime minister will have substantial authority in carrying out his duties,"" he said. ""I don't think the wording itself is important.""Meanwhile, Choo, the Democratic Party leader, plans to hold a breakfast meeting Tuesday with her party's presidential hopefuls to discuss how to cope with the fallout from the political scandal.Among the participants are former party leader Moon Jae-in, Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon and South Chungcheong Governor Ahn Hee-jung, a party official said.Choo has also scheduled a meeting with the leaders of the People's Party and Progressive Party on Wednesday to discuss their cooperation in handling the ramifications of the scandal.","break political deadlock on monday ,meeting tuesday with her party ,opposition parties rejected president park ,tuesday with her party presidential ,presidential official told reporters declining","['Park Geun - hye', 'Park', 'Han Gwang - ok', 'Park', 'Han', 'Park', 'the National Assembly', 'Cheong', 'Park', 'Kim Byong - joon', 'Democratic Party', 'Democratic Party Odds', 'Park', 'time', 'Kim Byong - joon', 'Kim', 'Han', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Cabinet', 'Saenuri', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'Han', 'Han', 'Cabinet', 'Han', 'Park Jie - won', ""People 's Party"", 'Kim', 'Democratic Party', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Ahn Hee - jung', ""the People 's Party"", 'Progressive Party']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67823607  0.6385473

Both the South Korean military and the US forces stationed on the Korean Peninsula said they are utilizing all available resources to keep close tabs on the movement of missiles. The Musudan or BM-35 missile is an IRBM with an estimated range of some 3,500 kilometers, which is enough to allow it to target the US Pacific territory of Guam. The island is home to many strategic assets that can support South Korean and US forces in the event of a conflict breaking out on the peninsula.

Still, they denied reports filed by a local media outlet that the files indicated Choi's intervention in a Cabinet meeting held in November last year.Jeong Ho-seong, a former personal secretary of President Park Geun-hye, appears at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office in Seoul on Nov. 7, 2016, to undergo questioning over suspicions he leaked confidential presidential documents to Choi Soon-sil. Jeong is one of Park's top aides who resigned on Oct. 30, following the latest scandal involving Choi, who is suspected to be the behind-the-scenes power broker of the current administration.He has been in custody since Thursday over allegations he leaked official secrets to Choi, the longtime friend of Park. Jeong was formally arrested early Sunday along with another former presidential secretary An Chong-bum, as a local court issued warrants. On Oct. 25 President Park apologized, admitting to handing over drafts of presidential speeches to Choi, who holds no governmental post, and letting her edit them.She offered a second apology on Friday, but failed to allay public outrage over the burgeoning scandal with her approval rating crashing to 5 percent last week. It is the lowest record ever for a sitting South Korean president, according to a survey conducted by Gallup Korea. Tens of thousands of citizens took to the streets over the weekend, demanding her resignation. Also on Monday, prosecutors questioned a number of officials from companies and foundations suspected of their involvement in the scandal, including executives at the Federation of Korean Industries, the country's largest business lobby. The FKI is suspected to have spearheaded the collection of nearly 80 billion won  from local conglomerates for two nonprofit foundations. There have been allegations that the money was then unlawfully funneled to Choi.The 60-year-old Choi is undergoing interrogation in custody, as the same court issued a warrant to formally arrest her Thursday night.","he leaked confidential presidential documents ,also on monday prosecutors questioned ,phone conversation between former presidential ,investigators said they confiscated cell ,resignation also on monday prosecutors","['Park Geun', 'Jeong Ho - seong', 'Choi', 'Cabinet', 'Jeong Ho - seong', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Seoul', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Jeong', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Park', 'Jeong', 'An Chong - bum', 'Park', 'Choi', 'south korean', 'Gallup Korea', 'the Federation of Korean Industries', 'FKI', 'Choi', 'Choi']",0,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.51678395  0.36807525

The liberal opposition’s bigwigs are rushing to turn public anger over the Choi Soon-sil scandal into an opportunity to rally support. Heavyweights from the ruling Saenuri Party, meanwhile, are trying to set themselves apart from the embattled president and position themselves as conservative alternatives.UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who is rumored to be President Park’s pick for her successor, has taken a hit from the scandal, losing his longtime lead in polls of potential presidential contenders.     For the first time in 15 weeks, Realmeter polls Thursday put Ban’s popularity behind Moon Jae-in, the former Democratic Party leader. Moon’s approval rating was 20.9 percent, but Ban stood at 16.5 percent, 4.4 percent points down from a week earlier. Scheduled to end his term at the UN this December, the world’s top diplomat has not clarified his post-UN career, including his presidential bid for next year’s election. Many have speculated that if he does, he would run on Saenuri’s ticket. Now with the Choi scandal, some say he may not want to be linked to the disgraced party. “Given that our party is on the brink of being completely abandoned by the people, do you think Ban will join us?” Saenuri floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk was quoted as saying by Saenuri officials during a closed-door party meeting Friday. Reeling from the scandal that has worsened factional strife between the pro-Park clique and their dissenters, some Saenuri heavyweights aim to present themselves as moderate power brokers by denouncing the president and her faction’s sway over the party’s affairs. Saenuri’s former leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung called for a “complete overhaul” equivalent to the reestablishment of the party. Its former whip. Rep. Yoo Seong-min offered what he considered as an “alternative vision” for the conservative party by addressing income disparity and promoting fair growth. Though the two dissenting bigwigs had once built close ties with the president during their political careers -- former leader Kim once famously said, “Every Saenuri knows who Choi Soon-sil is” -- they noted that it is time to move beyond Park’s legacy. Encouraged by the remarkable, if not significant, increase in their popularity, the opposition parties’ heavyweights are trying to seize the momentum and turn public outrage over the conservative president into support for their presidential bids. While Moon has emerged as the front-runner for the 2017 race, other liberal or centrist bigwigs such as Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon and former People’s Party leader Ahn Cheol-soo have not seen considerable boosts in their popularity. According to the latest Realmeter poll Thursday, Mayor Park’s approval ratings was 5.7 percent, 0.4 percent point lower than similar survey a week earlier. Ahn’s approval rating stood at 10.3, 0.2 percent point down from the last week’s survey. Such results appeared to reflect how each opposition bigwig responded to the burgeoning political scandal -- all three politicians demanded President Park stay away from state affairs, but they differed on specific requests.  Democratic Party’s front-runner Moon has refrained from publicly demanding the impeachment -- or resignation -- of President Park, fearing that such a radical approach would cause backlash among the general voters.  But most recently -- as the president appears to maintain her grip on state affairs by nominating the prime minister and Cabinet members -- Moon has adopted a more assertive tone. He said that unless the president backs down, he would make an “important decision,” alluding to a push for Park’s resignation. Former People’s Party leader Ahn and Seoul Mayor Park, on the other hand, were among the first politicians to demand the ousting of the president. The central-left politicians said President Park has lost the “authority and ability” to act as commander in chief and that political confusion caused by a power vacuum could be offset by electing the next president earlier than scheduled. “Even if the president were to step down, it doesn’t bring disruption to the country,” said Ahn in a parliamentary speech Thursday. Mayor Park told protesters at Saturday’s rally that “he will get the president to step down and bring an end to the president’s failure.” Among the politicians has emerged Seongnam City’s Lee Jae-myeong, whose unapologetic leftist message resonates with longtime supporters and is now extending to average voters since the outbreak of the scandal. The latest Realmeter poll showed that Mayor Lee ranked the fourth favorite presidential hopeful. He led Mayor Park by 4 percentage points, 9.7 percent to 5.7 percent. His gap with Ahn was only 0.6 percent points.

The island is home to many strategic assets that can support South Korean and US forces in the event of a conflict breaking out on the Korean Peninsula.""Speculation of a launch taking place in the near future comes as North Korean experts have said Pyongyang will likely want to send a strong message to the next president,"" another military official, who declined to be identified, said. He added the North recently has carried out many of its provocations to coincide with key foreign events.Others said if the launch succeeds this time around, it will highlight Pyongyang's growing nuclear and long-range missile capability that will give it more leverage in potential future talks.Both the South Korean military and the US forces stationed on the Korean Peninsula said they are utilizing all available resources to keep close tabs on movement of missiles.The military said it had detected a Musudan missile near Kusong in North Pyongan Province. The region is where the North fired off a Musudan on Oct. 20.The North is known to have first fielded the IRBM in 2007, but it only test fired it for the first time on April 15 of this year.Since then, it has fired eight missiles with only one, which was launched on June 22, flying any distance. That missile flew about 400 km after reaching an altitude of 1,400 km.Besides the missile launch, military forces here are not ruling out other forms of provocations by the North, although it has thus detected nothing out of the ordinary along the heavily guarded inter-Korean border.There has even been speculation that the North may be preparing for another nuclear test, which could drastically escalate tensions.After detonating its first nuclear device in 2006, the North tested nukes in 2009 and 2013. For 2016, the North conducted two nuclear tests in January and September.","launchers the us presidential election ,two nuclear tests in january ,election takes place on tuesday ,preparing for another nuclear test ,the us presidential election takes","['North Korea', 'US', 'Musudan', 'US', 'democratic', 'republican', 'Musudan', 'IRBM', 'US Pacific', 'Guam', 'south korean', 'US', 'north korean', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'south korean', 'US', 'Musudan', 'Kusong', 'North Pyongan Province', 'Musudan', 'North', 'IRBM', 'inter - korean']",6,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.78149134  0.63333583

Prosecutors suspect that An collaborated with Choi Soon-sil, longtime friend of Park and the woman at the heart of the scandal, to pressure local companies to donate nearly 80 billion won  to two nonprofit organizations. There have been allegations that the money was then illegally funneled to Choi.The 60-year-old woman, suspected to have meddled in various state affairs and amassed profits using her ties to the president, is also in custody, as the same court issued a warrant to arrest her Thursday night. Professor-turned-presidential advisor An is also accused of attempting to force a local company to hand over to a third party shares of another firm that it took over. An associate of Choi is suspected to having taken part in the process. In addition, the court issued a warrant to arrest Jeong Ho-seong, the former secretary for private presidential affairs, for handing over state documents to Choi.The latest arrest came less than two days after President Park Geun-hye apologized for a second time in a nationally televised address, saying she will accept, if needed, a probe regarding her role in the alleged wrongdoings. In the first address, she admitted to handing over drafts of presidential speeches to Choi, who holds no governmental post, and letting her edit them. The second apology came as the first one, which took place on Oct. 25, failed to allay public outrage over the scandal which has only been snowballing. Her approval rating crashed to 5 percent late last week, the lowest ever for a sitting South Korean president, according to a survey conducted by Gallup Korea.","latest political scandal surrounding president ,secretary was arrested sunday after ,arrest her thursday night professor ,presidential secretary was arrested sunday ,arrested sunday after he resigned","['Park Geun', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'an Chong - bum', 'Park', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Jeong Ho - seong', 'Choi', 'Park Geun', 'Choi', 'south korean', 'Gallup Korea']",0,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.90049374  0.27687189

It is the first time a General Assembly resolution has mentioned the North's labor exports, which has become an increasingly important source of hard currency for Pyongyang amid concern that the funds could be used for its nuclear and missile programs.About 50,000-60,000 North Koreans are believed to be toiling overseas, mainly in the mining, logging, textile and construction industries. The average wage was stated as $120 to $150 per month, but in most cases employing firms paid salaries directly to the North's government.The North reportedly receives more than $100 million from this system per year.As in the past, the new resolution also calls on the Security Council to ""take appropriate action to ensure accountability, including through consideration of referral of the situation"" to the ICC, and through ""consideration of the further development of sanctions in order to target effectively those who appear to be most responsible for human rights violations.""It also encourages the council to continue discussions on the issue.The 2014 General Assembly resolution is considered a watershed moment in international efforts to improve the North's human rights situation as it marked the first time for the Assembly to call for the North's referral to the ICC.That resolution led to the UN Security Council holding consultations on the issue for the first time later that year. In addition, a similar resolution was adopted last year and the Security Council also held discussions on the North's human rights situation for the second time.The consecutive adoption of such resolutions underscored the seriousness the international community attaches to the problem and is expected to increase pressure on Pyongyang. North Korea has long been labeled as one of the worst human rights violators. The communist regime does not tolerate dissent, holds hundreds of thousands of people in political prison camps and keeps tight control over outside information.But the North has bristled at such criticism, calling it a US-led attempt to topple its regime.","third consecutive year for the ,thursday passage of the resolution ,the landmark resolution in 2014 ,mark the third consecutive year ,unveiled thursday passage of the","['UN General Assembly', ""North Korea 's"", 'the International Criminal Court', 'Pyongyang', 'the Third Committee', 'the General Assembly', 'the UN Security Council', ""the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea"", 'General Assembly', 'Pyongyang', 'North Koreans', 'North', 'the Security Council', 'General Assembly', 'Assembly', 'the UN Security Council', 'the Security Council', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'US']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.04847162  0.37404326

153,153,Park appoints ex-opposition figure as new chief of staff,"President Park Geun-hye on Thursday named her new chief of staff and senior political adviser, wrapping up the extensive shake-up of her secretariat aimed at defusing protest over the corruption scandal involving her confidante Choi Soon-sil.

Her previous reshuffle decisions had triggered backlash for “failing to reflect the calls for reform,” but this time the president chose to embrace a ranking opposition figure in an apparent gesture of reconciliation.It remains doubtful, however, whether the series of personnel replacements will be a valid solution to growing public fury against the president’s alleged connections to the unprecedented scandal.Han Gwang-ok Park’s pick to steer the presidential staff was Han Gwang-ok, the incumbent chairman of the Presidential Committee for National Cohesion and a former chief of staff for the late liberal President Kim Dae-jung.For the post of senior presidential secretary for political affairs, she tapped Hur Won-je, a former journalist-turned-politician and vice chairman of the Korea Communications Commission.“With his ample experience, as well as his devotion to democratization, Han will assist the president amid these difficult times and contribute to stabilizing state management,” said spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk.Han reciprocated by saying that he will “gather opinions from all social standings and deliver them to the president.”The incoming presidential chief of staff is marked for his past affiliation with the liberal opposition. He served as chief of staff for the late President Kim Dae-jung and was also a fourth-term lawmaker in former bodies of the current main opposition Democratic Party of Korea.Han seconded to the ruling conservative Saenuri Party in 2012, shortly before the presidential election, and has been in his current post as national cohesion chief ever since Park’s presidential transition team kicked off in January 2013.Park’s appointment of the former opposition figure was regarded back then as a gesture of political reform and social tolerance -- campaign pledges which she had vowed to achieve.The fact that he came from Jeonju, North Jeolla Province, which is part of the longtime liberal stronghold area in the southwest of the nation, also adds to the symbolic significance of his appointment.Despite the gesture of reaching across political boundaries, Park’s personnel decision was at odds with the opposition.“Not a day has yet passed since the latest shake-up which reflected her disconnection, not only from the public and opposition but from the ruling camp as well,” said Democratic Party spokesperson Rep. Keum Tae-sup in a briefing.The runner-up opposition People’s Party, too, blasted the president for turning a deaf ear to those asking for her explanation, apology and even resignation.Hur, the new senior presidential secretary for political affairs who replaces the feud-ridden Woo Byung-woo, formerly worked as a journalist for several local papers including the nation’s leading progressive voice Kyunghang Shinmun. He also worked several years in broadcasting companies KBS and SBS, after which he joined political circles as a ruling party lawmaker in the previous 18th National Assembly.He served as a campaign strategist for Park during the primary back in 2007 to win the presidential nomination of the Grand National Party, the former body of the current Saenuri.His expected function as the president’s political agenda chief is to “play a bridging role” so as to ensure communication with the legislature and citizens, according to the Blue House spokesperson.Though the post of senior secretary for policy coordination, formerly occupied by scandal-linked An Chong-bum, still remains vacant, Thursday’s appointments more or less filled most of the personnel blanks in top presidential posts.The embattled state leader appointed two new senior secretaries Sunday and a new prime minister Wednesday, along with a new deputy prime minister and public safety and security minister.Meanwhile, the prosecutorial investigation on Choi continues. She is the controversial friend of the president who allegedly used her ties with the state leader to sway key state affairs.After reports seemingly indicating the president’s liability, Justice Minister Kim Hyun-woong said Thursday that he will suggest the president volunteer for questioning.By Bae Hyun-jung","protest over the corruption scandal ,two new senior secretaries sunday ,public fury against the president ,reshuffle decisions had triggered backlash ,presidential transition team kicked off","['Park Geun - hye', 'Han Gwang - ok', 'Park', 'Han', 'the Presidential Committee for National Cohesion', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'Hur Won - je', 'the Korea Communications Commission', 'Han', 'Jung Youn', 'Han', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'Han', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park ’s', 'Jeonju', 'North Jeolla Province', 'Park ’s', 'Democratic Party', 'Keum Tae - sup', 'People ’s Party', 'Kyunghang Shinmun', 'KBS', 'SBS', 'National Assembly', 'Park', 'the Grand National Party', 'Saenuri', 'Blue House', 'Chong - bum', 'Choi', 'Kim Hyun - woong', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49444121  0.59732318

The statement, read by their representatives at a press conference in Seoul, said that the new Cabinet should be formed by a prime minister who can garner support from across the aisle and the public. It also urged political parties to come together to address the current paralysis of state affairs for the sake of the country and the people, and not to try to use the situation for their own interest. Among the 22 are former Prime Minister Chung Un-chan and five former National Assembly speakers: Park Gwan-yong, Lim Chae-jung, Chung Ui-hwa, Kim Won-ki and Kim Hyung-oh.Some of them expressed their opposition to President Park’s selection of a new Prime Minister -- Kim Byong-joon -- earlier in the day.“What we call for is a nonparty Cabinet that can win the support of both ruling and opposition parties, and the public. Replacing the prime minister and a couple of other ministers isn’t enough,” said Park Nam-soo, head of the United Religions Initiative of Korea and supreme leader of Chondogyo, a native Korean religion. Voices denouncing President Park are growing across academia, civil society, religion and other parts of society, with the latest poll showing her approval ratings dipping to an unprecedented below 10 percent range.

159,159,[Reporter‘s Column] A president in isolation,"Former Senior Presidential Secretary for Political Affairs Kim Jae-won may have had a point when he said that “the president is lonely and sad, please protect her” in his parting message, though his sympathetic tone was not echoed by the majority of the public.　Yes, President Park Geun-hye is most certain to be lonely as she finds herself isolated from the aggressive legislature, from the half-empty secretariat, f...","Former Senior Presidential Secretary for Political Affairs Kim Jae-won may have had a point when he said that “the president is lonely and sad, please protect her” in his parting message, though his sympathetic tone was not echoed by the majority of the public.Yes, President Park Geun-hye is most certain to be lonely as she finds herself isolated from the aggressive legislature, from the half-empty secretariat, from the soon-to-be overhauled Cabinet, from the furious public -- in short, from the nation which she is supposed to govern.But one would hardly think that her “sadness” is justified as it was brought on by her own inappropriate involvement with a corrupt shadow broker, dampening the spirits of even those most loyal to her.The distressed president on Tuesday made her first public appearance in five days with a meeting of the newly-appointed foreign ambassadors in Korea to receive their letters of credence.But apart from this diplomatic ceremony, most of the president’s pre-scheduled events have been called off since she hurriedly issued a very terse “apology” last Tuesday, admitting to her long-suspected ties with Choi Soon-sil.The only official actions taken by the feud-ridden state chief during those frantic days were to order her senior secretaries to submit their resignation en masse and to replace some of the most disputed members.Cheong Wa Dae attributed Park’s prolonged silence to her “prudent contemplation” on how to respond to the people’s call for reform, especially on how to restructure the Cabinet.Such pretext obviously did not have the intended effect, as Park’s approval rating has continued to plunge.The Blue House has so far feigned indifference to the plummeting polls, but now faced with the risk of an unprecedented single-digit popularity rating, the president should grasp the reality that “prudent contemplation” is not the answer to any of her pressing challenges.President Park’s approval rating stands at a record low of 10.4 percent, according to a survey released by local pollster Research View on Tuesday.As shocking as this figure may be, it is more surprising that Park’s longtime stronghold clusters -- elderly voters aged 60 or more and residents of the conservative-leaning Gyeongsang region -- have begun turning their back on her.Even the ruling conservative Saenuri Party is voicing complaints, some non-mainstream members going as far as demanding her resignation, just like the opposition parties.The president’s aides have often spoken of Park’s “dark period in life,” when she found herself “cut off from the rest of the world” upon the death of her father, the assassinated autocratic President Park Chung-hee.This traumatic experience was often used not only to stimulate nostalgia in elderly voters, but also to explain Park’s irrational attachment to the controversial aide Choi, as well as to her deceased father and cult leader Choi Tae-min.But this time, the “isolation” is real for the president who now has nowhere to turn to, in this nation in which she is still the nominal leader.By Bae Hyun-jung","president is lonely and sad ,to her the distressed president ,the president is lonely ,the president is lonely and ,that the president is lonely","['Kim Jae - won', 'Park Geun', 'Cabinet', 'Korea', 'Cheong', 'Park ’s', 'Cabinet', 'Park ’s', 'the Blue House', 'Research View', 'Park', 'Gyeongsang', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Park ’s', 'Choi', 'Choi Tae - min', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.6371786   0.70292324

A whirlwind of events have taken place in the past few days: the return from overseas of Choi’s key men and herself on Sunday, the prosecution’s “search by voluntary cooperation” of Cheong Wa Dae and finally Choi’s appearance Monday at the prosecution some 32 hours after her arrival in Seoul. These may have been part of a “prearranged scenario” prepared by the shared inner circle of President Park Geun-hye and Choi, they claimed. “I believe that Park’s former Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon, Civil Affairs Secretary Woo Byung-woo and their team apparently put together by Choi have embarked on a covert operation to cover up their crimes,” said Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo of the second-largest opposition People’s Party. Kim served as the chief of the presidential secretariat from August 2013 to February 2015. Woo, a former state prosecutor, joined the secretariat in April 2014 until he was replaced Sunday by Choi Jai-kyeong, another prosecutorial figure said to have close ties to Kim. Both Kim and Woo are accused of condoning or even actively aiding Choi’s string-pulling behind the scenes by using her 40-year-long ties to President Park. “Under the direction of Woo, they are trying to cover this up and make it look like Choi’s personal failure that she went overboard to edit presidential speeches and conduct irregularities,” Rep. Park Jie-won of the People’s Party said. “They are now making up the story and destroying evidence,” he claimed. Fueling such suspicion was the prosecution, which waited 33 hours to call Choi -- the main suspect in its probe -- in for questioning. Choi arrived at Incheon Airport at 7:30 a.m. on Sunday and was summoned for questioning only at 3 p.m. on Monday. During this time, Choi could have consulted with others who are also facing questioning in the investigation to match their statements or destroy evidence, the opposition lawmakers said. “This is the biggest favor ever given by prosecutors to a suspect in this country,” Rep. Choo Mi-ae of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea said. The prosecutors said Monday that they secured seven boxes of documents from Cheong Wa Dae in their two-day raid, which was conducted without even entering the premise. Investigators, having been denied access to the offices of presidential aides, made requests for certain documents and Cheong Wa Dae provided them, they said.","opposition politicians tuesday cried foul ,politicians tuesday cried foul over ,politicians tuesday cried foul ,opposition politicians tuesday cried ,tuesday cried foul over the","['Choi ’s', 'Choi', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'Choi', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'Civil Affairs', 'Woo Byung - woo', 'Choi', 'Ahn Cheol', 'People ’s Party', 'Kim', 'Choi Jai - kyeong', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Woo', 'Choi ’s', 'Park', 'Choi ’s', 'Park Jie - won', 'the People ’s Party', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Choo Mi', 'Minjoo Party', 'Cheong', 'Cheong']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34595352  0.8067162

The ruling Saenuri Party convened an emergency meeting of senior members and agreed to recommend Park form a neutral Cabinet while reaffirming its demand for an across-the-board shake-up of Cheong Wa Dae staff. The session followed a Saturday gathering of core pro-Park legislators during which they explored ways for a sweeping personnel overhaul in the presidential palace and Cabinet.The decision came as the influence-peddling scandal involving her confidante Choi Soon-sil continues to unravel, fanning concerns over a possible government vacuum. Rep. Kim Sung-won “We urge the president to set up a neutral Cabinet that could be approved by the ruling and opposition parties and trusted by the people,” Saenuri spokesman Rep. Kim Sung-won told reporters, adding the prosecution should carry out a thorough probe into the scandal given the return home of the disgraced Choi. The neutral Cabinet concept has been gaining traction as leading opposition figures relay their proposals, including the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea’s previous head Moon Jae-in and the minor opposition People’s Party’s Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo. Senior ruling party members such as former Saenuri Chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung and Gyeonggi Province Gov. Nam Kyung-pil have also expressed support for the move. Other lawmakers and experts have floated a “premier with responsibilities” scheme intended to split the president’s administrative powers by ensuring the prime minister’s actual exercise of his right to nominate Cabinet members and recommend their dismissal as enshrined in the constitution.On the campaign trail in 2012, Park herself said she would empower the premiership as an election pledge. Yet she has given little authority to her prime ministers throughout her nearly four years in office, especially in personnel affairs. On Sunday, former Democratic Party Chairman Sohn Hak-kyu urged Park to designate a new premier and the rival parties to forge a coalition. “Even if the president would not make the request, the National Assembly ought to agree on a prime minister candidate and demand her nomination,” he said at an event to celebrate his new book in Gangjin County, South Jeolla Province. Earlier in the day, Minjoo Party Rep. Min Byung-doo offered to launch a campaign to collect 10 million signatures calling for the establishment of a neutral Cabinet, legislative action for prosecution reform and the minimization of presidential power until the scandal is cleared. “The ruling and opposition parties, in cooperation with other parts of civil society, should immediately begin consultations to set up a neutral Cabinet,” Min said in a text message to reporters. “While keeping her engagement in administration minimal until the Cabinet’s creation, the president should be prevented from exerting any influence in the investigation into the scandal.” But the plan poses challenges given persistent strife within the parliament and a seemingly limited pool of candidates who could win bipartisan endorsement. It could be a more time-consuming process than other options due to the scale of the entailed reshuffle and parliamentary and administrative tasks to follow. Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn also cast doubt over the idea during last week’s parliamentary session, saying, “It will likely result in a mere war of words with no progress in state management.”Among the names being mentioned for the new premiership or head Cabinet post are Sohn, former Minjoo Party interim chief Rep. Kim Chong-in, former Prime Minister Kim Hwang-sik and former Gyeonggi Province governor and lawmaker Rhee In-je. Park, for her part, held closed-door talks with some 10 senior members of civil society later in the day after meeting with eight elder Saenuri advisers Saturday, Cheong Wa Dae said. All of the 10 top presidential secretaries, including the embattled Ahn Chong-bum and Woo Byung-woo, tendered their resignations Saturday in line with Park’s instructions. Her Chief of Staff Lee Won-jong offered to step down last Wednesday, followed by her three closest aides, who are suspected to have been playing a bridging role between the president and Choi.

Park, the daughter of military strongman Park Chung-hee, lost her mother in 1974 to a bullet meant for her father. Five years later, her father was assassinated by his intelligence chief.   It was not the first time she has been on the hot seat for her relationship with the Choi family.  Throughout her political career, she has constantly fought lurid rumors regarding her ties to Choi’s father -- Choi Tae-min, a pseudo-Christian cult leader, who, according to a 2007 US embassy cable revealed by WikiLeaks, was rumored to “have complete control over her body and soul.”South Korean President Park Geun-hye Whenever someone raised questions about the elder Choi, Park reacted angrily. During the primary presidential race in 2007, she famously said those who made up such rumors “should be punished by the divine law.” Now that the Chois have become the cause of her biggest political crisis, many people can’t help but wonder: Why did the president maintain her relations with the Chois for all those years? What made the president so reluctant to cut her ties? Various theories abound in political circles, among the public and even among psychologists. One of them is that the Chois may have been like a family for Park, who spent most of her private life by herself. She has never married and has no family of her own, having been estranged from her younger siblings. “Her brother and sister are not her family members -- the Chois are her real family,” said Jun Yeo-ok, a former lawmaker who served Park as a spokesperson until their relationship soured in 2007. “Average people would have abandoned such family, but she kept them in heart.” The other theory is the president has been “mystified” by the elder Choi and her belief in him is religious, and therefore beyond logic. “It has been like how sorcery works,” said Chung Doo-un, a former three-term lawmaker from the president’s own Saenuri Party. “For Park, the elder Choi has been someone like a demigod, and I assume it is the case until now. I don’t think there is another way to explain such a relationship but this.”According to a media report earlier in the week, Park Ji-man had described the president as acting strangely, as if she was “hypnotized,” whenever talking about Choi Soon-sil. The conservation was reportedly with former Cheong Wa Dae official Park Gwan-chun, one of the first among Park’s aides to expose the alleged influence-peddling of Choi to the public.Kim Tae-hyung, a psychologist who published his own analysis of President Park in 2015, said Park, who lost her parents when she was young, has a “commitment issue,” and the childhood trauma has prompted her to rely too much on the Chois. “Psychologically speaking, I think the president was held hostage by the Chois,” said Kim. “I don’t think the president has the ability to address the crisis. Since they cannot help now, I’m afraid she may undergo a mental breakdown.” In his previous book, the psychologist compared the president to ancient leaders who ascended to power despite their lack of interest in politics. He noted that unlike other political leaders and her predecessors, she appeared to be indifferent to expanding power by herself. “Most politicians have wanted to assert themselves,” wrote Kim. “But President Park seems to act the other way around -- since she entered politics she has highlighted the fact she is done with her role. I think her being elected as president is not something she wants, but her supporters wanted.”  By Yeo Jun-suk","her tragic family history park ,chung hee lost her mother ,podium last week to apologize ,angrily during the primary presidential ,lost her mother in 1974","['Park Geun', 'Choi', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Choi', 'Choi ’s', 'Choi Tae - min', 'christian', 'US', 'korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Choi', 'Park', 'Chois', 'Park', 'Jun Yeo - ok', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Chung Doo - un', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Park Ji', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Cheong', 'Park Gwan - chun', 'Park ’s', 'Choi', 'Kim Tae - hyung', 'Park', 'Chois', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Park', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50982285  0.17754965

YonhapIn a text message sent to the press late on Friday night, presidential spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk announced that the president ordered her senior staff to submit their resignation and that a reshuffle of the presidential office will take place shortly.The resignation en masse would include Presidential Chief of Staff Lee Won-jong, Senior Secretary for Policy Coordination An Chong-bum and Senior Presidential Secretary for Civil Affairs Woo Byung-woo.An and Woo have maintained their posts all along, despite their frequent involvement in the queue of corruption disputes which finally traced back to Choi Soon-sil, whose extensive political influence-rigging has recently been revealed.Speculations had built up earlier on Friday as Park suddenly cancelled a pre-set luncheon with members of the Presidential Committee for Unification Preparation. She met instead with Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, chairman of the ruling Saenuri Party and one of her closest political aides, to discuss the course of action.Floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk, too, met with the president in a separate session in which he vowed for the mass resignation of the party’s leadership, unless Cheong Wa Dae takes gestures of “sweeping reform.”But no tangible actions were taken during the day, while the spokesperson and the senior secretary for public affairs merely said that the president was “contemplating” various options.What pushed the embattled state leader to make the last-minute decision is the worst-ever approval ratings as revealed by the recent series of public polls, especially the unseen drop among the stronghold cluster -- voters residing in the conservative-leaning Daegu-North Gyeongsang belt, senior citizens aged 06 or more, and supporters of the ruling Saenuri Party.A nationwide survey conducted by local pollster Gallop Korea on Tuesday-Thursday this week, only 17 percent of the respondents gave positive appraisal of the president’s state management, down 8 percent from the previous week.The regional figure for the Daegu-North Gyeongsang region stood at 27 percent, and the per age figure for the 60s and older group crushed to 36 percent, falling below the 50 percent line for the first time since Park’s inauguration.During the two days following Park’s “apology” to the nation, the given figures were even lower. Only 14 percent of the respondents’ pool thought positively of Park, indicating that the public did not embrace the president’s response to the scandal.But a mere reshuffle of presidential staff, excluding the direct liability of the president, is not a sufficient solution, the opposition political circles and a number of civic groups continued to claim.“ came four days after the first report broke out on Choi’s state affairs manipulation, which was way too late considering the public’s fury over this unheard-of scandal,” said the party’s chief spokesperson Rep. Youn Kwan-suk through a statement.Floor spokesperson Rep. Ki Dong-min added that Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn should be replaced to give way to a new Cabinet leadership that may win back the public’s trust.The Saenuri, while welcoming the president’s “determination,” also called for more radical actions, such as replacing the disputed secretaries who allegedly were involved in delivering confidential state documents to the disputed presidential aide.Calls grew especially from the so-called non-Park faction that the party should take more preemptive measures to distance itself from the scandal, which is sure to push away supporters ahead of the by-election and the presidential election next year.“The party should come up with countermeasures, including the possibility of establishing an emergency committee, if only to overcome this unbelievable situation,” said Rep. Choung Byoung-gug.Meanwhile, a number of civic groups suggested earlier in the week to hold a candlelight rally in Gwanghwamun Square on Saturday evening, calling for the president's additional apology and resignation.By Bae Hyun-jung","friday night presidential spokesperson jung ,pollster gallop korea on tuesday ,friday as park suddenly cancelled ,friday night presidential spokesperson ,demand for park resignation president","['Park Geun', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'Jung Youn', 'Lee Won - jong', 'Policy Coordination', 'Chong', 'Civil Affairs Woo Byung - woo', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Park', 'the Presidential Committee for Unification Preparation', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'Cheong', 'Dae', 'Daegu - North Gyeongsang', 'Saenuri Party', 'Gallop Korea', 'Daegu - North Gyeongsang', 'Park ’s', 'Park', 'Choi ’s', 'Youn Kwan - suk', 'Ki Dong - min', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Cabinet', 'Saenuri', 'non - park', 'Choung Byoung', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47979251  0.62619364

Despite being an age-old tradition in many western countries, Halloween is a new phenomenon here. Once mainly been celebrated by party-loving youngsters and expats in Hongdae or Itaewon, it has more recently found a new audience -- kindergartens. “Traditional holidays in Korea are rather formal and rigid and may be a little heavy for children. Halloween parties can be a fun opportunity for kids to try out different costumes and culture,” Kwon Jeong-yun, a child education professor at Sungshin Women’s University in Seoul said in a phone interview. Halloween has its roots in Celtic Ireland during the celebration of seasonal change and harvest. The idea of donning a costume came about from the myth that during this time the worlds of the living and dead were at their closest and it was feared that ghosts would try to possess human bodies. In order to confuse the ghouls people would wear masks. While the myth behind it may have died, the idea of dressing up remains. Children dressed in Halloween costumes Halloween celebrations at kindergartens first started with English-immersive institutions, but more regular schools are now incorporating it into the yearly calendar, viewing it as a fun event that can introduce kids to another culture.Unfortunately, it seems that in Korea’s hyper-competitive society where devoted mothers can apparently do everything, Halloween parties can bring out rivalry. “Does this look ok? I bought a cheap wizard gown last year and my child did not stand out at all in the picture,” a mother posted in a local online mother’s community in Dongtan, Gyeonggi Province. Instead of it being a fun day for kids, mothers feel under pressure to buy expensive costumes, kindergarten teachers said. There have even been complaints by some mothers because they feel that their costume choice will reflect their financial status. The cost of a costume can vary from 10,000 won to over 100,000 won.For young parents, this new festival is greeted with interest and worry. Some think that just as Valentines’ Day here has become a big season for buying chocolate and candy, Halloween is driven mainly by marketing. “It is definitely not a Korean tradition at all. My daughter’s kindergarten held a Halloween party last year but some parents complained and now they don’t do it anymore,” said Shin Sae-young, a 38-year-old mother from Gwangju. “I also do not see the point of celebrating it. It is a trend created by companies.”Some kindergartens have moved to take the pressure off mothers by banning any preparation. “We told parents not to prepare makeup and clothes, because it is a burden on them. We will do face painting and provide costumes at the kindergarten,” said An Hae-jin, a teacher at an English hagwon in Cheonan, South Chungcheong Province.  Experts point out that the day is not just about costumes but is related to religion and culture. “It is important to properly explain and teach the background of the foreign tradition,” professor Kwon said.“It is, in part, an anti-religious event. In the US, schools give guidelines on the dress codes to prohibit offensive costumes and also gives the option either to send or not send the kids to school for Christian families. Such guidelines can be applied,” she said.

Other polls, released after the scandal broke Monday, all signaled a weakening of Park’s core support base -- namely in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province as well as the over-60 age group. A series of media reports have indicated that Choi -- who is also the daughter of Park’s late mentor Choi Tae-min -- received reports on presidential documents, including those containing top secret military and diplomatic information. The Realmeter survey also indicated that the public deemed Park’s apology Tuesday as insufficient. On how Park should “take responsibility” for the Choi fiasco, 42 percent of respondents called for Park to resign or be impeached, while 21.5 percent demanded a Cabinet and presidential staff reshuffle. This was followed by Park leaving the ruling Saenuri Party and a public apology, at 17.8 percent and 10.6 percent, respectively. The scandal saw even Park’s most loyal voter groups turning away from her. During the 2012 presidential election, over 80 percent of those who voted in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province picked Park as the next leader, but the weekly approval rating in the region also fell to reach an all-time low of 35.4 percent.The disapproval rating for the over-60 age group -- 54.9 percent -- surpassed the approval rating -- 42.7 percent -- for the first time. The same trend held true for the conservative group with approval and disapproval at 42.2 percent and 53 percent, respectively.Traditionally anti-Park liberals only showed 10.1 percent of approval for her, while 15.8 percent of nonpartisan respondents showed support.By Yoon Min-sik","park apology tuesday as insufficient ,after the scandal broke monday ,17 percent survey showed thursday ,public deemed park apology tuesday ,35 percent the disapproval rating","['Park Geun - hye', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Park ’s', 'Daegu', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'Choi', 'Park', 'Choi Tae - min', 'Park ’s', 'Choi', 'Park', 'Cabinet', 'Park', 'Saenuri Party', 'Daegu', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'Park', 'Yoon Min - sik']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.25532621  0.58513057

After the death of her mother, Park's father, former President Park Chung-hee, was killed by his own spy chief in 1979.""As I know well what is in Park's mind and heart, I helped her find the right words to express herself. I did not know the materials were confidential,"" Choi told the paper, adding that her involvement came out of a wish to lend assistance.When asked when she received the presidential documents, Choi said she cannot clearly remember, but admitted getting e-mails after Park was elected in 2012.On allegation she received printed materials or got them through tablet PCs, Choi said she only got them through e-mails.""I do not have a tablet PC, let alone know how to use one. I think the report of the leaks came from someone else's device,""Choi said. A local broadcaster broke the story after it retrieved data from an abandoned tablet PC at Choi old office in Seoul.Choi then denied allegation she was involved in the Mir Foundation and the K-Sports Foundation. South Korean media have been citing claims she was deeply involved in the foundations which collected huge donations from conglomerates, and that the money was funneled to Choi. ""I can take poison and die here,"" Choi said, stressing she is innocent of the charges raised. ""I am too exhausted and reporters have made us into criminals.""Choi said she came to Germany to ""protect"" her daughter, adding the two are being used as pawns in political intrigue.Choi's daughter is also embroiled in speculations that she was unfairly accepted to Seoul-based Ewha Womans University. Some of the university's students argued that Choi's daughter received relatively higher grades compared to her actual achievements.On prospects of her returning home Choi said her poor health prevented her from traveling at present.  ""I am suffering from a nervous breakdown and I have been diagnosed with heart issues,"" Choi said. ""If I recover, I will ask for forgiveness, and will accept punishment if I did anything wrong.""Justice Minister Kim Hyun-woong said the ministry is taking all necessary measures to bring Choi back home, adding it is also ""considering"" the suspension of Choi's passport.""We have an obligation to keep information confidential in terms of judicial cooperation ,"" Kim said. ""Although we cannot provide details, we are working closely with out counterparts."" The minister also said the majority of legal experts do not consider Park as being subject to an investigation. When asked if there will be any search conducted on the presidential office, Kim added it will seek ""appropriate"" measures in line with the outcomes of the investigation. South Korea's ruling and opposition parties continued to express concern over the mounting allegations. Rep. Kim Moo-sung, the former head of the ruling Saenuri Party, who had a falling out with Park, said being sick is not an excuse to stay in Germany, adding she must promptly return home for investigation.Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, the former head of the minor People's Party who is considered a liberal presidential candidate, called for reducing the authority of the president, while suggesting a new prime minister should take the lead in normalizing state affairs.Both the ruling and opposition parties already agreed to call for a special prosecutor to look into all allegations raised.Amid the on-going allegation, Park's approval rate crashed.According to the survey conducted by major pollster Real Meter, Park's approval rate came to 17.5 percent on Wednesday, marking the lowest rate since she took office.More than 40 percent of the respondents asked for Park's impeachment or resignation, while 21.5 percent said there must be a personnel reshuffle at the presidential office. Amid the mounting allegations, lawmakers supporting a constitutional revision said the discussion must be pushed forward.They said the scandal should be considered a milestone as it proved the negative aspects of having a president with excessive authority.""The Constitution must be changed so that we can alter the entire system related to state affairs to prevent another Choi scandal,"" Kim Moo-sung said. ""After South Korea adopted a single five-year term system, six presidents had relatives arrested, while five of them left their parties,"" Kim said. ""As the winner takes everything in the current authoritative presidential system, there has been discord in every state affair, especially since failure by the opposition to challenge the president could make it hard to take the presidency in the next election.""Rep. Kim Boo-kyum of the Minjoo Party agreed that the scandal proves the weakness of the system, adding there must be a ""revolutionary"" revision to protect the people from those with political, economic and social power.","mother park father former president ,six presidents had relatives arrested ,presidents had relatives arrested while ,political intrigue choi daughter ,daughter of park late mentor","['Choi Soon - sil', 'Park Geun', 'Choi', 'Germany', ""South Korea 's"", 'Segye Times', 'Park', 'Park', 'Park', 'Choi Tae - min', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Yook Young', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Park', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Seoul', 'Choi', 'the Mir Foundation', 'the K - Sports Foundation', 'south korean', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Germany', 'Choi', 'Seoul', 'Ewha Womans University', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Kim Hyun - woong', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Kim', 'Kim', ""South Korea 's"", 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park', 'Germany', 'Ahn Cheol', ""People 's Party"", 'Park', 'Real Meter', 'Park', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'South Korea', 'Kim', 'Kim Boo - kyum', 'the Minjoo Party']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.7748186   0.59378797

President Park admitted to sharing her presidential speech scripts with Choi, who the president described as “someone who had helped” during Park’s presidential bid in 2012. She described her consultations with Choi as an act done “out of pure heart to be meticulous” in preparing her speeches. “There are so many things to be proved and such a short apology is insufficient,” said Minjoo spokesperson Rep. Lee Jae-jung. “It is nothing but the same tactics used by the president to avoid communicating with the public about serious cases.” While the ruling Saenuri Party offered “deep regret” over the scandal following the president’s apology, some moderate Saenuri members echoed the criticism that Park’s explanation was not enough to prove her innocence. Rep. Choo Mi-ae, chairwoman of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea, holds a press conference at the National Assembly in Seoul on Tuesday. “I believe that she has offered zero explanation about wrongdoings,” said former Saenuri floor leader Rep. Yoo Seung-min, who had clashed with the president over her welfare policies. “I don’t think the president’s apology is enough to wrap up the scandal. More investigation is needed.” The political parties demanded prompt investigation into the allegation -- raised by cable TV channel JTBC on Monday -- that Cheong Wa Dae had leaked confidential presidential speeches to Choi, who was also allegedly involved in abusing her power to fund dubious government entities by raising money from conglomerates Opposition parties’ presidential hopefuls, Moon Jae-in of the Minjoo Party and Ahn Cheol-soo of the People’s Party, adopted a more assertive tone. While Moon denounced the scandal for disrupting the national system, Ahn demanded the president herself face investigation and her Cabinet members resign en mass. The pressure on the president is expected to derail Park’s efforts to amend the current Constitution that she described as currently “unfit” for South Korea. The revision requires approval by two-thirds of the 300-member National Assembly and majority support in a referendum. “If the allegations are true, President Park should come forward and explain herself,” said Saenuri floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk. “We need to find out how Choi Soon-sil has been abusing her power to misguide this country.” Saenuri also appeared in disarray over the proposed Constitutional amendment. Though the party began working-level discussions over Constitutional amendment Tuesday, its leadership struggled to bring focus to revision of the basic law. Some Saenuri lawmakers, most of whom belong to the group outside the faction close to President Park, urged the government to name special prosecutors to investigate Choi, whose whereabouts are still unknown since she allegedly moved to Germany.But some members from the pro-Park faction, such as Saenuri leader Rep. Lee Jun-hyun, appeared to defend the president by saying, “I have also relied on my friends’ help when writing speeches.” Lee served as Park’s senior presidential secretary between 2012 and 2013.While ratcheting up their attacks against the president over the scandal, the opposition parties vowed to block the president’s attempt to amend the Constitution and denounced the move as an attempt to divert the public’s attention. “It is an attempt to cover up the snowballing scandal,” said Minjoo leader Rep. Choo Mi-ae during the party’s emergency meeting Tuesday “I don’t think there is anyone in this country who wants to trust such a president with revising the basic law.” By Yeo Jun-suk","the president over the scandal ,leaked confidential presidential speeches ,scandal following the president apology ,president over the scandal ,had leaked confidential presidential speeches","['Park Geun', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'People ’s Party', 'Park ’s', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Minjoo', 'Lee Jae - jung', 'Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri', 'Park ’s', 'Choo Mi - ae', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'the National Assembly', 'Seoul', 'Saenuri', 'Yoo Seung - min', 'Choi', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Ahn Cheol', 'the People ’s Party', 'Moon', 'Ahn', 'Cabinet', 'Park ’s', 'South Korea', 'National Assembly', 'Park', 'Saenuri', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'Choi soon - sil', 'Saenuri', 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Germany', 'Saenuri', 'Lee Jun - hyun', 'Lee', 'Park ’s', 'Minjoo', 'Choo Mi -', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.31019253  0.31902522

The budget review kicks off this week with President Park Geun-hye addressing the Assembly on Monday and the lawmakers inquiring Prime Minister and Finance Minister later in the week. Parliamentary committees, meanwhile, are to begin their month-long review session on Tuesday. Minjoo Party’s chief policy strategist Rep. Yoon Ho-jung  on Sunday explains the party‘s plan to review 2017 budget. But the prospect of passing the bill by Dec. 2, a legal deadline set by a parliamentary law otherwise known as “National Assembly Advancement Act,” remains grim as the opposition-dominated legislature poses challenges upon government-proposed budget bills.“Neither the ruling party nor opposition bloc can seize a sweeping victory during the budget battle,” said Rep. Kim Hyun-mee, lawmaker of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea and chairperson of the Assembly’s Special Committee on Budget and Accounts.Over the past two years, yearly budget bills have cleared the Assembly before the deadline as the Saenuri, based on the advancement law, put the bill to a plenary floor vote, even without opposition approval. Now holding 129 out of the 300 parliamentary seats, the ruling party is no longer capable of meeting the required three-fifths quorum.At the core of the budget battle is the debate on whether to raise the corporate tax rate. Since the previous Lee Myung-bak administration lowered the tax rate from 25 to 22 percent in 2009, opposition lawmakers have been working to bring the rate back to its previous level of 25 percent. It is the claim of the Minjoo and People’s Party that the 2009 tax cut had offered benefits only to a limited number of top-tier conglomerates, not to the nation‘s economy in general. They also argued that more taxes are needed to implement the pending state-led welfare policies. But Saenuri lawmakers and some business groups countered that the tax hike would hamper the government’s effort to jumpstart the nation’s faltering businesses, describing that the measure is “global trend” shared by advanced economies aiming to boost their economies. The escalating tax battle is expected to depend upon the position taken by the Assembly Speaker Rep. Chung Sye-kyun. The top legislator has an authority to designate the auxiliary bills to the state budget bill.“Given that corporate tax plays an important part in tax system, I believe that it is eligible as an auxiliary bill,” Chung told reporters last week, alluding his approval for the move.Should the former Minjoo lawmaker maintain his view, the motion to reinstate the former corporate tax rate may directly be put to a full floor vote, without committee-level reviews.Chung had clashed with Saenuri lawmaker over his decision to allow the passage of a motion asking for the dismissal of Agriculture Minister Kim Jae-soo over ethical lapses. Angered by the move, Saenuri leadership boycotted the state audit for days, calling for Chung’s resignation.By Yeo Jun-suk","long review session on tuesday ,session on tuesday minjoo party ,two years yearly budget bills ,addressing the assembly on monday ,sunday explains the party plan","['the National Assembly', 'Park Geun', 'Assembly', 'Minjoo Party ’s', 'Yoon Ho - jung', 'National Assembly Advancement Act', 'Kim Hyun - mee', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'the Assembly ’s Special Committee on Budget and Accounts', 'Assembly', 'Saenuri', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'People ’s Party', 'Saenuri', 'Assembly', 'Chung Sye - kyun', 'Chung', 'Minjoo', 'Chung', 'Saenuri', 'Agriculture', 'Kim Jae -', 'Saenuri', 'Chung ’s', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43208078 -0.01419838

It is well on the way to becoming not just a nuclear power, but a power that is able to deliver a nuclear missile,” she was quoted as saying.The remark is the latest in a series of warnings in the US of the seriousness of the North Korea problem in the wake of Pyongyang’s fifth nuclear test last month. That blast, together with ceaseless missile tests, sparked geunine fears that Pyongyang is making real progress in developing nuclear missiles.Over the past week alone, the North twice tested its Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missile believed to be capable of reaching the US territory of Guam. Both tests failed as the missile exploded shortly after take-off.“Musadan could probably hit Guam, but the next larger rocket would probably be able to hit the US,” Miscik was quoted as saying. “The fact these rocket launches are failing shouldn’t give anyone comfort, because they’re not failing for the same reason -- they fail and they fix that thing, and it might fail for another reason, but they’re advancing in terms of their capability.”She said that the true threat to the US will come when North Korea figures out how to successfully launch a missile into space, re-enter the atmosphere, and hit its target, although noting this has yet to happen, according to the magazine.A North Korea missile “could hit the continental United States at some point,” Miscik said.She said the U.S. should work “very closely and privately with China” to rein in the North.“I think the Chinese, Americans, South Korea, and Japan need to work together to figure out what to do about North Korea ... You want to shut down their ability to carry out their intentions,” she said, according to the magazine.","problem for the next president ,pyongyang fifth nuclear test last ,north korea will be huge ,missile tests sparked geunine fears ,interview with the fortune magazine","['WASHINGTON', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'US', 'Jami Miscik', 'CIA', 'Fortune', 'US', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'US', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'musudan', 'US', 'Guam', 'Guam', 'US', 'Miscik', 'US', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'United States', 'Miscik', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Chinese', 'Americans', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'North Korea']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.74233663  0.90100718

You know how you try to hold it in, but sometimes feel like you’ve had enough and are about to explode? I felt I would explode someday, which is why I came here,” he said.Having joined the Army in 1987 right out of high school, Yeom said he was under a lot of stress as a sergeant major, caught between conscripted soldiers and ranking officers. In 2014, he ended 27 years of service in the military and retired to a tiny rural town in Myeongji-ri, Gangwon Province, where he would lead a quiet, stress-free life, far removed from the social hierarchy and peer competition of his previous life. Yeom joined an increasing number of city dwellers trading urban life for the countryside. The fad is called “gwinong” here, which roughly translates to “return to agriculture.”According to the state-run information center on gwinong , there are currently 11,959 households in the countryside made up of families who moved from cities. About 18.6 percent dwell in North Gyeongsang Province, followed by South Jeolla and South Gyeongsang provinces at 15.6 percent and 13.5 percent, respectively.But rural life is no picnic, the third-year farmer pointed out.“If you decide  in a certain area, you need all the information you can get. In the past, people didn’t need a lot of money to start farming. But this is not the case, now,” he said. He moved to the rural home with 200 million won . Most of the money went to buying his humble plot of 3,322 square meters and building a house. His military pension helped him get through the next couple of years, when he lacked immediate income.“Farming in the fields hardly pays enough to make a living when you are an amateur,” he said, revealing his total net income from vegetable farming last year was about 2 million won.  Yeom also grows vegetable at his farm in Myeongji-ri, Gangwon Province. This year, he is trying new things, including growing oyster mushrooms indoors. He found that for an amateur farmer like him, the controlled environment of the greenhouse is much better, enabling him to make more money with less effort.“For the first year here, my goal was to make 10 million won in farming. It looks like this year I will be able to exceed that goal by 2 million,” Yeom said. He plans to build another greenhouse for the mushrooms on spare land, which is expected to triple the profit.Still, it will hardly be a bonanza, but Yeom says money is not the main issue when the quality of life is satisfying. “I can work when I want, sleep when I want. We have a beach and a valley just a few minutes away,” he said. Also sitting just a stone’s throw away from his home is Seoraksan, the province’s most popular tourist attraction.The neighborhood of Myeongji-ri is another reason he feels life is more fulfilling here. In cities, people rarely interact with neighbors, but that is not the case in rural communities, he said. “We help each other out when there’s some work to be done. When you first move, it definitely helps to participate whenever there’s a town event, because it helps them get a good impression of you,” he said.Rural life, however, is not for everyone, he pointed out. Sometimes the inconvenience and hardship can be too much, which is why he recommends potential movers to get some real experience before actually making the move.On Wednesday, he had two guests from cities who are looking to move to the countryside. They came to see what it was like to live there. One of them said he used to run a Japanese restaurant and made up to 200 million won a month. Another was a 33-year-old man who was quickly growing weary of city life.“A part of me thought that 33 was too early. But then again, maybe starting early is a good thing because it would help him get settled early,” Yeom said.With growing interest in rural life among Koreans, there has also been an increasing number of swindlers targeting them.Last week, police busted a crime ring that swindled 12.4 billion won from 1,300 people by luring them with high profits.“Farming is not something you make a ton of money with. Don’t expect a jackpot when you come here. And when you decide on what you want to do, stick to it.“And finally, get all the information and experience you can. Even if you don’t end up cultivating that specific crop, you can at least learn a thing or two,” said Yeom. By Yoon Min-sik /","picnic the third year farmer ,the dream now mushroom farmer ,mushroom farmer the former soldier ,last week police busted crime ,greenhouse mushroom farming it stress","['Yeom Deok - gi', 'South Korea ’s', 'Yeom', 'Army', 'Yeom', 'Gangwon Province', 'Yeom', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'South Jeolla', 'South Gyeongsang', 'Yeom', 'Gangwon Province', 'Yeom', 'Yeom', 'Seoraksan', 'Myeongji - ri', 'japanese', 'Yeom', 'Koreans', 'Yeom', 'Yoon Min - sik']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27773902  0.33461428

Park's approval rating fell to a record low of 26 percent in a survey released Friday by the local pollster Gallup Korea.Park first met with officials and employees at an industrial-academic convergence district within the Gumi National Industrial Complex, located 261 kilometers southeast of Seoul, to offer her encouragement. In particular, she visited KAIDEA, a 3-D printer developer, and VM e-Korea, an electric bicycle manufacturer, in the district.Formed in 2014, the district is now home to some 50 research institutes and four universities, and has emerged as a key model for industrial-academic collaboration, which the Park government has been pushing to expand to help create jobs, find new growth engines and revitalize the economy.Over the last three years, some 19 industrial-academic collaborative projects have been carried out in the sprawling district with scores of students having participated in these projects. Of these students, some 77 have landed jobs within the Gumi industrial complex.The president, then, toured the smart factory of Mooryong Co., a high-tech firm specializing in the surface treatment of auto parts and mobile phones cases.Her government, in cooperation with local businesses, has been striving to introduce automated smart factories to enhance the quality of products, cut production costs, and streamline and speed up the manufacturing process.Mooryong is one of the leading companies in the introduction of smart factories. It has invested 14.1 billion won  over the last six years to refurbish its manufacturing facilities and make them fully automated.In Gumi, Park also attended the ground-breaking ceremony for a factory of Toray Advanced Materials Korea Inc., an affiliate of Japan's Toray Industries Inc., which specializes in the production of chemical materials.During the ceremony, Park stressed the importance of developing the materials industry to respond more actively to the fourth industrial revolution -- the fast-paced transformation linked to the fusion of various cutting-edge technologies such as big data and artificial intelligence.The ceremony was attended by some 500 people, including Akihiro Nikkaku, the president of the Japanese firm, workers and top officials from the local governments of North Gyeongsang Province and Gumi City. Toray currently runs a dozen factories in South Korea, and has invested 3.7 trillion won into the Asian country. After the groundbreaking ceremony, Park visited a traditional market in the city to meet with vendors and citizens.There, she expressed her goal of increasing support for traditional markets whose sales have been waning in the face of large-scale discount stores.","wednesday in her latest move ,local pollster gallup korea park ,after the groundbreaking ceremony park ,local economy her provincial tour ,asian country after the groundbreaking","['Park Geun', 'Gumi', 'Gumi', 'Park', 'Gallup Korea', 'the Gumi National Industrial Complex', 'Seoul', 'KAIDEA', 'Gumi', 'Mooryong Co.', 'Mooryong', 'Gumi', 'Park', 'Toray Advanced Materials Korea Inc.', 'Japan', 'Toray Industries Inc.', 'Park', 'Akihiro Nikkaku', 'japanese', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'Gumi City', 'South Korea', 'asian', 'Park']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39695615  0.72601718

""In the rebalance's second phase ... the Pentagon is continuing to place some of our best military personnel in the region and deploying some of our most advanced capabilities there.

Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and Defense Minister Han Min-koo will join US Secretary of State John Kerry and Defense Secretary Ash Carter in Wednesday's ""two plus two"" talks, a biennial gathering designed mainly to demonstrate the firmness of the alliance and discuss strategies to deal with the North.The meeting comes just a few days after the communist nation carried out a banned test Saturday of a Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missile, believed to be capable of reaching the US territory of Guam, about a month after its fifth nuclear test.The test was unsuccessful as the missile exploded shortly after take-off, but the launch still showed how committed the North is to developing nuclear-armed, long-range missiles. Officials and experts have warned Pyongyang could keep conducting nuclear and missile tests in coming months.Wednesday's talks are expected to focus on ways to strengthen the US ""extended deterrence"" protection of South Korea and to ramp up pressure and sanctions on Pyongyang, including through a strong new U.N. Security Council sanctions resolution and unilateral sanctions of their own.""Extended deterrence"" refers to the threat of nuclear retaliation to deter attacks on allies. The US has provided extended deterrence or a ""nuclear umbrella"" to South Korea after withdrawing nuclear warheads from the country in the early 1990s.""We will discuss comprehensive strategies to deal with North Korean threats. In particular, we're going to have in-depth discussions on ways to specify and institutionalize extended deterrence, which is a key element in the US security commitment to South Korea,"" Yun told reporters during a joint visit with Han to the Korean War Veterans Memorial in Washington.Yun also said the two sides will discuss ways to maximize effects of sanctions on the North.On Thursday, the two sides are scheduled to hold annual defense ministers talks, known as the Security Consultative Meeting , where Han and Carter are expected to discuss detailed ""extended deterrence"" measures, possibly including permanently deploying US ""strategic assets"" in the South, such as nuclear-capable B-52 and B-1B bombers, F-22 stealth fighter jets and nuclear-powered submarines.""In the SCM talks, we will jointly assess North Korea's threats and the situation in the North ... and discuss ways to guarantee the implementation of extended deterrence, including the US nuclear umbrella, so as to cope with North Korea's nuclear and missile threats,"" Han told reporters during the visit to the war memorial.The US has temporarily sent such strategic assets to South Korea as a show of force in the wake of the North's two nuclear tests in January and September, but perceptions have grown among South Koreans that such one-off missions are not enough at a time of unprecedented threats from the North.Permanent deployment of such military hardware is expected to reassure South Koreans of the US defense commitment amid heightened security jitters that sparked calls for developing the country's own nuclear weapons or bringing US nuclear bombs back into the country. Such sophisticated weapons would also serve as a strong warning against the North.In the SCM talks, the two sides are also expected to check on progress in efforts to deploy the US THAAD missile defense system in the South, while reaffirming that the deployment is aimed only at defending against North Korean threats and poses no threats to China and other countries.","washington on tuesday for security ,korea after withdrawing nuclear warheads ,hold annual defense ministers talks ,two nuclear tests in january ,arrived in washington on tuesday","[""South Korea 's"", 'Washington', 'US', 'North Korea', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Defense', 'Han Min - koo', 'US', 'State', 'John Kerry', 'Defense', 'Ash Carter', 'musudan', 'US', 'Guam', 'Pyongyang', 'US', 'South Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'U.N.

Woo Byung-woo (Yonhap)“The given repor...","Controversy on a corruption scandal-ridden top presidential aide resurfaced Monday, with Cheong Wa Dae once again denying rumors on his imminent dismissal and gesturing at continuing their back-scratching relationship.This time, it was a report by an influential daily which said the exit of Senior Presidential Secretary for Civil Affairs Woo Byung-woo is just around the corner. Woo Byung-woo “The given report is completely false,” presidential spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk told reporters, referring to JoongAng Ilbo’s exclusive report which claimed that President Park Geun-hye has made up her mind to replace the civil affairs chief. “I understand that the president made the decision  so as to break through the political crisis ,” the newspaper said, quoting a ranking official of the ruling Saenuri Party.The anonymous party official suggested the measure is likely to take place within the week, shortly before the parliamentary House Steering Committee’s state audit on the presidential office on Friday.The growing speculation on Woo’s impending expulsion gained further momentum as the Blue House suddenly called off the president’s planned meeting with senior secretaries on Monday morning.“The meeting will be put off, due to internal reasons,” spokesperson Jung said.Asked about the reason for the cancellation, he said “there is no special reason to pay attention to it,” adding that such rescheduling has happened before.Instead of meeting with her top officials, the president will focus on seeking solutions to “serious pending problems,” such as North Korea’s nuclear provocations and the nation’s economic situation, he said. As for the suspected connection between the sudden cancellation and the alleged plan to replace Woo, the official refuted it, accusing the daily of false reporting.While denying the dismissal rumor, Cheong Wa Dae continued to hold its ground on not sending the disputed senior presidential secretary as a witness in the state audit, citing “common practices.”In contrast to the presidential office’s thorough defense of Woo, the Saenuri camp has recently gestured at summoning him as witness, hoping to make progress in the political stalemate and to gain an upper hand over the opposition.“I personally hope that  will show up , even for just an hour or two,” the Saenuri floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk told reporters Monday.“The reason that senior presidential secretaries were spared from past audits was because rival parties reached a consensus on it, which is not the case this time.”Having reconfirmed the Blue House’s move not to displace Woo, the opposition camp geared up on its calls for a thorough investigation into the extensive corruption charges circling around the disputed aide.“There is a plot to smother state affairs scandals and to silence opposition lawmakers, and at the heart of it is Woo,” said Rep. Choo Mi-ae, chief of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea at a party meeting.“Under the National Assembly Act, Woo should by all means attend the state audit session as a witness.”Minjoo kicked off a special task force on Monday to dig into the allegations that presidential confidants, including Woo, had exerted pressure upon the prosecution to intensively crack down on opposition lawmakers.Since July this year, Woo has been under fire for a series of allegations, which started off from the suggestion that he had covert ties with key figures of high-profile corruption cases.His scandal later expanded to a larger controversy on the existence of an “invisible political manipulator” group, including not only Woo, but also Choi Soon-sil, a mystery confidant to President Park.The daughter of Park’s late mentor Choi Tae-min and the ex-wife of Park’s former aide Jeong Yun-hoe, Choi is suspected to have influence-peddled in various organizations by using her close ties with the state leader.By Bae Hyun-jung","top presidential aide resurfaced monday ,corruption scandal ridden top presidential ,completely false presidential spokesperson jung ,scandal ridden top presidential aide ,presidential aide resurfaced monday","['Civil Affairs Woo Byung - woo', 'Woo Byung - woo', 'Jung Youn', 'JoongAng Ilbo ’s', 'Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'House Steering Committee ’s', 'Woo ’s', 'the Blue House', 'Jung', 'North Korea ’s', 'Woo', 'Saenuri', 'Saenuri', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'the Blue House ’s', 'Choo Mi', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'the National Assembly Act', 'Woo', 'Woo', 'Woo', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Park', 'Park', 'Choi Tae - min', 'Park ’s', 'Jeong Yun - hoe', 'Choi', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43489933  0.34605941

She has also been widely talked about as the top candidate for defense secretary under a Clinton White House.Flournoy tamped down calls for an early reopening of negotiations with the North.""Negotiations are a waste of time unless you have those  signals from them,"" she said.When it comes to dealing with Pyongyang, Flournoy said that all options are on the table, including pre-emptive military action, adding that pre-emptive action is even in the UN charter when talking about self-defense against imminent threats.Still, however, the focus should be on strengthening sanctions, she said.""I think all options would be on the table, but the focus of our policy should be to try to put through sanctions and other pressure, get the leadership to come back to the negotiating table and make good on their earlier promises of denuclearization,"" Flournoy said.She stressed that sanctions on Pyongyang should include cutting off energy supplies to the North and restricting trade along the long North Korean-Chinese border. She said the US should engage China seriously to have it enforce sanctions to rein in the recalcitrant neighbor.""We know that there is illicit activity going on right now that is already in violation of existing sanctions and much of that is coming through China,"" she said. ""We need to engage China to get them to try to be more serious about enforcing existing sanctions, let alone future sanctions on their own soil.""Last month, the US imposed sanctions on a Chinese company for providing the North with ""dual-use"" items that can be used in nuclear and missile development. It was the first time the US has ever sanctioned a Chinese firm with regard to Pyongyang's weapons programs.Flournoy said that such sanctions will continue.""We are trying to ensure that the sanctions are actually implemented and enforced.

Clinton has also said repeatedly during her campaign that alliances are a ""source of strength"" that makes the US safer.""I think most Americans, most members of Congress, most presidential candidates understand that in a very complex dynamic security environment we gain a great deal from having strong allies with shared interests and shared values who are willing to work alongside us to create stability and security,"" Flournoy said.Flournoy, currently CEO of the Center for a New American Security, a major think tank in Washington, is scheduled to visit South Korea early next week with a group of next-generation leaders from the think tank.

Lee Jung-hyun.Chung, who is originally from the Minjoo Party of Korea, effectively fueled the controversy when he was heard in a voice recording saying that the ruling party should not ""ask for something for free,"" indicating the speaker may have wanted to utilize the dismissal motion to induce Saenuri to make concessions on other issues that are important to the opposition. While the ruling party eventually ended the protest a week afterward, the repercussions continued throughout the later parts of the audit as the parties engaged in existing and new political wrangling rather than bringing key issues important to the people and the country to the table.Saenuri blamed the opposition parties for the deadlock at the National Assembly, adding they only focused efforts on criticizing President Park Geun-hye, aimed at gathering support ahead of the presidential race in 2017.""The parliament must accept the public's criticism that the audit only focused on the upcoming presidential election and ignored the livelihoods of the people,"" Rep. Kim Gwang-lim of Saenuri said.The opposition bloc, however, said they were unable to roll out proper audit proceedings due to the tie between Saenuri and the presidential office.For one, opposition parties have been claiming that Cheong Wa Dae is suspected of being involved in raising some 80 billion won  in funding for the controversial Mir and K-Sports foundations from the country's major conglomerates. The foundations were created to promote cultural content that can contribute to national economic growth. The debate surrounding the transparency of such foundations hindered lawmakers from handling other issues, political pundits said.Throughout the weeks of the regular audit, lawmakers were criticized for making hasty accusations.Rep. Park Jie-won of the People's Party had announced that the country's spy agency has been taking steps to prepare Park's retirement home, which was later revealed to be groundless.The Minjoo also accused the head of the Korean Intellectual Property Office of using his power to influence a local defense company to hire his son. It later turned out the case involved a person with the same name as his son.Rep. Han Sun-kyo of Saenuri then came under spotlight after making an alleged sexist remark to a female lawmaker from Minjoo.A union of nongovernmental organizations that oversees the parliament's audit every year gave an ""F"" to the outcome of the first audit held by the 20th National Assembly, marking the lowest grade in 18 years. The grade is a notch lower than the ""D"" earned by the preceding parliament.The official closing date of the audit is slated for Wednesday, although most of the key proceedings will end Friday.","upcoming presidential election and ignored ,protest week afterward the repercussions ,foundations hindered lawmakers from handling ,to dismiss new agriculture minister ,hunger strike by party chief","[""the National Assembly 's"", 'Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri', 'Chung Sye - kyun', 'Agriculture', 'Kim Jae - soo', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'Chung', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Saenuri', 'Saenuri', 'the National Assembly', 'Park Geun', 'Kim Gwang - lim', 'Saenuri', 'Saenuri', 'Dae', 'K - Sports', 'Park Jie - won', ""the People 's Party"", 'Park', 'Minjoo', 'Han Sun - kyo', 'Saenuri', 'Minjoo', 'National Assembly']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64444047  0.12064742

The 47-year-old special education teacher, wife, mother of three children and dog owner no longer wanted to spend much time on cleaning, washing dishes and an endless list of household chores after returning home from work.

The 47-year-old special education teacher, wife, mother of three children and dog owner no longer wanted to spend much time on cleaning, washing dishes and an endless list of household chores after returning home from work. What first caught her eye was a pile of clothes that she had not been wearing for years. Then she moved on to flowerpots and a fishbowl, which she had wanted at the time of purchase but at some point turned into nuisances. And so it began. It was September 2014. Two years later, tens of thousands of South Koreans have joined the movement and started decluttering their houses, living the so-called minimalist lifestyle. Hwang is now the manager of an online community with over 45,000 registered users sharing their minimalist experiences, as well as the author of a book on living a minimal life here.  This photo provided by 47-year-old special education teacher Hwang Yun-jeong on Oct. 3, 2016, shows her dresser at her house in Hanam, southeast of Seoul, almost empty. ""If you start decluttering, you will be surprised how we live surrounded by stuff we don't even use,"" Hwang said in a recent interview with Yonhap News Agency. ""And just by getting rid of them, you can focus more on things you care about."" Hwang's book, published last month, is one of the first books on living a minimalist life written by a Korean author amid a number of others from Japan and western countries. Though many people think the trend here originated from its neighboring country Japan, Kim Min-hye at Ntree, who was in charge of publishing the book, said the drive seems quite different. ""Japan traditionally has a culture of living in very small houses, which led its people to minimize everything,"" Kim said. ""The recent series of quakes that struck the island country also contributed to the boom in Japan as people found that a lot of furniture can easily turn into deadly weapons in case of an earthquake."" In South Korea, which remains relatively safe from such natural disasters, it is more of the change in family type and perception of consumption that induces many people to live in a minimalist way, according to experts. The surge especially comes along with the rising number of working women in the country.  This photo provided by Tak Jin-hyun, who operates an online website on living a minimalist life, on Oct. 4, 2016, shows her room. She said all her possessions can be packed in the black traveling bag shown in this photo. Just like Hwang, 24-year-old social worker Kim Bo-min started emptying her house when she realized that neither of her working parents nor she had energy left to do chores after work. ""My mom was often irritated by looking at all the things she had to do after long working hours,"" she said. ""Now that the house is always clean, there is really not much to do for all of us."" According to the data by Statistics Korea, some 5.2 million households had both husband and wife working, accounting for 43.9 percent of all South Korean married couple households, as of October last year. Professor Kim Yun-tae at Seoul's Korea University, meanwhile, said the phenomenon cannot be explained without understanding the change in people's perception of excessive consumption. ""Everyone would have their own motivations for why they chose to live with less stuff, but it basically seems like an effort to find an alternative to the current excessive and conspicuous consumption trend,"" professor Kim said. ""It is quite natural that the minimalist lifestyle surfaced as a reaction in a society where people endlessly consume and brag about their consumption."" Professor Lee Seung-sin at Seoul's Konkuk University said the new trend of living with less is also related to the development of the idea of responsible consumption. ""Many people start living the minimalist life, overwhelmed by all those things, or because they are too busy to handle them but in the end, they pay more attention to what they buy and what kind of impact it has on our society,"" she said. The 47-year-old Hwang now has a ""no shopping"" project. The only thing she has bought for the last 10 months -- except for groceries and other daily necessities -- is a pair of shoes, she said. ""I felt sort of guilty to face the amount of trash I have created while decluttering,"" Hwang said. In the beginning, living a minimalist life was more related to a simple and tidy interior that reminded her of northern European design, but now, the focus has clearly shifted to the environmental and social impact of buying and throwing things away. The members of the minimalist online community actually share information on where and how they can donate things they do not use anymore. According to the non-governmental Beautiful Store Foundation, the number of contributed items have been constantly increasing from some 10 million in 2014 to over 12 million last year. The number reached 11.9 million as of early October this year. ""We see the increase as an indication of more people embracing the idea of recycling and donation,"" activist Jo Sang-eui said. ""The recent trend of the minimalist lifestyle seems to have had an influence on that as well."" Still, many, even the minimalists themselves, remain skeptical that this trend would become mainstream. ""Right after this whole living simple thing became all the rage, household goods companies used it as a marketing point, telling people to throw away stuff and buy new ones: their products,"" Hwang said. ""We are living in a capitalist society after all,"" she added. ""I am not saying that we shouldn't buy anything. I just hope the increase in the number of consumers who want to act responsibly to change society in a better way, someday.""","chores after work my mom ,min started emptying her house ,special education teacher wife mother ,emptying her house when she ,started emptying her house when","['Hwang Yun - jeong', 'South Koreans', 'Hwang', 'Hwang Yun - jeong', 'Hanam', 'Seoul', 'Hwang', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'Hwang', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Kim Min - hye', 'Ntree', 'Japan', 'Kim', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Tak Jin - hyun', 'Hwang', 'Kim Bo - min', 'Statistics Korea', 'south Korean', 'Kim Yun - tae', 'Seoul', 'Korea University', 'Kim', 'Lee Seung - sin', 'Seoul', 'Konkuk University', 'Hwang', 'Hwang', 'european', 'Beautiful Store Foundation', 'Jo Sang - eui', 'Hwang']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.6081906   0.64093471

From an architect to a housewife and retiree, the group was composed of people from different walks of life, but their mission for the day was the same: discover the hidden charm of a town called Seochon. “Many may consider Seochon as an area that has recently gained popularity among foreign tourists, but Seochon has numerous historical sites that boast rich traditional value as well as an artistic atmosphere,” said Youn Sung-gi, the guide. Meaning “west town” in Korean, Seochon is located to the east of Inwangsan and the west of Gyeongbokbung. In the early Joseon era, the area was famous for its serene natural beauty, which attracted flocks of artists and poets, said 68-year-old Youn, who has given tours in Seochon for over a decade. Sunday’s tour was part of a Seoul Metropolitan Government program launched in August to offer its citizens a chance to uncover public art in their neighborhoods.  Participants for “Art on Seoul’s streets found by citizens” listen to alley tour guide’s explanation during Seochon alley tour in Seoul on Sunday. Kim Da-sol/The Korea HeraldUnder the “Art on Seoul’s streets found by citizens” project, participants find and promote lesser-known public art and landmarks in groups of 10, joined by field experts and art connoisseurs.Once a week, each team goes out to the corners of Seoul to excavate relatively unpopular or undiscovered artworks, take photos and write logs on how to continue to excavate to promote these hidden spots, as well as how to preserve it for the next generation.The day began cold but warmed up slightly in the afternoon, as members moved through more than 20 spots in alleys and boulevards of Seochon leading to the front gate of Cheong Wa Dae, the presidential office. The tour stopped by sites like Artspace Boan 1942, located in Tongyi-dong, which used to be the Boan Inn where painter Lee Jung-seob and poet Seo Jeong-ju hid out during the Japanese colonization period. “I have lived in Seoul my entire life, but never knew that there were historical places on the streets that we pass by every day. I love how I can now realize the hidden beauty of Seoul through this program,” said Jung Tae-young, 61, the eldest in the group.Kwon Yun-hee, 38, an artist manager at Artist Pension Trust who joined the tour as a leading field expert, stressed the importance of constantly searching and unearthing public art for citizens’ interest.“Like how we toured and found today, there are so many traces of art and history left undiscovered on the streets, alleys and corners of buildings in Seoul. I hope more kinds of municipal citizen programs are introduced to arouse citizens’ excitement and interest in Seoul’s hidden beauty,” said Kwon.

That criticism, however, has done little to dampen Americans' support for the US-Korea alliance,"" the council said in a report.Support for keeping troops in South Korea was higher than in the cases for other allies. Only 46 percent of the respondents were in favor of having a presence in Australia, 61 percent in Germany and 60 percent in Japan, according to the survey.By party, 76 percent of Republicans, 70 percent of Democrats and 64 percent of independents expressed support for troop presence in the South, the council said, adding that one reason for the increased support is the ""growing perception of North Korea as a critical threat to the US""The survey was conducted from June 10-27, and had margins of error of plus or minus 2.2-3.5 percentage points.About 28,500 American troops are stationed in South Korea to help deter North Korea. Seoul pays about half the costs, about $900 million a year, to help finance the troop presence, and US officials, including Gen. Brooks, said it would cost more to keep those troops stationed in the US than it does in Korea.But Trump has long expressed deeply negative views of such security commitments, seeing them as a cumbersome burden sucking up taxpayer dollars. The real-estate tycoon has claimed that allies should pay more, or the US should be prepared to end their protection. ""While the American public at large may not be aware of the details of these contributions , three quarters  of Americans say that US relations with South Korea are either staying about the same  or improving ,"" the council said.The survey also showed that 60 percent think the North's nuclear program is a critical threat to the US, up 5 percentage points from last year. The North represented the third-highest threat after international terrorism  and the possibility of unfriendly countries becoming a nuclear power .Among those who cite the North's nuclear program as a threat, 75 percent support long-term bases in the South. As to how to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, 81 percent expressed support for continuing diplomatic efforts to get the North to suspend its nuclear program. Eighty percent also support imposing sanctions and 53 percent support conducting cyberattacks on the communist nation, the survey showed.Military action remains less favored, with 35 percent supporting airstrikes against the North's nuclear facilities and only 25 percent supporting sending American troops to destroy those facilities, it showed.The North was also the least favored country.On a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 representing the highest possible favorability, the North had 19 points, being the only country among a dozen nations listed in the poll to fall below 20.

The Federation of Korean Industries is at the center of a snowballing political scandal surrounding Mir Foundation and K-Sports Foundations, accused of pulling strings to have member conglomerates donate funds to the foundations, which are suspected to have been run by a President Park Geun-hye confidant. “The FKI was supposed to represent business interests. Now that benefit has gone,” said Minjoo Party of Korea Spokesman Rep. Ki Dong-min in a press briefing at the National Assembly. “The FKI has been relegated to a corrupt venue used by the government to extract funds from conglomerates.”Federation of Korean Industries‘ headquarters in Yeouido, Seoul Mir and K-Sports, established less than a year ago under the auspices of FKI, raised a combined 75 billion won  from major chaebol groups, such as Samsung, Hyundai and LG, mostly FKI members, through what critics see as “dubious” fundraising activities. The foundations claim the donations were voluntary. The FKI, after allegations surfaced, announced the two foundations would disband and be integrated into one. Minjoo Party lawmakers suspect the merger plan is an attempt to cover up wrongdoings. Prosecutors, launching a probe into the foundations upon a complaint filed by a civic group, said Thursday they would “faithfully” investigate the case. The disestablishment call was echoed by some ruling Saenuri Party’s moderate members such as Rep. Yoo Seong-min. The Saenuri former whip, who has pushed centrist agenda since taking office and clashed with President Park Geun-hye over her economic policy, demanded “constructive disestablishment” of the business group. Even President Park Geun-hye’s former economic think tank moved against the group. On Tuesday, The Institute for the Future of State, alongside liberal-based Solidarity for Economic Reform, issued a statement denouncing the FKI for being too politicized and failing to fulfill its original purpose. The government has distanced itself from the controversy, saying the FKI should decide its own future course. But Finance Minister Yoo Il-ho acknowledged the need for a change in its membership, which includes government-led agencies such as the Export-import Bank of Korea. Opposition party lawmakers have demanded the FKI cut its ties with those entities. This is not the first time the FKI has been embroiled in a political scandal during President Park Geun-hye’s administration. The business group was accused of offering illicit funds to right-wing groups such as the Korean Parent Association and the Center for Free Enterprise to help them push government-led agendas such as state-authored textbooks. The FKI was established in 1961, supposedly to foster a cozy relationship between big businesses and former President Park Chung-hee, who sought to lift the country out of poverty by supporting big businesses. Many believe it was formed based on a deal between business leaders and the president, who rose to power through a military coup. While it was credited with playing a role in the nation’s economic growth by advocating government-led export-driven economic policies, the business group also faced criticism for fostering cronyism and business-politics collusion. In 1988, the FKI was accused of raising illicit funds for a foundation run by then-President Chun Doo-hwan. Business experts said the FKI should at least be transformed in a more transparent entity, break away from “antiquated” business practices and embrace new economic trend. “I think the group has failed to serve in the interest of the society as a whole,” said Lee Jung-hee, an economics professor at Chung-Ang University in Seoul. “Things have changed a lot, but they are still acting in an old-fashioned way. It needs to change.” By Yeo Jun-suk","political scandal during president park ,snowballing political scandal surrounding ,to disband by opposition lawmakers ,snowballing political scandal surrounding mir ,scandal during president park geun","['korea‘s', 'the Federation of Korean Industries', 'Mir Foundation', 'K - Sports Foundations', 'Park Geun', 'FKI', 'Minjoo Party', 'Ki Dong - min', 'the National Assembly', 'FKI', ""Korean Industries '"", 'Yeouido', 'Seoul Mir', 'K - Sports', 'FKI', 'Samsung', 'Hyundai', 'LG', 'FKI', 'FKI', 'Minjoo Party', 'Saenuri Party ’s', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Saenuri', 'Park Geun', 'Park Geun - hye', 'the Institute for the Future of State', 'Solidarity for Economic Reform', 'FKI', 'FKI', 'Yoo Il - ho', 'Export', 'Bank of Korea', 'FKI', 'FKI', 'Park Geun', 'the Korean Parent Association', 'the Center for Free Enterprise', 'FKI', 'Park Chung - hee', 'fki', 'Chun Doo - hwan', 'FKI', 'Lee Jung - hee', 'Chung - Ang University', 'Seoul', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43656126  0.24111259

Slated to kick off as early as within the month, the organization held a pre-launch symposium Thursday afternoon at Korea Press Center.“The economic policies of the Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye administrations ended in utter failure,” Moon said in his keynote speech.In order to achieve a change of government, according to the presidential hopeful, the nation should adopt a new economic paradigm.“People’s growth means a just growth, a kind that returns the profits of economic development to individual households and puts people before companies.”But Kim asserted that such ideas -- of balancing growth and democratization -- were already included in the concept of economic democratization.The senior economist-turned-politician also added that the “growth” mentioned by Moon’s think tank is not very likely to take place.“We have already stepped into a stage of low growth and are not likely to achieve growth beyond the 2 percent range,” he said.The two former Minjoo Party chiefs have long held a tense relationship. Though Moon had actively invited Kim to take over the party’s leadership earlier this year, Kim has often expressed disapproval over the alleged power monopoly of the “pro-Moon” faction within the party.The latter also often mentioned the need to create a new power group that does not involve conventional presidential front-runners, triggering speculation he may later unite forces with a runner-up candidate other than Moon.Meanwhile, Kim mentioned Saenuri-affiliated Gyeonggi Gov. Nam Kyung-pil as a close discussion partner when it comes to economic agenda.“We meet from time to time to discuss economic democratization,” Kim said.He, however, denied the possibility of politically uniting with the ruling party politician, citing “dissent on the methodology.”By Bae Hyun-jung","ruling party politician citing dissent ,disapproval over his policy keynote ,presidential front runners triggering speculation ,thursday economic democratization however does ,the senior economist turned politician","['the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Kim Chong - in', 'Moon', 'Kim Chong - in', 'Kim', 'MBC', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Moon ’s', 'Korea Press Center', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Park Geun', 'Moon', 'Kim', 'Moon ’s', 'Minjoo Party', 'Moon', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Moon', 'Kim', 'Saenuri', 'Nam Kyung - pil', 'Kim', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47605398  0.55374366

Since being re-elected as mayor in June 2014, the activist-turned politician has been regarded as one of the candidates for the presidential ticket of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea. Former President Lee Myung-bak was a Seoul mayor when he decided to run for the top office.  Park Won-soon, Mayor of Seoul. According to a survey released Monday by local pollster Realmeter, Park ranked fourth in the list for the most favored presidential candidates -- behind former Minjoo leader Moon Jae-in, and former People’s Party leader Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon topped the list. Rep. Ahn reiterated his pledge to transform what he viewed as “antiquated” politics in South Korea, asserting that the next year’s election would witness “big changes” that defied conventional wisdom.“I will devote myself to changing the politics that the people have been fed up with,” said Ahn in a speech Tuesday at a community college in Seoul. “Any predictions based on conventional wisdom or current polling will prove wrong.” The former People’s Party leader also expressed confidence about the prospect of his centrist party which emerged as the third-biggest party in the latest general election. Ahn resigned as its party leader in June over a bribery scandal involving his fellow lawmakers Reps. Kim Su-min and Park Sun-sook. The entrepreneur-turned-politician withdrew his bid for the Seoul mayorship in 2011 to endorse Park. In the 2012 presidential election, Ahn also yielded to Moon, then presidential candidate from the main opposition United Democratic Party, who was defeated by Park Geun-hye, the conservative flag-bearer and now the president. Meanwhile, speculation over Ban’s bid for the 2017 election continued to roil political circles. Despite the popularity, the UN official and former Korean foreign minister has been vague about his presidential ambitions. Local newspapers reported Wednesday that former Prime Minister Kim Jong-pil, who met the UN top official during his trip to Korea in May, told his aides that Ban appeared to “make up his mind"" to run.

Moon is seeking to break away from his image as an idealistic progressive icon to gain an upper hand on economic policy, traditionally seen as a strong suit for the conservatives.Moon Jae-in, former chairman of the opposition Minjoo Party, steps out of a restaurant after lunch during a visit to Daegu on Sept. 28. YonhapHe plans to begin by leading the foundation of a private think tank, which is expected to later become an election campaign strategy team.The think tank, tentatively titled “People’s Growth,” will hold a pre-foundation symposium at the Korea Press Center in central Seoul on Thursday, according to Minjoo Party Rep. Kim Kyoung-soo, a close aide to Moon. The official launch of the organization is scheduled to take place as early as this month.“People’s Growth consists of voluntary participants, most of them experts in political and economic fields who agree with Moon’s vision,” Kim said Wednesday.“Our initial goal is to develop the think tank into a valid alternative policy group by the end of the year, increasing the advisers’ pool from the current 500 to some 1,000.”The core concept of the incoming think tank is a strong focus on down-to-earth economic issues and engagement with the centrist-conservative section of the public, according to Kim.In his keynote speech for Thursday’s symposium, Moon is expected to provide a renewed strategy as a presidential hopeful, underlining his economic growth plans.Cho Yoon-je, a professor at Sogang University and economic adviser to former President Roh Moo-hyun, is to be the think tank’s director, while former Deputy Prime Minister Han Wan-sang will serve as senior adviser. The listed professors are to be assigned to one of the seven sectors -- foreign and security policy, economy, information technology, industry, labor, welfare and regional autonomy.“In this era of low growth, it is no longer significant to distinguish between conservative and progressive, or growth and distribution,” said Kim Hyun-chul, professor at Seoul National University’s graduate school of international studies.“I agreed with Moon in that a new policy frame was needed to promote growth and distribution simultaneously.”Professor Kim, who has for long kept a distance from the progressive political camp, is to make a presentation during the symposium on how South Korea should gear up for a growth-driven economic initiative.The term “People’s Growth,” he added, was an attempt to break free from the conventional prejudice that growth is a conservative agenda and distribution a progressive one.The economy-driven centrist agenda may, however, evoke unease among progressive supporters, some admitted.“We are aware that some of the progressive supporters may feel uncomfortable with the name  or the slogan it carries,” said Cho Dae-yeop, director of Korea University’s graduate school of labor studies and vice director of the think tank.“But people need to understand that our definition of growth is not just an increase in the nation’s economic indexes or the growth of companies, but the kind that actually helps people earn money and improve their livelihoods.”Criticism of the incumbent Park Geun-hye administration’s “unsuccessful” economic policies also pushed a number of scholars to join in Moon’s initiative, he added.By launching “People’s Growth,” Moon is to become the first among top-ranking presidential potentials to affirm his bid in next year’s race.His aggressive turn is seen as reflecting the lesson he learned from the 2012 presidential election, in which he lost to conservative rival Park -- a result which many attributed to Moon’s limited political pool and neglect of economic issues.The opposition politician is also facing a potential challenge from United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who is expected to enter domestic politics once he steps down from his current post at the end of the year.According to a survey conducted by local pollster Realmeter on 2,525 voters nationwide in the last week of September, Ban outran Moon in approval ratings outside the margin of error. The UN official received 26.8 percent of respondents’ support, while Moon stood at 18.8 percent.Meanwhile, the Minjoo Party also launched a set of policy task forces to address progressive issues such as welfare, in a move to rally progressive voters and to back Moon‘s moves. In the last presidential election, the opposition camp lost momentum in the welfare sector as the ruling conservative Saenuri Party had fielded the slogan of “economic democratization,” in an appealing gesture toward the political center.By Bae Hyun-jung","presidential election moon is seeking ,presidential election the opposition camp ,keynote speech for thursday symposium ,presidential hopeful underlining his economic ,his keynote speech for thursday","['the Minjoo Party', 'Korea ’s', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Moon', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Minjoo Party', 'Daegu', 'yonhaphe', 'the Korea Press Center', 'Seoul', 'Minjoo Party', 'Kim Kyoung - soo', 'Moon', 'Moon ’s', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Moon', 'Cho Yoon - je', 'Sogang University', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Han Wan - sang', 'Kim Hyun - chul', 'Seoul National University ’s', 'Moon', 'Kim', 'South Korea', 'Cho Dae - yeop', 'Korea University ’s', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Park', 'Moon ’s', 'United Nations', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Ban', 'Moon', 'UN', 'Moon', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Saenuri Party', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23589037  0.23943022

Park Ji-won of the People’s Party at a parliamentary meeting. The People‘s Party is among the three political blocs united for the motion, with the two others being the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea and far-left minority Justice Party.  “As the government, which led Baek to die, argues that Baek died of an illness, opening a special investigation is the only answer .” Under the current law, an independent counsel can launch an investigation when requested by a majority of parliamentarians or the Justice Minister. If the proposal is passed, the parliamentary speaker sets up a special committee to recommend candidates to lead the probe and the president makes the final appointment. The special prosecution is given 60 days for a probe, which can be extended once for 30 days. The special investigation will allegedly center on the legitimacy of the use of force by police, cause of Baek’s death and alleged errors in his death report written by Seoul National University Hospital. Liberal civic groups and opposition parties lashed out at the police for using excessive force to crack down on rallies, while the police and ruling party cited the need to keep public order and dismantle what they called illegal and violent protests. Controversy has intensified since the 69-year-old died on Sept. 25 at SNUH, where he had remained in a coma for 317 days, as the police called for an autopsy. Baek died of acute renal failure, which doctors, civic groups and his family see as a result of a cerebral hemorrhage Baek was diagnosed with after he was directly hit by a blast from the police water cannon.Police applied for an autopsy warrant last week, claiming there were no confirmed links between the police water cannon blast and Baek’s death. The court issued a conditional warrant, requiring the police to seek consent of Baek’s families on how, why and by whom the autopsy is carried out.Police said they plan to execute the warrant before it expires Oct. 25. Baek’s family and their supporters have protested the autopsy plan, calling it “an insult” to the deceased and an attempt to shift the blame for his death elsewhere. They said that an autopsy is unnecessary, as the cause of Baek’s death was clearly the water cannon blast. Baek’s main doctor at SNUH further enraged Baek’s family after he put “illness,” not an “external element,” for the cause of his death in a hospital report. The doctor said that additional treatment could have saved Baek’s life, adding that Baek’s family did not allow him to perform hemodialysis. The family officially demanded the hospital revise the cause of death of Baek from illness to external injury.In the parliamentary audit by the Legislation and Judiciary Committee held Wednesday, the rival parties wrangled over whether to bring in the judge who issued the warrant as a witness and the conditions set in the autopsy warrant.“Judge Seong Chang-ho himself should explain what conditions in the autopsy warrant mean how it should be interpreted to ease confusion,” Rep. Park Ju-min of the Minjoo Party said. “As the audit cannot be conducted with an aim to peddle influence in an investigation or trial, bringing in the judge for questioning could lead to problems,” said prosecutor-turned-lawmaker Kim Jin-tae of the Saenuri Party. While the opposition party claimed the warrant can only be executed when conditions in the autopsy warrant are met, the ruling party argued the police can conduct the autopsy as long as they inform Baek’s family of their plan. “The court is triggering controversy by issuing an unprecedented form of warrant,” said Rep. Oh Sin-hwan of the Saenuri Party. “The conditions in the warrant should be seen as allowing the police to conduct an autopsy on Baek’s body if the police offer information to the bereaved families.”Asked to clarify meaning of the conditions in the warrant, Kang Hyung-joo, chief of the Seoul Central District Court said: “The warrant with conditions attached means that it could be carried out within a certain criteria. It means that the warrant is dismissed .” The rival parties in unison accused the court of dodging its responsibility to decide on the legality of the autopsy on Baek’s body. “The role of the court is to resolve a dispute, but the warrant appeared to accelerate the conflicts,” said Rep. Lee Chun-seong of the Minjoo Party during the parliamentary audit.

The test was conducted days after heavy rains pummeled the northeastern region.Seoul condemned North Korea for pouring money into its nuclear program while neglecting the suffering of its people in the flood-hit areas.","korea after the latest floods ,north korea over the flooding ,heavy rains hit north korea ,korea over the flooding amid ,korea over the flooding","['United Nations', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs', ""the UN International Children 's Emergency Fund"", 'North Korea', 'North Hamgyong Province', 'the Korean Central News Agency', ""North Korea 's"", 'North Koreans', 'the Red Cross', 'North Korea', 'UN', 'KCNA', 'China', 'China', ""North Korea 's"", 'north korean', 'Ri Yong - ho', 'UN', 'New York', 'General Assembly', 'US', 'Radio Free Asia', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'North Korea']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.69946092 -0.17493914

But they continued to clash at standing committees over some highly political issues. Scandals involving close associates of President Park Geun-hye were high on the agenda for lawmakers from liberal opposition Minjoo Party, while the lawmakers from the conservative ruling Saenuri Party sought to play them down.In one of the scandals, President Park’s confidant is alleged to have used influence to offer favors to conglomerate-funded foundation, while Park’s senior secretary for civil affairs Woo Byoung-woo is accused of taking bribes in the other scandal. Opposition parties’ lawmakers at parliamentary committees dealing with legislative and tourism issues urged the prosecutors to promptly investigate the burgeoning scandals, while Saenuri dismissed the call as a political stint to undermine the president. “For the rest of the audit session, we will focus on the allegation surrounding Mir Foundation and K-Sports Foundation,” said The Minjoo Party of Korea’s floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho, referring to the entities suspected of raising massive funds from conglomerates by pulling strings through a close associate of Park.The Minjoo Party lawmakers at Education, Culture, Sports and Tourism Committee grilled officials at Korea Tourism Organization and Korea Sports Promotion Foundation over whether they were involved with helping a Taekwondo team recruited by K-Sports accompany President Park’s trip to Iran in May as a special treatment. Rep. Baek Hye-ryun of The Minjoo Party urged the prosecutors to promptly investigate the allegation, arguing that the business groups tied to the scandal had ordered their employees to eliminate relevant evidence. Last month, An Chong-bum, senior presidential secretary for policy coordination, was accused by a civic group of leading the dubious fundraising efforts along with Choi Soon-sil, who was known to close with President Park and involved with establishing the dubious entities. The Minjoo Party lawmakers also stepped up their attacks on the bribery scandal involved with presidential aide Woo. Rep. Cho Eung-chun, who served as a former presidential secretary for civil service until he resigned in 2015, criticized prosecutors for being worried about Cheong Wa Dae and delaying the investigation. The Saenuri Party lawmakers, for their part, appeared to be on defensive and urged their counterparts to refrain from raising what they view as a groundless allegation for political gains. Most Saenuri members questioned the government officials and other witnesses over the issues irrelevant to the controversy. “Since we are under tight schedule for the audit session, I hope we should avoid controversial issue,” said Rep. Kim Jin-tae of the Saenuri Party who sits on the Legislative Committee. “The parliamentary audit should focus on the people’s livelihood, not political tit-for-tat.” Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon on Tuesday attends the parliamentary Security and Public Administration Committee for the state audit on the metropolitan government. YonhapBut the Saenuri Party lawmakers at Security and Public Administration Committee criticized Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon over his policy to help the young unemployed find jobs by offering them monthly subsidy worth of some 500 thousand won  for up to six months. “Some young people don’t quite fit the purpose of the program,” said Rep. Chang Je-won of the Saenuri Party. Citing the case where an applicant whose family’s annual income worth of 160 million had received the subsidy, he dismissed the initiative as “populist policy.” Some lawmakers attacked the mayor over his political ambition. Rep. Lee Yong-ho of the third-biggest People Party asked whether Mayor Park, one of the flag-bearers in the Minjoo Party, would leave his office to run for the 2018 presidential election. Park said that his decision to run for the top office is something that “he cannot decide on his own but requires the peoples’ call.” “I am giving a lot of thought to this plan but I also understand how important it is to serve as Seoul Mayor,” said Park.

The comment, seemingly inviting North Koreans to defect, triggered vexed responses from the communist regime.“ is shameless to overlook the South‘s  reality and speak of ‘defection’ so out loud,” said the North’s official Rodong Sinmun in an editorial Sunday.“President Park’s words, encouraging North Koreans to defect to the South, are extremely dangerous,” Rep. Woo Sang-ho, floor leader of The Minjoo Party of Korea, said in a party meeting.The main opposition whip claimed the president thus implied the intention of “bringing down” the North Korean regime, deviating from the original pledge to promote communication and cooperation between the two Koreas.Rep. Woo also pointed out that a sudden fall of the North Korean regime would inevitably lead to an excessive influx of refugees and the consequent burden upon Seoul.Rep. Park Jie-won, interim chief of the runner-up opposition People’s Party, echoed the concerns, though he added with precaution that the South needs to ready itself for such a possibility.“We should always have a contingency plan, should the North Korean regime fall and its residents defect en masse,” he said. “But never, under any circumstances, should we deliberately create such circumstances.”The ruling conservative Saenuri Party supported the president, stressing that the disputed remark was only an expression of sympathy for North Korean residents.“North Koreans, too, are nationals of the Republic of Korea as defined by our Constitution,” said floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk. “Should they face political and economic difficulties, the  Korean government should step up to protect them.”The president’s intention was to actively embrace those who seek asylum here, not to forcibly bring residents from the North to the South, he added, blaming the opposition for egging on the political quarrel.The Unification Ministry reiterated the ruling party‘s stance.“ was merely to point out the poor human rights situations faced by the North Korean residents, as well as the regime liability for such reality,” a ministry official told reporters.Cheong Wa Dae remained at a distance from the bipartisan battle of words, refraining from directly commenting.It did, however, allude to its stance through spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk by pointing to an editorial in the Wall Street Journal titled “Liberating North Koreans -- mass defection may be the key to regime change in Pyongyang.”“The US hasn’t been able to stop North Korea’s nuclear program, so bravo to South Korean President Park Geun-hye,” said the US-based daily.“ Park deserves credit for ending the last vestiges of the Sunshine Policy, the appeasement of Pyongyang begun under President Kim Dae-jung in 1998.”The editorial also commended Park for shutting down the Kaeseong industrial park, a facility that yielded some $100 million per year, purportedly funneled into the North’s nuclear ambitions.By Bae Hyun-jung","korean power struggle on saturday ,to stop north korea nuclear ,north koreans mass defection may ,president stressing that the disputed ,bravo to south korean president","['Park Geun - hye ’s', 'north korean', 'inter - korean', 'Armed Forces Day', 'Park', 'north korean', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Cabinet', 'Gwanghwamun', 'Seoul', 'Sejong', 'South Chungcheong Province', 'North Koreans', 'North ’s', 'Rodong Sinmun', 'North Koreans', 'Woo Sang - ho', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'north korean', 'Koreas', 'Woo', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'Park Jie - won', 'People ’s Party', 'north korean', 'Saenuri Party', 'north korean', 'Koreans', 'the Republic of Korea', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'korean', 'the Unification Ministry', 'north korean', 'Jung Youn', 'the Wall Street Journal', 'North Koreans', 'Pyongyang', 'US', 'North Korea ’s', 'south korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'US', 'Pyongyang', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'kaeseong', 'North ’s', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",6,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.76911032  0.56910783

Victor Cha, former director for Asian Affairs in the White House’s National Security Council and currently senior adviser to the US-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote in a CSIS study he co-authored with other experts that a major nuclear or missile test “would be a way  of trying to intimidate the incoming president.”“North Korea chooses particular windows that they know will gain maximum attention from the world, and the US in particular. ... It could be a sixth nuclear test, it could be launching of their rocket which put a satellite in orbit,” Cha was quoted as saying to the CNN.Pyongyang has been upping efforts to complete its nuclear strike capacity under its leader Kim Jong-un, and conducted two nuclear tests this year in an unprecedented pace. The UN Security Council resolution bans the communist state of any nuclear or ballistic missile programs.North Korea has had a history of marking its ceremonious occasions or prominent incidents from elsewhere in the world with shows of force.On Sept. 9, Pyongyang conducted its fifth nuclear test to coincide with the 68th anniversary of its governmental foundation day. It was the first time that two tests in one year were conducted since the hermit kingdom carried out its first nuclear test in October of 2006.Rodong Sinmun, the daily newspaper of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party of Korea, bashed South Korean President Park Geun-hye with its usual harsh tone, saying her administration had driven inter-Korea relations to an “unclimbable depth.” It blamed Park for the current inter-Korea tensions while claiming the UN had become a puppet to defend interests of member states.The words came after Park on Saturday urged North Koreans to defect to South.Seoul’s Unification Ministry expressed strong regrets on Pyongyang’s rhetoric. It also reaffirmed the government’s stance it has no plans to provide relief for the people of North Korea, who were hit hard by flooding recently.Local observers have been anticipating the North to conduct some sort of armed protest, particularly since it revealed a new rocket engine last month that is believed to have stronger thrust capacity than its existing rocket engines.The communist country have been seeking to acquire nuclear strike capacity that can reach the US mainland. Its biggest functional weapon, as of now, is believed to be the intermediate-range Musudan, with range over 3,000 kilometers.Kim Dong-yup, a professor at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies at Kyungnam University, said the North may attempt to use the new engine a as means to threaten the new US leadership. He, however, said that using the engine may take place next year, after the new administration has taken office.In light of the growing threats from the North, the South Korean military is seeking to complete its three-legged “3K” defense system of missile defense, pre-emptive strike and massive retaliation.The Kill Chain centers on striking North Korean missiles before they are fired, the Korea Air and Missile Defense system is on intercepting the missiles in the air, while the Korea Massive Punishment and Retaliation is about wiping out the North Korean leadership upon attack.The newly applied operation plan 5015 of the Seoul-Washington alliance reportedly has boosted plans for pre-emptive strikes on Pyongyang, stepping up vigilance against the threats from the northern neighbor.But all three defense systems are expected to be completed in the 2020s at earliest, and some are questioning whether they will be effective as the military boasts.Rep. Kim Jong-dae of the minor opposition Justice Party said Tuesday that 80 percent of the military’s 9 trillion won  budget for Kill Chain is being used on ballistic and cruise missiles that purportedly are not very effective in striking missile facilities like transporter erector launchers or underground tunnels.“The ballistic and cruise missiles are effective against fixed targets, but is ineffective against portable launchers or underground facilities. Our  missiles require a pre-entered coordinate, which limits its use against moving launchers,” Kim pointed out in his press release. He also said that the Seoul-Washington agreement on missiles restricts the payload of Korean missiles to an 800-kilometer range and 500 kilograms, which would make it difficult to destroy underground facilities.

Seoul has cut off all inter-Korean economic ties that have been cited for bankrolling the North's weapons of mass destruction program.The reclusive country's main daily, the Rodong Sinmun, said in an article last week that the plan by President Park and her supporters to retain power is in itself an affront and shameless act, and will be opposed by ordinary South Koreans.The paper, an organ of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea , said ever since Park took power in 2013, her government has sided against the Korean people and has ruled the country with an authoritarian hand. It then went on to claim that Park and her followers have a confrontational policy toward the DPRK that has caused inter-Korean relations to deteriorate to their worst levels in recent times.The DPRK is the acronym of North Korea's full name: the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.""The incumbent conservatives should not think of trying to hold on to power but leave politics altogether, which is the wish of the people,"" the paper argued.The WPK mouthpiece in addition urged various elements in South Korean society to rise up, and send Park and her followers to their graves, clearly trying to stoke internal strife within the country.The same paper said in a separate report said that people in the South have given up hope on Park and her supporters, and know that if they hold onto power by winning next year's presidential election, a great tragedy will befall them.Echoing this view, Uriminzokkiri, Pyongyang's main Internet-based media and propaganda website, said in a piece released Tuesday that the South Korea's ruling Saenuri Party is already contemplating who will become the new prime minister under the newly elected government, as well as who will become party chief. It warned that if Saenuri again wins the presidency it will be a catastrophe for the Korean people as a whole.In particular, Radio Pyongyang even lashed out at United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who is widely viewed as running in the race as a conservative party standard bearer, by claiming he has no real support base and is politically incompetent. ""Ban knows very little about the challenges facing South Korea,"" the broadcaster claimed.Ban, whose second five-year term at the helm of the global body, ends this year said he will return home early next year and said he will think of ways to serve his country. He has never said he will or will not run for president. His approval rating among potential runners has consistently been high, exceeding those of potential candidates from the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea like Moon Jae-in and Ahn Cheol-soo from the smaller People's Party.Local experts, meanwhile, said the North's moves to influence South Korea's parliamentary and presidential elections is nothing new. ""The more the North tries to impact South Korean elections and take sides, the opposite results generally occur,"" said Yang Moo-jin, a political science professor at Seoul's University of North Korean Studies. He said the fact that it is trying again may indicate that there is a loyalty race within the leadership's inner circle to look good to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.Other scholars said that the North traditionally seems to favor the South Korean liberal camp, which has been more dovish, and wants to maintain good relations with the North.","presidential race by blasting conservatives ,south korea 2017 presidential race ,2017 presidential race by blasting ,stance against pyongyang continued nuclear ,year presidential election great tragedy","['North Korea', ""South Korea 's"", 'Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'inter - korean', 'the Rodong Sinmun', 'Park', 'South Koreans', ""Workers ' Party of Korea"", 'korean', 'Park', 'inter - korean', ""North Korea 's"", ""the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea"", 'WPK', 'south korean', 'Uriminzokkiri', 'Pyongyang', ""South Korea 's"", 'Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri', 'korean', 'Radio Pyongyang', 'United Nations', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Ban', 'South Korea', 'Ban', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Ahn Cheol', ""People 's Party"", ""South Korea 's"", 'south korean', 'Yang Moo - jin', 'Seoul', 'University of North Korean Studies', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'south korean']",6,"[ 3.          0.          0.         ... -0.20939746  0.19729222

Warning that dissenters would be punished, the ruling party’s leadership pledged to continue their boycott of the parliamentary sessions until Assembly Speaker Rep. Chung Sye-kyun resigns over his decision to pass a contentious motion recommending the dismissal of Agriculture Minister Kim Jae-soo.However, the party has suffered a major glitch to its boycott as some of its member lawmakers have publicly urged the leadership to stop it. Rep. Kim Young-woo, who is a chairman of the National Defense Committee, convened the audit Thursday in defiance of the leadership. The ruling Saenuri Party’s Chairman Rep. Lee Jung-hyun  talks with floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk, who joined him in a hunger strike at the National Assembly on Thursday.  Park Hae-mook/The Korea Herald“The ruling party shouldn’t act the same way opposition parties did in the past by staging protests on the street,” said Rep. Na Kyung-won. “We decided to urge the leadership to do its utmost to break the legislative deadlock.” The move was joined by other ranking Saenuri lawmakers such as the party’s former leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung and Rep. Yoo Seung-min. They have long clashed with the faction close to President Park Geun-hye who steers the party.But the party leadership rejected these calls and continued their protest and boycott of the parliamentary audit. The committee meetings chaired by the Saenuri lawmakers failed to be held -- except for the Defense Committee -- while other committees headed by opposition parties performed the audit without the Saenuri Party’s members. “I need you to respect the party’s guidance established under the consensus of party members,” said the Saenuri Party’s floor leader Chung Jin-suk, who has joined the hunger strike that Saenuri Party leader Rep. Lee Jung-hyun started. “The value of our fight will not be diminished.” Saenuri lawmakers escalated their attacks on the speaker by filling a criminal charge against him for violating political neutrality. They claimed the speaker broke the law by changing a parliamentary schedule without coordination with the Saenuri Party to hold a plenary session and pass the dismissal motion. It was the first criminal charge pressed against an incumbent Assembly speaker by lawmakers. Throughout the history of the National Assembly, former Speaker Park Hee-tae was the only one who resigned during his tenure after being involved in a bribery scandal in 2012. They also accused the speaker of instructing the Assembly secretariat to publish false reports and undermining the reputation of Saenuri lawmakers. In the report, Chung claimed that he had discussed whether to hold the Saturday session, but the Saenuri Party claimed that they were only informed with a one-page document. Rep. Cho Won-jin, a member of the Saenuri Party’s Supreme Council, raised fresh allegations that the speaker had violated electoral laws when he was elected as a lawmaker in the latest general election. Cho claimed he had obtained reports of such a violation and urged prosecutors to investigate. The speaker denied the allegation and vowed to seek libel charges against Cho. “The speaker will consider every option including legal measures. Cho should be held accountable for his remark,” said Assembly spokesman Kim Young-soo during a press meeting.  The tit for tat came after the Saenuri Party proposed a motion pushing for the speaker’s resignation. In the opposition-controlled Assembly, the Saenuri party cannot force the speaker to step down unless either the opposition parties approve the motion or the speaker steps down voluntarily. Currently, the Saenuri Party holds 129 seats, while the opposition bloc secures 165.As the deadlock continued, some ranking Saenuri Party lawmakers decided to attend audit sessions in defiance of the party leadership, who vowed to punish them for disobeying the party’s instructions. The Defense Committee opened an audit session at 10 a.m. and it was attended by lawmakers from opposition parties, but other Saenuri lawmakers did not join.“The chairman’s decision will aggravate the fight between the ruling and opposition parties,” said Rep. Kyung Dae-soo who represents the Saenuri Party at the committee. A day earlier, some ranking members from the Saenuri Party locked Kim in his room to prevent him from hosting the session.

Daniel Russel “We’re focusing our efforts on cutting off sources of revenue for the regime’s unlawful nuclear and ballistic weapons programs, including revenue generated through the coal trade and overseas by North Korean workers,” Russel said in the statement.“Our three countries will continue to increase the costs on North Korea and target its revenue and reputation until it makes a strategic decision to return to serious talks on denuclearization and complies with its international obligations and commitments,” he said.Russel said that the US has long expressed its willingness to hold “credible and authentic talks aimed at returning to the six-party talks on ending the North’s nuclear programs, but Pyongyang’s “litany of provocations demonstrates its rejection” of dialogue.Exports of coal and other mineral resources are an important source of hard currency that accounts for nearly half of the North‘s total exports. The latest UN Security Council resolution bans such mineral exports unless they are intended for livelihood purposes.Labor exports have also increasingly become a key source of income for Pyongyang.About 50,000 North Koreans are believed to be toiling overseas, mainly in the mining, logging, textile and construction industries.Such workers earn on average $120-150 per month while employers pay significantly higher amounts to the North’s government.Russel also said that the US is in discussions with partners about tightening the financial screws on Pyongyang to “deny North Korea access to the international banking infrastructure that has been abused and manipulated in furtherance of its illicit programs.”He was referring to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication  network that enables financial institutions worldwide to send and receive information about financial transactions in a secure, standardized and reliable environment.“I think that our hope is that we will in fact ultimately be able to reach an agreement that would further restrict North Korea‘s access,” Russel said, adding that the US government is also looking at North Korean banks and banking activities in an effort to shut down “anything that might contribute to the illicit programs or otherwise violate the Security Council resolutions or our own laws.”","to curb pyongyang nuclear programs ,pyongyang to deny north korea ,the regime unlawful nuclear ,to curb pyongyang nuclear ,japan to cut off sources","['WASHINGTON', 'the United States', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'North Korea', 'State Department', 'asian', 'Daniel Russel', 'the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee', 'Pyongyang', 'Daniel Russel', 'north korean', 'Russel', 'North Korea', 'Russel', 'US', 'North ’s', 'Pyongyang', 'north‘s', 'UN Security Council', 'Pyongyang', 'North Koreans', 'Russel', 'US', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication', 'Russel', 'US', 'north korean', 'Security Council']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66182828  0.00532933

Lee Jung-hyun‘s on-going hunger strike in turn.“Most of the members agreed that they cannot return to the audit while leaving the chairman on a hunger strike on his own,” said the party’s floor spokesman Rep. Min Kyung-wook. Saenuri Party lawmakers hold up pickets calling for the resignation of National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun in front of the Assembly hall on Wednesday. Adding that Speaker Chung Sye-kyun has repeated his refusal to apologize, Min said they had no reason to return at this time.The party’s decision came several hours after chairman Lee told the party’s members to cease its boycott of the audit, as calls for the resumption of the annual audit are growing.Saenuri has been refusing to participate in the audit since Monday over what they claim was an abuse of power by Speaker Chung Sye-kyun during a vote for the dismissal of the controversy-ridden agriculture minister.Lee has been on a hunger strike calling for Chung’s resignation. “It is my belief, as well as Saenuri’s, that we should work for the country no matter what the situation is. Through the audit, please make sure that  is spending its budget right and is not mistreating the people,” Lee said during a party meeting about Chung’s resignation.But earlier in the day, Saenuri floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk had remained more adamant, saying that the party leadership “will not tolerate” attempts to break away from the party’s general direction.Lee vowed to continue his hunger strike, maintaining his claim that Chung has failed to remain politically neutral and must step down. Speaker Chung maintained that he has acted according to parliamentary regulations and that he has no reason to apologize during a meeting with the foreign press.Rep. Woo Sang-ho, the floor leader for the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea, had welcomed Lee‘s announcement and said it would help “normalize” the Assembly.“I assess  as giving in to the pressure from the people, that they  cannot abandon the parliamentary audit which takes care of people‘s lives. It has been my consistent position that the parliament’s discussion of the state affairs cannot be discarded under any circumstances,” he said, adding that Lee‘s remarks came as a complete surprise. The ruling party said Wednesday it will press criminal charges against the Assembly speaker for libel due to his alleged spreading of false information. The ruling party has accused Chung of falsely claiming to have reached an agreement with both ruling and opposition parties to start a parliamentary session Saturday. The attending opposition lawmakers approved a resolution to recommend the dismissal of newly appointed Agriculture Minister Kim Jae-soo. The Saenuri Party said Chung failed to remain politically neutral.After President Park Geun-hye’s veto of the recommendation Monday, Kim was named to the post. Kim has been marred by multiple allegations including questionable real estate transactions and receiving a bank loan at a suspiciously low rate.Saenuri subsequently commenced a boycott of the audit, but there have been growing calls for the ruling party to scrap its protests from the opposition as well as within the party. Choo Mi-ae, the leader of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea, accused Lee of acting solely on the president’s behalf.Earlier in the day, she called the Saenuri leader and urged him to stop the hunger strike “for the people” and carry out political actions “in a normal way.” Friction within the Saenuri Party was hinted at Tuesday when Rep. Kim Young-woo, the head of the parliamentary Defense Committee, defied the party’s leadership and attempted to participate in the audit.Kim was prevented from doing so when fellow party members -- including former leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung -- entered his office and stopped him from leaving.The Assembly’s Strategy and Finance Committee Chairman Rep. Cho Kyoung-tae, who is also a Saenuri Party member, appeared open to resuming the audit, as he convened a meeting Wednesday with members of the main and opposition party of the committee to discuss conditions. They failed to reach an agreement.Both chairmen Kim and Cho, along with other members such as Rep. Ha Tae-keung, who had called for the resumption of the audit against their party’s boycott, belong to the party’s minority faction. Prior to Lee’s announcement, members of the opposition bloc and Saenuri had commenced talks on the Chung conundrum.Minor opposition People’s Party floor leader Rep. Park Jie-won said the floor leaders of the three parties had reached an agreement to end the current impasse but Speaker Chung had rejected it.Rep. Woo, however, countered Park’s claim, saying there has been no agreement as Saenuri refused to cease calls for the speaker’s resignation.By Yoon Min-sik","the chairman on hunger strike ,pickets calling for the resignation ,stop the hunger strike for ,wednesday decided against their chief ,leaving the chairman on hunger","['Saenuri Party', 'the National Assembly', 'Lee Jung - hyun‘s', 'Min Kyung - wook', 'Saenuri Party', 'National Assembly', 'Chung Sye - kyun', 'Assembly', 'Chung Sye - kyun', 'Lee', 'Saenuri', 'Chung Sye - kyun', 'Lee', 'Chung ’s', 'Saenuri ’s', 'Lee', 'Chung ’s', 'Saenuri', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'Lee', 'Chung', 'Chung', 'Woo Sang - ho', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Assembly', 'Assembly', 'Chung', 'Agriculture', 'Kim Jae - soo', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Chung', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Saenuri', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Lee', 'Saenuri', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Kim Young', 'Defense Committee', 'Kim', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'the Assembly ’s Strategy', 'Finance Committee', 'Cho Kyoung - tae', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim', 'Cho', 'Ha Tae - keung', 'Saenuri', 'Chung', 'People ’s Party', 'Park Jie - won', 'Chung', 'Woo', 'Saenuri', 'Yoon Min - sik']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48724437  0.25057784

The Improper Solicitation and Graft Act bans members of civil agencies, private educational institutions and media from giving and receiving free meals, presents or monetary gifts respectively worth 30,000 won , 50,000 won and 100,000 won or higher. The “Kim Young-ran” law, named after the former chief of the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission who initiated the drive in 2011, is forecast to bring about a sweeping shift in a culture that has long cherished generous hospitality and exchanges of presents as an intrinsic part of business. Some 4 million people from more than 49,000 organizations are subject to the legislation. Violators could face a fine of up to 30 million won or imprisonment for a maximum of three years, irrespective of the existence of a direct link between the gift and a favor. “We expect the act would help create a clean society where everyone can compete on a level playing field, and provide a turning point to sharply increase our national rectitude,” Cheong Wa Dae spokesperson Jeong Yeon-kuk told reporters. A restaurant selling Korean beef located near the government complex in Sejong City remains vacant during lunch Wednesday, when the anti-solicitation act came into effect. At noon around Gwanghwamun in downtown Seoul, traditional Korean restaurants frequented by officials and lawyers appeared less full, even though many of them had lowered the prices of their lunch courses below the 30,000 won ceiling. Some storied diners had already shut down or changed their menus, such as to everyday food. “We have only two rooms out of eight booked today, but the real problem is dinnertime, because that involves alcohol,” a restaurant owner said. “I think it’s more about the atmosphere of the first day of the law’s effectuation and things will get better hopefully over time.” A server at a Korean beef place in Mapo-gu, where a district court, prosecutors’ office and police station are located, said: “We are just doing fine, which was anticipated because we offer rice soups and table d’hote menus at reasonable prices for lunch as before. But given the higher prices of our main barbecue options, we are thinking to introduce additional cheaper dinner options.” The cafeteria at the Education Ministry in Sejong City is crowded with officials during lunch hours Wednesday, when the anti-solicitation act came into effect. To boost understanding and minimize confusion, public agencies, businesses and schools have been holding briefing sessions, distributing guidelines and taking written oaths to abide by the law from their employees. “Though we teachers did receive education, there is lingering confusion such as regarding what if parents bring things like coffee or pastries as usual when they visit to consult on their children, and the report process looks a bit too complex, unrealistic or has much room for interpretation,” said Jeong Hye-yeon, a 31-year-old instructor at a high school in Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province. Concerns remain that the legislation may further dampen consumer sentiment in an already flagging economy. It could reinforce bureaucracy and prompt daunted civil servants to further shun contact with the people, critics say.Initial backlash came from cattle growers, fruit farmers and fishermen, as well as small and mid-sized firms. Their yearly boons typically come around the Chuseok and New Year holidays, when many Koreans exchange costly gift packages of high-quality beef, homegrown fruit and fish in a display of gratitude and respect. With the legislation having now taken effect, however, thorough enforcement should be a top priority and any revisions be explored later if necessary to shore it up, officials said. Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn has also called for related state agencies to encourage an “active attitude” among the officials and eliminate uncertainties through the commission’s authoritative interpretations. “For the act to take root in a stable manner and contribute to making a clean, transparent society, it’s more important than anything to prevent confusion at an early phase of its implementation,” he said at a videoconference Cabinet meeting Tuesday.

After a two-week investigation of various products, Rep. Lee Jeong-mi of the minor Justice Party found that some 3,000 tons of Chloromethyl-methylisothiazolone, a synthetic biocide and preservative commonly referred to as CMIT/MIT, were distributed to 30 local and foreign manufacturers through Miwon Chemicals. Rep. Lee Jeong-mi of the People’s Party questions the environment minister during the parliamentary audit on Tuesday. The firms allegedly used the substance to make toothpastes, soaps, body and bath products and laundry detergents, according to the findings. A total of 11 toothpastes made by the nation’s largest cosmetics-maker AmorePacific were found to contain up to 0.0044 parts per million of CMIT/MIT. The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety said that it will withdraw the 11 toothpastes, including AmorePacific’s signature brands Pine Salt and Median. The ministry imposed a suspension of business on the firm, forbidding it from producing toothpastes for three months. “The toothpastes in question contain up to 0.0044 ppm of CMIT/MIT. It is not harmful to human health as it is rinsed away with water after brushing the teeth,” said an official from the drug ministry, citing that up to 14 ppm of the substance is allowed to be used in toothpastes in other countries.The CMIT/MIT, which is thought to affect the lungs, was designated a toxic substance by the Environment Ministry in 2012. The substance is banned from use in making toothpastes in Korea. The lawmaker released a list of 30 companies that Miwon Chemicals provided the chemical substance. On the list were AmorePacific, Aegyeong and Coreana Cosmetics. The foreign manufacturers include two American companies -- Norman Fox & Co and Vivion -- Russian firm Zao Rushkhimset, Japanese Kozekura Shoukai and Indian Lupin Chemicals.The lawmaker criticized the government for “loosely managing sanitary supplies.” “The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, as well as the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, should conduct a comprehensive inspection together to see which products contain the substance,” said Lee in a press release. “It was found that the Drug Ministry has not at all overseen the use of CMIT/MIT and it was not even aware of the relevant facts.” AmorePacific apologized Tuesday to customers for causing concerns over safety of its toothpastes.“We found that a very small amount of CMIT/MIT was contained in sodium lauryl sulfate, which we were provided by a chemical company,” it said in a press release. “We feel the responsibility for using improper substance. We should have more thoroughly managed the use of substance to offer safe products to customers.” The company and the ministry were allegedly not aware that the harmful substance was used to make products until the lawmaker informed them.The firm said that customers who bought the 11 recalled toothpastes can return them or exchange them from nearby stores. There is no need to present a receipt. Used items can also be returned. AmorePacific and Aekyung account for 25.6 percent and 17.8 percent, respectively, of the toothpaste market, according to industry watchers. AmorePacific’s toothpaste brand Median alone has 20.1 percent market share. The revelation comes amid persistent suspicions over the safety of everyday products, as the country saw toxic humidifier sterilizers claimed more than 900 lives over the past decade. South Korean authorities confirmed a link between humidifier disinfectants and lung-related diseases in 2011.

Kim Young-woo of the Saenuri Party was to hold an afternoon session at around 2 p.m. but was blocked at around 11 a.m. by fellow party members including former leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung. They entered Kim Young-woo’s office and prevented him from leaving for about three hours. The chairman had declared earlier in the day that he was returning to the audit, as the nation is facing a security crisis and needs the parliamentary process to go on. Former Saenuri Party leader Kim Moo-sung  and other lawmakers enter the office of National Defense Committee Chairman Rep. Kim Young-woo  at the National Assembly on Tuesday. “I do agree that the National Assembly speaker conducted a biased proceeding of the parliament. However, even so, I cannot refuse to hold the audit. It would be a violation of democracy,” said the committee chairman in a text message sent to reporters. “What would happen to a country where the Defense Committee cannot convene at a time of threats from North Korea and its nuclear weapon?”The Saenuri Party has been staging a boycott of the audit since Monday in protest against the opposition parties’ passage of a bill recommending the president to sack the agriculture minister who has been questioned for his ethical standards. The party is also demanding a resignation of National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun, who they said facilitated the opposition by agreeing to hold a plenary session on midnight Saturday without the attendance of ruling party members, thereby going against his duty to stay neutral.Chung has repeated his refusal to step down, telling an audience during a seminar Tuesday that the role of a speaker is “not something that anyone can ignore or undermine.”Later in the afternoon, the Saenuri Party submitted a proposal to take discipline action against the speaker and demand his resignation. In the statement, they argued that Chung -- who gave up his membership in The Minjoo Party of Korea upon being elected as speaker -- violated laws in steering the plenary session in favor of opposition parties.“We think that the speaker has moved beyond the point where we can tolerate his behavior,” said Rep. Chun Hee-Kyung who supported the motion along with fellow lawmakers. “We believe that we can secure a majority to pass the motion.”For the motion to clear the Assembly, it needs to gain approval from more than half of the 300-strong Assembly. Currently, the Saenuri Party holds 129 seats, with three opposition parties securing a total of 165 seats. Saenuri leader Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, meanwhile, entered the second day of his hunger strike, vowing to continue until the speaker steps down. “I never would have started if I just wanted to give in and accept their demand,” Lee told the lawmakersAmong meetings of the 12 standing committees originally set to take place earlier in the day, only seven committees chaired by opposition parties, such as a legislative committee, were held. The other six committees headed by the Saenuri Party was canceled, as its chairman and members refused to hold the meetings. The Defense Committee was scheduled to question the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but the session was suspended as the opposition lawmakers left the venue, saying they may seek a brief transfer of the right to convene the meeting from the chairperson.Throughout the three-hour scuffle at his office, Kim traded barbs with the lawmakers who prevented him from leaving. Inside Kim’s office, an unidentified lawmaker was heard telling the third-term lawmaker that they were “doing this to save you.”Kim, minutes later, was heard saying, “Please let me go. You have always talked of reform .” After the standoff ended, Kim came out and told reporters he would seek to convene the committee’s audit. Saenuri Party heavyweights, such as fifth-term lawmaker Rep. Chung Byoung-gug, rebuked Kim Young-woo for ignoring the party’s decision. “I think it is a party member’s duty to follow the guidelines set by the party leadership,” Chung told reporters. The Minjoo Party of Korea, meanwhile, applauded Kim for his decision, saying it was “worthy of respect” for showing responsibility as a member of a ruling conservative party.By Yeo Jun-suk","audit since monday in protest ,hour scuffle at his office ,president to sack the agriculture ,since monday in protest against ,plenary session on midnight saturday","['Saenuri Party ’s', 'the National Assembly ’s Defense Committee', 'Kim Young', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Kim Young - woo', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'National Defense Committee', 'Kim Young', 'the National Assembly', 'the National Assembly', 'the Defense Committee', 'North Korea', 'Saenuri Party', 'National Assembly', 'Chung Sye - kyun', 'Chung', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Chung', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Chun Hee - Kyung', 'Assembly', 'Assembly', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'Lee', 'the Saenuri Party', 'the Defense Committee', 'the Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Saenuri Party', 'Chung Byoung', 'Kim Young - woo', 'Chung', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Kim', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.16828369  0.2012291

Based in the North Korean-Chinese border city of Dandong, DHID was found to have used front companies, financial facilitators and trade representatives to facilitate transactions on behalf of Korea Kwangson Banking Corp., which is already under UN and US bans for providing financial services in support of the communist state’s proliferation program. The company and four people are subject to a property freeze in the US, and Americans are prohibited from making transactions involving them. The Department of Justice has also filed a civil forfeiture action for all funds in 25 bank accounts linked with DHID, as well as a request for a related restraining order to China.“Today’s action exposes a key illicit network supporting North Korea’s weapons proliferation,” Adam Szubin, the Treasury’s acting under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a statement. “DHID and its employees sought to evade US and UN sanctions, facilitating access to the US financial system by a designated entity. Treasury will take forceful action to pressure North Korea’s proliferation network and to protect the US financial system from abuse.” The firm is a subsidiary of Hongxiang Group, which is under the investigation of Beijing on allegations it has supplied items with potential military uses to Pyongyang. Early this month, the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul and the Center for Advanced Defense Studies in Washington said in a joint report that the conglomerate provided aluminum oxide, pure aluminum ingots, ammonium paratungstate, tungsten trioxide and other “dual use” materials used in enriching uranium or building missiles. The latest announcement came as the UNSC moves to slap a fresh set of sanctions in response to Pyongyang’s fifth nuclear test on Sept. 9. While crafting independent punitive steps at home, Seoul and Washington are intensifying diplomatic efforts to bring Beijing, Pyongyang’s top diplomatic and economic backer, aboard an even more biting resolution. A focal point is whether it would include bans on trade of livelihood goods and energy, as well as “secondary boycott” measures calling for penalties for third-party groups and individuals engaging in transactions with the North.“The recent progress on Hongxiang indicates the resolve of the US and China to tighten its squeeze on North Korea, and would inevitably have some impact on the ongoing UNSC discussions,” a Seoul diplomat said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.

Lee Jung-hyun , former leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung , floor leader Chung Jin-suk and other party officials denounce National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun's constroversial remarks at the National Assembly in Seoul on Monday. The partisan fight -- which escalated upon President Park Geun-hye’s veto of the opposition-led recommendation to dismiss the agriculture minister-designate over the weekend -- blew up into a full-fledged boycott and protests against Speaker Chung Sye-kyun. Chung, a former member of the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea, had arranged for a midnight session Saturday that allowed the opposition to pass the dismissal motion of Agriculture Minister Kim Jae-soo without the attendance of the Saenuri Party. The ruling Saenuri Party’s leader Rep. Lee Jung-hyun stages a hunger strike Monday in his office at the National Assembly. Park Hae-mook/The Korea HeraldThe confrontation was aggravated on Monday upon the leaked voice recording of Chung in a closed-door conversation with a Minjoo Party lawmaker, during which he was heard suggesting the Saenuri Party offer a compromise on other controversial bills in exchange for the withdrawal of the dismissal motion. He was reportedly referring to the legislations designed to extend the working period of parliamentary committee investigating Sewol sinking in 2014 and another committee targeting a right-wing civic group accused of inciting pro-government protest. Both have been blocked by the Saenuri Party.The Saenuri Party vowed to continue to boycott the audit unless Chung resigns for passing the “illegitimate” motion they said lacked due details. “We will never tolerate Chung, who violated parliamentary laws and worked as an advocate for opposition parties,” the Saenuri Party’s floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk told his fellow lawmakers at the party’s general assembly. “I mistook him for something that he was not.” Saenuri Party leader Rep. Lee Jung-hyun said he will go on hunger strike until the speaker leaves his post. The party leadership decided to stage a sit-in at the National Assembly to add pressure against Chung and file a petition to the Constitutional Court to determine whether the speaker abused his power. For his part, Chung said that his taped remarks were merely an “expression of regret” over legislative impasse and that he was playing a meditating role to offer the Saenuri Party a “legitimate reason” to break the deadlock.As the standoff intensified, Chung proposed the opposition parties push back the parliamentary audit for a couple of days. During the meeting with leadership from the Minjoo Party and runner-up opposition People’s Party, he asked them to postpone the session until the Saenuri Party returns to the floor.The People’s Party interim leader Rep. Park Jie-won agreed to the suggestion and said he would seek consensus among the fellow lawmakers. “We shouldn’t run the business unilaterally, as President Park Geun-hye has done so far,” Park was quoted as saying.The Minjoo Party, on the other hand, rejected the proposal and pledged to hold the session as planned for the time being. “Though we cannot rule out all the scenario, we won’t change our plan,” said the Minjoo Party spokesman Rep. Ki Dong-min.

Song Young-gil of The Minjoo Party of Korea said that after analyzing the reports by the relevant ministries, most of the budget requests for preparatory measures, such as expanding aseismic designs, have been denied.For the budget between 2015 and 2017, the MPSS requested 51.3 billion won, 69.9 billion won and 19.7 billion won, respectively, to undertake various preparatory measures. The requests for 2015 and 2016 were denied completely, while 1.2 billion won was set aside for 2017, Song said.Song also said that they have heard from earthquake-related officials that they had a hard time persuading the need to maintain the earthquake division under the Disaster Management Office when establishing the MPSS in 2014. These officials also reportedly claimed to have heard from the government that it would be “more economical” to subsidize the cost for damage repair rather than investing in preparatory measures.Gyeongju city officials on Sept. 18 work on covering damaged roofs of houses with nets and tents after the area suffered a 5.8 magnitude earthquake the previous week. “Safety measures without due personnel and budget are impossible. While the Park administration changed the names of relevant ministries numerous times upon the Sewol ferry sinking disaster , no safety has been maintained,” Song said.Earlier this month, the country’s strongest recorded quake rattled Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province, and the surrounding regions.The government later designated the city as a special disaster zone to help the estimated damage speculated to reach more than 7.5 billion won. Nearly 100 cases of damage have been found on historical artifacts. “Now the budget estimated by the MPSS to implement earthquake preparatory measures reaches over 84 billion won. We could not even confirm the budget needed by organizations such as the Cultural Heritage Administration that manages our cultural assets,” Song said.","magnitude earthquake the previous week ,140 billion won in budget ,lawmaker said monday rep song ,billion won nearly 100 cases ,past three years the ministry","['the Ministry of Public Safety and Security', 'Song Young', 'the Minjoo Party', 'MPSS', 'Song', 'Song', 'the Disaster Management Office', 'gyeongju', 'song', 'Gyeongju', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'the Cultural Heritage Administration', 'Song']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.31690806  0.44194415

Afternoon operations from Tuesday to next Monday, however, will be reduced to around 80 to 85 percent of their normal levels should unionized workers go on strike as planned, it said. The strike by subway workers, if carried out, will be the first in 12 years since the last one took place in 2004.The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport also has said the country's railway services will run without any major disruption. It plans to expand other means of transportation, such as buses, to cover the routes with reduced train services.The government and unionized workers have said they will continue to seek a resolution until the very start of the strike, but those close to the negotiations said chances of an agreement are slim.The new wage system is part of the Park Geun-hye administration's efforts to boost labor flexibility to create more jobs, especially for the young generation.Some 120 public companies and institutions are in the process of adopting the new wage program, with some of their unions protesting the move.","the strike by subway workers ,walkout scheduled to begin tuesday ,their unions protesting the move ,vacancies afternoon operations from tuesday ,strike by subway workers","[""South Korea 's"", 'the Federation of Korean Public Industry Trade Unions', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.19367264 -0.12355316

The Saenuri and the presidential office have argued the dismissal motion was politically motivated and had nothing to do with actual wrongdoing.In a voice recording obtained by the Saenuri, Chung, who is originally from the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea, said the ruling party should not ""ask something for free.""Political observers said the recording came after Chung unknowingly left his microphone on during the session.""They  should bring up something, whether it be  Sewol or something else, but they are not doing it,"" Chung said in the recording to an unidentified person.The Sewol ferry, which sunk on April 16, 2014, was en route to the southern resort island of Jeju from Incheon, west of Seoul, with a total of 476 passengers. Most of the 304 dead were high school students on a field trip.The incident dealt a harsh blow to the government for its failure to properly rescue the passengers, as well as its negligence in overseeing the safety regulations of local ships. The opposition has tried to extend the probe as long as possible, while the government has objected to such a move, pointing out that the investigation's duration has officially expired.""The recording is evidence that  condemned an innocent minister as part of a bargaining ploy,"" the Saenuri said in a statement, adding Chung should resign from his current post.Chung's political neutrality was also questioned earlier after he seems to have sided with the opposition bloc's stance on the deployment of an advanced U.S. missile defense system.While the government claims the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery is important in defending the country from North Korea's provocations, the opposition parties claim that the move may make Beijing and Moscow uncomfortable, and should be reconsidered.Chung, however, said the latest remark was only an expression of regret that the ruling and opposition parties failed to narrow their differences on key issues.""Politics is about conversation and compromise,"" Chung said about the leaked recording, adding parties failed to come up with a solution due to the rigid stance of Saenuri lawmakers.","ruling party boycotted the vote ,leaked recording adding parties failed ,sack the agricultural minister last ,last week south korea opposition ,party on monday cast doubt","[""South Korea 's"", 'Saenuri Party', 'National Assembly', 'Chung Sye - kyun', ""South Korea 's"", 'Cabinet', 'Saenuri', 'Saenuri', 'Chung', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Chung', 'Chung', 'Jeju', 'Seoul', 'Saenuri', 'Chung', 'Chung', 'U.S.', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', ""North Korea 's"", 'Beijing', 'Moscow', 'Chung', 'Chung', 'Saenuri']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68143499  0.0988321

Yonhap“President Park decided to reject the dismissal recommendation,” said Cheong Wa Dae Spokesperson Jeong Yeong-guk. He asserted that the parliamentary motion was irrelevant to the minister’s job qualification and the allegations against Kim, such as ethical lapses, were cleared during his hearing. A day before, the president had hinted at her veto, denouncing the National Assembly for passing a motion she said “lacked formal procedure” at a time when South Korea faces economic and security challenges. During a plenary session held at midnight on Saturday, the Assembly endorsed the dismissal motion 160 to 7, with three counted as invalid. All Saenuri members, totaling 129, boycotted the vote in protest of the session, despite their opposition.The ruling Saenuri Party pledged to boycott all parliamentary sessions -- including audit sessions scheduled to kick off Monday -- unless The Minjoo Party of Korea and National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun apologized and resigned over the decision to push through dismissal bill. “No matter how much  want to take power, they shouldn’t do such things,” Saenuri Party Chairman Rep. Lee Jung-hyun said in an emergency meeting. Not only did the party decide to boycott all parliamentary sessions chaired by the speaker, they also decided to seek to press criminal charges against Chung for abusing his power. The main opposition Minjoo Party and runner-up opposition the People’s Party, on the other hand, denounced President Park and the Saenuri Party for undermining the democratic process by neglecting parliamentary procedure.    “President Park’s decision is the epitome of her arrogance and her lack of communication with the Assembly and the people,” said the Minjoo Party Spokesman Rep. Ki Dong-min. “It is something we cannot tolerate.” The opposition parties also shunned the Saenuri Party’s call for the speaker’s resignation and urged them to join the audit as planned. “We agreed to hold the parliamentary audit as scheduled, even if the ruling party boycotts the session,” said the Minjoo Party floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho. Saenuri lawmakers claimed that Assembly Speaker Chung violated parliamentary laws by holding the midnight session without due coordination procedure. The session was held upon the proposal of the speaker.“Without coordination with political parties, the speaker cannot hold additional plenary sessions,” said Rep. Kim Do-eup, the Saenuri Party’s deputy floor leader, referring to clause 77 of Assembly law, requiring the speaker to consult with political parties to change parliamentary schedules. The speaker refuted the notion, saying his decision was made in accordance with parliamentary laws. The Assembly’s Secretariat said in a statement Sunday that the speaker had consulted with the ruling party before the vote and holding the session was “inevitable” to finalize the issue before a deadline.By law, the legislative body must hold a plenary session to deal with a motion to recommend the dismissal of a cabinet member during a time frame of between 24 and 72 hours after the motion was submitted to the floor. The dismissal recommendation was submitted on Thursday at 10 a.m. and the deadline was set between Friday 10 a.m. and Sunday 10 a.m. The parliamentary audit was originally scheduled to be held for 20 days from Sept. 26. The sessions are expected to target about 700 entities and 3,000 witnesses -- including top government officials and chaebol owners such as Cho Yang-ho, chairman of Hanjin Group, whose shipping company filed for bankruptcy.   Among top political agenda items at the audit is the controversy over the president’s close associates’ alleged attempts to raise illicit funds through the Mir Foundation and K-Sports Foundation.

This followed two strong earthquakes that hit the city on Sept. 12. The larger quake, which was felt throughout South Korea, was the strongest ever recorded on the Korean Peninsula.Wednesday's quake was one of the stronger aftershocks among 423 tremors detected as of 2 p.m. Thursday since the two big quakes hit the historical city, the KMA said during a press briefing held at its office in Seoul. The weather agency said aftershocks of magnitude between 3.0 and 4.0 can occur down the road, though it could not predict when they will end.The KMA said it will dispatch a task force in charge of on-site studies to the city. The team, comprised of scholars and other experts, will analyze the influence of the series of quakes until the end of March. Meanwhile, the weather agency corrected the epicenter of the5.8 quake to 8.7 km southwest from the city from the originally reported 8 km. The epicenter of the first quake that happened less than an hour before the strongest one was also corrected from 9 km southwest from the city to 8.2 km away.The meteorological agency also said it will reduce the time it takes to send alert messages to the public. There have been calls to improve the current system as the alert messages did not immediately reach the residents near the quake-hit region when they occurred.The KMA plans to directly send the warning messages starting in November in the event of an emergency. At present, the notification goes through the Ministry of Public Safety and Security, a process which has been cited for causing the delay.The KMA said it will also increase the number of seismic stations in the country to 315 by 2018 from the current 206.","aftershock exceeding the magnitude quake ,stronger aftershocks among 423 tremors ,the korean peninsula wednesday quake ,korean peninsula wednesday quake ,two big quakes hit the","[""South Korea 's"", 'the Korea Meteorological Administration', 'Gyeongju', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'KMA', 'Seoul', 'KMA', 'KMA', 'the Ministry of Public Safety and Security', 'KMA']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.1283953   0.37240076

Woo Won-shik of the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea, as well as Rep. Ha Tae-keung of the ruling Saenuri Party, Rep. Jung Choun-sook of the Minjoo Party and Rep. Kim Sam-hwa of the People’s Party.Their first schedule involved visiting a group of victims’ relatives who were holding a protest near Downing Street in London, where the UK Prime Minister’s Office is located.Their next schedule involved visiting the Reckitt Benckiser headquarters and talking with the CEO Rakesh Kapoor on Wednesday.“We will make sure to get an apology from RB. RB has maintained that it has not been aware of the situation that was the responsibility of its , but a number of data and hearings have shown that the headquarters had actually been involved and were at the forefront of all developments, including tests,” said Woo. He added that he brought all the necessary evidence with his team.Lawmakers belonging to the special committee on the humidifier disinfectant case talk with families of the victims near the Prime Ministers Office in London on Tuesday. In May, former CEOs and officials at Oxy Reckitt Benckiser -- formally renamed Reckitt Benckiser Korea in 2014 -- were arrested by the prosecution and fined for falsely advertising their product as “safe for humans.”The humidifier case first came to light in August 2011 after four pregnant women died of lung failure. A government-led investigation found that chemicals used to clean humidifiers were to blame. The authorities confirmed 221 victims, 95 of whom died, after using the products made by several consumer goods companies, including largely Oxy.RB Korea announced in July that it would provide up to 350 million won  in compensation to each Korean victim of its lethal humidifier sanitizers.Under the final plan, Oxy will compensate victims at least 150 million won if they were categorized by the government investigation as classes 1 or 2, meaning that it is highly likely that exposure to Oxy’s products led to their deaths.Compensation of 1 billion won will be given for infant and child victims’ deaths due to the seriousness of the related suffering and difficulty in calculating potential earning losses, the company had said.The final plan does not address the victims’ previous demands for compensation packages for victims classified under categories 3 and 4, whose suffering was deemed less directly related to humidifier sanitizers.","tuesday in may former ceos ,humidifier disinfectant deaths began three ,after four pregnant women died ,ceo rakesh kapoor on wednesday ,on tuesday to meet representatives","['UK', 'Woo Won - shik', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Ha Tae - keung', 'Saenuri Party', 'Jung Choun -', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Kim Sam - hwa', 'the People ’s Party', 'London', 'UK', 'Prime Minister ’s Office', 'Reckitt Benckiser', 'Rakesh Kapoor', 'Woo', 'the Prime Ministers Office', 'London', 'Oxy Reckitt Benckiser', 'Reckitt Benckiser Korea', 'Oxy', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Oxy', 'Oxy ’s']",7,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.55741376  0.78578591

The emergency alert system via text messages was issued about 10 minutes after the tremors were felt by residents in North Gyeongsang Province. “We come to realize how vulnerable our country is to earthquakes and that there is almost no safety measures to prevent them,” said Rep. Park Myung-jae of the ruling Saenuri Party representing Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province. Rep. Park Chan-woo of the Saenuri Party echoed the criticism, questioning the government’s ability to come up with comprehensive measures against disasters. “Disaster manuals turned out to be irrelevant to real-life situations and public workers are poorly trained,” Park said.The lawmakers pointed out that the Safety Ministry did not include evacuation training for potential earthquakes in its annual safety drill held between May 16 and 20. They also took note of “antiquated and inaccurate” information compared to countries with advanced disaster measures such as Japan. Park In-young , the minster of public safety and security, replies to a question from Rep. Kim Sung-tae of the Saenuri Party during the interpellation session at the National Assembly on Tuesday. YonhapPark In-yong, minister of public safety and security, acknowledged the agency’s lackluster warning system and vowed to overhaul it by eliminating the time gap in the earthquake detection system used by the Safety Ministry and the weather agency.Minister Park said that the ministry’s current warning system requires additional time before broadcasting to the public because its system, which he said was not as accurate as that of the weather agency, has to go through additional vetting.Opposition parties also criticized the government for making worse the safety concerns among the public who have been unsettled over a series of disasters such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2015 and the Sewol ferry sinking in 2014. “It is so shocking that there has been no changes to government safety protocols even though we went through MERS and the Sewol crisis,” said Rep. Won Hae-young of The Minjoo Party of the Korea.In response to public outcry upon the Sewol sinking, which left 304 dead or missing, the government had carried out a system overhaul by disbanding the coast guard and creating the Ministry of Public Safety and Security by integrating the divided roles of the administrative and maritime ministries and maritime police to improve disaster prevention systems.Rival parties, meanwhile, clashed over the government’s stance on North Korea’s mounting nuclear threat following its nuclear test earlier this month. The Saenuri Party called for prompt deployment of a US advanced missile system to improve Seoul’s deterrence capability, while opposition parties urged the government to tone down its hawkish stance toward the North. Rep. Kim Sung-tae of the Saenuri Party said that the government should promptly deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system batteries here and criticized opposition parties’ ambiguous position on the security measure.Meanwhile, lawmakers from the Minjoo Party and the People’s Party suggested the government adopt an engagement policy with the North such as by sending humanitarian support to help its massive flooding. Rep. Kim Boo-kyum of the Minjoo Party said that President Park Geun-hye should send UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon as a special envoy for the task. Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn dismissed the idea during the session, saying now is the time for the government to maintain its stern policy and that inter-Korean dialogue, including a summit between the two Koreas, remain off the table unless the North abandons its nuclear ambition.By Yeo Jun-suk","record breaking earthquake and aftershocks ,potential earthquakes in its annual ,magnitude earthquake that rattled gyeongju ,breaking earthquake and aftershocks in ,earthquakes in its annual","['Gyeongju', 'the Ministry of Public Safety and Security', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'Park Myung - jae', 'Saenuri Party', 'Pohang', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'Park Chan - woo', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Park', 'the Safety Ministry', 'Japan', 'Kim Sung - tae', 'the Saenuri Party', 'the National Assembly', 'YonhapPark', 'the Safety Ministry', 'Park', 'Won Hae - young', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'the Ministry of Public Safety and Security', 'North Korea ’s', 'the Saenuri Party', 'US', 'Seoul', 'Kim Sung - tae', 'the Saenuri Party', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'the Minjoo Party', 'the People ’s Party', 'Kim Boo - kyum', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Park Geun', 'UN', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'inter - korean', 'Koreas', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45708218  0.24792908

Lee Jung-hyun  talks with Supreme Council member Rep. Cho Won-jin during a party meeting at the National Assembly on Monday. Ahn Hoon/The Korea HeraldThe ruling conservative Saenuri Party, on the other hand, is vowing to place all focus on the people’s livelihoods, blaming the opposition circles for holding back the government’s economic revitalization plans. It is also expected to accentuate the imminent security threats upon North Korea’s latest nuclear test to impart stronger control of state affairs to the Park administration.“During the Chuseok holidays, the public has increasingly voiced out complaints against the government’s faulty administration over the past 3 1/2 years,” said the Minjoo Party’s vice floor leader Rep. Park Wan-joo at a party meeting.The leading opposition party thus vowed to clarify the administration’s liability in the aggravation of the domestic economy, especially over the fall of the shipbuilding and shipping industries.It is also set to blast upon the government for lacking a diplomatic paradigm in the face of North Korea’s repeated ballistic missile launches and the strongest-yet nuclear test on Sept. 9.Spearheading the questions in the domestic politics sector will be Rep. Cho Eung-cheon, recognized for his aggressive stance against ruling powers.Cho, who formerly served as presidential secretary for civil service discipline under President Park in 2013-2014, turned his back on the Blue House after he leaked internal documents. He is also expected to press the presidential office to speak out on Woo Byung-woo, a disgraced senior presidential aide who for months has been caught up in bribery scandals.“Saenuri will focus on issues concerning the people’s daily livelihoods and also address national security, an issue of growing importance since North Korea’s fifth nuclear test,” said the party’s vice floor leader Rep. Kim Do-eup.Leading the party’s talks in the foreign affairs session will be Rep. Lee Cheol-woo, a third-termer and chairman of the parliamentary intelligence committee.Lee, a former senior official at the National Intelligence Service, is expected to reiterate the party’s strong antipathy toward the reclusive neighbor state’s military aggressions and to advocate the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, an advanced US anti-missile battery to be deployed here.The opposition camp, however, is not likely to address the THAAD issue directly during this week’s questioning sessions.“We will call the government to account for raising diplomatic tensions in the Northeast Asian region with the THAAD announcement, rather than expressing disapproval over the deployment itself,” said a Minjoo Party official who refused to be named.The party’s “toned-down” response is seen as reflecting the public’s increased sense of crisis over national security, following the North’s fifth nuclear test on Sept. 9.The People’s Party is set to take the lead in the social affairs sector, with former judge and lawyer Rep. Cho Bae-sook calling for the establishment of an independent agency dedicated to the probe of high-ranking officials’ corruption cases.The interpellation, the first to take place since the regular parliamentary session kicked off earlier this month, will cover four sectors -- domestic politics, foreign affairs, economy and social affairs.Questioners will consist of five lawmakers from the Saenuri Party, another five from the Minjoo Party, two from the runner-up opposition People’s Party and one not affiliated with a parliamentary bargaining unit.

He has not only denounced the trade deal with Korea, but also vowed to pull out of the 12-nation TPP and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement .Trump also reiterated that wealthy allies should pay more for US defense support.""I have great respect for Japan but as you know, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend South Korea, we have 28,000 soldiers right now in South Korea.

Their calls, officially denied by the government, are joined by some of the opposition members but are also met with criticism from both within and outside the party for being unrealistic and dangerous.Since joining the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty in 1975, South Korea has been banned from acquiring nuclear weapons. The government reiterated Monday that it would neither seek nuclear armament nor push for the redeployment of a US tactical nuclear weapon in South Korea. Earlier on Thursday, Defense Minister Han Min-koo said “there is a limitation” to nuclear armament. Defense Minister Han Min-koo  on Monday attends the meeting for nuclear armament at the National Assembly along with the Saenuri Party’s lawmakers and security experts. Park Hae-mook/The Korea Herald.The Saenuri Party’s leader Rep. Lee Jung-hyun egged on the debate by saying Sunday that the government should consider all measures against Pyongyang’s nuclear threat. “It is time to put even unthinkable options on the table,” he said, hinting at the possibility for nuclear armament. A group of Saenuri lawmakers who formed a parliamentary group calling for nuclear armament demanded Monday that the government develop a nuclear submarine on its own and redeploy US tactical nuclear weapons. In September 1991, former US president George H. W. Bush withdrew tactical nuclear weapons from Korea under his campaign to reduce nuclear arsenal known as the “Presidential Nuclear Initiative.” Three months later, the two Koreas signed the Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Led by former Saenuri floor leader Rep. Won Yoo-chul as well as more than a dozen of his fellow party members, the group said in a statement that the National Assembly should build a bipartisan legislative body to come up with specific measures for nuclear armament. But dissenting voices emerged even among the hawkish wing of Saenuri lawmakers. They described nuclear armament as “far-fetched” because any damage to the NPT and other non-nuclear agreements would seriously strain ties with Washington as well as the international community.“ is an unrealistic choice. It would only lead to South Korea’s diplomatic and economic isolation,” said Rep. Yoon Sang-hyun in a media interview. Yoon was a member of the Assembly’s Foreign Affairs, Trade and Unification Committee and had served as presidential secretary for civil affairs for President Park Geun-hye.Citing US President Obama’s pledge to maintain a non-nuclear policy on the Korean Peninsula and the extended deterrence to South Korea, Yoon said that Washington would never agree to Seoul’s nuclear armament or the redeployment of US tactical nuclear weapons. The opposition parties also denounced the calls, accusing the pro-nuclear lawmakers of engaging in a political stunt to promote their profile. “I can’t help but think that the nuclear armament is a politicized campaign to cover up the government’s failure in containing cross-border tension,” said Rep. Yoon Kwan-suk, a spokesman of the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea. Yoon asserted that if the government seeks to develop or deploy a nuclear weapon, it would lose moral grounds to criticize Pyongyang for obtaining nukes in violation of the 1991 denuclearization pact.The People’s Party interim leader Rep. Park Jie-won also condemned the nuclear armament initiative. “Nuclear armament is a dangerous and irresponsible policy and could bring another war on the Korean Peninsula. They should stop promoting a populistic approach to security matters,” he said. Meanwhile, some opposition lawmakers joined calls to rethink Korea’s current defense strategy.Rep. Kim Chong-in, the former chairman of the Minjoo Party, said in a Facebook post, “It is hoped that the president and leaders of the three parties have a detailed and substantial discussion on reviewing the redeployment of tactical nuclear  of the USFK, tasks that need to be accomplished during next month’s Korea-US Military Committee Meeting and the Security Consultative Meeting, and measures against North Korea’s additional nuclear test within this year, to dissolve the anxiety felt by the people.”","accusing the pro nuclear lawmakers ,nuclear test is fueling fierce ,the pro nuclear lawmakers ,nuclear armament but dissenting voices ,won also condemned the nuclear","['North Korea ’s', 'South Korea', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty', 'South Korea', 'US', 'South Korea', 'Defense', 'Han Min - koo', 'Han Min - koo', 'the National Assembly', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'Park Hae - mook', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'Pyongyang', 'Saenuri', 'US', 'US', 'George H.

234,234,Clinton: Time for ‘rethinking’ of US approach to North Korea,"Hillary Clinton said Friday it was time for a “rethinking” of America’s strategy for North Korea following the regime’s latest test of a nuclear weapon. Donald Trump’s campaign chief, meanwhile, refused to outline the Republican presidential candidate’s plans for defusing tensions on the Korean Peninsula.Speaking after meeting with a bipartisan group of national security experts in New York, the former secretar...","Hillary Clinton said Friday it was time for a “rethinking” of America’s strategy for North Korea following the regime’s latest test of a nuclear weapon. Donald Trump’s campaign chief, meanwhile, refused to outline the Republican presidential candidate’s plans for defusing tensions on the Korean Peninsula.Speaking after meeting with a bipartisan group of national security experts in New York, the former secretary of state said she would seek to impose tougher sanctions on the communist nation. She also argued the latest test provides an opening to pressure China, which has been tepid in its response to North Korea’s nuclear ambitions.“I think we have an opening here that we haven’t had for the last several years that I intend to do everything I can to take advantage of,” Clinton said. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary ClintonClinton spoke hours after Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, pressed repeatedly on Trump’s plans for the region, said only, “He wouldn’t do what’s being done now.”“He’s not going to reveal all of his plans and he’s made that very clear. And maybe someone can ask him in a debate,” Conway told “CBS This Morning.” `’But the fact is that this entire world would be put on notice that there’s a strong leader in the White House.”North Korea’s latest atomic test was its fifth, and the second in eight months. South Korean President Park Geun-hye said the detonation, which Seoul estimated was the North’s biggest ever in explosive yield, was an act of “fanatic recklessness” and a sign that leader Kim Jong Un “is spiraling out of control.”President Barack Obama condemned the test and said the US would never accept the country as a nuclear power.In an afternoon speech to a group of conservative activists, Trump used the North Korean development to attack Clinton, describing the situation as “one more massive failure from a failed secretary of state.” He did not say whether he had a plan to address North Korea’s claim the test will allow it to build an array of stronger, smaller and lighter nuclear weapons.Trump also suggested Clinton and others are wrong to outline their national security policies, because doing so could help the nation’s enemies. “Maybe we shouldn’t be so honest when it comes to military strategy,” he said.Clinton said the United States would not let North Korea pursue a nuclear weapon and said that as president, she would seek new sanctions in addition to those endorsed by the Obama administration and adopted earlier in the year with the United Nations. She added she would back allies in the region, including South Korea and Japan.But she also said she would support the kind of negotiations that a group of countries engaged in with Iran over its nuclear program, because sanctions “aren’t enough.” The US must ensure China applies increasing pressure on North Korea, too.“North Korea poses a threat to the region and poses a threat to the kind of stable border relationship that China has always valued with North Korea,” she said.The development in North Korea comes at the end of a week in which Trump and Clinton clashed repeatedly over national security.The New York billionaire attacked Clinton’s record as the nation’s chief diplomat, yet he faced criticism from within his own party for refusing to outline his plans for combating foreign policy challenges, including threats posed by the Islamic State group. Trump said this week that he does indeed have a plan, but would convene military leaders in his first 30 days in office to craft another plan.Trump has also faced criticism for praising Russian President Vladimir Putin during a high-profile national security forum earlier in the week, and appearing on a Russian-backed television network Thursday evening.On Friday, Clinton said she was “disappointed” by Trump’s decision to appear on RT America, saying that “every day that goes by this just becomes more and more of a reality television show. It’s not a serious presidential campaign.”With several prominent Republican national security officials already concerned about Trump’s national security acumen, Clinton has tried to cast herself as the better potential commander in chief. She has aggressively promoted her growing list of military endorsements from both parties.On Friday, her campaign said the number of retired generals and admirals endorsing Clinton for president has grown to 110. Trump quickly countered by saying his list had ballooned to 120 former US generals and admirals earlier in the week.Trump’s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, received his first intelligence briefing Friday. The vice presidential nominee said he was “grateful” for the “thorough and informative” briefing, but declined to offer any specifics since the information was classified.Trump was set to appear at a Friday night rally in Pensacola, Florida. Continuing her aggressive fundraising push, Clinton was to appear at two fundraisers in New York. One of them is an LGBT event featuring Barbra Streisand.Clinton is getting some help from another wealthy backer as well. Billionaire Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz said Friday he’s giving $20 million to help defeat Trump.","korean development to attack clinton ,hours after trump campaign manager ,said democratic presidential candidate hillary ,nuclear weapons trump also suggested ,north korea latest atomic test","['Hillary Clinton', 'America', 'North Korea', 'Donald Trump ’s', 'republican', 'New York', 'China', 'North Korea ’s', 'Clinton', 'democratic', 'Hillary ClintonClinton', 'Trump', 'Kellyanne Conway', 'Trump ’s', 'Conway', 'the White House', 'Korea', 'south korean', 'Park Geun', 'Seoul', 'North ’s', 'Kim Jong Un', 'Barack Obama', 'US', 'Trump', 'north korean', 'Clinton', 'North Korea ’s', 'Clinton', 'Clinton', 'the United States', 'North Korea', 'Obama', 'the United Nations', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Iran', 'US', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Korea', 'China', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'Trump', 'Clinton', 'New York', 'Clinton ’s', 'Islamic', 'State', 'trump', 'russian', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Russian', 'Clinton', 'Trump ’s', 'republican', 'Trump ’s', 'Clinton', 'Clinton', 'US', 'trump ’s', 'Indiana', 'Mike Pence', 'Pensacola', 'Florida', 'Clinton', 'New York', 'lgbt', 'Barbra Streisand', 'Clinton', 'Dustin Moskovitz', 'Trump']",9,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.7914778   0.34534451

It will mark the first time since 2003 that the head of the liberal-leaning political party will visit Chun.Former President Chun Doo-hwan Chun, who was president of the country for seven years from 1981, remains a controversial figure among the liberal opposition bloc for his alleged involvement in the crackdown on the May 18 democracy movement in 1980. Tens of thousands of citizens rose up in Gwangju against the military junta led by Chun, who seized power in a December 1979 coup. The government officially maintains that about 200 people were killed in the crackdown, although some put the estimate higher. Chun was sentenced to death in 1996 for his part in the suppression of the uprising but was later pardoned.Political pundits said Choo's visit may spark opposition from other party members, especially from those from the South Jeolla Province and Gwangju.Shortly after her appointment in late August, Choo also paid tribute to late president Park Chung-hee, the father of incumbent President Park Geun-hye, at the Seoul National Cemetery, also sparking a controversy.","doo hwan next week political ,year presidential race close aide ,next year presidential race ,next year presidential race close ,of next year presidential race","['Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Chun Doo - hwan', 'Choo', 'Chun', 'Chun Doo - hwan', 'Chun', 'Chun', 'Chun', 'Choo', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Park Geun - hye']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.8186183   0.54655349

Choo Mi-ae said South Korea should move beyond a conglomerate-dominated, export-driven economy toward a “fair economy” by revamping the tax code and increasing the corporate tax rate.The Minjoo Party of Korea chairperson Rep. Choo Mi-ae delivers a speech at the National Assembly on Tuesday, under the chairmanship of parliamentary speaker Chung Sye-kyun. But the opposition chief tried to steer clear of politically sensitive issues, including the bribery scandal involving senior presidential secretary for civil affairs Woo Byung-woo. Instead, she proposed a one-on-one meeting with President Park to address agendas concerning the people’s livelihood.“Political interests cannot take precedence over our people’s livelihood,” said the party leader in an address to lawmakers. “Regardless of ideological and partisan differences, the government and the Assembly must be practical in doing their business.” The fifth-term lawmaker, who has echoed the idea of “economic democratization” advocated by her predecessor Rep. Kim Chong-in, devoted much of her speech to highlighting the economic challenges facing Korea and the government’s inability to navigate the issue. Using the collapse of South Korea’s biggest container shipping company, Hanjin Shipping Co., as an example, Choo asserted the nation’s economy is “in a state of emergency,” and criticized President Park for sticking to the “antiquated” economic policy implemented during her father’s presidency between the 1960s and 1970s“President Park is now losing the main industry built during her father’s term,” Choo said. “Her economic policy is just dependent upon her father’s growth plan. She is just missing the success story achieved by her father.” Instead, the chairwoman demanded that the government and businesses implement a fair salary system, overhaul the tax code system and increase the corporate tax rate. She asserted that the measures would ensure fairness in taxation and improve wealth distribution.

The rest said they were likely to not vote at all. Participants in the survey were 140 prominent figures and opinion leaders in the Korean-American community, according to researchers. Some 68.6 percent of them were in the 30-40 age group, while the male-to-female ratio was about 47:53. Of the respondents, 74 had annual income of over $150,000, with about 16 percent saying they make over $500,000 a year.The results indicated that support for Clinton was higher even among Republicans in the group, as 25 identified themselves as Republicans, but only six said they would likely vote for Trump.  Hilary Clinton  and Donald Trump . Yonhap“Not many  Republicans will vote for Trump as there is a growing feeling among Korean-Americans that he is somewhat ‘dangerous’ when it comes to Korea-US relations,” commented lead researcher Lee Je-hoon, a research associate professor and director of the Center for Asian-Pacific Leadership at the USC School of Social Work.The Republican candidate, who has gained a reputation for his eccentric personality and brash remarks, has startled Koreans by attacking the Seoul-Washington free trade agreement and saying the US should withdraw its troops from the country if Korea doesn’t shoulder more costs.Lee’s findings showed that Korean-Americans are greatly interested in Korean affairs, as around 60 percent of respondents said they consume Korea-related news either daily or weekly. About 81 percent said that Korea-US relations are at least “somewhat important” when deciding who to vote for as president, indicating that Clinton’s comfortable lead was due to concern that Trump winning the presidency would be detrimental to the alliance.The USC Center for Asian-Pacific Leadership, the organizer of NetKAL, aims at promoting leadership education for Asians and Asian-Americans and strengthening their communities.By Yoon Min-sik","republicans will vote for trump ,that trump winning the presidency ,trump for their next president ,vote for trump hilary clinton ,many republicans will vote for","['korean', 'US', 'Hilary Clinton', 'Donald Trump', 'US', 'the University of Southern California ’s Network', 'Clinton', 'US', 'Trump', 'korean', 'Clinton', 'Republicans', 'Republicans', 'Trump', 'Hilary Clinton', 'Donald Trump', 'Republicans', 'Trump', 'Korean', 'Korea', 'US', 'Lee Je - hoon', 'the Center for Asian - Pacific Leadership', 'the USC School of Social Work', 'republican', 'Koreans', 'Seoul', 'US', 'Korea', 'Lee', 'Korean', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'US', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'the USC Center', 'netkal', 'Asians', 'Asian - Americans', 'Yoon Min - sik']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.7341463   0.48503116

The so-called ""no first use"" policy has unnerved allies relying on US nuclear weapons for their security.U.S. President Barack Obama speaks during a news conference. ""US officials have occasionally considered adopting a 'no first use' pledge, but the policy has remained largely unchanged since the end of the Cold War,"" the CRS report said. ""The absence of a 'no first use' pledge is less about the perceived need to employ these weapons first in a conflict than it is about the view that the threat of nuclear escalation continues to serve as a deterrent to large-scale conventional war or the use of chemical and biological weapons,"" it said.Supporters of the current policy fear that removing the threat of nuclear escalation could ""embolden countries like North Korea, China or Russia, who might believe that they could overwhelm US allies in their regions and take advantage of local or regional conventional advantages before the United States or its allies could respond,"" the report said.The no first use policy could also undermine allies' confidence in the US commitment to their defense and possibly ""spur them to acquire their own nuclear weapons,"" which in turn would undermine US nuclear nonproliferation goals, it said.But the report also noted that advocates of a ""no first use"" policy assert a lack of evidence that the threat of nuclear escalation can deter conventional war, while arguing that US nuclear first use might spark a nuclear response and an all-out nuclear exchange.""As a result, they conclude that the possible first use of nuclear weapons is not only unnecessary but also might turn conventional war into a nuclear catastrophe. Moreover, they argue that 'no first use' would support US nonproliferation goals by demonstrating that the United States accepted a limited role for its nuclear force,"" the report said.Both military and civilian officials in the Obama Administration oppose a ""no first use"" pledge, the report said, adding that Adm. Cecil Haney, commander of the Strategic Command; Secretary of State John Kerry; Secretary of Defense Ash Carter; and Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz have raised concerns.Congress remains divided, with some, like Sen. Dianne Feinstein , arguing that the only moral use for US nuclear weapons is as a deterrent to their use. Others, such as Rep.

It will document cases of Pyongyang’s rights violations and information regarding separated families, abductees and prisoners of war. The director-general-level organization is supposed to deliver the results of its works to an archive to be installed under the Justice Ministry every three months. The ministry also plans to create a new bureau that will oversee North Korean rights-related tasks while taking over other existing divisions responsible for the separated families issues, defector resettlement support and humanitarian assistance. “By now, there is sufficient consensus formed in the international community that the quality of lives of North Koreans has to be improved, and the overall human rights situation there has to be improved,” ministry spokesperson Jeong Joon-hee said Friday, referring to similar laws enacted in countries such as the US and Japan. “So it’s time for the North, too, to face up to the reality and strive to advance the rights of its people, instead of decrying and disparaging the South’s efforts.”  The image taken on Aug. 29 from Paju, Gyeonggi Province, shows towns near the inter-Korean border where the South and North Korean flags flap respectively. In Seoul, the legislative campaign was initiated in 2005 by then Saenuri Party lawmaker and former Gyeonggi Province Gov. Kim Moon-su, one year after the US put in place its own act. But the issue had since been a source of partisan bickering until it gathered international traction in recent years which culminated in a watershed February 2014 report of the UN Commission of Inquiry. Then last March, a more comprehensive bill passed the National Assembly. The landmark act reflects South Korea’s approach to separately deal with the Kim Jong-un regime and its oppressed, isolated rank-and-file citizens. In her Liberation Day address on Aug. 15, President Park Geun-hye called for the North’s “officials and ordinary people” to join endeavors for reunification. With global support being key to changes, the law called for the Foreign Ministry to appoint an ambassador for North Korean human rights. The Unification Ministry will also establish a policy advisory committee.By keeping track of cases of political persecution and coercion, Seoul expects to secure grounds to hold Kim and other perpetrators accountable someday, while ratcheting up pressure on the regime in the short term. The US, for instance, placed the young ruler and other 14 executives and eight entities on its sanctions blacklist over human rights abuses for the first time last July. South Korea is exploring taking a similar “naming-and-shaming” step, officials said.  “The regime’s violations of its people’s basic rights to freedom and life constitute a grave crime, and it’s an issue that should be handled not only within the domestic justice system after unification, but also from an international criminal law’s aspect from now on,” Kim Han-kyun, a researcher at the Korean Institute of Criminology, said in his recent report. “In particular, managing the archive and inter-Korean human rights dialogue would help establish the foundation for a post-unification criminal system and policies.” Pyongyang has been ferociously resisting the drive as a plot to topple its system, arguing that such human rights issues do not and cannot exist there. “ is an act that is as ridiculous, futile and blind as trying to break a rock with an egg,” the North’s Measure Council for Human Rights in South Korea said Thursday through state media, threatening the Park administration with “destruction.” The official Korean Central News Agency also accused the president and her aides of inciting confrontation Friday, saying they deserved “being trampled.” Sources of contention linger, however, with the act defining applicable targets as “persons who have their domicile, lineal ascendants and descendants, spouse, workplace and other bases of living north of the Military Demarcation Line.” This could complicate support for North Koreans in a third country seeking to enter the South. The text also failed to carry concrete steps or a detailed agenda to bring about a inter-Korean human rights dialogue. Any talks appear far-fetched at this point, given Seoul’s “no-dialogue” principles -- unless the North makes progress in denuclearization -- as well as Pyongyang’s unbridled nuclear and missile provocations and refusal to accept the rights problems. “With regard to defectors in a third country, we will need to make a prudent decision taking comprehensively into account diplomatic relations and other issues involved,” a senior Unification Ministry official told reporters last week, adding details of future programs are to be hammered out.By Shin Hyon-hee","last march more comprehensive bill ,aides of inciting confrontation friday ,july south korea is exploring ,sunday fueling momentum for decade ,new law on north korea","['North Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'the Unification Ministry', 'Pyongyang', 'the Justice Ministry', 'north korean', 'North Koreans', 'Jeong Joon - hee', 'US', 'Japan', 'Paju', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'inter - korean', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'Saenuri Party', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Kim Moon - su', 'US', 'the UN Commission of Inquiry', 'the National Assembly', 'South Korea ’s', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Park Geun', 'the Foreign Ministry', 'north korean', 'the Unification Ministry', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'US', 'South Korea', 'Kim Han - kyun', 'the Korean Institute of Criminology', 'inter - korean', 'Pyongyang', 'the North ’s measure Council for Human Rights in', 'South Korea', 'Park', 'Korean Central News Agency', 'the Military Demarcation Line', 'North Koreans', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Unification Ministry', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57383114  0.51469046

YonhapFollowing a bilateral summit on Saturday, President Park underlined the persisting military threats from North Korea, in an apparent move to defend the forthcoming installment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense here.“North Korea’s increasing nuclear and ballistic missile threats are a matter of life and death to us as we lay within minutes range ,” Park said in a joint conference held at the Far Eastern University in Vladivostok.“Any responsible government would take all possible measures so as to protect the nation’s security and the people’s lives.”Unless the international society addresses the North’s nuclear program in a firm manner, global peace and security will be put at risk, she added.Park also claimed that the two states agreed to “strengthen strategic communication” in order to solve the North Korean issue.The summit between the two states, being the fourth of its kind, was held on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic forum, an occasion to discuss regional cooperation in developing Russia’s underexploited Far East region.The Russian president shared Park’s view, albeit with more caution.“Standing against North Korea’s nuclear proliferation, we urge that the North abides by the resolution adopted by the international community and the UN Security Council,” Putin said during the EEF session earlier in the day.He, however, called for cautious negotiations so as “not to provoke the  leadership.”The idea of installing THAAD in the southern part of the Korean Peninsula by end of 2017 has been causing uneasiness among Korea‘s neighboring states, such as China and Russia.Along with their improved diplomatic ties, Seoul and Moscow also agreed to co-work for a free trade deal between South Korea and the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union.Negotiations will begin as early as next month, as soon as the civilian feasibility study is wrapped up, according to Kang Seog-hoon, senior presidential secretary for economic affairs.Kicked off in January 2015, the EAEU comprises of a population of 180 million and a gross domestic product of $1.6 trillion.Cheong Wa Dae also claimed that the one-on-one business consultation sessions, an event affiliated with the state leader’s visit to Russia, led to a potential economic outcome worth some $210 million.Following her itinerary in Russia, Park arrived in Hangzhou, eastern China, on Sunday to attend a summit of the Group of 20, during which she is slated to meet Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping.By Bae Hyun-jung","bilateral summit on saturday president ,summit on saturday president park ,russia yonhapfollowing bilateral summit on ,on saturday president park underlined ,yonhapfollowing bilateral summit on saturday","['South Korea', 'Russia', 'North Korea ’s', 'Park Geun', 'US', 'russian', 'Vladimir Putin', 'northeast asian', 'Park Geun', 'russian', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Vladivostok', 'Russia', 'Park', 'North Korea', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'Korea', 'Park', 'the Far Eastern University', 'Vladivostok', 'North ’s', 'north korean', 'the Eastern Economic', 'Russia', 'russian', 'Park ’s', 'North Korea ’s', 'the UN Security Council', 'Putin', 'EEF', 'korea‘s', 'China', 'Russia', 'Seoul', 'Moscow', 'South Korea', 'Russia', 'Eurasian Economic Union', 'Kang Seog - hoon', 'Dae', 'Russia', 'Russia', 'Park', 'Hangzhou', 'China', 'Group of 20', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.25225785  0.54366457

Vice speaker Park Joo-sun was chosen to preside over the session in place of Chung upon the Saenuri’s request.National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun  shakes hands with the Saenuri Party`s floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk on Friday afternoon. Chung had prompted Saenuri lawmakers to lodge a protest and walk out of the first plenary session of the 20th Assembly after he commented in his opening speech on senior presidential secretary Woo Byung-woo and the disputed deployment of advanced US antimissile system.The ruling party slammed the speaker for violating neutrality as he criticized Woo’s refusal to resign despite undergoing a corruption probe, and the way the decision to install Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system was made. Former member of The Minjoo Party of Korea, Chung is currently formally unassociated with the party in accordance with the Assembly rules. After a night of confrontation at Chung’s office, the Saenuri lawmakers continued to demand for Chung’s apology and a promise against a recurrence, or a resignation.Chung, for his part, has defended his remarks as speaking on behalf of the people and offered instead to issue an apology for causing delays in the parliamentary passage of 11 trillion-won supplementary budget. The Saenuri Party refused Chung’s offer as of the afternoon.The passage of the extra budget had been crucial amid faltering exports and slowing domestic demand.The extra bill, initially scheduled to be approved by Aug. 12, was delayed for the third time as the rival parties locked horns over the details. The Assembly is also set to start reviewing next year’s budget submitted by the government on Friday.The final version of the extra budget bill placed a hike in the school facility improvement funds and a cut in foreign exchange bonds and state-run bank investments, marking an overall drop of 105.4 billion won. The National Assembly Budget Office had warned that if the supplementary budget is not implemented within the third quarter, it would lead to some 3,000 job losses and a 0.02 percentage point drop in economic growth rate.Meanwhile, the parliamentary committee on culture, sports and tourism on Friday adopted a confirmation report concluding that culture minister nomine Cho Yoon-sun is unfit for the job, in a session boycotted by the ruling Saenuri Party members. The Saenuri Party members had also refused to attend Cho’s hearing held on Wednesday over a separate scuffle regarding the extra budget bill.Cheong Wa Dae said earlier in the day that it will push ahead with the appointment of Cho as the new culture minister, along with new agriculture minister nominee Kim Jae-soo.

The first trial gave Jang 12 years in prison, with his actions condemned as “psychological murder and unpardonable abuse of human dignity.”However, in the second appeals trial the verdict was reduced to eight years following the victim’s wishes and due to omission of a few charges from the legal documents.Jang had hired the victim to work for his academic society but later began to abuse him for his “unsatisfactory work style.”Jang’s other pupils Jang, 25, and Jeong, 28, were respectively given four and two years in prison for taking part in the violence.Another accomplice Kim, 30, did not appeal for retrial and will go through the 18-month term he received in the original trial.

Woo Sang-ho, floor leader of The Minjoo Party of Korea.Rep. Park Jie-won, floor leader and interim chief of the runner-up People’s Party, accused the state powers of “pulling a blunt knife on Woo, while thrusting a razor at Lee.”Complaints also came from within the ruling conservative Saenuri Party, especially from those classified as reformists, in contrast to those close to President Park Geun-hye.“The fact that Woo maintains his position as senior presidential aide for civil affairs is an obstacle to the prosecutorial probe,” said the Saenuri’s Rep.

It's directed at the threat from North Korea,"" Rhodes said of THAAD. ""And so long as North Korea is developing ballistic missile capabilities and moving forward with its nuclear program, we have an obligation, a responsibility, for our own security and the security of our allies in Japan and the Republic of Korea to take steps to counter that threat.""Noting that China has expressed concerns about THAAD, Rhodes stressed that the most important thing is to continue to apply pressure on the North Koreans to change course.

Choo Mi-ae responds to cheers upon her election at the party‘s national convention held in Seoul on Saturday. “I will consider each and every vote I got as a heaven-sent command to cure division , make a strong opposition by unification and win in a fair presidential race on July 20, 2017 by any means. I will serve by winning,” she said, after winning 54 percent approval to Rep. Lee Jong-kul’s 23.8 percent and Kim Sang-gon’s 22 percent to easily take the race. She became the first female party leader and the first chief from the “TK” region, referring to Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province, which has traditionally been a stronghold for Saenuri and President Park.Choo defined division, defeatism and “old politics” as those that should be eradicated during her leadership.The five-time lawmaker has been calling for party members to rally on key points of dispute. She has been endorsed by the party’s mainstream faction that stands behind former party leader Moon Jae-in and the late former president Roh Moo-hyun. This includes on where the Minjoo Party stands on the upcoming deployment of the US’ Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile system. The preceding Kim Chong-in leadership had publicly agreed with the deployment, with the outgoing leader going as far as saying that THAAD was “inevitable,” considering North Korea’s ballistic missile threats and the importance of the Seoul-Washington alliance.But contrary to Kim’s overall neutral stance, Choo has vowed to make clear where the party stands on the THAAD issue. She backed her resolve by saying she will adopt rejection of THAAD as an official plank of the party platform.Pundits say this makes the possibility of a coalition with minor opposition parties People’s Party of Korea and Justice Party more likely, as they are already publicly opposed to the government’s THAAD plans.A Choo-led Minjoo Party is also expected to take a firmer approach on issues related to the investigation on the deadly sinking of the Sewol ferry in 2014. While the government has decided to dissolve the Sewol Special Committee investigating the tragedy, the bereaved families of victims have been requesting an extension of its term and called for the Minjoo Party to work with them on revising the related law.Choo has vowed she will extend the term of the committee to “unveil the truth that the Park administration has been struggling to hide.”The fifth-termer has also pledged a different approach on economic reform than the Park administration, which includes reducing the wage gap between guaranteed and non-guaranteed contract workers and having corporations use their funds for job creation, supporting affiliated companies in exchange for tax benefits.Speculation is growing that the 20th National Assembly may be muddled with confrontations as the Saenuri Party similarly selected Park loyalist Rep. Lee Jung-hyun as its new chairman. The apparent dominance of the pro-Moon faction has sparked concerns that minor factions will be mostly ignored within the party. Cho Guk, a professor at Seoul National University who supported Kim Sang-gon in the race, wrote via his Facebook account that “minor presidential candidates” such as Seoul Mayor Park Won-sun and South Chungnam Province Gov. Ahn Hee-jung may be discouraged from competing for the presidential candidacy. Although both Choo and President Park were born in the city of Daegu, Choo’s family background contrasts drastically with that of Park’s. While Park’s father, Park Chung-hee, was the dictatorial leader of the country across the 1960s and 1970s, Choo’s father ran a local laundry shop. Despite being a Daegu-native, Choo eventually became an “adopted daughter” of the largely Gwangju and Jeolla Province-based opposition block. She worked as a judge for the Gwangju High Court before iconic former president Kim Dae-jung led her to politics. Choo became a key member of the opposition under the Kim and Roh administrations.While considered part of the pro-Moon faction, Choo has somewhat of a complicated history with the Minjoo Party’s former leader. Dating back to 2003, the lawmaker voted for the impeachment of then-president Roh. The liberal leader was Moon’s political ally and close friend, which remains one of the key rallying points for the opposition bloc.The two have mended ties since then, with Choo making gestures like participating in Moon’s 2012 presidential bid. Choo, who represents Gwangjin-gu of Seoul, has apologized for her involvement in Roh’s impeachment, calling it “the worst mistake” of her political career.By Yoon Min-sik","korea in sweeping victory saturday ,win in fair presidential race ,cheers upon her election ,race in an acceptance speech ,presidential race in an acceptance","['the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'New Minjoo Party', 'Choo Mi', 'Seoul', 'Lee Jong - kul ’s', 'Kim Sang - gon ’s', 'Daegu', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'Saenuri', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'the Minjoo Party', 'US', 'Kim Chong - in', 'North Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'Choo', 'thaad', 'People ’s Party', 'Korea', 'Justice Party', 'Minjoo Party', 'the Sewol Special Committee', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Park', 'National Assembly', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'Cho Guk', 'Seoul National University', 'Kim Sang - gon', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - sun', 'Ahn Hee - jung', 'Choo', 'Park', 'Daegu', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Choo ’s', 'Daegu - native', 'Choo', 'Jeolla Province', 'the Gwangju High Court', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'Kim', 'Roh', 'Choo', 'the Minjoo Party ’s', 'Roh', 'Moon ’s', 'Moon ’s 2012', 'Gwangjin', 'Seoul', 'Roh ’s', 'Yoon Min - sik']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40754968  0.37282789

YonhapEarlier this week, the company management and union leaders struck a deal to raise the monthly base pay of an employee by 58,000 won . Each worker will also receive 350 percent of the base monthly payment and an additional 3.3 million won in performance incentives.Many members of the labor union were apparently displeased with the wage hike rates.Under the 2015 deal, their monthly salary went up by 85,000 won along with a 400 percent bonus and an additional 4.2 million won in incentives.The labor union has also struggled with internal conflicts among several factions, inside sources said, adding some members of the union even staged an unannounced campaign to vote down the agreement.It remains uncertain that a new wage agreement will be reached before Chuseok, the Korean Thanksgiving holiday, in mid-September.The management claims relatively small pay hikes are inevitable due to unfavorable business conditions both at home and abroad.""Operating profits have decreased each year since recording 8.44 trillion won in 2012.

In July 2015, the nation's top court returned to a lower court a ruling that convicted former spy chief Won Sei-hoon of willfully neglecting to check online posts made by his subordinates that slandered opponents of Park in the runup to the election.

Also, the government will provide up to 2 million won  per month to men on paternity leave for three months, the ministry said.The measures came after the number of newborns in the January-May period decreased by 10,000 from a year ago despite the government's measures announced earlier this year.The number of newborns in the country came to 34,400 in May, down 5.8 percent from a year earlier. It marked the lowest monthly level since Statistics Korea began compiling such data in 2000.Again, the number of childbirths here dropped to a six-month low of 32,900 in June.Medical costs for infertility treatment had so far been covered by national health insurance only to couples with low income. In order to qualify for the subsidy, a couple had to earn less than 150 percent of the national average monthly income, which is about 5.3 million won.The ministry said medical costs for infertility treatments, including three sets of artificial insemination and a maximum of four sets of external fertilization, will be covered by national health insurance.For artificial insemination, a couple can receive up to 500,000 won for each procedure, which is about half of the total cost, while a maximum of 2.4 million won is given to each round of an external fertilization.The ministry said the number of couples forecast to receive the subsidy will increase from the current 50,000 to 96,000.In order to help families with children, the government said it will increase the subsidy to households with a father taking parental leave from the current 1.5 million to 2 million per month.The government has been encouraging paternity leave, including turning unpaid leave into paid leave in 2001 and extending the age limit for children in 2008.Also, families, where both the husband and wife work with more than three children will have priority access to daycare centers, the ministry said.Under the measure, households with dual income and more than three children will be guaranteed priority in enrolling their children to both state and private daycare centers as well as kindergartens.Families with three children and a single income will also be given priority, the ministry said, noting that dual income families with two children will soon have more benefits as well.A total of some 60,000 infants from dual income families with more than three children are currently waiting to be admitted to daycare centers across the country.Also, the government will support small-and-medium sized firms to construct a system that allows more workers to stay at home while working. Under the measures, public officials or those working at state-run companies with more than three children will be given priority in choosing a place of work, the ministry said.The ministry said it expects the number of newborns next year to increase by additional 20,000 thanks due to the measures.Health and Welfare Minister Chung Chin-youb announced a statement, urging business entities to actively participate in tackling the low birth rate problem.""The problem of low birth rate is a grave task that will greatly influence the national future. Unless it is solved, we cannot pursue sound and sustained development,"" said Chung.South Korea has one of the lowest birth rates among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development members, stoking concern that it could cripple the country's growth potential and possibly result in more welfare expenses.According to data by Statistics Korea, some 435,400 babies were born last year, down around 1,000, or 0.2 percent, from a year earlier. It marked the second straight year of on-year decline and was the lowest since 2005, when around 435,000 babies were born.","paternity leave for three months ,additional 20 000 next year ,government on thursday rolled out ,newborns next year to increase ,million won per month","['Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare', 'Statistics Korea', 'Chung Chin - youb', 'Chung', 'South Korea', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'Statistics Korea']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68823224  0.20568229

Led by Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, the government taskforce aimed at combating corruption, released a report on the condition of school meals and a set of measures to improve the situation at a ministerial meeting. During the inspection from April to July, the taskforce uncovered a total of 677 cases in which the School Meals Act were breached, such as through the poor sanitation of ingredients, failure in quality control and dubious deals between lunch operators and food suppliers. The group, which comprises the Food and Drug Safety Ministry, Agriculture Ministry, Education Ministry and local education offices, probed 274 out of 11,698 schools providing students with school meals, as well as 2,415 food production and distribution companies. The taskforce filed a complaint about 45 cases and imposed administrative punishment on 157 cases.The team found 487 cases in which schools granted deals to some food firms at the expense of the quality of food through an unfair bidding process. Of these cases, 16 involved bid rigging and schools’ cozy relationships with food firms owned by school staff members’ families and acquaintances. According to the probe, some nutritionists ordered food items from particular companies in return for rebates such as gifts, cash cards and movie tickets. Four food firms -- Dongwon, Daesang, CJ Freshway and Pulmuone -- are suspected of offering kickbacks worth 1.6 billion won to nutritionists at 3,000 schools for the past 2 1/2 years in exchange for a business contract to procure food ingredients for school meals. The taskforce found that dubious deals led to shady execution of the schools’ budgets, an increase in food prices and the poor quality control of ingredients for school lunches. A total of 68 cases involved the lax monitoring of cooking staff’s health conditions, poor hygiene in handling ingredients, false reports about the sanitary of storage rooms and vehicles transporting food. In 118 cases, schools failed to inspect the quality of ingredients, using food whose expiry date was over or whose country of origin was falsified About 6.14 million students at 11,698 elementary, middle and high schools across the country enjoy school meals daily as of 2015, costing the government 56 trillion won in budget. Following the inspection, the government laid out a plan to improve the quality and safety of school meals and root out unfair practices by 2017. The government plans to set up a website and mobile application dedicated to informing the public of results of the evaluation on school meals hygiene and safety as well as the ingredient supply system. It will develop a standardized menu to narrow differences in the quality of school meals in 17 cities and order a regular inspection of food suppliers. Some 170 parents will be tasked with overseeing school-operated kitchens and meals across the country. Meanwhile, some 730 students at five schools in Seoul, Busan, Daegu and Bonghwa across the nation showed symptoms of food poisoning after having school meals, health authorities said Tuesday. The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety cited food ingredients spoiled by the continued heat wave as a cause and it has collected cooking tools, water and food from the schools for a relevant agency to conduct an in-depth investigation. The results are expected in about a week. The Education Ministry and the MFDS rolled out a plan to prevent food poisoning from spreading to other schools at a news briefing later in the day. The ministries said that it will bring forward a scheduled inspection on school kitchens and food supplier to Wednesday. It will also adopt a quicker system to find out the cause of the food poisoning and to inform other schools of a possible breakout of the disease.

Local broadcaster MBC reported last Tuesday that Lee exposed details of the investigation into Woo’s case to a local media outlet through a messaging app. Under the law, a special inspector can face a jail term of up to five years for leaking information about the ongoing probe. To reporters on his way to his office in central Seoul, he said, “Isn’t it the government’s policy that suspicions don’t necessarily lead to resignations?” He refused to comment further on the ongoing investigation into Woo as well as the alleged information leak, saying it was “inappropriate.” Woo has been under investigation for allegedly misappropriating funds from his family-run company and abusing his status to help his son get assigned to a relatively easy military post during his national service. Special inspector Lee Seok-su answers reporters’ questions on his way to his office in Seoul on Monday.

Realmeter attributed the outcome to a surprise defection of a high-profile North Korea diplomat overshadowing the issue.The survey was conducted between Tuesday and Friday.

Ki Dong-min.”But the Saenuri is constantly looking away from the issue and shifting the blame onto the opposition.“Amid the partisan stalemate, however, some officials speculated that parties could reach a last-minute compromise to pass the budget bill within the week.“In order for the budget bill to take the anticipated pump-priming effect, it has to obtain parliamentary approval by Wednesday at the latest,” said an official of the National Assembly, explaining that a one or two-day delay would not cause major setbacks.By Bae Hyun-jung","assembly standoff over the weekend ,weekend posing last minute challenges ,sunday blasted the minjoo party ,the weekend posing last minute ,plotting massive injection of government","['Assembly', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Saenuri Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'the People ’s Party', 'Kim Myung - yeon', 'Kim Do -', 'Kim', 'Minjoo Party', 'Saenuri', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Minjoo', 'Park Wan - joo', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Finance', 'Choi Kyung - hwan', 'an Chong - bum', 'Korea Development Bank', 'Minjoo‘s', 'Ki Dong - min', 'Saenuri', 'the National Assembly', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55454028  0.5432353

The allies picked a South Korean air defense base in Seongju as the original site for the THAAD placement, but it is in the proximity of residents' farm and houses.""At first, all county residents formed a united front in voicing opposition against the THAAD deployment here. But since talks about an alternative site have been raised, their opinions have divided,"" a resident said.","anti missile system failed saturday ,protest residents of the southern ,system failed saturday to discuss ,missile system failed saturday ,government should scrap its plan","['U.S.', 'Seongju', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Seongju', ""North Korea 's"", 'South Korea', 'south korean', 'Seongju']",13,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.35695866  0.00103683

Advocates of the Night Tube also emphasise its benefits on the rest of the cultural sector, with theatres and galleries now able to stay open late if visitors can get home.""This is about offering access to people who work in London throughout the night as well as those who enjoy the entertainment of London as well,"" said Steve Griffiths, chief operating officer for the night tube.""So we are serving many different people with many different requirements and this is fantastic for London and now we are part of that 24/7 operation,"" he added.The new service was inaugurated by London Mayor Sadiq Khan and there are plans to extend the scheme later this year to the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines, with the latter reaching Heathrow airport.It is expected the night tube will transport about 200,000 people between now and the end of the year.The night-time service was scheduled to start in September last year but was delayed by a dispute with trade unions over staff conditions and pay.Concerns have also been expressed about the safety of the new service, after a leaked internal assessment by operating firm Transport for London indicated that sexual offences and other crimes are likely to increase.The British Transport Police are providing 100 more officers to patrol the 144 stations that will be open all night when the service begins.The Tube dates back to 1863 and carries over one billion passengers every year.","midnight at bustling oxford circus ,teacher london has vibrant party ,london midnight at bustling oxford ,london has vibrant party scene ,subways stay open all night","['LONDON', 'Oxford Circus Underground', 'London', 'the Big Smoke', 'Excited Londoners', 'Omar Khan', 'London', 'Jade Hectol', 'London', 'New York', 'Washington', 'Berlin', 'New York', 'Copenhagen', 'London', 'London', 'Steve Griffiths', 'London', 'London', 'Sadiq Khan', 'Piccadilly', 'London', 'the British Transport Police']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66820371  0.29276901

He also has experience in courts as he has served as a judge. It also noted that he carries “balanced values and philosophies such as in history.” The committee also praised his wish to continue his academic activities rather than open a private practice upon his retirement.Since his nomination, Kim has expressed his support for the National Security Law and alternative services for faith-based draft objectors. He has also called for the abolition of capital punishment in written answers to questions during his parliamentary hearing. Supreme Court Justice nominee Kim Jae-hyung takes an oath while attending a parliamentary hearing on his nomination Thursday. Kim, currently a professor at Seoul National University’s School of Law, said that the National Security Law is still crucial for a country in consistent military confrontation with the North and that its pitfalls have been considerably reduced in its interpretation and enforcement through revisions.The committee, however, pointed out that while he did not show any significant “ethical lapses,” his past work with a large law firm in exchange for “large” compensation as a professor at a national university could be considered inappropriate. His relatively lack of experience in criminal law was also noted. Kim was nominated on July 21 to replace retiring Justice Lee In-bok next month. Kim will be officially named to the post after the Assembly’s plenary session endorses the committee’s report, to be followed by the president’s formal appointment.A native of Imsil, North Jeolla Province, Kim graduated from Seoul National University’s School of Law before passing the bar exam. He served as a civil court judge in Seoul from 1992 to 1995. Since 1995, he has moved to his alma mater, and researched and lectured on the civil code.He is to be the second professor-turned-justice at the Supreme Court since former Justice Yang Chang-soo, who served between 2008 and 2014 before returning to the academia.","friday approved supreme court justice ,history the committee also praised ,hearing on his nomination thursday ,the bar exam he served ,friday approved supreme court","['the National Assembly ’s', 'Supreme Court', 'Kim Jae - hyung', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Supreme Court', 'Kim Jae - hyung', 'Kim', 'Seoul National University ’s School of Law', 'Kim', 'Lee', 'Kim', 'Assembly', 'Imsil', 'North Jeolla Province', 'Kim', 'Seoul National University ’s School of Law', 'Seoul', 'the Supreme Court', 'Yang Chang - soo']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.0105765   0.3334026

""Her trip to Russia and China was arranged in the midst of various forms of pressure on South Korea to scrap the THAAD deployment plan,"" Nam Chang-hee, international politics professor at Inha University, said.""Park should stay focused steadfastly on seeking understanding for Seoul's position that the deployment was an inevitable choice in response to Pyongyang's growing missile and nuclear threats."" On Sept. 2, Park will fly to Vladivostok, Russia, for the Eastern Economic Summit and a bilateral meeting with her Russian counterpart, President Vladimir Putin. Following her trip to Russia, she will travel to Hangzhou, China, on Sept. 4 for the Group of 20  summit. Laos will be the last leg of her three-nation trip. From Sept. 7-9, Park will attend the forums related to the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations and a bilateral summit with her Laotian counterpart Bounnhang Vorachith. Photo taken on April 1, shows President Park Geun-hye  shaking hands with her Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping before their talks on the sidelines of the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington, D.C. During the multilateral summits, Park is expected to encounter the leaders of the United States, China and Japan, among others.But her aides said whether Park will hold bilateral summits with any of them is yet to be determined.The South Korean chief executive is expected to capitalize on these gatherings to stress that the planned deployment of THAAD will not target any country other than North Korea.Amid strong opposition from China and Russia, Park has defended the deployment plan as a ""self-defense"" measure, vowing not to bow to any pressure when it comes to the crucial issue of national security.Beijing and Moscow believe that a THAAD battery on the Korean Peninsula would strengthen America's military clout in the Asia-Pacific region and thus undermine their security interests.China's opposition to THAAD, in particular, has caused a diplomatic headache for Park as she has been striving to strengthen the strategic partnership with the Asian power -- despite growing concerns both in Seoul and Washington that South Korea, America's core ally in the region, was tilting too much towards China.Since Park took office in February 2013, the South Korean leader has been trying to shore up trust with China, South Korea's key partner for trade, tourism, as part of a plan to push the North to denuclearize and lay the foundation for reunification of the divided country. The former Lee Myung-bak government gave short shrift to China with its policy thought to have focused inordinately on the US It sought to strengthen the South Korea-US alliance, which had buckled under his predecessor Roh Moo-hyun, who pursued a more ""balanced"" relationship with the country's superpower ally.During her possible encounter with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Park may seek to patch things up with him, the observers said.Ensuring that the international community maintains a united front against the North's nuclear program would be another critical task for Park's multilateral diplomacy drive next month.The vehement opposition from Beijing and Moscow -- the key players in the implementation of international sanctions on North Korea -- has spawned concerns that they could become less willing to faithfully enforce the sanctions due to the THAAD row.In March, the U.N. Security Council imposed the toughest-ever set of sanctions on the communist state for its nuclear test in January and long-range rocket test the following month.""Park may be able to garner China's understanding over the THAAD issue by emphasizing to Xi that Seoul would not have decided to deploy THAAD had Beijing taken a meaningful step to prevent Pyongyang from advancing its nuclear and missile programs,"" Inha University's Nam said.At the multilateral summits in China and Laos, maritime disputes over the South China Sea could also be dealt with at the gatherings, which could put Park in a diplomatically challenging situation.Seoul has maintained that freedom of navigation and flight over the South China Sea should be protected, and that the strategically vital waterway should not be militarized. But it has been cautious not to step into the increasingly sensitive spats over territorial issues centered on the South China Sea.In Laos, Park is expected to seek ways to further strengthen economic ties with the ASEAN, whose regional influence has been increasing since it launched the ASEAN Economic Community late last year, experts pointed out.In recent years, Seoul has intensified efforts to build deeper, wider economic ties with the resource-rich ASEAN that boasts a huge market with the combined population of 632 million. ASEAN is South Korea's second-largest trade partner with two-way trade reaching $119 billion last year.""The ASEAN is rich in natural resources and labor force -- a reason why South Korean companies have been seeking to advance into it,"" Jang Jun-young, Southeast Asia expert at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.Jang added that Seoul needs to expand its diplomatic cooperation with the ASEAN over various issues including North Korea-related ones -- rather than focusing its policy toward the bloc wholly on the economic dimension.","multilateral diplomacy drive next month ,weeklong trip to russia china ,hye summit diplomacy next month ,summit diplomacy next month ,on weeklong trip to russia","['Park Geun', 'US', 'South Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Park', 'Russia', 'China', 'Laos', ""North Korea 's"", 'Beijing', 'Moscow', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'Russia', 'China', 'South Korea', 'Nam Chang - hee', 'Inha University', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Park', 'vladivostok', 'Russia', 'the Eastern Economic Summit', 'russian', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Russia', 'Hangzhou', 'China', 'Laos', 'Park', 'Association of Southeast Asian Nations', 'laotian', 'Bounnhang Vorachith', 'Park Geun', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'the Nuclear Security Summit', 'Washington', 'Park', 'the United States', 'China', 'Japan', 'Park', 'south korean', 'North Korea', 'China', 'Russia', 'Park', 'Beijing', 'Moscow', 'America', 'China', 'Park', 'asian', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'South Korea', 'America', 'China', 'Park', 'south korean', 'China', ""South Korea 's"", 'Lee Myung - bak', 'China', 'US', 'South Korea', 'US', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'Park', 'Park', 'Beijing', 'Moscow', 'North Korea', 'the U.N.

Obama's trip will highlight his ""ongoing commitment to the G-20 as the premier forum for international economic cooperation as well as the U.S. rebalance to Asia and the Pacific,"" Earnest said.After China, Obama will visit Laos for annual regional summits led by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations -- the US-ASEAN Summit and the East Asia Summit -- as well as bilateral meetings with Lao President Bounnhang Vorachith, the White House said.China has strongly protested the decision by Washington and Seoul to deploy a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense unit in South Korea, saying the system, especially the powerful ""X-band"" radar, could be used against it, despite repeated US assurances the system is purely defensive and designed only to cope with North Korean threats.The issue has raised concern that China might be refusing to render full-scale cooperation for international efforts to increase pressure on Pyongyang, including implementing the latest UN Security Council sanctions resolution, in protest of the THAAD deployment decision.After the North's latest missile launches early this month, the US sought to have the Security Council adopt a press statement condemning the firings, but those efforts fell through due reportedly to Chinese insistence the statement also include opposition to THAAD's deployment.The US and China have also been at odds over China's territorial claims in the South China Sea. Last month, an international tribunal rejected China's claims in a victory for the Philippines and other Southeast Asian nations locked in maritime disputes with Beijing. But China has rejected the ruling.","during the 20 summit obama ,barack obama will visit china ,china obama will visit laos ,after china obama will visit ,president barack obama will visit","['US', 'Barack Obama', 'China', 'Group', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'the White House', 'US', 'China', 'US', 'South Korea', 'Xi Jinping', 'China', 'Hangzhou', 'White House', 'Josh Earnest', 'Earnest', 'chinese', 'Hangzhou', 'Obama', 'U.S.', 'Earnest', 'China', 'Laos', 'the Association of Southeast Asian Nations', 'US', 'the East Asia Summit', 'Lao', 'Bounnhang Vorachith', 'the White House', 'China', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'US', 'north korean', 'China', 'Pyongyang', 'UN Security Council', 'US', 'the Security Council', 'chinese', 'US', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'Philippines', 'southeast asian', 'Beijing', 'China']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.82681561  1.15914881

The thesis was published by the Korean Association of Party Studies.While the percentage of the moderates came at 28.7 percent right after the 19th election, it increased by 6.9 percentage points to 35.6 percent after this year’s election.The ratio of conservatives, meanwhile, dropped by 7.5 percentage points from 40.1 percent four years ago to 32.6 percent this year.The change in the ratio of progressives remained little changed from 31.1 percent in 2012 to 31.6 percent now.The survey was conducted on 1,600 eligible voters between April 20 and May 12 this year. The election was held on April 16. The statistics for 2012 was taken from a survey conducted by Seoul National University’s political research institute. Banners hung during the 20th general election in April The research also pointed out that while the ideological identification among the voters changed, both rivaling parties saw a rise in the portion of supporters who are conservative.The ruling Saenuri Party saw the proportion of conservative supporters rise significantly from 48.7 percent upon the 19th election to 69.0 percent after the 20th election. Progressive supporters for the party, on the other hand, declined from 28.5 percent to 8.9 percent.Meanwhile, the main opposition, The Minjoo Party of Korea, saw the ratio of their progressive supporters remain slightly changed from 51.2 percent to 56.1 percent, while the conservatives surged from 8.9 percent to 18.8 percent. The proportion of moderates, on the other hand, dropped from 38.8 percent to 25.1 percent.Observers noted that while the Minjoo Party appears to have succeeded in bringing in more conservative voters by moderating its progressive agendas and naming conservative Rep. Kim Chong-in as its interim chairman, it has relatively failed in wooing the moderates.In the report professor Ryu noted that, despite their proclaimed political disposition, conservative and progressive voters showed little difference toward specific policies. He also noted that there were many cases in which a conservative voter would support a progressive policy and vice versa. “They can be deemed as voters who can change their position if an issue becomes politicized, despite how there are bigger possibilities of drawing out a consensus when it comes to specific policies,” Rhy was quoted as telling Munhwa Ilbo.","the latest parliamentary election ,latest parliamentary election the number ,latest parliamentary election ,latest parliamentary election the ,the latest parliamentary election the","['Ryu Jae - sung', 'Keimyung University', 'the Korean Association of Party Studies', 'Seoul National University ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Kim Chong - in', 'Ryu', 'Munhwa Ilbo']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.76168925  0.49737859

The so-called ""no first use"" policy has unnerved allies depending on U.S. nuclear weapons for their security.State Department deputy spokesman Mark Toner said that Obama laid out his vision for a nuclear-free world in a landmark address in Prague in 2009, and the administration has since achieved progress on a number of fronts, including reducing its own deployed stockpiles and launchers and diminishing the role of nuclear weapons in its security strategy.""We are always looking for additional ways to achieve progress towards the president's goal, while maintaining, and this is important, a credible deterrent for the United States, our allies and our partners,"" Toner said at a regular briefing.""We've said we'll continue to review our planned modernization programs, we're going to continue to assess whether there are additional steps that we can take to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in our security strategy and pursue ways to strengthen the global nonproliferation regime further. But, as I said, we're always going to maintain a credible deterrent for our friends and our allies,"" he said.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has reportedly expressed opposition to the ""no first use"" idea, raising concern that the policy could weaken deterrence against North Korea.

After joining the legislature as a proportional representative in 2008, she soon blended into the pro-Park clique, serving as spokesperson for the party during the 2012 presidential election season and then for president-elect Park until inauguration.Based on her strong ties with the state leader, Cho took office as gender equality minister in 2013, becoming the only female Cabinet member in the Park administration as well as the youngest head for the ministry that was created in 2001.New culture minister, Cho Yoon-sun Her ministerial career, followed by 11 months as presidential secretary for political affairs, seemed to be smooth sailing until she was pressed to step down to take responsibility for the underachievement of government-led reforms of the civil servants’ pension system.She suffered another fall earlier this year during the ruling Saenuri Party’s nomination race to select candidates for the April 13 general election, in which she was outrun by rival Lee Hye-hoon.Despite such setbacks, however, Cho’s reinstatement to the Cabinet had largely been speculated, especially since Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, another ranking pro-Park figure, grasped the ruling party’s chairmanship in the recent leadership election.“The public society should set an example in breaking the glass ceiling,” said Park at a Cabinet meeting earlier this month, alluding to Cho’s appointment into a key government post.The 50-year-old Cho majored in diplomatic science at Seoul National University and acquired a master’s degree in law at Columbia University Law School.

Kim Jae-su, CEO of the state-run Korea Agro-Fisheries and Food Trade Crp., was picked as minister of agriculture, food and rural affairs, while Cho Kyeung-kyu, deputy chief of the prime ministerial Office for Government Policy Coordination, was tapped as environment minister.“ nominee Cho has an intimate knowledge of culture and arts, and thoroughly understands the president’s statecraft philosophy, having served as  lawmaker, minister and presidential secretary,” senior presidential secretary for public affairs Kim Sung-woo told reporters.Senior presidential secretary for public affairs Kim Sung-woo attends a press briefing at Cheong Wa Dae on Tuesday. Cho is to replace Kim Jong-deok, who has been in office since August 2014.For the other Cabinet positions, the president chose from senior government officials with experience in their given field.New Agriculture Minister Kim, replacing Lee Dong-phil, is considered an expert in agricultural policy, having served in the ministry’s key posts over the past 30 years.“Kim is the right person to foster the nation’s agriculture and livestock industries and revitalize the rural economy, based on his ample experience,” the presidential secretary said.Cho Kyeung-kyu, a longtime expert in economic and state policy coordination, is to head the Environment Ministry amid recent series of environmental agenda such as fine dust, humidifier disinfectant harms and diesel car emission scandals.“Cho is expected to achieve harmonious communication with other government departments on key environmental issues such as climate change and fine dust,” Cheong Wa Dae said.The president also appointed four vice-ministerial officials.Replacing Cho Kyeung-kyu in the Office for Government Policy Coordination, Park named Noh Hyeong-ouk, senior official at the ministry of strategy and finance.Jeong Marn-ki, presidential secretary for trade, industry and energy, was appointed vice minister of trade, industry and energy.Former senior prosecutor Park Kyeong-ho and presidential secretary for agriculture, livestock and food Chung Hwang-keun were respectively picked as vice chief of the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission and head of the Rural Development Administration.Following the Blue House’s announcement, opposition parties immediately voiced their disapproval over the shake-up, reiterating their call for the dismissal of Woo Byung-woo, the senior presidential secretary for political affairs.“It is incomprehensible how a person involved in a number of irregularity disputes could qualify as a key government official,” said Rep. Park Kwang-on, spokesperson of The Minjoo Party of Korea, in a briefing.“We suspect that the reshuffle was but a pretense to dodge the public’s call for more fundamental state reform.”The disputed presidential aide came under fire last month for his monetary connection to a senior prosecutor who was arrested in a corruption scandal, as well as his alleged influence-peddling over his son’s military post.Despite the elevating dissent from opposition circles and concerns from within the ruling party, however, the president reiterated her trust upon the aide, refusing to dismiss him right away.By Bae Hyun-jung","cabinet reshuffle replacing three ministers ,president also appointed four vice ,new agriculture minister kim replacing ,reshuffle replacing three ministers ,to dismiss senior presidential secretary","['Park Geun - hye', 'Cabinet', 'Cho Yoon - sun', 'Kim Jae - su', 'Korea Agro - Fisheries and Food Trade Crp', 'Cho Kyeung - kyu', 'Office for Government Policy Coordination', 'Cho', 'Kim Sung - woo', 'Kim Sung - woo', 'Cheong Wa Dae', 'Cho', 'Kim Jong - deok', 'Cabinet', 'Kim', 'Lee Dong - phil', 'Cho Kyeung - kyu', 'Cho Kyeung - kyu', 'the Office for Government Policy Coordination', 'Park', 'Noh Hyeong - ouk', 'Jeong Marn - ki', 'Park Kyeong - ho', 'Chung Hwang', 'the Anti - Corruption and Civil Rights Commission', 'the Rural Development Administration', 'the Blue House ’s', 'Woo Byung - woo', 'Park Kwang - on', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63411558  0.04909584

Last month, the U.S. imposed its first-ever sanctions on North Korean leader Kim Jong-un for his roles in the country's human rights violations.The department is required to submit the report by Aug. 17 or within 180 days of the enactment of the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016, which went into effect February in the wake of the North's fourth nuclear test and a long-range rocket launch. As required by the law, the report is expected to include a list of countries that forcibly repatriate refugees from the North, a list of countries where North Korean laborers work, including countries that have formal arrangements with the North or any person acting for or on behalf of the North to employ North Korean workers.The report is also expected to include a plan for bilateral and multilateral outreach, including sustained engagement with the governments of partners and allies to brief them on North Korea human rights issues, as well as public affairs and public diplomacy strategies.About 50,000-60,000 North Koreans are believed to be toiling overseas, mostly in China and Russia and mainly in the mining, logging, textile and construction industries. The average wage was stated as $120 to $150 per month, but in most cases employing firms paid salaries directly to the North's government.The North reportedly receives in the low $100s of millions from this system per year.They are also forced to work usually between 12 and 16 hours, and sometimes up to 20 hours, per day, with only one or two rest days per month, and health and safety measures are often inadequate. Workers are given insufficient daily food rations.North Korea has long been labeled as one of the worst human rights violators. The communist regime does not tolerate dissent, holds hundreds of thousands of people in political prison camps and keeps tight control over outside information. But the North has bristled at such criticism, calling it a U.S.-led attempt to topple its regime.","report to congress this week ,sanctions on north korean leader ,first ever sanctions on north ,ever sanctions on north korean ,north korean workers the report","['the U.S. State Department', 'Congress', ""North Korea 's"", 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'U.S.', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'North Korea', 'North Koreans', 'China', 'Russia', 'North', 'North Korea']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55514741  0.47380024

Often referred to as the Kim Young-ran law, named after former Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission chief Kim Young-ran who proposed it in 2011, the act puts the threshold for money spent on meals at 30,000 won per person, gifts at 50,000 won and money given for ceremonial occasions limited to 100,000 won.It is intended to curb unlawful solicitation and bribery by public officials, journalists and private school faculty, but has sparked concerns it will have a detrimental impact on overall consumption across the country. Members of an association of agricultural and livestock farmers hold a rally against the antigraft law in Seoul on July 21. “I don’t think there has been a notable impact on sales yet, but we are worried that public officials will be afraid to come after the law takes effect in September,” said a worker at a restaurant near the Defense Ministry in Yongsan-gu, Seoul. Military officials and civilian workers in the military are both constituted as public officials by Korean law, and thereby fall under the influence of the antigraft law.It is customary in Korea to treat business partners to meals or hand out gifts in ceremonial occasions as a token of appreciation or good intent. It is also conventional for public officials to send out gifts during holidays, such as the upcoming Chuseok holidays next month.But there have been consistent concerns that such customs are being used as an excuse for de facto bribery and ultimately a network of corruption across civil and public sectors.The Constitutional Court’s ruling last month turned down challenges against the disputed act and has cleared the way for it to take effect on Sept. 28.Upon the court’s ruling, protests from the agricultural and marine sectors have further escalated.The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries and Small and Medium Business Administration filed for a suspension of the implementation along with adjustment of the spending limits to the Ministry of Government Legislation. The legislative body turned down the request for a delay, and requested arbitration on the spending limits to the Office for Government Policy Coordination.On Monday, the National Assembly’s Agriculture, Food, Rural Affairs, Oceans and Fisheries Committee unanimously adopted a resolution calling for exclusion of agricultural and marine products from being affected by the law citing concerns of drastic cut in demand. The committee said it will deliver the resolution to the State Affairs Committee in charge of the antigraft law.According to the Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs Ministry, about 93 percent of domestically grown beef gift sets are priced over 100,000 won. Some at the ministry estimate the law would cause demand for beef sets to slide to the tune of some 240 billion won. “The law will threaten our survival,” said Kim Young-won, in charge of public relations affairs at the Hanwoo Association. “It might be possible to lower prices of fruit gift sets by reducing the weight of the gifts. It is impossible to do so  because they would make the gifts too small to express gratitude.”A manager of beef restaurant Samwon Garden’s Daechi-dong branch, located in the affluent neighborhood in southern Seoul, agreed, “Yes, we are much concerned about the impact on our sales starting next month.”The decades-old eatery offers 200 grams of marinated Korean sliced beef bulgogi for 37,000 won. The fresh short ribs are sold at 79,000 won for 150 grams. According to Statistics Korea, the average expenditure on dining out per person is about 43,900 won on a meal of Korean food, 29,300 won on Western food, 69,000 won on Japanese and 33,000 won on Chinese.With the introduction of the bill, some restaurants are even cooking up their own “Kim Young-ran menu” designed to not exceed the limit. Seafood cuisine chain Haeuri is slated to launch a 29,000 won dinner set on the day the act kicks off.“The most affordable dinner course was 36,000 won, our chain plans to bring down the price below 30,000 won in order to prevent falls in sales,” said a manager at a Haeuri branch near Namdaemun in central Seoul.Regardless of the last-ditch efforts, some pundits have forecast the anticorruption law to have a significant impact on the Korean economy. According to a June report by the Korea Economic Research Institute, the collective loss in annual sales is expected to be around 11.6 trillion won. In terms of each industry, restaurants are expected to earn 8.5 trillion less, gift-related industries will see their profit fall by 1.97 trillion won and country clubs, primarily for golf, will make 1.1 trillion won less. The country’s Chuseok holidays from Sept. 14-16, where robust exchanging of gifts, usually takes place, are expected to be demonstrate on some level just how much of an impact the Kim Young-ran law has.An official from Lotte Department Store said that while it is preparing a cheaper sets of gift, it will be nearly impossible to make affordable choices for beef and other meats, which have been popular choices for holiday gifts.But some government officials supported the act, saying it will serve as an opportunity to uproot what is sometimes seen as an “excessive” act of hospitality to business partners.“There are not many people who would spend 30,000 won per person at a family dinner. Such  meals are only to show the other person that he or she would care enough to spend so much money on a meal,” a government official said.Both proponents and opponents of the law agree the act is somewhat vague and delegates the details and exceptions to the ordinance. A section of the act also defines gifts that are allowed by “social norms” as not punishable by law, without clarifying what social norms entail.“I think there are some ambiguous points as of now, which is why we need to work on specifying it in the manual. We expect trial and error in the earlier stages ,” said an ACRC official.He said the commission is also planning to hold briefing sessions for the Kim Young-ran law for foreign press within this year, as foreign workers in Korea would also be subject to the act.By Song Su-hyun and Yoon Min-sik","launch 29 000 won dinner ,most popular dishes from 32 ,korean food 29 300 won ,29 000 won dinner ,korean sliced beef bulgogi for","['the Improper Solicitation', 'Kim Young - ran', 'Anti - Corruption and Civil Rights Commission', 'Kim Young - ran', 'Seoul', 'the Defense Ministry', 'Yongsan - gu ,', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Chuseok', 'the Constitutional Court ’s', 'the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry', 'Ministry of Oceans', 'Medium Business Administration', 'the Ministry of Government Legislation', 'the Office for Government Policy Coordination', 'the National Assembly ’s Agriculture , Food , Rural Affairs', 'Oceans', 'Fisheries Committee', 'the State Affairs Committee', 'the Agriculture , Food and Rural Affairs Ministry', 'Kim Young - won', 'the Hanwoo Association', 'Samwon Garden ’s', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'Statistics Korea', 'korean', 'western', 'Japanese', 'Kim Young - ran', 'Haeuri', 'Haeuri', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'the Korea Economic Research Institute', 'Kim Young - ran', 'Lotte Department Store', 'ACRC', 'Kim Young - ran', 'Korea', 'Song Su - hyun', 'Yoon Min - sik']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39237395  0.29301414

According to the official, residents said they do not want to meet with Defense Minister Han Min-koo if he only wants to persuade them to accept the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system.“Instead of suggesting any new bargaining chip in talks with local residents, the minister will listen to their opinions about the planned deployment of THAAD,” the official said.

""He is the founder of ISIS.""He repeated the allegation three more times for emphasis.Trump also pointedly referred to the president by his full legal name: Barack Hussein Obama.The Republican presidential nominee in the past has accused his opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, of founding the militant group. Shiftingt he blame to Obama on Wednesday, he said ""crooked Hillary Clinton"" was actually the group's co-founder.As he works to keep his campaign message on track, Trump in recent days has sometimes tried to clarify controversial statements by arguing he was being misinterpreted. But given the opportunity Thursday morning to walk his statement back, Trump did the opposite. ""He was the founder, absolutely the founder,"" Trump said on CNBC. ""In fact he gets the -- in sports, they have awards. He gets the most valuable player award.''Trump has long blamed Obama and his former secretary of state _ Clinton _ for pursuing Mideast policies that created a power vacuum in Iraq that was exploited by IS, another acronym for the group. He's sharply criticized Obama for announcing he would pull U.S. troops out of Iraq, a decision that many Obama critics say created the kind of instability in which extremist groups like IS thrive.The White House declined to comment on Trump's accusation.The Islamic State group began as Iraq's local affiliate of al-Qaida, the group that attacked the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001. The group carried out massive attacks against Iraq's Shiite Muslim majority, fueling tensions with al-Qaida's central leadership. The local group's then-leader, Jordanian-born Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was killed in 2006 in a U.S. airstrike but is still seen as the Islamic State group's founder.Trump's accusation -- and his use of the president's middle name, Hussein -- echoed previous instances where he's questioned Obama's loyalties.In June, when a shooter who claimed allegiance to IS killed 49 people in an Orlando, Florida, nightclub, Trump seemed to suggest Obama was sympathetic to the group when he said Obama ""doesn't get it, or he gets it better than anybody understands."" In the past, Trump has also falsely suggested Obama is a Muslim or was born in Kenya, where Obama's father was from.The president, a Christian, was born in Hawaii.Trump lobbed the allegation midway through his rally at a sports arena, where riled-up supporters shouted obscenities about Clinton and joined in unison to shout ``lock her up.'' He railed against the fact that the Orlando shooter's father, Seddique Mateen, was spotted in the crowd behind Clinton during a Monday rally in Florida, adding, ""Of course he likes Hillary Clinton.""Sitting behind Trump at his rally on Wednesday was former Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., who resigned in 2006 after allegations he sent sexually suggestive messages to former House pages.","now accusing president barack obama ,trump is now accusing president ,president obama trump ,president obama trump said wednesday ,obama the republican presidential nominee","['SUNRISE', 'Fla.', '-- Donald Trump', 'Barack Obama', 'Islamic', 'european', 'Obama', 'Trump', 'Fort Lauderdale', 'Florida', 'Barack Hussein Obama', 'republican', 'Democrat', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Obama', 'Hillary Clinton', 'trump', 'Trump', 'trump', 'CNBC', 'Obama', 'Clinton', 'Iraq', 'Obama', 'U.S.', 'Iraq', 'the White House', 'Trump', 'Islamic', 'Iraq', 'al - Qaida', 'U.S.', 'Iraq', 'shiite muslim', ""al - Qaida 's"", 'Jordanian', 'Abu Musab al - Zarqawi', 'U.S.', 'Islamic', 'State', 'trump', 'Hussein', 'Obama', 'Orlando', 'Florida', 'Trump', 'Obama', 'trump', 'Obama', 'Muslim', 'Kenya', 'Obama', 'Christian', 'Hawaii', 'Clinton', 'Orlando', 'Seddique Mateen', 'Clinton', 'Florida', 'Hillary Clinton', 'trump', 'Mark Foley', 'R', 'Fla.', 'House']",12,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.78057188  0.54343313

Seoul's unification ministry stressed that the closure of the complex was an inevitable decision as North Korea has never stopped its nuclear and missile development, and threatening South Korea's national security.""At a time when North Korea poses  threats, it is nonsense to talk about the reopening of the factory zone,"" Jeong Joon-hee, ministry spokesman, told a regular press briefing.Seoul said that the government places priority on making Pyongyang give up its nuclear weapons program over the resumption of any inter-Korean talks.Critics and opposition lawmakers said the government should seek ways to resume the factory zone, saying that politics and economic activities need to be handled separately.South Korea's decision to close the complex aims to prevent money generated from the factory zone from bankrolling the North's nuclear and missile programs, the government said.Since the opening in 2004, a total of 124 South Korean firms had operated factories at the complex, some 50 kilometers northwest of Seoul, employing more than 54,000 North Korean workers to produce labor-intensive goods, such as clothes and utensils.The companies claimed that the shutdown has incurred more than 1.5 trillion won  in financial losses, saying that the government's financial support is not sufficient to cover their damage.Seoul said that it has provided 336.9 billion won, or 66 percent, of earmarked support funds totaling 500 billion won to the firms.""The government hopes that the companies could normalize their businesses within this year, aided by the government's financial support plan and their self-rescue efforts,"" Jeong said.","fourth nuclear test in january ,months ago seoul shut down ,country fourth nuclear test in ,pyongyang give up its nuclear ,communist country fourth nuclear test","['South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'inter - korean', 'the Kaesong Industrial Complex', 'inter - korean', ""North Korea 's"", 'Seoul', 'North Korea', ""South Korea 's"", 'North Korea', 'Jeong Joon - hee', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'inter - korean', ""South Korea 's"", 'south korean', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'Jeong']",6,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.62761271 -0.00177181

He has denounced the agreement with South Korea as a ""job killing"" deal, a ""disaster,"" and a ""perfect"" example of ""broken promises.""According to South Korea's trade ministry, the country's trade surplus with the U.S. rose from $11.64 billion in 2011 to $25.82 billion last year. But the data showed that much of the increase came from trade in items that did not benefit from tariff reductions under the FTA, such as auto, minerals and agricultural products.Tariff cuts under the deal are supposed to take effect in a phased-in manner. In the case of autos, it was only this year that the U.S. tariff of 2.5 percent on Korean cars was scrapped.According to the data, South Korea's exports of items benefiting from FTA tariff cuts rose by only $5.4 billion between 2011 and last year while the exports of items ineligible for tariff cuts jumped by nearly $10 billion during the same period.On the other hand, the increase in U.S. exports to South Korea came largely from the items subject to tariff cuts, meaning that it is the U.S. that benefited more from the free trade deal, the data showed.Moreover, the U.S. has been recording surplus in services trade -- $6.9 billion in 2011, $7.5 billion in 2012, $10.3 billion in 2013, $9.5 billion in 2014 and $9.4 billion last year.""If the trades both in goods and services are taken comprehensively into consideration, the Korea-U.S. FTA is an agreement that gives benefits to both countries,"" a source in Washington said.In late June, the U.S. International Trade Commission said in a report that the Korea deal has been good for American interests, saying the agreement is estimated to have improved bilateral merchandise trade balances by $15.8 billion last year. That means that had it not been for the deal, the U.S. trade deficits would have been larger.Trump has also claimed that the Korea deal resulted in killing more than 100,000 American jobs.But experts say that jobs are more to do with trade volume rather than surplus or deficit. Trade volume between the two countries have been on a steady rise from $100.77 billion in 2011 to $113.87 billion last year.Moreover, South Korean businesses have increased investments in the U.S. since the trade deal went into force, contributing to job creation in the U.S., experts said. Major South Korea companies have created some 37,000 jobs in the U.S. since the FTA took effect, data showed.","economic woes trump has slammed ,trump has slammed free trade ,struggling with economic woes trump ,tuesday that belies republican presidential ,larger trump has also claimed","[""South Korea 's"", 'the United States', 'republican', ""Donald Trump 's"", 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Trump', 'american', 'South Korea', ""South Korea 's"", 'U.S.', 'FTA', 'U.S.', 'korean', ""South Korea 's"", 'FTA', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'FTA', 'Washington', 'the U.S. International Trade Commission', 'Korea', 'american', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'american', 'south korean', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'FTA']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.59194046  0.74082881

Lee Jung-hyun, a third-term lawmaker loyal to President Park Geun-hye, as its new leader, and chose five new members of the party’s decision-making Supreme Council. The appointment of the party’s leadership to replace the interim one is seen as step in the right direction and comes when Saenuri needs to pull itself together and put up a united front.The biggest challenge for the new cadre of leaders comes from ever-simmering factional strife, which analysts have cited as part of the reason why the ruling party lost in the April general elections and the public remained largely apathetic about the party’s leadership race.“At the moment, addressing factional conflicts would be the most crucial issue for the new leadership to tackle as we have witnessed relentless spats between different party factions before and during the leadership election,” said Lee Chung-hee, politics professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.“Now the new party is in dire need of the kind of leadership that promotes party unity and harmony.”Factional fissures were laid bare during the grueling leadership race that pitted the the newly elected party chairman -- from the “pro-Park” faction -- against those classified as belonging to the “non-Park” faction, or “neutrals,” with no ties to any of the two rival factions.Public apathy towards the Saenuri leadership contest, seen as a prelude to the party’s in-house race for a presidential nomination, reflects the degree to which citizens have been displeased with the party’s persistent factional discord, analysts said.The president herself voiced concerns over the elusive task of overcoming internal strife.“ trust from citizens would be far-fetched if we cannot stand united and if we hate, criticize and distrust one another,” Park said earlier in the day during her congratulatory remarks at the party convention.Another major task for the new leadership is reshaping the party-government relationship, which has long been seen as “vertical,” with the president exerting inconspicuous yet considerable influence on party affairs, analysts said.The two-way relationship should be turned into a more “horizontal one” so that the party can more actively pursue its own policy platforms that would help win back the minds of citizens, observers pointed out.“The new party leadership should ponder how to play a positive role as a coordinator that helps the Park administration stably manage state affairs by talking tough to the president rather than just upholding the wishes of the chief executive,” said political analysts Jun Kye-wan.Forging cooperative ties with the opposition bloc is another challenging task given that the ruling party no longer maintains a majority in the 300-seat National Assembly.Currently, the Saenuri Party holds 129 seats, well shy of a majority, meaning it needs to secure backing from the opposition parties to pass bills. “On various issues, including the passage of the government’s extra budget proposal, the ruling party needs support from the opposition parties,” said Lee Nae-young, a politics professor at Korea University. “Pursuing the politics of cooperation with the opposition bloc ... that is the message voters conveyed to the ruling party during the April parliamentary elections.”The passage of the 11 trillion won  extra budget, in particular, is something that the new leadership must tackle as Seoul pushes forward industrywide restructuring efforts and strives to create new jobs when the national economy is expected to grow at a slower pace than previously anticipated. Gearing the party towards winning next year’s presidential election will be another major task for the new leadership, though any unforeseen mishap could cut short its term and spare it from the Herculean task.The preparations for a presidential election, which may include a personnel overhaul to shore up public trust, are always fraught with bitter in-house rivalries that could reopen cracks in the already fractured party, observers pointed out.“If the leadership were to fail to handle the problems that could flare up in the process of the presidential candidate nomination, the party could suffer yet another serious confusion,”Jun said. “How to craft a fair, democratic primary process could be a challenge for the leadership.”","winning next year presidential election ,election victory on tuesday ,seoul pushes forward industrywide restructuring ,the newly elected party chairman ,in house race for presidential","['Saenuri Party', 'Seoul', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Supreme Council', 'Saenuri', 'Lee Chung - hee', 'Hankuk University of Foreign Studies', 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'Jun Kye - wan', 'National Assembly', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Lee Nae - young', 'Korea University', 'Seoul', 'Herculean']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.71775043  0.30422738

Cho had to wait for the first patient Kang to be transported to the hospital. They both were pronounced dead on the same day.According to participants, the meet also began without proper warm-up exercises.“We did not have proper warm-up exercises before the race began,” a participant said to The Korea Herald. “An organizer did mention it regarding warming up, but it wasn’t official or anything so who would care?” Kang’s family members said the organizer was to blame for his death. “My father was a head of an amateur swimming club and had been competing in numerous swimming meets,” said the second son of Kang in despair. “Things all went wrong when the organization suddenly advanced the competition without any announcement beforehand, so my father had to rush into the water, unprepared.” Before the incident, Kang enjoyed indoor swimming as a hobby and had completed 2-kilometer and 3-kilimeter water courses before participating in the tragic event, family members said. Police have started a probe into the deadly accident to investigate whether there were any lacking safety measures.

Its result is to be sealed for two days, until the end of the party’s national convention on Tuesday, and totaled with ballots casted that day by some 9,000 representative members, according to officials.The four candidates bidding for the ruling Saenuri Party‘s chairmanship.  Reps. Lee Ju-young, Lee Jung-hyun, Joo Ho-young, and Han Sun-kyo. Representing the non-Park faction is Rep. Joo Ho-young, who earlier united his candidacy with Rep. Choung Byoung-gug based on public polls.From the pro-presidential clique are former Maritime Minister Rep. Lee Ju-young, former senior presidential secretary for public affairs Rep. Lee Jung-hyun and former news announcer Rep. Han Sun-kyo.Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, boosted by his close ties with the president and his consecutive election victories in the opposition-leaning Yeosu region, claimed to have an upper hand but he, too, has been struggling with the split of votes within the pro-Park pool.The key factor in the one-on-three match is whether the candidacy merger of the two non-mainstreamers will have the intended synergy effect. Rep. Joo, fourth-termer in the southern city of Daegu, is hoping that his unity with Gyeonggi-based Rep. Choung will up his chances in the metropolitan region.Also, backing up the non-Park group is Rep. Kim Moo-sung, former party chairman and bigwig figure in Busan, who explicitly voiced his support for Rep. Joo. Kim’s existence is especially likely to affect the party electorate in the southeastern Busan-South Gyeongsang region, where a considerable portion of the party’s electorate voters are located.Meanwhile, Rep. Lee Ju-young made protests that each faction was delivering “orders” to its affiliated members to vote for a specific candidate.“It was for such factional dispute that we lost in the general election ,” said Rep. Lee in a press conference on Sunday.“There is no future for the Saenuri Party, should such these power games continue.”The former minister thereby pointed the finger not only at the non-Park group, but also at his own pro-Park clique, calling for fair democratic processes.By Bae Hyun-jung","party national convention on tuesday ,for next year presidential election ,party on sunday kicked off ,conservative saenuri party on sunday ,president and his consecutive election","['Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun', 'non - park', 'Saenuri Party‘s', 'Lee Ju - young', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'Joo Ho - young', 'Han Sun - kyo', 'Joo Ho - young', 'Choung Byoung', 'Lee Ju - young', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'Han Sun - kyo', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'Yeosu', 'Joo', 'Daegu', 'Gyeonggi', 'Choung', 'non - park', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Busan', 'Joo', 'Kim ’s', 'Lee Ju - young', 'Lee', 'the Saenuri Party', 'non - park', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.70920652  0.32152182

Cheong Wa Dae’s chief of staff Lee Won-jong also attended, accompanied by senior presidential secretaries An Chong-bum and Kim Jae-won.President Park Geun-hye meets with Saenuri Party lawmakers representing Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province on Thursday at Cheong Wa Dae to discuss the disputed deployment of an advanced missile defense system in the region. Yonhap“Considering the concerns from Seongju residents,  will thoroughly review  a new location within Seongju, should the military make relevant recommendations,” Park was quoted as saying by some of the participants.It was Seongju representative Rep. Yi Wan-young who had first suggested the compromise, reflecting the worries that, THAAD’s radar waves would pass directly across residential areas from the original location.The Daegu-North Gyeongsang cluster, collectively referred to as the TK belt, has long been considered a political stronghold for the conservative party and especially for President Park, who was born in Daegu.But since Seoul and Washington last month selected a South Korean artillery unit in Seongju as the location for a THAAD battery, local residents’ feelings toward the government have soured.Their claim is that THAAD’s far-reaching radar system is likely to cause damage to people’s health and agricultural crops, and that the existence of such a powerful military device could also make Seongju a military target if a conflict occurred.Another point of concern has been economic retaliation from China and Russia, both of which see THAAD as part of the U.S. missile program as well as a threat upon their national security.“The electromagnetic waves are nothing to worry about, as a safety test carried out in Guam proved that  is innocuous,” Park told the lawmakers, persuading them of the necessity and safety of the U.S.-initiated defense battery.While the Blue House strove to push ahead with the THAAD plan, some opposition members said that they will visit China next week to meet with ranking diplomatic officials.Rep. Kim Young-ho of The Minjoo Party of Korea and five other first-termers will leave next Monday for Beijing to gather opinion on THAAD deployment and its consequent impact on Korea-China ties, officials said Thursday.A group of Saenuri members, including Gyeonggi Gov. Nam Kyung-pil made a similar visit last month, shortly after the deployment announcement, but China’s key officials did not attend the conference.In a stepped-up protest against Seoul’s THAAD decision, a state-run newspaper in China blamed President Park in an editorial Wednesday for installing the defense system in the Korean Peninsula.Chong Wa Dae, though it refrained from commenting, alluded to some level of disapproval.“It is not appropriate  to answer every question related to diplomatic issues,” said spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk.“The Foreign Ministry will take charge, if necessary.” By Bae Hyun-jung","hour meeting with 11 lawmakers ,wednesday for installing the defense ,innocuous park told the lawmakers ,stepped up protest against seoul ,meeting with 11 lawmakers","['Park Geun', 'U.S.', 'Seongju', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Daegu', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'Cheong', 'Lee Won - jong', 'Chong', 'Kim Jae - won', 'Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Daegu', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'Seongju', 'Seongju', 'Seongju', 'Yi Wan - young', 'Daegu - North Gyeongsang', 'Daegu', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'south korean', 'Seongju', 'China', 'Russia', 'U.S.', 'Guam', 'Blue House', 'China', 'Kim Young - ho', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Beijing', 'Korea', 'China', 'Saenuri', 'Nam Kyung - pil', 'China', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Park', 'Chong', 'Jung Youn', 'Foreign Ministry']",2,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.40791726  0.40595403

The residents fear that THAAD's powerful radar system could pose health risks and hurt their agricultural crops, and that their hometown could become a military target in case of an armed conflict on the peninsula.Strong opposition also comes from China and Russia that argue THAAD, a core element of America's global multilayered missile defense program, will needlessly escalate regional military tensions and undermine their security interests.

In addition people in these fields are barred from making improper solicitation for favors.The Constitutional Court ruled the law that goes into effect on Sept. 28 is valid last week, paving the way for it to be implemented.The ruling Saenuri Party, however, said the law should exclude agricultural and fishery goods, as the price ceilings could bring negative impacts on the country's provincial economy.The main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea expressed concerns that the price limit should be revised up to 50,000 won and 100,000 won for meals and gifts, respectively, adding the presidential office should also lend support to revision.Smaller parties, however, claim that the law should be first implemented as stipulated, adding a revision can be made in the future.Political pundits, meanwhile, said there are growing calls for the anti-graft law to be applied to a wider scope of people, such as lawyers and workers at civil advocacy groups, who can exercise considerable control over various aspects of society.","week political watchers said monday ,constitutional nod last week political ,illegal to accept meals exceeding ,last week political watchers ,nod last week political watchers","[""South Korea 's"", 'Kim Young - run', 'the Anti - Corruption and Civil Rights Commission', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Saenuri Party', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54602075  0.33169895

One of the disinfectants had contained OIT. The meeting was attended by officials from the KACA and representatives from local air purifier manufacturers including Samsung Electronics, LG, Cuckoo and Winia. YonhapTo improve product safety and dispel public anxiety, companies said they agreed to revise the current regulation standard and ask the Environment Ministry to strengthen control of chemicals used in filters.Currently, electronic home appliances are supervised by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy under the Electrical Appliances Safety Control Act. Air filters are not included in the list for ministry supervision because they are considered electronic components.According to the regulation, the ministry-designated association is in charge of the authentication process for air purifiers. Since 1998, the KACA has been giving Clean Air authentication marks to air purifiers based on the functions of the product, such as deodorization efficiency, noise level and dust collection efficiency. A total of 113 air purifier models from 24 local brands including Samsung Electronics, LG, Coway, Chungho Nice, Winia, Cukcoo, have acquired this Clean Air mark.The revised authentication standard will include stricter safety test for filters. Five chemicals -- OIT, CMIT, PHMG, PGH and MCIT -- will be banned from use in manufacturing filters. These are the chemicals that were found to have been used in toxic humidifier disinfectants, which caused at least 200 deaths since 2011.Substances designated as harmful in other countries and uncertified sterilizing chemicals will also be banned from being used in filters.If a company breaches the above regulations or cannot provide documents to prove product safety, they will not be able to acquire the Clean Air mark.“It is true that the current authentication standard did not fully consider the safety of air purifiers,” one of the attendees at the meeting was quoted as saying.“Although it may seem like 20-20 hindsight, we believe the related ministries and customers will welcome our idea of a stricter authentication process, which is aimed at putting customer safety first before anything” the official added.According to a local news report, 3M sold over 720,000 filters to local companies from 2014 to May this year. This accounts for 80 percent of the total number of filters sold in the market.Amid moves to recall the products out of concern, the corresponding companies last week announced that they would offer free filter replacements to customers.

Choo Mi-ae, Rep. Song Young-gil and Kim Sang-gon, a party personnel official, are considered to be in the pro-Moon Jae-in faction. Lee is considered to be more independent.Moon Jae-in, who stepped down from the party's leadership earlier this year, had competed with President Park Geun-hye for South Korea's top elected office in late 2012. He is still considered a prominent potential presidential candidate in next year's race.As the Minjoo earlier decided to shortlist the number of candidates to three, the party will hold a preliminary election next week.","new chairman with five candidates ,korea also finalized its candidates ,five candidates gunning for the ,chairman with five candidates gunning ,with five candidates gunning for","[""South Korea 's"", 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee Ju - young', 'Choung Byoung - gug', 'Chung', 'Park Geun', 'Joo Ho - young', 'Han Sun - kyo', 'Kim Young - tae', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'Saenuri', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Lee Jong - kul', 'Minjoo', 'Choo Mi - ae', 'Song Young', 'Kim Sang - gon', 'Lee', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Park Geun', ""South Korea 's"", 'Minjoo']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52788126  0.3864243

The plane was carrying passengers from Tokyo's Narita International Airport and landed at 11:57 a.m.South Korea's top carrier said the passengers and crew left the plane safety, and there were no injuries. The passengers were ferried to the airport's terminal on a bus.Because the plane could not be moved Korean Air used a towing vehicle to take the jet to the apron area, where maintenance personnel removed the tire and checked the landing gear for damage.The blown tire caused the east-west runway to be closed for over an hour with flight operations resuming after 1:14 p.m.Authorities said the accident led to delays for around 10 flights, although it did not cause serious disruptions in the schedules of flights arriving and taking off from the airport.Passengers on the flight included a mix of Japanese, South Korean and Chinese nationals, and a crew of 10.

Members of an association of farmers hold a protest in front of the Constitutional Court against its decision to uphold the disputed antigraft law on Thursday. But the inclusion of the media and education sector had touched off complaints that it was unfair and excessively broad in scope. Related parties including the Korean Bar Association and the Journalists Association of Korea filed a petition against the Constitutional Court. “The education and the media exert large influence over the society in general, and the corruption in the cited field has great ripple effect that inflicts damage that is both long-term and extensive ... As such, inclusion of private school officials and journalists was just,” the court said in its ruling, after reaching the decision on a 5:4 vote by its judges.It dismissed claims against the section of the act that defines gifts that are allowed by “social norms” are not punishable by law. It is conventional in Korean society to hand out gifts as a token of friendship or gratitude in ceremonial occasions.It was also decided that delegating the details -- including specific amounts for gifts that are allowed, and the fee for lectures -- to the ordinance was constitutional, along with the article that mandates reporting of bribery by spouses.“ respects the decision by the Constitutional Court, and hope that the implementation of the act will root out corruption and build the integrity of the nation in a ground-breaking way,” said Kwak Hyung-suk, the head of the ACRC Anti-Corruption Bureau, in a media briefing held immediately after the ruling. “In order for the act to be taken into effect on Sept. 28, the ACRC will carry out follow-up measures  for the remaining period. This will include enacting ordinance , creating a manual and conducting information sessions for the people.The KBA, on the other hand, released a statement condemning the ruling.“Act on the Prevention of Illegal Solicitation allows those in power to reign in the press, subsequently uprooting the very basis of democracy, while aggravating distrust among spouses and infringe upon the people’s right to act freely via its vague definition of ‘illegal solicitation’,” it said. “The KBA strongly regrets the court’s decision on such unconstitutional, inhumane and anti-democratic law.” The journalists’ association also protested the ruling, saying that the act may act as a “muzzle” for the reporters.“There is now a possibility that the authorities may try to silence the press, using the Kim Young-ran law as an excuse,” the JAK said in a statement. It added that the group “fully understand the necessity for the law,” but took issue with monitoring and regulating the civilian sector. But progressive Lawyers for a Democratic Society, or Minbyun, welcomed the Constitutional Court’s ruling, saying that it will act as the first step toward eradicating everyday, small-scaled corruptions within the society. The education sector was split on the decision. The Korea Federation of Teachers’ Associations raised concerns over potential ”overlapping punishment, pointing out that bribery by teachers are already regulated by local education offices But the Korea Teachers and Education Workers’ Union welcomed the decision and said that it will contribute to curbing corruptions by private school officials.The ordinance on the Kim Young-ran law puts the threshold on the value of food and gifts during social meetings at 30,000 and 50,000 won, respectively. The money given on ceremonial occasions, such as weddings, are restricted to 100,000 won.There have been complaints by local food and gifting industries that such restrictions will stifle them, as the law will make officials in the related sector reluctant to send out gifts. Agriculture Minister Lee Dong-pil had told local media that his ministry -- along with the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, Small and Medium Business Administration -- will file for an adjustment of the law to the Ministry of Government Legislation, regardless of the ruling.“While I agree with the law in principle, the scope of the law is too extensive, leading me to believe that it will have critical effect on domestic consumption,” he said.By Yoon Min-sik","disputed antigraft law on thursday ,hard hitting anti corruption law ,hitting anti corruption law ,corruptions by private school officials ,hitting anti corruption law on","['the Constitutional Court', 'Kim Young - ran', 'Kim Young - ran', 'the Constitutional Court', 'the Korean Bar Association', 'the Journalists Association', 'Korea', 'the Constitutional Court', 'korean', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Kwak Hyung - suk', 'the ACRC Anti - Corruption Bureau', 'ACRC', 'KBA', 'KBA', 'Kim Young - ran', 'Democratic', 'Minbyun', 'the Constitutional Court ’s', 'the Korea Federation of Teachers ’ Associations', 'the Korea Teachers and Education Workers', 'Kim Young - ran', 'Lee Dong - pil', 'the Ministry of Oceans', 'Medium Business Administration', 'the Ministry of Government Legislation', 'Yoon Min - sik']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.19974442  0.43506122

Kim Moon-soo, a former governor of Gyeonggi Province Political pundits said the move apparently came as Kim has hinted he may run in the presidential race slated for next year.Saenuri's law stipulates a party leader must step down from his or her post 18 months before the presidential election. South Korea's next presidential election is slated for Dec. 20, 2017.Party members have been eyeing Kim's candidacy amid on-going factional infighting that has hurt Saenuri's standing. Kim is usually classified as a member of the non-Park Geun-hye faction, although his real affiliation is ambiguous, with some even referring to him as pro-Park.So far, six members confirmed their candidacy, with three of them being from the non-Park faction. Rep. Lee Jung-hyun is considered the only pro-Park candidate at present, although Rep.Hong Moon-jong, another Park loyalist, may make a bid soon.The non-Park faction has yet to push for a single candidate to compete with the pro-Park group.The Minjoo Party of Korea, meanwhile, also plans to hold a convention on Aug. 27 to vote on a new leader.So far, three candidates have vowed to join the race. The main opposition party plans to conduct a primary if there are four or more candidates for the top leadership position to limit the number to three.Rep.

Won Yoo-chul claimed, adding the country should also develop its own nuclear weapons capability to deal with Pyongyang's ever-growing threat.Since 2006, the northern country has tested four nuclear devices and argued it can put these on top of missiles able to target all of South Korea, Japan and some U.S. bases in the Pacific.Trump has been claiming the U.S. should continue defending other countries as long as they pay for the cost of the troop presence, arguing that it makes no sense to pay to defend rich nations. South Korea currently pays about half the costs, about $900 million a year, to help finance its U.S. troop presence.Yoo added North Korea may conduct its fifth nuclear test around the end of this month, adding South Korea should also come up with serious countermeasures if the reclusive country makes such a move.  The five-term lawmaker has been an advocate of Seoul acquiring nuclear weapons as a means to defend itself.In line with the move, Yoo said he will kick off the so-called nuclear forum to conduct studies on detailed action plans to better cope with North Korea's provocations and help establish peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.Political pundits, however, said it is uncertain if Yoo's claim will earn support from other party members, as it contradicts the government's stance on non-proliferation.","korea should also develop nuclear ,republican presidential nominee donald trump ,nuclear weapons if pyongyang provocation ,advocate of seoul acquiring nuclear ,of seoul acquiring nuclear weapons","['Saenuri Party', 'South Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'U.S.', 'republican', 'Donald Trump', 'trump', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Won Yoo', 'Pyongyang', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Yoo', ""North Korea 's"", 'Yoo']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60163361  0.71467221

Incheon National University, which aims to place itself within the country’s top five national universities by 2020, has run the annual volunteer program since last year to enhance its students’ spirit of giving and to enhance their sense of community, the university said.Participants pose for a photograph after their volunteer works in Can Tho, Vietnam. The participants flew to Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam’s center of commerce, and Can Tho, the largest city in the Mekong Delta, from July 6-13. Can Tho is also home to most of the Vietnamese women residing in Korea. Upon arrival in Ho Chi Minh City, the team traveled for about 4 hours and 30 minutes to reach Can Tho. For the next five days, the students gave musical performances and organized recreational activities in partnership with local university students for 250 orphans in the region. The volunteers also visited facilities housing the physically challenged due to their exposure to defoliants to help clean the place and cook Korean traditional food. They also visited homes of two marginalized families to rebuild their houses.Volunteer students of Incheon National Unversity rebuilt a home for local residents in Can Tho, Vietnam. The university prepared for the program a month in advance, by traveling to the destinations and meeting with the local government officials and representatives of the University of Can Tho.It conducted an open audition to select local students who participated in the program and collected donations such as used clothes which were given to orphans in the region. “Volunteering in Vietnam gave a crucial opportunity to the volunteering students and university faculty members to rethink our role as a major national university,” an official from the university said. “We will strive to nurture students’ ability and attitude as a global citizen through various volunteer projects.”Incheon National University, located in the port city of Incheon and established in 1979, has 64 academic departments and programs from 12 colleges.

324,324,[Herald Interview] Activist-turned-scholar urges action on N.K. abductees,"On April 29, 1992, South Korea’s top intelligence agency arrested dozens of activists for plotting to overthrow the government by building underground socialist organizations. The authorities described the groups as the biggest antistate entity ever established in the country’s modern history. One of those arrested was Baik Tae-ung, who served as leader of the South Korean Socialist Coalition of Workers or “Sanom...","On April 29, 1992, South Korea’s top intelligence agency arrested dozens of activists for plotting to overthrow the government by building underground socialist organizations. The authorities described the groups as the biggest antistate entity ever established in the country’s modern history. One of those arrested was Baik Tae-ung, who served as leader of the South Korean Socialist Coalition of Workers or “Sanomaeng” in Korean. Despite the plea that he was exercising the right to political freedom, the then 29-year-old activist was sentenced to life in prison, a sentence which was later reduced to 15 years. Baik was designated as a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International and released in 1999 through a special pardon from former President Kim Dae-jung. He flew to the United States, where he earned a doctoral degree on international human rights law and passed the bar exam in the State of New York. Now the activist-turned-professor has returned to South Korea with a new mission – to bring home people abducted by North Korea. In 2015, his related activities won him the membership of the United Nations Human Rights Council’s Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, representing Asia-Pacific states. Paik Tae-ung, an associate professor at the William S. Richardson School of Law, University of Hawaii at Manoa. He is also a member of the United Nation’s Human Rights Council’s Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances. “The South Korean government should come forward to address this issue as it has significant meaning in the nation’s modern history. It is not just a matter of bringing an individual back home. It is about healing wounds from the past,” Baik said in an interview with The Korea Herald. “From the moment of kidnapping, individuals are deprived of the right to protect themselves and exposed to various types of torture. Forced disappearance is a grave violation of human rights, causing pain not just to those who have disappeared, but also to their family members.”The professor was in Seoul in June to attend a parliamentary seminar that discussed measures to retrieve those abducted by North Korea. According to a report by the Ministry of Unification, 4,782 South Korean nationals were kidnapped during the Korean War and 516 were alive in the North as of 2013.Some of them were reportedly subject to physical abuse while their family members faced a similar fate here after being accused of sympathizing with communism. Until now, North Korea has refused to confirm the whereabouts of the abductees and dismissed the South Korean government’s reclamation of them.The U.N. human rights expert said that his agency’s role is to act as a bridge between the families of the abductees and their government, especially when the latter fails to respond to the disappearance reports.“The organization fosters communication between the victims and their state by constantly monitoring the case until final closure,” he said. What the international organization does is not so much about finding individual people, but about coming up with a comprehensive strategy, he also explained.“We work as a sort of independent expert and offer our own professional insight. Actually, my job is not limited to North Korean issues but involves 86 states worldwide.”The key function of Baik’s agency is to gather disappearance cases, connect victims to their respective government, file related reports, help the government carry out investigations and follow up on cases on a periodic basis.Underlining the role that the U.N. organization has played in dealing with forced disappearance across the world, Paik referred to a case of 65,000 people reported missing in Sri Lanka during its 26-year civil war.The agency got the Sri Lankan government to sign the U.N. Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, under which the states must enact specific laws to prevent such disappearances, investigate reports of related cases and bring those responsible to justice.Observers are largely skeptic that such progress may happen in North Korea. The reclusive state has been refusing to discuss the disappearances issue since the U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Human Right reported back in 2014 that the regime was responsible for the disappearances of more than 200,000 people.Paik, however, suggested that there are possibilities that the North may open up further toward international organizations, indicating some changes that it made home and abroad amid international pressure on its human right condition.“North Korea, which used to show zero reaction to our requests, is now addressing the given accusations in international platforms. Although it is still refusing to reveal the whereabouts and identification of the abductees, I believe that the scope of engagement has changed,” he said “I think North Korea is and has been making changes. Whether the changes are active or passive ones, they can no longer ignore the pressure from the international community. What we should do is to steer such changes in the right direction,” he said.The changes he mentioned were North Korea’s 2009 decision to put the word “human right” in its Constitution and its 2014 amendment in criminal law to grant the accused more opportunity to appeal the ruling. The scholar said the regime would transform itself as its neighbor China and Russia had done. To encourage more changes in the reclusive regime, Paik asserted that the hawkish approaches taken by the current Park Geun-hye administration and its conservative predecessor toward the North needs to be reevaluated. Conservative political camps have often been cited as North Korea’s human rights problem as part of their attack against Pyongyang’s nuclear provocations. Progressive parties, in contrast, tend to be reluctant to raise the given issue, in fear of harming the tense inter-Korean relations.As a solution to avoid such partisan divide, Paik suggested that the South Korean government take a two-track approach -- responding sternly to military threats while engaging in further efforts to improve human rights. “It is precarious to cross out all talks because of the nuclear issue. Given that the nuclear negotiation is expected to be arduous one, we need to take substantive measures to address the human rights agenda. If necessary, we need to engage or cooperate with them,” he said. “North Korea’s human rights issue was sometimes treated as something that can be traded off for political goals, which is an anachronistic view tracing back to the Cold War frame. Human rights is universal agenda that goes beyond the politics,” he said.His criticism also extends to the U.S., including its recent decision to slap sanctions on North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and 10 other regime officials for their alleged complicity in human rights abuse against its own people.It is the first time Washington blacklisted the young leader personally. State Department spokesperson John Kirby said the report represents “the most comprehensive U.S. government effort to date” to name those linked with the communist state’s oppression of its people.Baik, however, played down the consequent impact of the sanction, asserting that it lacked “comprehensive vision” to address the human rights issue and was mostly driven by domestic pressure to take an assertive stance in Asia-Pacific against China. “I don’t think that the U.S. has a clear blueprint about how to improve the North’s human rights condition,” he said, noting that the sanction on the leader Kim is more of a security measure to curb nuclear development rather than a human rights approach.The professor said that the government should “not make too much of the decision” because it reflects the U.S. domestic politics. Both Democrats and Republicans try to use Pyongyang to mount pressure on Beijing amid its security challenge in the region, he said.Back when South Korea was under authoritarian rule, democratic campaigners largely refrained from publicly denouncing North Korea, in fear of backlash against the government’s frequent use of anticommunist sentiments to justify their crackdown on activists.Paik was a unique figure in the left-leaning group. In an article by him published in 1992, titled “Our Stance toward Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and its Workers Party,” he said that the DPRK’s personality cult and massive propaganda would eventually undermine the system.Describing the past reluctance to criticize the North as a form of protest against the authoritarian governments, the scholar hopes that liberal-minded citizens will take a more assertive tone against North Korea’s dismal human rights problems.“With the authoritarian era way back in the past, there is no reason we can’t speak out against human rights violations happening in South Korea. Its liberal society should playing a more important role in alleviating the pain of North Korea’s residents,” he said.Since Paik went to the United States after being released by presidential pardon in 1999, he has since spent most of his time overseas pursing his academic goals and trying to avoid the public spotlight. Now the 53-year-old scholar pledged to play a bridging role between his native country and the international body to which he currently belongs, promising that he would share his insight more frequently to improve the peninsula’s political and social disposition.“Sometimes it is a shame that I can’t be physically with those people spending everyday working so hard. Though I am working at an American law school and the U.N., I hoping my work there would help Korea improve. I will come to Korea more often and share my thoughts more freely.” Paik said. “I feel proud for what I have done to make Korea a better place, for being part of the nation’s democratic progress. Ultimately, social progress comes down to whether the people voice their concern against social injustices. That is what leads us to a better future.“By Yeo Jun-suk","top intelligence agency arrested dozens ,south korean nationals were kidnapped ,attack against pyongyang nuclear provocations ,korea top intelligence agency arrested ,agency arrested dozens of activists","['South Korea ’s', 'Baik Tae - ung', 'the south korean Socialist Coalition of Workers', 'Korean', 'Amnesty International', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'the United States', 'the State of New York', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'the United Nations Human Rights Council ’s Working Group on Enforced', 'the William S.

The main opposition, The Minjoo Party of Korea, said Thursday that it would move forward a bill to create an investigation body to exclusively deal with senior officials’ corruption. The centrist runner-up People’s Party and progressive Justice Party pledged to support the initiative.“The bill is our top priority during the August parliamentary session,” said the Minjoo floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho.“With the opposition majority in the National Assembly and some ruling Saenuri Party lawmakers endorsing the plan, approval of the bill is highly likely.”According to the National Assembly Act, pending bills require a three-fifth quorum to clear the floor in the 300-member Assembly. Opposition party members and those considered to be in consent of the bills account for 169 seats, 11 short of the threshold line. Rep. Woo Sang-ho , floor leader of The Minjoo Party of Korea, speaks at a party meeting on Friday. On his side is Kim Chong-in, chairman of the party‘s interim leadership. YonhapThe draft bill provides that the anti-corruption agency must be an independent organization. Also, its leader is not required to have legal expertise but only “high reputation and extensive experience in his or her professional field.”The Minjoo Party said that the eased qualification reflects their commitment to ending the practice of legal elites monopolizing key regulatory positions. The previous version had limited the qualification as someone who has practiced law for at least 15 years.Also, at least half of the employees must be staffed with lawyers who do not work for prosecutors. The scope of the investigation was expanded to top-ranking government officials including former presidents.“ means there is no exemption from the probe,“ said Rep. Back Hye-ryun of the Minjoo Party, one of the key initiators of the bill. The requirement for launching the investigation was lowered. The agency will be obligated to kick off the probe when there is a request from a party with more than 20 members.But some legal experts expressed concern that the system could be abused by belligerent politicians with partisan agenda, saying that the relaxed scope and authority of investigation open the way for massive politicized accusation. “Technically speaking, former presidents are not classified as government officials,” professor Roh Myung-sun of Sungkyunkwan University Law School said in a media interview.”The  requirement may exponentially expand the scope of investigation.“It was not the first time that lawmakers sought to introduce an exclusive graft probe agency. Since 1996, a total of nine such bills have been motioned but mostly ended in failure, due to ruling party disapproval.Rep. Kweon Seong-dong, former prosecutor who now chairs the parliamentary legislation and judiciary committee, claimed that there is no need to create additional investigating authority. “I don’t think there is enough rationale for pushing the plan,” Kwon said. “What we need to do is to refine or improve the current system. Plus, opposition parties in the previous Assembly asked for establishing permanent special prosecutors’ office, instead of building the anti-corruption agency,” he said. But dissenting voices appeared to gain ground among the lawmakers outside of the faction close to President Park Geun-hye. The non-Park lawmakers, who plans to run for the party’s top post elected on Aug. 9, have said that they agree with establishing such organizations.

Those found guilty of breaking the rules could face fines of under 50 million won  and a jail term of less than five years.On May 18, 1980, more than 200,000 citizens of Gwangju, 329 kilometers south of Seoul, rose up against the military junta led by Gen. Chun Doo-hwan, who took power following the turmoil left by the assassination of then-President Park Chung-hee the previous year. The late president had ruled the country for 18 years before his death and is the father of incumbent President Park Geun-hye, while Chun went on to become a president of South Korea.The uprising is viewed as one of the key turning points in South Korean history that eventually led to the country shedding its authoritarian past.

In addition to the stiff penalties, the opposition has called for making ""March for the Beloved"" the official song of the May 18 movement, which would oblige everyone attending the national ceremony in Gwangju to sing it.Earlier this year, the conservative bloc opposed such calls over the song that commemorates the 1980 uprising.Since 1997, the uprising's signature song had been sung at the event, but the government of former President Lee Myung-bak decided in 2009 to have a choir perform the song and allow those that wanted to sing along to do so.","korea opposition parties on friday ,assassination of then president park ,opposition parties on friday vowed ,illegal to use newspapers tv ,the assassination of then president","[""South Korea 's"", 'Seoul', 'Chun Doo - hwan', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Park Geun', 'Chun', 'South Korea', 'south korean', 'Kim Chong - in', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Park Jie - won', ""People 's Party"", 'Lee Myung - bak']",2,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.4728162   0.30008334

U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump ""She supported the job-killing trade deal with South Korea. She has supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The TPP will not only destroy our manufacturing, but it will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments,"" Trump said.Trump said he will never sign any trade agreement that ""hurts our workers, or that diminishes our freedom and independence. We will never ever sign bad trade deals. America first again! America first!"" Instead, he said he will make individual deals with individual countries.""No longer will we enter into these massive deals with many countries that are thousands of pages long and which no one from our country even reads or understands. We are going to enforce all trade violations against any country that cheats,"" Trump said.That includes stopping China's ""outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation,"" he said.""Our horrible trade agreements with China and many others will be totally renegotiated. That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a much better deal for America and we'll walk away if we don't get that kind of a deal. We are going to start building and making things again,"" he said.Trump made no direct mention of renegotiating the trade deal with Korea specifically, but is widely expected to do so if elected to the White House. His aides have said that Trump wants to go back to ""ground zero"" with regards to the trade deal with Seoul.Trump also reiterated his determination to force allies to pay more for an American troop presence.""We will completely rebuild our depleted military, and the countries that we protect, at a massive loss, will be asked to pay their fair share,"" he said.In an interview with the New York Times published earlier in the day, Trump made a similar remark that he is ""absolutely prepared"" to tell U.S. allies, ""Congratulations, you will be defending yourself,"" unless they agree to shoulder more of the cost of an American troop presence.Making allies pay up for an American troop presence has been one of the top foreign policy priorities for Trump. The real-estate businessman has argued that it makes no sense for the U.S. to help defend such wealthy allies as Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia in exchange for little.

The regulation was further strengthened by having in the enforcement decree an all-out smoking ban at all restaurants.The restaurant owner raised the suit in August last year, saying that the comprehensive smoking ban without due compensation for consequent damages violated the right to property. He had also argued that the limit to freely operating his restaurant violated his right to pursue happiness.YonhapThe court said in its ruling that the relevant clauses cannot be deemed to have violated such constitutional rights as they did not obligate any removal or changes to the facilities and equipment of the restaurant. “As the legislation aims to protect the people staying in the restaurant from health risk through secondhand smoke, the appropriateness of the  purpose is also recognizable.”The court also said that while alternatives could include allowing adult smokers to smoke at the facility during a certain period, this would also expose nonsmokers to thirdhand smoking due to residual nicotine and other chemicals that remain in the space.Previous complaints were raised in 2011 and 2003.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon recently sent a letter to a former prime minister, political sources said Thursday, a move seen by local political observers here as a sign of his intent to run for Korea's presidential race slated for next year.In the letter sent to Kim Jong-pil, an iconic conservative politician from Chungcheong Province, who was once considered a contender for the presidency, Ban said he will visit once he returns to Korea in January, the sources said. The U.N. chief is also from the Chungcheong region.U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  meets Kim Jong-pil, a former prime minister in Seoul on May 28.The sources added the letter also expressed Ban's gratitude for greeting him during his visit to Korea in May, and asked Kim to give him ""guidance"" in the future as well. Kim, a former prime minister still has symbolic importance even though he has retired from frontline politics.Political pundits said the letter may reflect Ban's wish to seek the country's highest elected office. They added that it could also spark renewed debate, particularly among conservatives on the need to rally behind Ban next year, since there is a scarcity of contenders who could take on liberal candidates in the 2017 election.During his visit to South Korea earlier in the year, Ban said he would ""contemplate"" what he would do as a South Korean citizen when he returns to his home country after completing two terms as the U.N. helmsman at the end of this year.While Ban never clarified his plan, he has been standing at the top of the public survey on preferred potential candidates.According to the survey compiled by local pollster RealMeter on Thursday, Ban's approval rate came to 38 percent, handily beating Moon Jae-in, the former head of the Minjoo Party of Korea whose numbers stood at 31.8 percent.A source in Korea's foreign ministry, meanwhile, said that while some media outlets have raised issue with the possibility that Ban's letter may have been sent through a diplomatic pouch, he said there is nothing unusual if it did. He pointed out that using diplomatic pouches to deliver certain letters is a standing diplomatic tradition.","korea presidential race slated for ,political sources said thursday move ,for korea presidential race slated ,run for korea presidential race ,korea presidential race slated","['U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Korea', 'Kim Jong - pil', 'Chungcheong Province', 'Ban', 'Korea', 'U.N.', 'U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Kim Jong - pil', 'Seoul', 'Ban', 'Korea', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Ban', 'Ban', 'South Korea', 'Ban', 'south korean', 'U.N.', 'Ban', 'Ban', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Ban']",16,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.41575146  0.12615578

The Gangwon Pyeongchang Police are seeking an arrest warrant for the driver surnamed Bang. Bang had changed his statement twice. He initially gave false information that the accident occurred as he was changing lanes from the second lane to the first. However, recordings surfaced on social media showing that he had only driven on the first lane. Bang changed his statement, claiming that he had failed to see the cars in front. Shortly after, another recording showed Bang’s bus veering between lanes, igniting accusations of his having dozed off while driving. Bang then claimed that he had been reaching for some gum to curb his drowsiness, effectively admitting to having dozed. According to the police, Bang said he had started feeling drowsy 7 to 9 kilometers away from the site where he crashed into other vehicles. He had been driving at 105 kilometers per hour, over the speed limit of 100 kph. In the pileup of five cars, four women in their 20s died and 37 were injured.  The day before the accident, Bang had driven his tourist bus for five hours from Seoul to the city of Gangneung. The trip had taken double the usual time due to weekend congestion coinciding with the summer holidays. The group on the bus arrived at their accommodation at around 9 p.m. Bang said he dined with the mechanics who had been on the bus, but denied drinking. He told the police he slept in the bus instead of at the accommodation because the latter was “unfamiliar” and “too noisy.” He woke up at around 6 a.m. and spent the day driving around tourist spots.The 57-year-old had worked as a bus driver for 25 years. In 2014, he had his driver’s license revoked after being caught driving under the influence three times. Bang reacquired the license in March 2016.

Choi Kyung-hwan and Yoon Sang-hyun -- who lead the faction close to President Park Geun-hye -- demanded a fellow member to change his constituency citing it is the president‘s intent.Rep. Choi Kyung-hwan The two, in return, reportedly assured the politician that the pro-Park faction would support him during the party’s nomination process. The politician in question is believed to be Kim Sung-hoe, who served as a lawmaker between 2008 and 2012. Kim accepted the proposal, but failed to be nominated. Saenuri leadership quickly came to the fore on Tuesday, condemning any attempt by members without authority in meddling with the party’s executive affairs. “They are cats acting like lions who rely on the president’s name,” said the Saenuri Party’s floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk. “It is a significant violation that damages the party. Those who are involved with the nomination process without the right to do so should take time off and apologize to the people,” he said. The burgeoning scandal also prompted outrage among lawmakers who have been at odds with the pro-Park faction. The non-Parks planning to run for the leadership post in the Aug. 8 national convention were the most vocal.Third-term lawmaker Rep. Kim Yong-tae, who plans to run for the party’s top post, urged the Saenuri leadership to file a charge against Yoon and Choi for engaging in irregularities and demanded President Park clarify her positon toward what he called the “rigged” nomination process. Fourth-term lawmaker Rep. Joo Ho-young, who is also considering a bid for the chairmanship, agreed, “Those so-called power brokers have blackmailed to prevent their members from running in the elections,” said Joo who had defected from the party in April to protest against his nomination drop, and returned after the election.Meanwhile, the most senior member of the pro-Park faction Rep. Seo Chung-won on Tuesday decided not to run for the next party chairman. He had been widely speculated to join the race in place of Choi, who had earlier withdrawn his plan to run. The ongoing controversy surrounding the Park loyalists, as well as Seo’s retreat, is expected to further heat up the race by dispersing the votes of pro-Park members, observers said.The 73-year-old lawmaker is also being implicated in the nomination controversy, as his name was mentioned significantly in the leaked conversation. Rep. Lee Woo-hyun, one of Seo’s close aides, denounced the leak as an “act of cowardice” engineered to torpedo Seo’s bid for the top post. Throughout the conversation, Choi and Yoon were seen forcing Kim to change his constituency to avoid a showdown with Seo in the April election. The constituency from which Kim Sung-hoe withdrew is that of Seo who was elected there two terms in a row. “Sure, Sure, Sure. We’ll definitely help you ,” Choi reportedly said when asked by Kim whether the proposal reflects the intent of President Park. “You’d better take my advice. If you push things too hard, you would get nothing,” he said. Choi’s phone call was said to be preceded by Yoon’s, according to the report. Referring to Kim with the endearing term “brother,” the former presidential aide warned against Kim’s plan to run in Seo’s constituency. “Brother, I know how the president thinks. This is not the place to run,” Yoon said. “Be careful brother. You ask me about how the president thinks and I told you . I guaranteed your nomination. We can make it happen using the pro-Park campaign,” he said. It is not the first time that Yoon has been implicated in a political scandal.In March, Yoon said he would “get rid of” then-party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung to block his attempt to sway the nomination process in his favor. He was then kicked out of the party until he returned after winning the latest election.  Upon the revelation, both Choi and Yoon have canceled their public schedules and remained silent. Choi, who was supposed to begin his travels to the U.K. and other European nations, canceled his trip. Yoon was absent from the party’s regular meeting and parliamentary sessions. Their aides said that the lawmakers were tending to their private schedules.

Jeff Sessions , who oversees Trump's foreign policy team, has expressed deeply negative views of free trade deals, often using the pact with South Korea as an example to make the case the administration of President Barack Obama duped the country into supporting deals that turned out to be bad for the U.S.""I supported most of the trade deals. I supported the Korean -- when the last big one. I supported the China deal. I think they were now mistakes,"" Sessions said on MSNBC. ""The data came in. It was not anything close to what they promised.""""In Korea, they promised -- when Obama signed it and I voted for it -- that we would increase exports to Korea by $10 billion a year. It was $30 million in increase last year, four years later.Whereas their imports to us were $15 billion increase. The trade deficit is more than double,"" the senator said.Sessions said that the U.S. is a trading nation and he believes in trade, but stressed that the U.S. shouldn't allow its trading partners ""to cheat, to manipulate the currency manipulation and other things that take jobs unfairly.""He also said that Trump can show ""we've had bad trade deals and how things are not working well.""Trump has also been critical of free trade. In an economic policy speech early this month, the billionaire real-estate tycoon claimed that the free trade deal with Korea enlarged U.S. trade deficits and cost American jobs. He called the pact, which has been in effect since 2012 and is considered a symbol of the economic alliance between the two countries, ""a job-killing deal.""Trump also vowed to pull out of the yet-to-be-ratified, 12-nation Trans Pacific Partnership if elected president. He also said he would immediately renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement to get a better deal, and withdraw from the deal unless Canada and Mexico agree to a renegotiation.These negative views have reinforced concern that Trump could seek a renegotiation of the deal with Korea.Walid Phares, another foreign policy adviser to Trump, said in an interview with Yonhap New Agency in May that Trump wants to go back to ""ground zero"" with regard to the trade deal.These claims run counter to the view of the International Trade Commission that the Korea deal has been good for American interests.In a report late last month, the ITC said that the agreement with Korea is estimated to have improved bilateral merchandise trade balances by $15.8 billion last year. That means that had it not been for the deal, the U.S. trade deficits would have been larger.","countries job killing deal trump ,presidential candidate donald trump blasted ,job killing deal trump ,barack obama duped the country ,job killing deal trump also","['republican', 'Donald Trump', 'South Korea', 'american', 'asian', 'Jeff Sessions', 'Trump', 'South Korea', 'Barack Obama', 'Korean', 'China', 'MSNBC', 'Korea', 'Obama', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'american', 'Trans Pacific Partnership', 'the North American Free Trade Agreement', 'Canada', 'Mexico', 'Trump', 'Korea', 'Walid Phares', 'Trump', 'Yonhap New Agency', 'Trump', 'the International Trade Commission', 'Korea', 'american', 'ITC', 'Korea', 'U.S.']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.92379993  0.63838923

Lee said that he plans to take stern action in accordance with the result of the investigation into the case. “There cannot be any excuse for the inappropriate remarks made by a public servant under any circumstances,” Lee said. “Education officials take this case as an opportunity to make utmost efforts to have a desirable work ethic as a public servant.”A local daily had reported last week that Na Hyang-wook, the director general of the ministry’s police planning bureau, described the general public as “dogs and pigs” at a recent dinner gathering in Seoul with reporters. He allegedly said that the government should just make sure they are fed and alive. The report also quoted him as saying that equality is nothing but an unattainable illusion and there should be a stricter class system in Korea.Education Minister Lee Joon-sik attends a parliamentary committee meeting on Monday. As the alleged remarks prompted public outrage, the National Assembly called Na for questioning at its Education Committee. Na, who has withdrawn from his post, did not appear, causing the committee meeting to be suspended. Education Ministry officials said Na was currently staying at his hometown in Masan, South Gyeongsang Province, due to his “frail mental and physical condition.”Both ruling and opposition lawmakers lashed out at Na’s remarks as well as the education minister for condoning Na’s absence, and called for his immediate expulsion.Rep. Lee Jang-woo of the ruling Saenuri Party said, “ remarks are just not acceptable. I cannot understand how a high-ranking official can make such comments. We should make it clear what punishment will be imposed on him.” Rep. Woo Sang-ho, the floor leader of the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea, called on the government to expel Na. “We cannot see a person who described the public as dogs and pigs as a public servant receiving a paycheck from taxes.” Unions also expressed concerns over his remarks in a statement. “We cannot help but be worried about the future of our education as a high-ranking official in charge of mapping out Korean education policies has old-fashioned viewpoints such as advocating the class system for the top 1 percent,” said a union for the nation’s universities. A labor union for the nation’s public servants blamed the Park Geun-hye administration’s “authoritarian ruling system,” which led to the appointment of a person with “distorted” views in a key post. “The Constitution stipulates that public servants serve the public and take responsibility for the public. Na should be expelled from the public post forever,” it said in a statement. Na, who passed his civil service examination in 1993, previously served as the secretary for the minister and an administrative officer at Cheong Wa Dae under former President Lee Myung-bak. He was promoted to the head of the policy planning at the Education Ministry in March.

343,343,Korean mother-in-law’s mantra: Please cook for my son,"When Kim Eun-ju got married in 2007, she never expected her mother-in-law would call her every day to ask a particular question: What did you feed my son for breakfast today?  　“My mother-in-law would first call me, get my answers and then call my husband to check whether I lied to her or not,” the 39-year-old registered nurse told The Korea Herald. “She would call me every day for the first three months of my m...","When Kim Eun-ju got married in 2007, she never expected her mother-in-law would call her every day to ask a particular question: What did you feed my son for breakfast today?  “My mother-in-law would first call me, get my answers and then call my husband to check whether I lied to her or not,” the 39-year-old registered nurse told The Korea Herald. “She would call me every day for the first three months of my marriage – just to make sure I made him homemade breakfast.”Throughout her 10-year marriage, Kim said she struggled with her work and life balance partly because of her mother-in-law, who insisted all the household chores, especially cooking, were a woman’s job. As a nurse working at a general hospital, Kim would often have full-length nightshifts and catch up on her sleep during the day. But whenever Kim’s mother-in-law saw her husband doing laundry or cleaning, she would get upset and make him stop. She would tell her son: ‘Why on earth do you have to do such trivial work? All my life, my wish was to see you being respected .”“There were many times my mother-in-law interrupted my sleep during the day by calling me, just to ask me what I made my husband for breakfast,” she said. “I was so stressed about it and my mother ended up making side dishes for me -- so I can tell my mother-in-law I made my husband something good every day.”Generation gap among Korean women  South Korea’s family structure has gone through dramatic changes since the 1980s, and so has the collective experience of Korean women. From 2010 to 2014 alone, the number of double-income households increased from 27.9 percent to 31.2 percent. More women in Korea are being educated, participating in the labor force and putting off marriage.  Turbulent relationships between mothers-in-law and their daughters-in-law have been featured countless times in South Korea‘s TV series, films and plays. A scene from MBC‘s drama series ""Iron Lady Cha."" In the 1980s, only about 30 percent of Korean girls enrolled in post-secondary education, whereas 74.6 percent of school girls did so last year. Women’s employment rate also rose from 42.8 percent to 49.5 in the same time period. The average age at first marriage among Korean women increased significantly from 23 in 1981 to 30 this year. The generational dissonance between Korean mothers-in-law – who expects their daughters-in-law to take care of domestic chores and husbands even if they have their own careers – and their “worn-out” daughters-in-law have been prevalently discussed on Korea’s social media. Earlier this month, a citizen journalist’s column on her wish to be treated to a home-cooked dinner by her pregnant daughter-in-law triggered outrage among some netizens on SNS, some even calling it a “piece that belongs to the horror genre.” The netizens asked why the author expects a home-cooked meal -- which requires time and service on top of money – only from her daughter-in-law, not from her own son. “There is a severe generational gap between women born in the 1950s and 60s, and those who were born in the 70s and 80s,” said Hong Seung-ah, a researcher who specializes in women’s work and life balance at the Korean Women’s Development Institute. “While many of the older women spent their lives as housewives, thinking domestic chores and child care are women’s responsibilities, the younger generation value individual happiness and professional ambitions, as well as sharing domestic work with their  spouses.”Hong pointed out that for women in their 50s and older, the idea of sharing domestic responsibilities with their husbands was practically unthinkable, even if they had their own jobs while raising their young children. “They are not really used to the idea of equality at home. Regardless of their employment status, they considered domestic chores as their basic duty . And some of them have trouble coping with the changing gender roles as they are expecting their daughters-in-law to do the same.”Statistics show that Korean men still spend the least hours on domestic chores in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations. As of 2014, Korean women on average spent 3 hours and 25 minutes daily on household chores on weekdays, whereas men only spent 39 minutes. Jeong Eun-ji, a 34-year-old working wife, said Korean mothers in their 50s and older contributed to the gender disparity experienced by young married Korean women at home, by not teaching their sons how to perform household activities while raising them. Her husband, for example, lived with his parents for 34 years until he married Jeong two years ago. Throughout his entire life prior to the marriage, his mother did all household chores for him – preparing his meals, cleaning his room and doing his laundry. She said her younger brother was raised in a similar way – her mother would only make Jeong help her with cooking and other household chores. “It seems like my mother-in-law still wants me to replace her as his caregiver slash his personal chef, instead of treating him like an adult. She once told me, ‘your husband needs somebody to look after him. Otherwise he’s going to skip meals.’ But he’s 36 years old. If he skips meals, let him deal with it. It shouldn’t be his mother’s problem anymore.”A scene from jTBC‘s drama series “Childless Comfort,” which deals with a full-time pharmacist  and her difficult relationship with her mohter-in-law. Between ‘Please rest’ and ‘I appreciate your work’ Lee Mi-yeon, a 38-year-old public servant, thinks of her mother-in-law as a sweet, kind-hearted person. Born in 1948 to farmers in a small rural town, she couldn’t continue her studies after finishing elementary school as she had to care for her eight younger siblings while working in her family farm. After marrying Lee’s father-in-law, a railway worker from a not-so-affluent family, she became a full-time housewife and mother. “She just belongs to a different generation,” Lee said. “That does not make her a bad person.”For Lee’s mother-in-law, making food on national holidays for her grown children is one of her biggest joys. She also takes pride in being respected by her daughters-in-law, usually in the form of being treated to a home-cooked meal. But Lee said it was not always easy getting along with her mother-in-law, who firmly believed that domestic chores should be done by women. Whenever she and her husband visited the parents’ house, only Lee would have to help her make food, while her husband was told to rest. “She would always tell me, ‘I appreciate your hard work,’ while making sure my husband does not set foot in the kitchen,” she said. “She’d tell him: ‘Please rest, you have to rest. It’s your rare chance to relax away from work.’ But, you know, I’m also employed full-time.”Once, Lee was almost late for work because her mother-in-law, who was briefly staying at Lee’s house, insisted Lee must use newly cooked rice for her husband’s breakfast, instead of the left-over made the night before. “She said her son needs to have a proper breakfast with freshly cooked rice,” Lee said. Another time, when Lee’s family went on a camping, her husband ended up grilling the meat at an outdoor barbecue – as he was more experienced with the fire. Her mother-in-law became extremely upset. “She kept saying, ‘He should be eating! He should be eating !” Lee said. “It was as if she was witnessing his son being severely mistreated by others in public.”“My husband repeatedly explained that it’s more common for men to grill meat at a barbecue these days, but it just made her even more upset,” Lee said. Park Soo-ha, a 28-year-old working professional in Seoul, said she had to lie many times to her mother-in-law, especially when she and her husband ate out. Like Kim, Park also received regular phone calls from her mother-in-law, who would always ask her what she made for her husband for dinner each day. “I would just say whatever menu that popped up in my head,” she said. “One day I’d say we ate kimchi stew, the other day I’d say I cooked the meat you sent us a few days back. Should I repeat the same menu from the day before, she would say ‘You ate that again today?’” Once, when Park lied she made galchijjim, braised hairtail, for dinner, Park’s mother-in-law became suspicious. “She asked me to make the same dish and bring it to her house the next time I visit her,” she said. “So I bought the dish at a market and put it in a Tupperware container, to make it look like it’s homemade.”Feeling conflictedDuring her first year as a married woman, Lee Su-bin received an unexpected phone call from her sister-in-law. Lee had just made a reservation at a restaurant for her mother-in-law’s upcoming birthday. “My sister-in-law said, ‘Daughters-in-law are supposed to provide a home-cooked meal for their mothers-in-law’s first birthday that they celebrate as a family. You know that, right?’” Despite the pressure, Lee went ahead with the restaurant plan, as her husband defended Lee on her behalf.But Lee said she felt guilty when her mother-in-law’s birthday returned a year later.“So I just decided to make her a home-cooked birthday dinner just to get it off my chest,” she said.Lee said as a woman who grew up in a gender-specific culture, she finds herself feeling conflicted about such traditional yet sexist expectations on daughters-in-laws.“To be honest, I know that if I had a younger brother and his wife didn’t provide a home-cooked dinner for my mother’s birthday, I would also question her fitness to become the member of our family,” she said. Park, meanwhile, said even her own mother tells her to make sure her husband eats properly. “I make more money than my husband, and I work longer hours than him,” she said. “And still, cooking is considered my responsibility ”Colliding different dreamsIt took some time for Kim’s mother-in-law to understand why Kim needs to catch up on her sleep during the day. She’s never been treated as an inpatient at a general hospital, and has only encountered nurses at small clinics. She simply thought being a nurse at night can’t be “that hard.”“In my mother-in-law’s time, most married women who had a job worked as bookkeepers, domestic workers or teachers,” Kim said. “She said all the nurses she’d encountered are ‘just sitting down’ a lot of the time.”Three years ago, her mother-in-law temporarily moved in to Kim’s house to care for her grandchildren. Her mother-in-law did not understand why Kim was always asleep during the day, and why her son was doing domestic chores.Once, before going to work, Kim was about to have her lunch at home after waking up during the day. But all of a sudden, her mother-in-law started cleaning the fridge and took every item out of it, making the kitchen too cluttered to prepare anything. “I still don’t know why she did that,” Kim said. “I just grabbed a piece of bread on my way to work and cried until I arrived in the hospital. It just felt so unfair.”To tackle the situation, Kim’s husband had to repeatedly explain to his mother, in detail, what Kim has to do at work -- including maintaining reports of patient’s medical histories and providing instant care during medical emergencies.With Kim’s husband’s help, her mother-in-law has changed over the years, albeit reluctantly, she said. She no longer calls Kim during the day. She now asks her own sons for help when preparing for food on holidays. “My mother-in-law said although my husband is her own son, he is still a grown man, and she’s just not comfortable nor used to asking adult male for favors,” Kim said.One of Kim’s mother-in-law’s biggest joys has been ironing her son’s suits. Kim never really understood why, until about four years ago. Having been married to a blue-collar worker, her mother-in-law said she at least hoped her son to be respected by others. To her, a respected man was someone who is highly educated, successful, does not have worry about domestic chores and treated well by his wife and his children. “I’ve always admired women who get to iron suits for her husbands,” Kim’s mother-in-law told her four years ago, while ironing her son’s shirt. “But ironing suits for my spouse has never been one of my lifelong wishes,” Kim said.

Suh Chung-won, an eighth-termer who is said to be considering his candidacy upon the request of the pro-Park Geun-hye clique.Rep. Chung Byoung-gug on Sunday announces his bid for the ruling Saenuri Party’s chairmanship election. Yonhap“I announce my bid in the party’s chairmanship election, seeking to renew the Saenuri and to renovate the nation,” said fifth-termer Chung Byoung-gug during a press conference.“I will restore fundamental conservative values such as liberal democracy, market economy and national security.”The party’s national convention, including its election for new leadership, is slated for Aug. 9.Chung’s key slogan is to end the rampant abuse of power, which has often been pointed out as a social ill that triggers discrimination and violence.“What the people want the most is to put an end to such abuse of power. We should learn from their anger so as to implement disruptive and creative self-reform,” he said.It was the party’s arrogance which made the public turn its back on it in the April 13 general election, resulting in the crushing defeat of the ruling conservative camp, according to Chung.Chung, who served as culture minister in the former Lee Myung-bak administration, is considered a representative member of the non-Park cluster, standing at odds with the pro-Park mainstreamers.Speaking for the pro-Park faction, fourth-termer and former broadcasting announcer Rep. Han Sun-kyo also announced his bid to join in the race, along with other pro-Park members who have already confirmed their candidacy. Among them is Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, a former senior presidential secretary for public affairs, who recently came under fire for allegedly censoring a public broadcasting report on the Sewol ferry sinking in 2014 that had blamed the nation’s coast guard for neglecting rescue duties.“I cannot suddenly turn into a non-Park figure but I will give up all vested rights of the pro-Park faction,” Rep. Han said, calling for self-reflection and unity.The main concern for both factions, however, is whether Rep. Suh Chung-won will also run, in response to calls from pro-presidential members.Last week, former Deputy Prime Minister and ranking pro-Park figure Rep. Choi Kyung-hwan renounced his candidacy, encouraging Rep. Suh to take control of the party. This move drew complaints -- from within and outside the party -- that pro-Park Suh is not fit to achieve the political reforms required of the party.Observers nevertheless speculated that the obvious support from his faction and from the president may eventually push him to accept the challenge.“I appreciate your efforts as the top senior member ,” President Park told Rep.

When the reporters asked Na to define “the general public” for them, the official reportedly said they are “the 99 percent of all Koreans.” The official, who defined himself as a “person who tries hard to belong to the remaining 1 percent,” also argued that there should be a stricter caste system in Korea, and the general public should accept the fact that equality is nothing but an unattainable illusion. The official also shared his views on the race-based “caste system” that he thinks currently exists in the U.S., claiming that African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans, “don’t even try to climb the social ladder” and have no ambition in politics.“All the senators and representatives have to do is to provide a means of survival for such people in the U.S.,” Na reportedly told reporters.One of the most controversial remarks made by Na that night was his comments on the case of a 19-year-old contract worker who died in May at Guui Station in Seoul. He was killed by an incoming train after getting stuck behind a platform screen door that he was trying to repair.The reporters challenged Na that night, arguing his own children may belong to the 99 percent should they fail to secure full-time employment. “Think about the victim who was killed at Guui station – how would you feel if the victim were your own child?” the reporters asked Na.The official said those who say they empathize with the specific case were “hypocrites” and that he could not really imagine  of such labor accident happening to his own children. A caste-driven society is more “practical” than societies where social mobility is possible and fluid,  he added. The reporters told him that they may publish his remarks and asked him for his official explanation, but he declined to comment further, they said. According to local studies, social immobility is becoming more prevalent among the younger generation in South Korea, especially in terms of their access to education and housing. A report by the Korea institute for Health and Social Affairs showed that as of last year, 89 percent of Koreans in their 20s and 30s who received higher education also had university-educated parents. Following the news report on Friday, all three opposition parties released statements criticizing both Na and the Education Ministry. “Na’s comments are beyond shocking. They give us a sense of despair,” the Minjoo Party of Korea said in a statement. “As his job is to oversee the nation’s education policies, the Education Ministry is also responsible for what he said. The ministry needs to reform itself.”The People’s Party asked for Na’s resignation, while the Justice Ministry asked for an official apology from the government.The Korean Federation of Teachers’ Associations also released a statement, asking for a thorough investigation of the case and disciplinary measures against Na. Na, who passed his civil service examination back in 1993, previously served as the secretary for Education Minister, an administrative officer at Cheong Wa Dae for former President Lee Myung-bak, as well as an officer at the Education Ministry’s University Support Bureau before being promoted to his latest position in March. “Both Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye administrations should provide an explanation on how someone like Na was given such important positions in the ministry, as well as on what grounds he was promoted in March,” said the nongovernmental organization People’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy in a statement, while asking for Na’s permanent expulsion.  By Claire Lee","parents following the news report ,in seoul he was killed ,night arguing his own children ,friday all three opposition parties ,stricter caste system in korea","['Education Ministry', 'Seoul', 'Na', 'Koreans', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'African - Americans', 'Hispanic - Americans', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Guui', 'Na', 'South Korea', 'Korea', 'Health and Social Affairs', 'Koreans', 'the Education Ministry', 'Na ’s', 'the Minjoo Party', 'the Education Ministry', 'People ’s Party', 'Na ’s', 'the Justice Ministry', 'the Korean Federation of Teachers ’ Associations', 'Education', 'Cheong', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'the Education Ministry ’s University Support Bureau', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Park Geun', 'People ’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy', 'Na ’s', 'Claire Lee']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42122102  0.59048504

346,346,[Herald Interview] KATUSA fraternity aims to be voice of alliance,"When U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump started accusing Seoul of getting a “free-ride” from Washington for its defense, many South Koreans reacted angrily, since they collectively pay nearly 1 trillion won ($865 million) each year for the upkeep of U.S. troops here.

There were also concerns about the future of the security alliance. For Kim Jong-wook, the chairman of the KATUSA Veterans Association, Trump’s remarks highlighted the sheer absence of robust voices at home and in the U.S. that could speak for the two countries’ need for the alliance. And that is precisely the vision he envisages for the fledgling association, which set out as a miniscule social meeting in 2007 before evolving into a 9,000-strong government-registered fraternity in 2013. Now the group is striving for the launch of what is set to be the largest Korea-U.S. veterans’ society in the U.S. this year, which could help shape the two countries’ defense policy, support the alliance and carry out community service. “With former U.S. Forces Korea commanders being the pivot, it should be capable of raising voices on pressing issues, and I think it’s surely possible given their experience on the ground and also in policymaking,” Kim said in an interview Tuesday with The Korea Herald in Seoul. “I regret that there was virtually no organization that could speak out with a united voice when Trump made the arguments. I believe veterans could have influence, especially if brought together in a society like America that has high respect for them.” Kim Jong-wook, chairman of the KATUSA Veterans Association, poses during an interview with The Korea Herald at his office in western Seoul on Tuesday. Kim, the chief executive and president of Swissport Korea Ltd., an Incheon-based cargo handler, himself served at KATUSA, or the Korean Augmentation Troops to the U.S. Army, from 1977 and 1979. At the 2nd Infantry Division’s data center in Dongducheon, Gyeonggi Province, he polished not only his English skills but computer and data processing expertise, which helped him land a job at the Busan Container Terminal Authority after his service. “My days at KATUSA changed my career path and I benefited much from that. So I had always been thinking to give back to the U.S. Forces Korea and KATUSA through social service and alliance support programs,” he said. Some 250,000 South Koreans are estimated to have served under the KATUSA since the 1950-53 Korean War. The association solely runs on fees from its 9,000 active members, which amount to an annual budget of nearly 150 million won. Every June, the group holds a commemoration ceremony at the U.N. Memorial Cemetery in Busan and Korean War Veterans Memorial in Washington, calling the names of every KATUSA who fell during the battle. The surviving veterans also take part in volunteer work at orphanages, deliver briquettes to the underprivileged on a regular basis and arrange social gatherings with United States Forces Korea leadership. They also give awards to outstanding conscripts at the KATUSA Training Academy in Camp Jackson in Uijeongbu, Gyeonggi Province. Kim pinned high hopes on the envisioned establishment of the Korea Defense Veterans Association, which would embrace retired and in-service USFK soldiers as well as those from the KATUSA. The size of its membership remains to be seen, but it could be the largest-ever in the U.S. with ties to South Korea, given that some 3.5 million Americans have served here since the Korean War. Walter Sharp, a former USFK commander from 2008-11, will chair the association and be joined by other ex-generals including Leon Laporte and James Thurman. Last month, Kim met with them in Washington to discuss the project, he said. “We aim to collect the $500,000 required for the registration in the U.S. by the end of September and hold a formal inauguration ceremony at the end of the year,” Kim said. “The veterans are valuable resources in light of the scale of the USFK, which is unmatched anywhere else outside the U.S., as they can help promote our interests. We need to actively make use of them, and the KVA would be the Seoul chapter for the KDVA.”By Shin Hyon-hee","donald trump started accusing seoul ,republican presidential candidate donald trump ,presidential candidate donald trump ,candidate donald trump started accusing ,presidential candidate donald trump started","['U.S.', 'republican', 'Donald Trump', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'South Koreans', 'U.S.', 'Kim Jong - wook', 'the KATUSA Veterans Association', 'Trump ’s', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Kim', 'the Korea Herald', 'Seoul', 'Trump', 'America', 'Kim Jong - wook', 'the KATUSA Veterans Association', 'the Korea Herald', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'Swissport Korea Ltd.', 'Incheon', 'KATUSA', 'the Korean Augmentation Troops', 'the U.S. Army', 'the 2nd', 'Infantry Division ’s', 'Dongducheon', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'the Busan Container Terminal Authority', 'KATUSA', 'the U.S. Forces Korea', 'KATUSA', 'South Koreans', 'KATUSA', 'Busan', 'Washington', 'katusa', 'United States Forces Korea', 'the KATUSA Training Academy', 'Camp Jackson', 'Uijeongbu', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Kim', 'the Korea Defense Veterans Association', 'KATUSA', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Americans', 'Walter Sharp', 'USFK', 'Leon Laporte', 'James Thurman', 'Kim', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'Kim', 'USFK', 'U.S.', 'KVA', 'Seoul', 'the KDVA.”By Shin Hyon - hee']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.74095118  1.0323025

Chung Jin-suk, vice floor leader Rep. Kim Do-eup and chief policymaker Rep. Kim Gwang-lim.This was their first official encounter since the presidential office reshuffled its ranking members including the chief of staff. The ruling party established its incumbent leadership last month.The key agenda of the meeting was economic revitalization, a push which has gained further momentum recently in the wake of Britain’s decision to exit the European Union and its consequent impact on the global economy.“Economy is by far the most crucial task,” said the Saenuri Party’s chief Kim, pressing for immediate economic rescue plans.“As a result of Brexit, the global economy has grown vulnerable, while some of our core industries have come to require restructuring.”The party chief also stressed that the restructuring program should not remain at a superficial level but should get to the root of the problem.Presidential Chief of Staff Lee called for unity between the government and ruling party.“What the people want the most is for the government and the ruling party to join hands and stabilize the economy.“The presidential office, ruling party and government will work together to process the labor reform and deregulation bills, which failed to pass the previous Assembly,” Lee said.Saenuri whip Chung, meanwhile, also took time to distance the party from the Blue House ahead of the meeting, namely over criticism of the presidential office lacking communication with the public.“The government and Cheong Wa Dae should change their way of thought, so as to reinforce communication with the people,” he said. He later said during the meeting that the government and the party should work together as a “dream team.”Prime Minister Hwang placed focus on pushing for the extra budget plan set to support the restructuring program for ailing industries, especially the distressed shipbuilding sector.“We have limited time on our hands , but such challenges may be overcome, if we work together for the same goal,” he said.During the gathering, noneconomic issues were also discussed, such as fine dust pollution, toxic humidifier disinfectant aftermaths, follow-up measures for Sewol ferry victims, and the country’s cash-strapped Nuri child care curriculum, according to officials.The three-way talks were originally scheduled to be held on June 17, shortly after the new Assembly kicked off, but was called off due to the Saenuri’s internal feuding.On June 14, the party’s emergency committee decided to reinstate seven controversial defectors who had left the camp in the run-up to the April 13 general election, rekindling the factional divide within the party and widening the gap between the party and the presidential house.At the heart of the dispute was Rep. Yoo Seong-min, Daegu’s fourth-termer and the party’s former floor leader, known for his deep rift with President Park Geun-hye. His return to his home camp has been considered a yardstick of Saenuri’s willingness to overcome the chronic strife between the pro-Park and the non-Park factions.Interim committee chief Kim Hee-ok, who had temporarily boycotted party affairs in protest against the reformists’ decision, resumed his position upon Chung’s apology, to lead the party until it elects new leadership in early August.By Bae Hyun-jung","government met thursday seeking to ,the government met thursday seeking ,government met thursday seeking ,april 13 general election rekindling ,the government met thursday","['the Saenuri Party', 'Cabinet', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn ’s', 'National Assembly', 'the Blue House', 'Lee Won - jong', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Hee - ok', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'Kim Do - eup', 'Kim Gwang - lim', 'Britain', 'the European Union', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'Kim', 'Brexit', 'Lee', 'Assembly', 'Lee', 'Saenuri', 'Chung', 'Blue House', 'Hwang', 'Nuri', 'Assembly', 'Saenuri', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Daegu ’s', 'Park Geun', 'Saenuri ’s', 'Kim Hee - ok', 'Chung', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.75077307  0.19336681

Park Jie-won, the interim chief of the People’s Party, threatened Thursday to hold a parliamentary hearing over a former presidential secretary’s alleged attempt to censor South Korea’s public broadcaster in its coverage of the Sewol disaster in 2014. “Cheong Wa Dae should apologize for the intervention in media coverage,” Park said during a meeting of the National Assembly’s third-biggest party. “Otherwise, opposition parties will seek parliamentary measures to get to the bottom .” People’s Party floor leader Rep. Park Jie-won speaks during a party meeting at the National Assembly on Thursday. Park Hae-mook/The Korea HeraldIn a phone conversation leaked last week, former presidential press secretary Rep. Lee Jung-hyun demanded KBS broadcasting director Kim Shi-gon revise a news story about the ferry disaster. In the recording, Lee of the ruling Saenuri Party asked the news director to “remove” and “rerecord” the report because it could paint a negative picture of now-defunct Korea Coast Guard, which was tasked with the rescue operation. The Coast Guard’s lackluster response to the disaster had sparked public outrage and led President Park Geun-hye to disband it later. The news director, who left his post after the disaster, claimed Wednesday that he was forced to resign under pressure from KBS chief Gil Hwan-young who, according to Kim, said that the decision was the “intent” of President Park Geun-hye. Since the allegations surfaced, Lee has insisted that the conversation was part of his job as a press secretary. Saenuri Party Rep. Lee Jung-hyun announces his bid to run for the party’s chairman post at a press conference on Thursday. Park Hae-mook/The Korea HeraldDespite the controversy, Lee announced Thursday his bid for the party’s chairmanship.“There is only one purpose to my bid. I will change the politics of the Republic of Korea,” Lee said in a press conference. “I will protect the country, protect the people, and protect the values of the Republic of Korea,” Lee said.This is his third bid to become chair of the ruling party. The other candidates are fifth-termer Rep. Lee Joo-young and third-termer Rep. Kim Yong-tae. Kim is the only candidate outside the Pro-Park faction. The chairperson will be elected at the party’s national caucus on Aug. 9. The new leadership will be elected in lieu of simmering in-house competition among potential candidates for next year’s presidential election and amid the looming lame duck period of President Park.Lee Jung-hyun, who hails from Gokseong, South Jeolla Province, is considered a trusted mouthpiece of the president. The third-termer famously cried in a television interview during the 2012 presidential race while defending Park from critics of her political disposition in relation to her late father and former President Park Chung-hee. Park’s campaign four years ago picked up pace after a series of setbacks, after Lee joined the campaign team as head of communications. He first joined the National Assembly as a proportional representative in 2008. He has also served as Park’s senior secretary for political affairs. Lee won his latest term in his hometown that is part of a region traditionally considered anti-Saenuri.By Yeo Jun-suk","the people party threatened thursday ,leaked last week former presidential ,presidential race while defending park ,threatened thursday to hold parliamentary ,week former presidential press secretary","['Park Jie - won', 'the People ’s Party', 'South Korea ’s', 'Park', 'the National Assembly ’s', 'People ’s Party', 'Park Jie - won', 'the National Assembly', 'Park Hae - mook', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'KBS', 'Kim Shi - gon', 'Lee', 'Saenuri Party', 'Korea Coast Guard', 'the Coast Guard ’s', 'Park Geun', 'KBS', 'Gil Hwan - young', 'Kim', 'Park Geun', 'Lee', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'Park Hae - mook', 'Lee', 'the Republic of Korea', 'Lee', 'the Republic of Korea', 'Lee', 'Lee Joo - young', 'Kim Yong - tae', 'Kim', 'Park', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'Gokseong', 'South Jeolla Province', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Park ’s', 'Lee', 'the National Assembly', 'Park ’s', 'Lee', 'anti - Saenuri', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36706084  0.03032291

""I urge  to stop different factions from pointing their fingers at each other and hating each other.""Saenuri Party Rep. Choi Kyung-hwan speaks during a press conference at the National Assembly on July 6, 2016. The group of lawmakers close to the president, called the pro-Park faction, has demanded that Choi join the leadership election, scheduled for Aug. 9. Since the party's preceding leadership resigned over an election debacle in the April 13 parliamentary polls, the party has been led by an interim leadership committee. With about a month left before the leadership election, a series of senior party bigwigs have expressed their intention to join the race. Among them are Lee Ju-young, a pro-Park lawmaker, and Kim Yong-tae, part of a faction that is not close to President Park.Suh Chung-won, an eight-term lawmaker close to the president, has also been mentioned as a likely candidate, although he has been reluctant to enter the race. Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, President Park's former chief publicity secretary and confidant, said he would declare his bid to join the leadership race on Thursday.","the leadership race on thursday ,presidential election slated for december ,leadership election slated for august ,leadership resigned over an election ,leadership race on thursday","['Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Choi Kyung - hwan', 'Saenuri Party', 'Choi', 'Choi Kyung - hwan', 'the National Assembly', 'Choi', 'Lee Ju - young', 'pro - park', 'Kim Yong - tae', 'Suh Chung - won', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'Park']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64258611  0.34458923

That deadline passed on June 17.The department is expected to submit the report this week as it is unable to delay any longer, and the report is expected to mention the North's leader, the source said on condition of anonymity.

He even suggested allowing South Korea and Japan to develop their own nuclear weapons for self-defense to reduce U.S. security burdens.About 28,500 American troops are stationed in Korea to deter North Korean aggression, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.

State media’s recent dispatches signaled the shift in their introductions of Minister of People’s Armed Forces Pak Yong-sik. The ministry had been overseen by the National Defense Commission, the communist state’s potent top governing body, which was dismantled with the launch of the State Affairs Commission during a parliamentary meeting last week. “This indicates that the ministry is now under the control of the cabinet instead of the now-defunct NDC,” said Cheong Seong-chang, head of unification strategy at the Sejong Institute who has been monitoring changes within the North’s top echelons for years. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un  is inducted as chairman of the new State Affairs Commission during a session of the Supreme People’s Assembly on Wednesday in an image carried on June 30 by the Rodong Sinmun. “As a member of the SAC himself, Pak would now have to keep following Kim’s direct orders while actively reflecting instructions from the premier .” Alongside the agency, the Ministry of People’s Security led by Choe Pu-il has also possibly been repositioned within the cabinet or the SAC, given his appointment to the fledgling organization. The perceived transfer indicates the young leader’s ongoing drive to dilute the influence of the powerful, rigid military in his state governance, shying away from his late father’s “songun ” mantra in favor of the party and cabinet playing a greater role, Cheong said. “With the Armed Forces Ministry being in charge of military diplomacy and logistics and welfare programs, the decision was probably intended to facilitate the military’s cooperation in the cabinet’s economic campaign,” he added. “As a result, the military’s traditionally robust standing is relatively weakening, whereas the influences of the party and the cabinet are growing further.” But Seoul’s Unification Ministry remained cautious, saying more analysis is needed to confirm the move. Other experts such as Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, also noted that it was too early to come to a conclusion because Pyongyang had changed the Armed Forces Ministry’s name and then restored it again in the past. “It is to be determined after collecting further information whether the Armed Forces Ministry’s affiliation has actually changed to the cabinet or it remains within the SAC, but with a different name,” ministry spokesperson Jeong Joon-hee said at a regular news briefing. Last Wednesday, North’s rubber-stamp Supreme People’s Assembly unveiled the formation of the SAC and named Kim its chairman, which is the “top position” in the country. But little has since been revealed other than the relaunch of the Committee for the Peaceful Unification of the Fatherland as an independent state organ in charge of inter-Korean affairs, detaching it from the party. In another development, the official Korean Central News Agency on Sunday introduced Ma Won-chun, the formerly director of the NDC’s Designing Department, as from the SAC, though still with the same position.

362,362,[NEWS ANALYSIS] Does populism also stand a chance in Korea?,"Over the past few months, the populist movement has taken center stage in global politics.

Ranging from presidential nominee Donald Trump in the U.S. to Brexit, antiestablishment sentiments are sweeping across some of the most advanced democracies in the world.On the exterior, South Korea seems to be unaffected by this phenomenon, as the nation stands mostly together in its prolonged confrontation with North Korea and in pursuit of economic growth. Politics may be boisterous, but the directions and solutions preached by rivaling parties remain in the same vein.Derived from the Latin word “populus,” which means people in English, populism commonly refers to an ideology that “pits a virtuous and homogeneous people against a set of elites,” according to “Twenty First Century Populism,” coauthored by political scientists Daniele Albertazzi and Duncan McDonnell. In the latest case of the U.S. and the U.K., the populists came to the fore advocating bans on foreign immigrants, denying multinational treaties and alliances and departing from international institutions, in a nationalistic move against globalization. “The populists in the U.S. and Europe have appealed to the frustration by the voters who are left in the cold during globalization,” said Chun Sang-jin, a sociology professor at Sogang University.New York businessman Donald Trump and other chauvinistic politicians across the European continent, such as Jean-Marie Le Pen from Front National in France, rose to prominence after they campaigned to stop immigration, close borders and adopt protectionism.  But populism takes on quite a different meaning in Korea. Populists in Korea have galvanized regionalism among voters to roll out election pledges only catered to specific constituents. The conservative and liberal parties alike have often created a sense of hatred among different provinces mainly between the conservative-based Gyeongsang provinces and liberal-based Jeolla provinces -- all in the hopes of getting supporters to rally behind their causes. Populism therefore has become the byword for bad politics as its scope here includes unrealistic welfare promises, pitting people against one another based on their social and economic standings. Earlier this month, progressive mayors Park Won-soon of Seoul and Lee Jae-myung of Seongnam were labeled “populist” by President Park Geun-hye for their pledges to help young people search for jobs by offering them monthly subsidies in cash.Meanwhile, none of the mainstream parties advocate protectionism. The conservative Saenuri Party, central-left The Minjoo Party of Korea and center-right The People’s Party proclaim they embrace free movement of goods and service. “Populism in the U.S. and Europe has grown alongside increasing challenges in the open economy and massive immigration. As luck would have it, South Korea has faced few challenges on that front,” said Lee Byoung-hoon, a sociology professor at Chung-Ang University in Seoul.Historically, Korea has rarely been divided over differences in trade policies. Since it joined the World Trade Organization in 1995 as a founding member, it has embraced free trade. The only exception was the free trade agreement with the U.S., which led to antigovernment rallies mostly led by liberal groups. Another factor is the nation’s restricted immigration policy. According to 2015 statistics from the Ministry of Interior, the ratio of foreigners to the total population is about 3 percent, with most staying in Korea as temporary workers, not permanent residents. Behind reluctant immigration policies lie strong nationalism, said Shin Yul, a political professor at Myongji University. He noted that chauvinist politicians in the U.S. and Europe have spearheaded anti-immigration policies and that Korea’s nationalistic sentiment could become the driving force of a similar movement, such as against North Korea and the country’s “sacrosanct principle” of eventually seeking for reunification.“Of course, there was no significant uprising of chauvinistic politicians here. But that ironically shows that such nationalist views are already generally deep-rooted in South Korea. Korea is not behind the present Western democracies in terms of its nationalistic movement. It is quite the other way around,” Shin said.Experts said that South Koreans are as xenophobic as those in Western democracies -- if not more -- and that it is only “a matter of time” before antiestablishment politicians come to the fore -- as long as the stage is set for them. “South Korea has fertile ground for a populist movement to thrive,” said Chun Sang-jin, a sociology professor of Sogang University. “It is inevitable for the ‘globalized’ country to face populist challenges. I think we have about 20 years left before confronting the problem,” he said.Shin agreed and said the antagonistic sentiment would get stronger if South Korea was to face a massive inflow of immigrants from the North upon reunification. “Nationalism is the idea of ‘us’ creating a community. South Koreans are not likely to treat a North Korean as one of them,” he said.For the time being, in a move to avoid association with extremist groups, political leaders and presidential hopefuls mostly cast themselves as moderates. Any move perceived as radical or populist has been quickly condemned by the masses.For instance, it was revealed in 2014 that the Saenuri Party had appointed as its strategist a conservative activist who allegedly helped the far-right online community “Ilbe” stage a smear campaign against victims of the Sewol ferry disaster. He had been put in charge of removing “left-wing ideologies.”It was considered to be a coalition between establishment political groups and right-wing ideology.Right-wingers in Korea dominantly advocate patriotism, criticizing left-wingers for ignoring national interest by speaking on behalf of minors.More recently, a communications official from the presidential office was accused of having a rightist civic group, “Korean Parent Federation,” hold pro-government rallies, with the nation’s biggest business association accused of funding the activities.Both acts were heavily criticized, and the conservative camp immediately disassociated themselves from such moves.Rival party chiefs and floor leaders have echoed centrists’ rhetoric in their latest parliamentary speeches such as creating lucrative jobs and reducing income disparity. But the unanimous call for “moving to the center” is another version of a worrisome movement designed to champion the established political and economic system, said British Pakistani scholar Tariq Ali in his book “The Extreme Center: A Warning.” The leftist activist said in his critically acclaimed book that centrist politicians, who have won general elections since the late 1980s, only served the interest of the market and caused corruption and dysfunction in British and European politics. Sociology professor Chun agreed, “It seems to me that the global challenge these days requires more than business-as-usual solutions. Under these circumstances, people will feel frustrated at the loss of a group representing their interests and become more likely to sympathize with radical ideas.” By Yeo Jun-suk","global politics ranging from presidential ,trump and other chauvinistic politicians ,presidential nominee donald trump ,politics ranging from presidential nominee ,acclaimed book that centrist politicians","['Donald Trump', 'U.S.', 'Brexit', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'latin', 'Daniele Albertazzi', 'Duncan McDonnell', 'U.S.', 'U.K.', 'U.S.', 'Chun Sang - jin', 'Sogang University', 'New York', 'Donald Trump', 'european', 'Jean - Marie Le Pen', 'Front National', 'France', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Gyeongsang', 'Jeolla', 'Park Won - soon', 'Seoul', 'Lee Jae - myung', 'Seongnam', 'Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'the People ’s Party', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Lee Byoung - hoon', 'Chung - Ang University', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'the World Trade Organization', 'U.S.', 'the Ministry of Interior', 'Korea', 'Shin Yul', 'Myongji University', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'Korea', 'western', 'Shin', 'South Koreans', 'South Korea', 'Chun Sang - jin', 'Sogang University', 'South Korea', 'South Koreans', 'north korean', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Korea', 'korean Parent Federation', 'british', 'pakistani', 'Tariq Ali', 'british', 'european', 'Chun', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.72002769  0.74570644

It was prepared as a lunch for elementary school students aged approximately 7 to 12.Not only did the meal seem to lack enough nutritional value for a growing child, but it also seemed unable to justify the fixed price per meal at 3,000-3,500 won .“Why do innocent schoolchildren have to eat this poor meal?” read one comment. “It is really shocking and sad for them,” said another.Hygiene at the school’s kitchen was also found to be inadequate. Some fifth and sixth graders said they sometimes found hair, tissues and plastic pieces in their meals. One government investigation, found that food trays contained up to 5,979 types of bacteria, about 30 times more than would normally be expected.Students at an elementary school in Seoul receive rice cakes and fruit juice as a replacement for a regular school meal, after temporary school staff at some 115 schools in Seoul went on strike on June 23. About 40 percent of temporary workers at schools are cooks in school kitchens. YonhapThe Daejeon Metropolitan Office of Education immediately released an apology and vowed to conduct a special audit into Bongsan Elementary School through a committee comprising parents, civic groups and field experts. As a result, seven faculty staff in the school kitchen, including a nutritionist and cook, lost their jobs.South Korea’s public schools have been providing meals since 2003. A total of 6.14 million students at some 11,700 elementary, middle, high and special schools nationwide were provided meals from Monday to Friday at their schools as of February, according to the Education Ministry. The current School Meals Act states that the local government is responsible for ensuring meals are nutritional and produced in hygienic conditions. After a huge food poisoning scandal broke out in schools in Incheon in 2006, stricter regulations, such as mandatory food service from school-operated kitchens and penalty systems, were introduced. Despite the government and municipalities’ efforts to improve conditions at school kitchens and meals, complaints have continued to grow among students and workers at school kitchens.Jeong Su-bin, a 17-year-old high school student in Suwon, told The Korea Herald that she buys her lunch from a nearby convenience store on her way to school. She said the diverse options to choose for her meal, despite most of them presumably containing significant amounts of preservatives, was the biggest merit of not relying on the school kitchen.“Food at my school is simply not tasty,” said Jeong, adding she normally buys bulgogi kimbap or crab sandwiches. Jeong said she started to buy her own meals after she was told to eat all the leftovers on her food tray. She said she was given a large portion from the staff at the school kitchen, and was forced to eat it all due to the penalty system at her school.“It was like a nightmare. Why do I have to eat bad-tasting food just because it was on my food tray?” asked Jeong.A photo uploaded by a parent of a student at Bongsan Elementary School shows a school meal served at an elementary school. Many of the schools here face problems from food waste, which costs a tremendous amount of money to dispose of each year. According to Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education, at least 2 billion won was spent in 2015 to dispose of 15,970 tons of food waste at schools in Seoul. This accounted for 13.3 percent of the total school support budget provided by the government.Statistics in 2013 showed that an average of 30.8 kilograms of food waste was produced by a single high school student each year, while an average of 15.1 kilograms of food waste was produced by an elementary school student. In order to prevent accumulation of food waste, some schools prepare meals with a minimum amount of ingredients or cook with ingredients that can be stored for a long period of time, leading to poor quality. According to a recent investigation by authorities, 16 schools in North Gyeongsang Province were caught using ingredients that had expired. In order to calm public distrust toward school meals and criticisms from parents, the Education Ministry said Thursday that it would implement active monitoring and conduct evaluations on food service at schools by checking a photo uploaded by the school kitchen every day of the meal distributed on the food tray. The ministry explained that it was to offer a transparent food service system that was open and accessible to all students, parents and authorities.Those who do not upload a photo will be given a penalty point during the food service evaluation that is conducted twice a year by the local government. However, industry workers point to what they see as a more fundamental cause -- the need for better working conditions for cooking staff. They added that cooking staff, mostly temporary workers, are faced with discriminatory treatment at the workplace compared to nutritionists.“There is a big gap in treatment between nutritionists and cooking staff at school kitchens. A lot of the cooks are very often neglected and treated unfairly,” said Kim Jin-sook, head of the nutritionist association, citing a lack of communication between them as another big issue. “A reduced workload and an improved labor environment for the cooking staff would naturally lead to better quality of school meals,” said an official from the labor union for temporary workers at schools.According to the current Enforcement Decree of the School Meal Act, the related regulation only addresses the duty and role of a nutrition teacher, someone who, as a licensed teacher, should be able to “guide and supervise the kitchen staff.”By Kim Da-sol","after huge food poisoning scandal ,huge food poisoning scandal broke ,lunch for elementary school students ,huge food poisoning scandal ,social media chicken skewer cube","['Bongsan Elementary School', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'YonhapThe Daejeon Metropolitan Office of Education', 'Bongsan Elementary School', 'South Korea ’s', 'the Education Ministry', 'Incheon', 'Jeong Su - bin', 'Suwon', 'the Korea Herald', 'Jeong', 'Jeong', 'Jeong', 'Bongsan Elementary School', 'Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education', 'Seoul', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'the Education Ministry', 'Kim Jin - sook', 'Kim Da - sol']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38975903  0.40153086

This is the first time a heatstroke death has been reported in South Korea this year.Korea has endured unusually warm weather this year since spring. The average temperature in May was 18.6 degrees Celsius this year, making it the warmest May dating back to 1973. The highest temperature during the month was 32.4 degrees on May 19 in Ichon, Gyeonggi Province.Last year, the first heatstroke death was reported on July 28, much later than this year’s case that occurred on June 25.“We recommend all citizens be careful of the heat, especially children, the elderly, those who work outdoors and those with chronic health conditions,” said the Health Ministry in a statement issued Wednesday. The Korea Centers for Disease Prevention and Control have been monitoring Koreans who seek medical help for heat-related illnesses since May 23. From May 23 to June 25, 122 Koreans were treated for such ailments, including heatstroke. Last year, fewer patients – 101 -- visited health clinics for heat-related conditions in the same time period.Among the 122 patients reported this year, 71 percent of them were male. Also, 30.7 percent of all patients were aged 65 or older. The largest number of them, 61 individuals, were brought to medical professionals because of heat exhaustion, followed by those who had hyperthermia  and heat cramps . Almost 87 percent of them developed heat-related ailments after spending time outdoors, such as farms and mountains.In order to prevent heatstroke, the Health Ministry recommends wearing lightweight, light-colored clothing, using sunscreen and drinking extra fluids. It’s generally recommended to drink at least eight glasses of water daily during summer. Last year, 1,056 Koreans sought medical help for heat-related conditions. Among them, 11 died.

Extra meetings are scheduled to be held for three consecutive days from July 4, with both sides set to present revised proposals. Minimum Wage Council chairman Park Joon-sung leaves the meeting after failing to meet the legal deadline, in Sejong City on Wednesday. YonhapLabor representatives demand next year’s hourly minimum wage be raised to 10,000 won  from this year’s 6,030 won. They argue the hike would curb the nation’s income inequality, improve living standards of low-income workers and boost the economy by spurring consumer spending. Business leaders campaign for a freeze, saying that the minimum wage has risen too rapidly and needs to be stabilized. They also claim that soaring labor costs will take a toll on small and medium-sized enterprises and result in job losses for low-skilled workers. Through seven rounds of plenary sessions, the Minimum Wage Council decided to stipulate hourly wages as well as monthly wages in employment contracts, an attempt to better protect workers’ rights to be entitled to one paid holiday for five working days. Since the government adopted the minimum wage in 1988, the 27-member Minimum Wage Council, consisting of nine members each from labor, management and the public sector, has set the minimum wage through discussion. The government will declare the agreed rate for next year’s minimum wage on August 5.

Jeff Sessions , who oversees Trump's foreign policy, has also been strongly critical of the trade deal, claiming that it ended up increasing U.S. trade deficits while bringing little benefits.Korean officials say that even though the U.S. has a deficit in goods trade, the country has about $10 billion worth of surplus in services trade, and Korea has made more investments in the U.S. than the U.S. did in Korea.The pact, which went into effect in 2012, has been viewed as an economic alliance between the two countries.","republican presidential candidate donald trump ,accusing his democratic rival hillary ,candidate donald trump strongly criticized ,000 american jobs republican presidential ,presidential candidate donald trump strongly","['U.S.', 'republican', 'Donald Trump', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'american', 'Pennsylvania', 'democratic', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Hillary Clinton', 'South Korea', 'trump', 'the Economic Policy Institute', 'South Korea', 'american', 'republican', 'Donald Trump', 'Clinton', 'american', 'NAFTA', 'China', 'South Korea', 'Trans Pacific Partnership', 'the North American Free Trade', 'NAFTA', 'Korea', 'Walid Phares', 'Trump', 'Yonhap New Agency', 'Trump', 'Jeff Sessions', 'Trump', 'U.S.', 'korean', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Korea']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.58153474  0.13920723

371,371,[EYE] ‘It comes down to IT going green’,"Gary Cook, a senior IT analyst at Greenpeace, said that he has noticed a particular trend among the younger generation in the United States -- they delay getting their driver’s license after they turn 20.“It’s interesting. America, very much defined by car culture, is seeing lowering importance of getting a car. An interesting shift over the last five years,” Cook said in an interview with The Korea Herald.He exp...","Gary Cook, a senior IT analyst at Greenpeace, said that he has noticed a particular trend among the younger generation in the United States -- they delay getting their driver’s license after they turn 20.“It’s interesting. America, very much defined by car culture, is seeing lowering importance of getting a car. An interesting shift over the last five years,” Cook said in an interview with The Korea Herald.He explained that many drivers in the U.S. are choosing electric vehicles as the first option, wanting to move away from gasoline and fossil fuels, as they recognize the impact when they switch the transportation mode.Amid the fast-changing consumer attitude for greener options, big names such as Facebook and Google are also contributing to the environment-friendly movement.  Gary Cook, a senior IT analyst at Greenpeace, poses during the interview with The Korea Herald. Greenpeace has initiated the “Cool IT Campaign,” urging IT companies to adopt renewable energy and power technological solutions in order to fight climate change. At least 16 companies including Facebook, Google Softbank, Apple and eBay have been participating in this campaign since 2011.According to a Greenpeace report, when IT companies mitigate their own carbon footprints, they can deliver approximately 7.8 gigatons of equivalent carbon dioxide emissions savings by 2020. By improving energy efficiency in power transmission and distribution in buildings and factories as well as in the use of transportation to deliver goods, these companies can also deliver carbon savings five times larger than the total emissions from the entire IT sector by 2020.What the campaign asks for is simple. It recommends companies to break the cycle in which “computing is in the cloud, the cloud is driven by data centers and these data centers are overwhelmingly powered by dirty coal-fired plants.”“We asked these companies, look, you’re incredibly innovative company, changing the world, but your current growth with your data center investments are in fact increasing demand for coal,” he said.Last year, Naver also joined the move as the first Asian company to do so. “Naver is the first Asian company to commit to be 100 percent powered by renewable energy among IT companies. But we still need policies to open the market first and you also need policies to help the drive of the use of renewable energy at scale,” added Cook.Greenpeace data in 2013 showed that an average datac enter in Korea consumes at least 2.6 billion kilowatt-hour per year. This figure is a fivefold rise from 2006, since at least 50 million users are enjoying the perks of speedy Internet in the wired country. Korea is the second largest country in the world to produce the largest traffic, followed by the United States, as of 2013.Cloud computing, for all its virtual advantages, relies on brick-and-mortar data storage infrastructure. Thanks to this, individuals can store unlimited media instead of filling up hard drives, but electricity consumption required to power the cloud is soaring. And the overwhelming source is coal.According to Jude Lee, a senior climate and energy campaigner at Greenpeace Korea, that is why the way these companies provide services is becoming significant.“If they are providing services by killing our earth that we are standing on, they are going the opposite of their industry philosophy. So, that’s why most of the IT sectors agree with using renewable energy,” said Lee. Gary Cook, a senior IT analyst at Greenpeace and Jude Lee, a senior climate and energy campaigner at Greenpeace Korea, talk during an interview with The Korea Herald. As the campaign is quickly gathering momentum, Greenpeace is actually seeing a race within the IT sector.“That race is starting to spread to other sectors, where renewable energy is becoming a critical part of not only for brand identity, but also the smart business,” Cook said. But Cook stressed that the current government lacks a holistic view in viewing the whole energy system in Korea.“You are beginning to see some movement, but the policies are far behind,” said Cook.“Policies in the U.S. have been really pushing toward the targets, maybe utilities have initially resisted that move, but now they actually showed they can meet the goal so the municipalities are gradually raising the target,” he added. In the U.S., California is already roughly 20 percent powered by renewable energy. The state is aiming to become 50 percent powered by renewable energy by 2030.“Policies matter a lot. Both Korea and U.S. have IT sectors and we see that they are driving the movement and now, how they define innovation is being increasingly defined by how much green energy they use,“Ultimately it needs leadership in the beginning, to get moving,” added Cook. Amid mounting worries over fine dust here, Cook said that one of the biggest contributing factors comes from coal-fired power plants.In South Korea, there 53 coal power plants predominantly located in the Chungcheong-do area. In order to meet expanding demand for electricity, the South Korean government recently proposed to build at least 20 more coal-fired power plants by 2030.“From an environmental perception, we cannot afford more coal fired power consumptions. In U.S., we are actually shutting down coal plants,” said Cook.According to an article on Guardian published earlier this year, America’s use of coal for electricity dropped to its lowest point on historical record in 2015 – it accounted for just 34 percent of U.S. electricity generation last year, the Sustainable Energy in America data was quoted as saying. In 2014, coal made up 39 percent of electricity supply.Coal has been long defined as the dirtiest of fossil fuels and America’s biggest single source of climate pollution. “Coal is no longer a part of the question. No one is proposing new coal plants in the U.S. It is question of which ones are going to be shut down in what order,” added him.He added that not only big companies but also individuals can contribute to make the world greener. “Solar has been a huge growth in many parts of the U.S., as consumers can install solar panels with the least payment as companies will come and change them regularly according to regulation,” he said.“It is a win-win strategy, which is better for the environment and better for the pocketbook,” he said.In the same vein, Lee also underlined the importance of the power that consumers have.“Consumers have a lot of power. They can send strong messages and signals to companies which operate in unsustainable ways,” she said.“We -- as informed digital citizens -- have the power to demand IT move away from dirty energy, embracing renewables instead,” she added.By Kim Da-sol","delay getting their driver license ,car culture is seeing lowering ,south korean government recently proposed ,companies including facebook google softbank ,companies to break the cycle","['Gary Cook', 'Greenpeace', 'the United States', 'America', 'Cook', 'the Korea Herald', 'U.S.', 'Gary Cook', 'Greenpeace', 'the Korea Herald', 'Greenpeace', 'Facebook , Google Softbank', 'Apple', 'eBay', 'Greenpeace', 'Naver', 'asian', 'asian', 'Cook', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'the United States', 'Jude Lee', 'Greenpeace Korea', 'Lee', 'Gary Cook', 'Greenpeace', 'Jude Lee', 'Greenpeace Korea', 'the Korea Herald', 'Greenpeace', 'Cook', 'Cook', 'Korea', 'Cook', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'California', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'Cook', 'Cook', 'South Korea', 'south korean', 'U.S.', 'Cook', 'Guardian', 'America', 'U.S.', 'the Sustainable Energy in America', 'America', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Lee', 'Kim Da - sol']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.5267337   0.34322241

Kweon Seong-dong offered on Thursday to resign, succumbing to pressure from the leadership during a factional feud over the party’s latest decision to readmit controversial defectors.Kweon, who is considered part of the faction that rivals those loyal to President Park Geun-hye, had initially refused to step down despite mounting pressure led by the party’s emergency chief Kim Hee-ok. Kim and the pro-Park faction had called on Kweon to resign to take responsibility over last week’s decision to bring back all seven defectors through a vote. The pro-Parks had claimed the vote was premature and not conducted with sufficient consensus among the other party members.The decision to reaccept the defectors, however, remained intact and the party’s seats in the National Assembly have since grown to 129.Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk talks with resigning Secretary-General Rep. Kweon Seong-dong , while emergency committee chairman Kim Hee-ok sits next to them, at the party’s meeting on Thursday. “I have expressed my intention to keep my position as I have been  demanded to take responsibility over the matter. But as the chairman  expressed regret and promised to lead the party well, I will be accepting his request for me to step down,” Kweon said during a morning party meeting. Kweon was named to the post on June 2. Kweon also took time to lament the latest flare-up, saying, “While the emergency committee decided to accept the independents in its pursuit of reform -- and the decision was praised by many -- the controversy over the calls for my resignation has tarnished such efforts.”In response, Kim expressed regret and said that he had brought up the need to replace the secretary-general over differing views on how to conduct party affairs, marking a subtle change of his earlier position of holding Kweon directly responsible for the vote.“I will take necessary follow-up measures to correct the party’s discipline and achieve integration, and plan to name the next secretary-general who is neutral, capable and competent.”Kim had boycotted party affairs upon the committee’s June 16 unsigned vote, in which the majority agreed to bring back the defectors. He returned to the party three days later after party floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk visited him near his residence and offered an apology. Kim, a former justice, had taken issue with the party’s “lack of discipline” saying that his authority had been undermined when the committee pushed ahead with the vote despite his opposition. Kweon later told the press that he decided to resign as he deemed his honor has been somewhat restored, with Kim showing regret over the matter, and because he thought further pursuing the matter would not help the party and would aggravate public fatigue over politics.He also accused some of the pro-Park members of framing him as the force behind the decision to bring back the defectors, saying that such action ran counter to the party’s recent declaration to be rid of factional politics.The Saenuri Party has been reeling from the April 13 election defeat that stripped it of its majority and No. 1 parliamentary bloc status. While most of the defectors -- who won in their constituencies as independents after having been dropped from the Saenuri’s nomination -- have repeatedly expressed their desire to return to the party, the staunch pro-Park members had objected, citing conflicting political dispositions and values. Among the returning defectors, the key person that the pro-Parks had rejected was former floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min, who had been singled out by President Park Geun-hye as a traitor upon their disagreement over a parliamentary revision bill last year.“The way  are moving around in groups just because of their personal association rather than based on their political conviction or philosophy neither helps the party nor is received well by the public,” Kweon said.The third-term lawmaker also said that his plan to publish a white paper that goes over the responsibilities and reasons for the election defeat should continue regardless of his resignation. “An attempt to suspend it will be the same as digging our party’s own grave,” he said.","thursday to resign succumbing to ,thursday to resign succumbing ,on thursday to resign succumbing ,feud over the party latest ,suk talks with resigning secretary","['Saenuri Party ’s', 'Kweon Seong - dong', 'Kweon', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Kim Hee - ok', 'Kim', 'Kweon', 'Parks', 'the National Assembly', 'Party', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'Kweon Seong - dong', 'Kim Hee - ok', 'Kweon', 'Kweon', 'Kweon', 'Kim', 'Kweon', '”Kim', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'Kim', 'Kweon', 'Kim', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Park Geun', 'Kweon']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56275648  0.22925702

373,373,[NEWS FOCUS] Sejong resurfaces as hot politcal issue,"Following the thwarted airport plan that left the southeast region in feuds, political parties promptly shifted their focus to the central administrative city of Sejong, seeking momentum there and in its surrounding Cheungcheong provinces.But their ambitious scenario, involving a partial relocation of the legislative branch and possibly moving the presidential office, rekindled concerns that these rosy promises may o...","Following the thwarted airport plan that left the southeast region in feuds, political parties promptly shifted their focus to the central administrative city of Sejong, seeking momentum there and in its surrounding Cheungcheong provinces.But their ambitious scenario, involving a partial relocation of the legislative branch and possibly moving the presidential office, rekindled concerns that these rosy promises may once again dwindle away to become mere stunt pledges ahead of key elections.“If we revise the Constitutional Law, it will be possible to relocate not only the National Assembly but also Cheong Wa Dae to Sejong City,” said Sejong Mayor Lee Choon-hee on Thursday.“Sejong City was initially designed not just as an administrative city but as the nation’s administrative capital and we plan to achieve that long-term goal one day.”View of Sejong City The opposition-affiliated mayor thereby buttressed recently growing calls from Sejong-based lawmakers -- especially his fellow members of The Minjoo Party of Korea -- to build a regional parliamentary branch there.Steering the move is seventh-termer and former Prime Minister Rep. Lee Hae-chan who defected from the party in the run-up to the April 13 general election and won his legislative seat for Sejong City as an independent candidate.The senior lawmaker on Monday motioned a revision bill of the National Assembly Act, including the establishment of a legislative branch in the administrative city. The bill was backed by 38 parliamentary members, mostly those based in nearby Daejeon or the surrounding Chungcheong provinces.The establishment of the regional branch, involving the relocation of some 10 parliamentary committees and 100 representative offices, will cost about 107 billion won , according to the National Assembly Budget Office.After meeting with parliamentary Speaker Chung Sye-kyun, who has temporarily exited the Minjoo Party due to his post, Rep. Lee claimed that Chung had “promised to look into the matter on a parliamentary level,” raising hopes for the plan.The reason that the political circles have advocated a “partial” relocation of the Assembly traces back to the Constitutional Court ruling back in 2004 which, citing basic law, said that the nation’s core symbolic functions should remain in the capital city.Nam Kyung-pil and An Hee-jung, governors of Gyeonggi Province and South Chungcheong Province respectively, took the agenda a step further by claiming that the relocation plan to Sejong should include Cheong Wa Dae as well.“The Republic of Korea is suffering from the side effects of having all of its political and economic powers concentrated ,” said Nam, calling for constitutional revision.An also pledged in a press briefing on Wednesday to “join efforts with Gov. Nam” in nurturing Sejong City into an administrative capital city and to achieve balanced regional growth.But their blueprint also resembled preceding election pledges involving large-scale infrastructure made by former and incumbent conservative presidents Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye, who both had pledged to build an international airport in the southeastern part of the country. The multi-trillion won state project had helped gather a considerable number of votes from expectant local voters, but years of talks have gone down the drain, as the government has crossed out both of the rival candidate cities.The idea of creating Sejong City was initiated under late President Roh Moo-hyun back in 2002 as part of efforts to relieve the overcrowding metropolitan cluster.The plan, however, was often used as a political strategy to appeal to Chungcheong voters, who have often acted as the largest swing voter pool in national elections.The recent rise of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as the next presidential hopeful has also brought the Cheungcheong region to public attention. The former diplomat, who hinted at his bid in the 2017 presidential election, was born in Eumseong, North Chungcheong Province.By Bae Hyun-jung","following the thwarted airport plan ,possibly moving the presidential office ,lawmaker on monday motioned revision ,feuds political parties promptly shifted ,temporarily exited the minjoo party","['Sejong', 'Cheungcheong', 'the National Assembly', 'Sejong City', 'Sejong Mayor', 'Lee Choon - hee', '“sejong City', 'Sejong City', 'Sejong', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Lee Hae - chan', 'Sejong City', 'the National Assembly Act', 'Daejeon', 'the National Assembly Budget Office', 'Chung Sye - kyun', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Lee', 'Chung', 'Assembly', 'Constitutional Court', 'Nam Kyung - pil', 'an Hee - jung', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'South Chungcheong Province', '“the Republic of Korea', 'Nam', 'Nam', 'Sejong City', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Sejong City', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Eumseong', 'North Chungcheong Province', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49814013  0.51313853

Since 2012, all students attending school have been prohibited from bringing cellphones to class, except on specific circumstances such as school trips and outdoor field work. The ban was introduced in 2012 to prevent possible traffic accidents caused by cellphone use, as well as to encourage all students to focus on their studies without being disturbed by their smart devices. Still, Kim claimed the ban was unfair, as most students did not agree with it, adding that he has been unable to efficiently contact his parents after school, even in emergency situations. Kim’s school is one of the three educational institutions the NHRCK officially advised on Wednesday to ease their ban on cellphone use among students. The human rights watchdog said such practices that prohibit cellphone use violate Article 18 of the Constitution, which stipulates that the “privacy of correspondence of no citizen shall be infringed,” as well as the students’ unalienable rights to pursue happiness. The watchdog stressed that in the case of Kim’s school, the majority of its students and their parents did not agree with the ban. According to a survey organized by school authorities about a month after the ban was introduced, 73 percent of students said the ban should be lifted, while 54.9 percent of parents thought the same. Still, the school did not revise its regulations against cellphones.“There are other ways to prevent car accidents caused by cellphone use, such as safety education,” the agency said in a statement. “And it’s unfortunate that the practice was implemented without the majority of the students’ agreement. Such practice seems to violate the students’ rights to pursue happiness, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, by limiting their opportunities to communicate freely with their family and friends on top of infringing their rights to independence and freedom.”South Korea is one of the most wired countries it the world, with more than 80 percent of the entire population owning smartphones as of last year. A recent study by the nation’s Gender Ministry showed that nearly 14 percent of Korean students are addicted to either a smartphone or the Internet. Some of the government’s measures against smartphone addiction among teenagers include a rehab camp for young Internet or smartphone addicts, as well as therapy sessions with school counselors. Some schools, like Kim’s, ban smartphone use altogether in classrooms.“We acknowledge that many worry about smartphone addiction among teenagers, but at the same time, cellphones can be seen as an  medium that connects young people with one another, which prevents them from social isolation,” the NKRCK said in a statement.Aside from Kim, students from two other high schools also filed complaints to the human rights agency last year, claiming their schools’ ban on cellphone use is unfair. Both of the institutions are boarding schools that only allow students to use their cell phones on weekends. In one of the schools, 460 students currently have to share only four public phones, should they need to speak to someone outside the school on weekdays, and only with their teachers’ approval, the human rights agency said. The school’s authorities explained that allowing cell phone use may negatively affect student’s dorm life, on top of their academic performance. “Most students share their rooms with three other students, and when one of them plays with his or her phone at night when the light is turned off, it can decrease their roommates’ quality of sleep.” The authorities also claimed that students have “no time to spend with their cell phones,” due to their tight schedule. According to the report by the NKRCK, the students wake up at 6:30 a.m. every day, have breakfast at 7:30 and have classes from 8:30 a.m. until 9:30 p.m., before going to bed at 11 a.m. At the other school, students wake up at 6 a.m. and have classes from 7:30 a.m. until 8:50 p.m. They are required to study on their own from 9:30 p.m. until 1 a.m. before they go to sleep. The students only sleep five hours daily. Human rights violations in South Korea’s education system have been frequently reported, such as bans on dating, wearing earrings and dying or perming hair, according to the teenager rights organization Group for Youth Sexuality Rights. The NKRCK advised both of the schools to ease their bans on cell phones. “Students attending boarding schools inevitably live away from their family members, and it’s only natural for them to want to stay connected,” the agency said in a statement. “We conclude that it’s almost impossible for 460 students to freely communicate with their loved ones if they only have four public phones to share between everyone. Their privacy may also be violated as they are required to get their teachers’ approval should they want to use the public phones. We think this infringes on their right to pursue happiness.”By Claire Lee  Kim Ji-hoon is not his real name.

Had the North wanted to fly the missile longer, it could have used the Dongchang-ri or Sohae launching site in the country's west, instead of firing the missile from the east coast.The western site ""has a clear range as far south as the Philippines and has been used for their Unha space launches,"" he said, referring to a series of long-range rocket launches that the North has carried out, including one conducted in February.""More importantly, the second test launch was conducted only hours after the first one reportedly broke up in flight. That's not nearly long enough to figure out what went wrong, much less fix it.Even the month or so since the last test isn't really long enough for that,"" Schilling said. ""So these can't be real tests in the engineering sense, where one is trying to find and fix problems so as to build a reliable system,"" he said. ""This only makes sense as a desperate attempt to achieve, by luck if nothing else, something close enough to a success to be used for some propaganda purpose even as they have no way of knowing why one missile managed to fly as far as it did, while all the others failed completely."" The North will hold a meeting of its rubber-stamp parliament, the Supreme People's Assembly, one week from now, and Wednesday's launches could be lauded as a key achievement of leader Kim Jong-un following the North's fourth nuclear test in January and February's long-range rocket launch.The North first test-launched the Musudan missile on April 15.All but the last and sixth launch failed, with the missile exploding in midair or on a mobile launcher, or crashing seconds after launch.The U.S. condemned the latest launches and said it will raise the issue at the U.N.

Emergency committee chairman Kim Hee-ok, however, did not immediately say he would return to work after his meeting with whip Rep. Chung Jin-suk. This came three days after Kim boycotted party affairs over Chung pushing through a controversial vote on Thursday to accept any or all seven party defectors elected as independents.The public falling-out between the two had rekindled factional discord between those rallying around President Park Geun-hye and the non-Parks.Saenuri Party’s floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk  bows to emergency committee chairman Kim Hee-ok during their meeting at a cafe in Nonhyeon-dong, Seoul, Sunday. Yonhap“I will accept  apology as it seems sincere,” Kim told the press after his meeting at a coffee shop near his residence in southern Seoul. Their meeting, captured on camera from outside of the glass-door cafe, lasted less than half an hour. Chung was seen bowing to Kim in a show of apology. The press were notified of the time and location of their rendezvous an hour before.“But I need to think more about other parts. I will let you know through the party spokesperson,” Kim said, referring to whether he would return to his post.Kim had reportedly been outraged over Chung’s remarks when he attempted to delay the vote by the emergency committee members. Chung had said it would be “equivalent to a grave violation of the law if the vote were delayed.”Kim, a former Constitutional Court judge, had reportedly been trying to put off the vote that would bring back some of the controversial members. Among them is Rep. Yoo Seong-min, who had a public falling-out with the president last summer over Assembly rules that Park eventually vetoed. Kim was named to head the emergency committee comprised of five Saenuri members and five external figures earlier this month, after a 50-day leadership vacuum that followed the party’s April 13 election defeat. Kim had previously been Government Public Ethics Committee chairman, a post appointed by the president.The ballot count of Thursday’s vote by Kim and the 10 members, was stopped midway after the majority of votes – six -- were cast in approval of the defectors’ return. With the Saenuri Party’s defeat to the Minjoo Party -- 122 seats in the Assembly to 123 seats -- the return of the defectors was widely considered inevitable. Upon the decision by the emergency committee, currently acting as the Supreme Council, Yoo, along with four others immediately submitted their applications to return. With this move, the Saenuri Party has regained the No. 1 status in the Assembly with 126 seats. “ that he was at a loss as to what he could do when there is no discipline at the party,” said Saenuri’s spokesman Rep. Ji Sang-wuk after the Kim-Chung meeting. Ji added that Kim was also contemplating whether his staying in the post would further cause the party to remain in disarray.During the meeting, Chung told Kim, “I sincerely apologize for having used excessively rough and unnecessary remarks in the process of solving the matter of defectors.” He also pleaded with Kim to return so that they would be able to “smoothly hold” the party’s national caucus to pick new leadership on Aug. 9.Kim had reportedly lambasted Chung for degrading his role and said, “This is not a democracy. It was not out of party loyalty or comradeship. There is no trust, ethics of discipline.”Yoo’s defection right before the election, after being dropped from the party’s nomination, displayed what the opposition described as the pro-Park members’ deep-running loyalty to the president with intolerance toward lawmakers who openly disagree with her policies.","days after kim boycotted party ,through controversial vote on thursday ,president with intolerance toward lawmakers ,sunday as the disgruntled emergency ,party april 13 election defeat","['Saenuri Party', 'Kim Hee - ok', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'Kim', 'Chung', 'Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party ’s', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'Kim Hee - ok', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'Seoul', 'Chung', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Chung', 'Chung', 'Constitutional Court', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Assembly', 'Park', 'Kim', 'Saenuri', 'Kim', 'Government Public Ethics Committee', 'Kim', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Assembly', 'the Supreme Council', 'Yoo', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Assembly', 'Saenuri ’s', 'Ji Sang - wuk', 'Kim - Chung', 'Ji', 'Kim', 'Chung', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Chung']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49292523  0.32344463

Any number of things would make a Trump presidency interesting, to say the least, but one of them is to see what he would really do in regard to Korea policy,"" Cumings said.Trump first expressed his willingness to hold direct talks with the North's Kim in a media interview last month, drawing criticism not only from critics but also from his own party that such a meeting would end up bolstering the dictator.Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump says he would meet the North Korean leader and that “We should be eating a hamburger on a conference table and making better deals.” But while Trump has insisted on his willingness to speak to Kim, he has also said he won't go to the North. Earlier this week, Trump said he would ""accept"" a visit to the U.S. by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and hold nuclear negotiations with him while eating hamburgers, instead of a state dinner.During a campaign rally in Atlanta, Trump also said he will only ""make a good deal"" if he were to hold talks with the North's leader. He also said that there's a ""10 percent or 20 percent chance"" he could talk Kim out of developing nuclear weapons.Cumings likened Trump to a ""loose cannon"" and an ""unguided missile,"" saying it is inherently difficult to explain what Trump's foreign policy platform would look like and what he would do with regard to Korea. Still, however, the professor appeared to give points to his willingness to talk.""American leaders seem to think that it's a big gift if they deign to talk to enemy heads of state. But diplomacy emerged in history as a way of getting enemies to talk to, rather than fight with, each other,"" Cumings said.""What exactly has Washington gotten from its policy of isolating North Korea for 70 years and pretending that it doesn't exist? Nothing but conflict, pain and suffering. Give North Korea a couple more years, and it will have been around longer than the entire Soviet Union,"" he said.The six-party talks aimed at resolving the North Korean standoff have been stalled since late 2008. The U.S. has insisted that the North must take concrete steps demonstrating its commitment to rolling back the nuclear program before the negotiations reopen.While the talks idled, the North, which conducted its first nuclear test in 2006, conducted three more nuclear tests: one in 2009, another in 2013 and the latest in January this year. Analysts have warned that it is only a matter of time before the North develops nuclear-tipped missiles capable of striking the U.S.","republican presidential candidate donald trump ,republican presidential nominee donald trump ,presidential candidate donald trump ,atomic scientists noting that trump ,korea policy cumings said trump","['republican', 'Donald Trump', 'U.S.', 'North Korea', 'american', 'Bruce Cumings', 'University of Chicago', 'Korea', 'Trump', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Hillary Clinton', 'North Korea', 'Trump', 'Korea', 'Kim', 'republican', 'Donald Trump', 'korean', 'Trump', 'Kim', 'Trump', 'U.S.', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Atlanta', 'Trump', 'Kim', 'Trump', 'Korea', 'Washington', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'Soviet Union', 'north korean', 'U.S.', 'U.S.']",12,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.58672768  0.6453113

Yoo Seong-min, Daegu’s fourth-termer and the party’s former floor leader, known for his deep rift with President Park Geun-hye. Whether or not he would make it back to the party has been considered a yardstick of Saenuri’s willingness to overcome the chronic strife between the pro-Park and the non-Park factions. Kim Hee-ok, chairman of the party’s emergency committee, disappeared from public view on Friday, boycotting not only party affairs but also a scheduled tripartite meeting with Cheong Wa Dae and the Cabinet.Kim, who has been steering the distressed ruling party for less than a month, is said to be pondering his resignation.His actions come after the interim leadership’s decision to accept seven independent lawmakers who had defected amid nomination feuds for the April 13 general election.Of these lawmakers, four including Yoo immediately retrieved their party membership, while the remaining three have yet to submit their applications to the central headquarters.If all seven return, the ruling party would recover its status as the largest party in the 300-seat National Assembly, with its number of lawmakers rising from 122 to 129. Pro-Park Saenuri Party members discuss countermeasures against the return of Rep. Yoo Seong-min to the party. “The decision was made to respond to the public sentiment as shown in the April 13 election, asking for unity and harmony,” said spokesperson Rep. Ji Sang-wuk after the reinstatement vote.Party mainstreamers, however, lashed back against the earlier-than-expected return of the defectors.“I was taken aback by the rash decision,” said pro-Park Rep. Hong Moon-jong in a radio interview Friday.“I expect floor leader Chung  to feel responsible for the consequences.”Rep. Kim Tae-heum, another pro-Park member, described the emergency committee’s decision as a “coup” led by the reformist floor leader and advocated by nonparty members of the committee.But such protests from the pro-Park clique further deepened infighting with the reformists, who claimed that the pro-Park lawmakers are still caught up in power games.“The result  was based on a democratic agreement,” said committee member and former party chief spokesperson Rep. Kim Young-woo.Cheong Wa Dae refrained from commenting on the reinstatement.“We do not comment on issues which happened within the  party,” said presidential spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk, in response to reporters’ questions.As for the cancellation of the tripartite meeting, he cited “circumstances of the party,” denying direct causality with the party leadership’s decision to embrace the defectors.The feud between the presidential office, as well as those close to the president, and Rep. Yoo traces back to last year, when then-floor leader Yoo advocated an opposition-backed revision bill of the National Assembly law. President Park Geun-hye, upon vetoing the bill later, laid the blame on Yoo for being “untrue.”After being excluded from nomination for the April race in his Daegu electorate, where he would have been guaranteed an easy win, Yoo defected from the party to run as an independent candidate.Not only did the senior lawmaker score victory, but his image as a political martyr and an uncompromising reformer placed him in the list of potential bidders for the 2017 presidential election.According to local pollster Realmeter on Friday, Yoo’s approval rating stood at 15.7 percent, running second among conservative potential candidates, behind U.N.

As the main theme music of the show plays in the background, Keum exchanges text messages with one of his campaigners who tells him that they have waited long enough for him to announce his election bid.Then, a man wearing a horse-head mask – a camouflage that is widely used for humorous effect and symbolizes anonymity -- appears next to Keum. In follow-up social media postings, the man who donned the mask turns out to be Keum’s actual son, who went on to play a major role in the social media campaign for the now-elected first-term lawmaker of The Minjoo Party of Korea. The college student son’s playful, first-persona campaign postings catered to young constituents and boosted Keum’s image as a young crusader amid outdated politics -- the key vision maintained by the former prosecutor and lawyer who has now become the representative of Gangseo-gu, Seoul, for the 20th National Assembly.“In order to attract young people into politics, we need to offer them roles that can make full use of their strengths,” said Keum in his office at the Assembly during an interview with The Korea Herald. “Most young people joining election campaigns and political groups have ended up doing miscellaneous tasks such as serving coffee and making photocopies. Since they come here not for any financial reason but out of sense of duty, we have to give them the work that can help fulfill their noble cause,” he said. Rep. Keum Tae-sup of The Minjoo Party of Korea. Park Hae-mook/The Korea HeraldOffering more opportunities for young people to engage with politics is an agenda that Keum has been tackling since he entered politics. His first taste of politics was in 2011 in helping Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon win his post.The freshman lawmaker suggested that Korea should encourage young people to think about politics as legitimate careers, comparing the nation to advanced democracies who have elected young leaders. U.S. President Barack Obama became president at age 47 and Canada’s Prime Minster Justin Trudeau took office at age 43. The average age of South Korean presidents upon election is 61 with the oldest having been former President Kim Dae-jung at age 74.At the center of such efforts should be the political parties’ “bottom-up approach” to educating and training young political minds, said Keum. He lamented the latest rise of nonpoliticians dominating the political scene, namely U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who has been dubbed as a likely presidential candidate for the ruling Saenuri Party next year.“It is a prime example of politics failing to work properly,” said Keum, who served as a vice chairman of his party’s recruiting committee for the 2016 election. “Those seeking to join politics develop their careers in other fields until they realize it is about time to enter politics,” he said, adding that politicians should not shy away from being perceived as experts in politics, which still has negative connotations in Korea as being greedy for power.“Our recruitment structure in politics mostly involves those in their 50s and 60s, and 40s at the earliest. They usually have developed careers in other fields,” said Keum, who also joined politics in his 40s after spending 12 years as state prosecutor from 1995 and 2007. He left his post in protest against the authorities’ decision to ban him from publishing an article in a local daily about how to be interviewed in criminal investigation. Having rose to prominence after appearing as a panelist on a popular television shows about current affairs, the prosecutor-turned-lawyer joined the election campaign for Seoul city mayor Park Won-soon in 2011 and entrepreneur-turned-politician Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo’s the next year. Ahn withdrew from the presidential race at the last minute.“I believe that liberal parties are more likely to bring change to society than conservative parties,” Keum said. “Now is the time to pursue a new type of social reform because South Korea has mostly finished the work of industrialization and democratization.” Rep. Keum Tae-sup of The Minjoo Party of Korea. Park Hae-mook/The Korea HeraldOne of the changes that Keum, who serves as a member of the Assembly’s Legislation and Judiciary committee, wants to bring to the new Assembly is the overhaul of investigative authorities including prosecutors and intelligence agencies who have often been criticized for abuse of power and often find themselves embroiled in political scandals.Specifically, the former lawyer said he wants to revise the Criminal Procedure Act, a law governing the rules for criminal cases such as the process for launching investigations, holding trials, rendering verdicts and filing for appeals, among other things.  Under the current legal system, Keum said, those accused of a crime are denied the right to counsel during the investigation by prosecutors. Defense lawyers are limited to monitoring whether a prosecutor uses verbal or physical violence during interrogations. “Among similar democratic countries, South Korea is the only nation who denies the right to counsel to those accused by prosecutors,” Keum said. “The prosecutors have too much power which needs to be stripped down.” Though his legislative agenda and career path mostly resonates with liberal values, Keum has built a reputation for being one of the most vocal critics of liberal-minded opposition parties that have failed to win the presidential election since 2002. In his best-selling book, titled “I Want to Have an Opposition Party that Can Win,” Keum chronicled his two years working as a key strategist for Ahn’s election campaign that ended in failure, so it was not a surprise when he joined The Minjoo Party of Korea instead of Ahn’s new People’s Party.Among the winning strategies proposed by Keum was fostering internal competition and constructive criticism among liberal lawmakers, some of whom had been criticized for looking out for one another when faced with bribery and criminal charges.  “We have come a long way ,” Keum said. “But politics is a public business that focuses more on your future performance than your past record. For instance, having worked as a democratic activist is one thing and being a good lawmaker is another.” By Yeo Jun-suk","lawyer joined the election campaign ,presidential race at the last ,plays frank underwood machiavellian politician ,entrepreneur turned politician rep ,most talked about campaign ads","['U.S.', 'Keum Tae - sup', 'Frank Underwood', 'machiavellian', 'Kevin Spacey', 'Keum', 'Keum', 'Keum ’s', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Keum ’s', 'Seoul', 'National Assembly', 'Keum', 'Assembly', 'the Korea Herald', 'Keum Tae - sup', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Park Hae - mook', 'the Korea HeraldOffering', 'Keum', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'Canada', 'Justin Trudeau', 'south korean', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'Keum', 'U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Saenuri Party', 'Keum', 'Korea', 'Keum', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Keum', 'South Korea', 'Keum Tae - sup', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Park Hae - mook', 'the Korea HeraldOne', 'Keum', 'the Assembly ’s Legislation and Judiciary committee', 'Assembly', 'Keum', 'South Korea', 'Keum', 'Keum', 'can win', 'Ahn ’s', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Ahn ’s', 'People ’s Party', 'Keum', 'Keum', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",15,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.65649706  0.04112544

The meeting with reporters comes as Hwang marks his first year in office on Saturday.Last week, President Park Geun-hye conducted a small-scale reshuffle of her senior secretaries and vice-ministerial officials amid calls for a personnel shift in the wake of the ruling Saenuri Party's defeat in April's parliamentary polls. Initially, political pundits earlier expected a Cabinet reshuffle.Looking back on the past year, Hwang said it was regrettable that the country was not able to make sufficient headway in the economic sector.Concerning the latest debate over construction of a new airport in the southeastern part of the country, Hwang said his office will ""stick to principle"" and continue to keep an eye on the progress.Daegu, Ulsan and the North Gyeongsang Province support Milyang as the candidate site for the new airport, while Busan, the country's largest sea port and No. 2 city, wants the airport to be built on Gadeok Island, not far from the existing Gimhae International Airport.The issue has become a major area of focus for local political and industrial groups.As for next year's presidential election, Hwang skirted the issue adding he is ""already busy enough .""Hwang also declined to provide details on his meeting with U.N.

She usually posts selfies, photos of food she ate and sometimes pictures of her dog. “I usually post something before I go to bed,” she said. “And it feels nice to wake up in the morning and find out how people responded. It’s like my morning ritual.”Kim said she is addicted to her smartphone “just as much as everyone else she knows.” She carries it with her everywhere, all the time, every day. She charges her phone by the bed every night. One of her biggest anxieties in fact has to do with the battery dying. “I get anxious whenever I forget my phone charger,” she said. “It feels like I’m missing out on life when my phone is dead. I have no problem admitting that a big portion of my life exists in the online world. And it’s not just me -- most people are connected in KakaoTalk group chat rooms as much as they are in offline gatherings.”123rfKim is one of many South Korean women who spend a significant amount of their time socializing via smartphone apps and social media. A recent study by Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital, in fact, found that Korean women are twice more likely to be addicted to smart devices as their male counterparts. For the study, psychiatrists at the hospital surveyed 2,281 women and 2,573 men. Among the female participants, 17.9 percent were addicted to their smartphones, while only 9.4 percent of the surveyed men experienced the same. “We assume one of the reasons behind the statistics is that women tend to form more social relationships online than men do,” said Kim Dae-jin, a psychiatrist who organized the study.The study also found that depression and high activity of the behavioral inhibition system is related to smartphone addiction among South Koreans. Koreans who were depressed or had high activity of the BIS -- meaning they tend to avoid human interactions and conflicts in order to prevent negative emotions such as fear, sadness and anxiety -- were more likely to be addicted to smartphones and have a limited social network offline.  A study last year by the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs found that Korean women, especially those who are financially and socially vulnerable, were much more prone to depression than their male counterparts. While 9.1 percent of all Korean women experience the mental condition at least once in their lives, only 4.3 percent of Korean men go through the same, according to the study. Notably, 31.7 percent of Korean women who never attended high school have been depressed in the past, the study showed. Reasons included poor work and life balance, postpartum stress and domestic abuse experienced during childhood.The study by Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital claimed that smartphone addiction is, in some ways, a form of escapism for those who are depressed. “When one is stressed and experiencing negative emotions, it’s natural for him or her to find a place where they can be free from their fear and anxieties,” the report said. “The online world gives people anonymity and therefore gives them a chance to be somebody else, and act differently. This can be addictive to those who are unhappy with themselves in the offline world, because you don’t get the kind of endorsements you get online in your real life.”In terms of those with high activity of the BIS, researchers said interacting online can be less stressful for those who are afraid of human conflicts or difficult relationships. “Those who are highly sensitive to negative emotions tend to prefer socializing online, because they want to avoid conflicts that can occur when interacting with others in person. And they feel they can protect themselves better online, as they can be anonymous.”Kim said she is just as social offline as she is online, but agreed that avoiding those she doesn’t want to associate with is much easier in the virtual world. “You can easily cut them off by blocking them or just erasing your account altogether,” she said. “I guess it’s both convenient and somewhat sad at the same time.”By Claire Lee","day by checking her instagram ,checking her instagram she usually ,her instagram she usually posts ,addicted to her smartphone just ,her instagram she usually","['Kim Ji - yeon', 'Seoulite', 'KakaoTalk', 'south korean', 'Seoul St. Mary ’s Hospital', 'korean', 'Kim Dae - jin', 'South Koreans', 'Koreans', 'BIS', 'the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs', 'korean', 'korean', 'korean', 'korean', 'Seoul St. Mary ’s Hospital', 'BIS', 'Claire Lee']",7,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.6506061   0.35882664

""Constitutional amendment is something that someone must tackle,"" Chung said during his speech marking the opening of the newly elected parliament.""This is not an issue that we can easily bring up, but it is not an issue either that we can continue to disregard,"" he added, underscoring that the goal of the constitutional revision should be national integration.His remarks coincided with a seminar on rewriting the basic law at the assembly where a series of heavyweight politicians such as former Saenuri Party leader Kim Moo-sung and five-term Saenuri Rep. Lee Ju-young participated. Calls have been lingering for revising the constitution, which was last amended in 1987 following a massive pro-democracy movement to end the decades of rule by military-backed authoritarian governments. The proponents of the revision have argued that the current constitution does not reflect the social and political changes that have taken place since the last revision nearly three decades ago. Some of them, in particular, have called for a shift in the current governance structure, where power is concentrated too much on the chief executive, and asserted the need to adopt a four-year, double-term presidency to have a more stable, farsighted policy implementation.During the seminar, Rep. Lee expressed hopes that a constitutional amendment can happen before next year's presidential election.""We have one and a half years before the presidential election,"" he said during his congratulatory remarks. ""I have this expectation that if we push for the revision during this period of time and call for a national referendum, we can achieve a history of constitutional revision.""The seminar was arranged by an association of some six non-governmental organizations including the Hansun Foundation led by former Finance Minister Bahk Jae-wan.The government has so far held a cautious stance over the constitutional revision as it could trigger yet another partisan wrangling, which could derail its efforts to maintain political stability and focus on enhancing people's livelihoods. But some of the ruling party members, including Gyeonggi Province Gov. Nam Kyung-pil, have raised the issue.","constitutional revision resurfaced on monday ,following massive pro democracy movement ,monday as national assembly speaker ,revitalizing the economy constitutional amendment ,following massive pro democracy","['National Assembly', 'Chung Sye - kyun', 'Chung', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'Saenuri', 'Lee Ju - young', 'Lee', 'the Hansun Foundation', 'Finance', 'Bahk Jae - wan', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Nam Kyung - pil']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56962061  0.01355137

The operation was previously postponed in May due to technical problems. The lifting of the bow section is considered the most challenging part of the operation. If the lifting proceeds smoothly, the ferry may be brought to the surface by late July, experts anticipate. It will then be transported to a port in Mokpo for inspection.Salvage operations by Shanghai Salvage Co. involving wire construction are underway near waters off Jindo Island in South Jeolla Province on Sunday. /Ministry of Oceans and FisheriesOnce the bow is lifted, work to place 18 lifting beams beneath the ferry will begin to lift the body of the ferry and pull it out from the water. Lifting a 6,825-ton wreck in such a method has never before been tried, authorities added. A naval architect involved in the operation had projected the success rate of the operation at 80 percent during a briefing in April. The Sewol ferry was carrying 476 people -- mostly students on a school trip -- when it sank off the southwestern island of Jindo in April 2014. Just 172 passengers were rescued. Nine remain missing.Bringing the ferry to land has been a key demand of the victims’ families.

It was the shortest period to form the Assembly since the lawmakers set a legal deadline in 1994. The rival parties last week had reached a consensus on how to distribute key parliamentary positions, considered key in creating favorable conditions to endorse their bills and initiatives at each committee. The Assembly members elected Chung Sye-kyun of the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea as the new speaker last week.As internal competition was high at the parties for the key committee chairpersons’ posts, the two largest parties had also allowed some of the positions to be rotated among their senior members by breaking the four-year positions up into several terms.New chairpersons belonging to the ruling Saenuri Party to head standing committees pose after their election during the party‘s general assembly on Monday. In the Saenuri Party, the head post for the House Steering Committee went to floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk. It is customary for the ruling party’s whip to take the post, which supervises Cheong Wa Dae and the presidential office.The Saenuri Party’s third-term lawmaker Rep. Kweon Seong-dong was elected as the chief of the Legislation and Judiciary Committee. The committee is often considered to be the “upper chamber” of the Assembly because it can block pending bills from being put to a vote in a plenary session. After a heavy in-party contest, the former prosecutor is only expected to serve for the first year of the four-year term. After that, Rep. Yeo Sang-kyoo will take over the post the following year and Rep. Hong Il-pyo will serve the remaining two years. The same rule was to be applied to the management of other top posts of key committees. The standing committees of national policy, strategy and finance and security and public administration will rotate among the Saenuri Party’s senior lawmakers. The Minjoo Party allowed third-term lawmaker Rep. Kim Hyun-mee to assume the top post of the Special Committee on Budget and Accounts. Kim became the first female lawmaker to preside over the committee, which had, until this parliament, customarily been chaired by a lawmaker from the ruling party. Since the committee has the authority to review and endorse the government’s budget, the opposition lawmaker is expected to set a more critical tone in the process. Kim had served as a speaker for liberal parties and worked as a top aide to former Minjoo Party leader Moon Jae-in. Rep. Hong Young-pyo of the Minjooo Party was elected chairman of environment and labor, which deals with contentious bills related to the government’s plan to overhaul the labor market. The committee is also to deal with the opposition parties’ push to impose penalty on the manufactures of toxic humidifier disinfectants. Rep. Lee Cheol-woo of the Saenuri Party was chosen to serve as the chief of the Intelligence Committee. The opposition parties have vowed to abolish the counterterrorism law, which cleared the previous Assembly amid a partisan standoff. By Yeo Jun-suk","legislative body after two weeks ,party general assembly on monday ,first female lawmaker to preside ,last week as internal competition ,after two weeks of wrangling","['National Assembly', 'Assembly', 'Assembly', 'Chung Sye - kyun', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Saenuri Party', 'the House Steering Committee', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'Cheong', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'Kweon Seong - dong', 'the Legislation and Judiciary Committee', 'Assembly', 'Yeo Sang - kyoo', 'Hong Il - pyo', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Kim Hyun - mee', 'the Special Committee on Budget and Accounts', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Minjoo Party', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Hong Young - pyo', 'the Minjooo Party', 'Lee Cheol - woo', 'the Saenuri Party', 'the Intelligence Committee', 'Assembly']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56666189  0.44683996

""Han's France visit comes at the invitation of the French side that wants to discuss 'practical' measures to expand bilateral cooperation in the defense sector, which was agreed during the South Korea-France summit meeting last November,"" it also said. The meeting also comes less than two weeks after the two ministers held talks on the sidelines of the regional Shangri-La Dialogue held in early June in Singapore.In the past talks, they agreed to step up joint efforts to ensure the full implementation of international sanctions on North Korea.Joint South Korea-France actions on international peacekeeping operations and cyberspace security will also be on the table, the ministry said.

Ahn Cheol-soo of the People’s Party already finds himself trapped between a nose-diving party approval rating and an illicit fund probe concerning some of his closest aides.Whether or not he succeeds in pulling the fledgling centrist opposition party out of the current trials will also act as a leadership barometer, judging his qualifications for the 2017 presidential election, in which he is expected to make a bid. “Regardless of what happened, I am sorry to cause anxiety to the people,” Ahn said Friday over the ongoing allegations that one of the party’s proportional representatives took illicit funds during the April 13 general election campaigns.This was a compromising turn from his stout response the previous day, in which he said that “the given allegations are not true.”The National Election Commission on Thursday had reported Rep. Kim Su-min to the prosecution, charging her with taking up to hundreds of millions of won in political funds earlier this year.According to the election watchdog, two local advertisement companies in charge of the party‘s campaign promotion transferred 238.2 million won  to an account owned by a hotel that Kim used to run, but the detailed use of the money remained unclear.The lawmaker denied the given charges, but has so far refrained from explaining any further.Amid growing public reproach, Ahn quickly promised to establish an internal investigation team to look into the claims, in a preemptive attempt to eradicate the controversy once and for all.“We will look into every detail, including on Kim’s proportional representative nomination, and disclose everything to the people,” he told reporters Saturday.The greatest dilemma for the runner-up opposition party, which has been built on the promise of “new politics,” is that one of its core founding members is involved in the dishonorable charge.One of the allegations is that the political novice Kim, who also happens to be the youngest member of the new legislature, had acted under the direction of party leadership, especially then-secretary general Rep. Park Sun-sook, and thus won herself the nomination for the proportional representation.The fact that Kim had not even asked for the position further boosted suspicion that party leadership -- possibly Rep. Ahn himself -- may have been involved. The beleaguered party chief turned out to have interviewed Kim in a closed-door session, shortly before the party kicked off its proportional representative nomination committee.The illicit fund probe came at a time when the No. 3 party‘s approval rating was faltering upon the swift rise of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as a potential presidential candidate speaking for the ruling conservative Saenuri Party.According to a survey conducted by local pollster Gallup Korea on June 7-9 of 1,002 voters here, the support rate for Ahn stood at 10 percent. He thus fell to No. 3 behind Ban, who accounted for 26 percent, and The Minjoo Party of Korea’s former chief Moon Jae-in, who won 16 percent.Observers noted that a large number of reformist swing votes flocked from Ahn to Ban, preferring his reputed career as reelected chief of the international organization.By Bae Hyun-jung","reporters saturday the greatest dilemma ,potential presidential candidate speaking for ,for the 2017 presidential election ,friday over the ongoing allegations ,election campaigns this was compromising","['National Assembly', 'Ahn Cheol', 'the People ’s Party', 'National Election Commission', 'Kim Su - min', 'Kim', 'Ahn', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Park Sun', 'Kim', 'Ahn', 'Kim', 'U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Saenuri Party', 'Gallup Korea', 'Ban', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea ’s', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.74494135  0.53643143

The move -- considered bold in the country notorious for long working hours -- was met with mixed reactions. South Korea’s average yearly working hours reached 2,285 in 2015, the longest of any OECD member.Unlike private companies and government agencies, there was no rule governing working hours for lawmakers. “I think we can work more efficiently by separating when to work and when to take a break,” Pyo said. The former criminology professor has gained fame by being the country‘s first profiler and for his biting criticisms of the established system and President Park Geun-hye’s stance on civil liberty. He joined politics last year and won a seat in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province.The 50-year-old said that his aides and staff were often forced to work overtime to respond to calls from ordinary citizens and reporters. Those working at other lawmakers’ offices said that the former police officer’s celebrity status tended to attract more calls than the other first-term lawmakers. Instead, the opposition lawmaker vowed to communicate more frequently via online platforms by keeping communication channels open at all times.  Rep. Pyo Chang-won, a first-term lawmaker of the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea. Kim Myung-sub/The Korea HeraldTo make the case for his decision, Pyo cited the Labor Standards Act, which governs conditions for workers in South Korea. The regulation, implemented in 2014, stipulates that workers shall not work no longer than 8 hours per day and 40 hours per week. It also limits overtime to 12 hours per week.Pyo’s decision was welcomed by some parliamentary aides who said their work was often distracted by “frivolous” phone calls leaving them less time to actually work on sorting out requests from their constituents.“Not answering to calls doesn’t mean leaving the office and going home,” 33-year-old staff aide to an opposition lawmaker’s office. “Using telephone is not the only method to file a request or complain. I don’t think it should be taken for granted that the aides stay late at the office to answer calls,” the staff said, wishing to remain unnamed.But some citizens cautioned that the decision would hamper the work ethics among public servants. “A lawmaker’s office is not a bank ,” Yoon Gye-hun, 30-year-old office worker in Seoul, saying that the Assembly already enjoys superiority in authority over most stakeholders trying to reach out to the lawmakers.By Yeo Jun-suk","limits overtime to 12 hours ,opposition lawmaker office using telephone ,old office worker in seoul ,working hours for lawmakers think ,week it also limits overtime","['Pyo Chang - won', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Twitter', 'the National Assembly', 'South Korea ’s', 'OECD', 'Pyo', 'Park Geun', 'Yongin', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Pyo Chang - won', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Kim Myung - sub', 'Pyo', 'South Korea', 'Pyo ’s', 'Yoon Gye - hun', 'Seoul', 'Assembly', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57224679  0.10534132

Park vetoed the contentious bill, drawing the ire of the opposition parties.Seeking to reset her ties with the opposition camp, Park will deliver a speech to mark the launch of the new legislature, which officially began its four-year term on May 30.The schedule for her speech at the assembly has yet to be finalized. But the presidential Cheong Wa Dae said that it is ""customary"" for the chief executive to deliver a speech to celebrate the launch of parliament.The speech is likely to be designed to drum up legislative support for her drive to create jobs and reinvigorate the economy, and reset relations with the newly-elected assembly on a high note, political observers said.With assembly speaker Rep. Chung Sye-kyun having cut affiliation with the Minjoo Party of Korea, the main opposition party now has 122 seats in the 300-member assembly -- the same number of seats for the ruling Saenuri Party.

Chung was voted in as the speaker for the first half of the 20th National Assembly at the plenary session of parliament.Chung will be obligated to sever party ties during his two-year term.The appointment of the speaker, which was deadlocked after the new parliament began its four year term on May 30, came about after the ruling Saenuri Party agreed to let Minjoo take the speaker's post on Wednesday. In exchange, it secured the right to appoint the chairs for the critical house steering and legislation committees.The latter, in particular, can hold up bills from being put to a vote in the plenary session.Saenuri and Minjoo had been fighting over the speaker post, especially as the April 13 election showed no concrete winner.Saenuri won 122 seats compared to the Minjoo's 123 in the 300-seat unicameral parliament with the rest being taken by minor parties and independents. ""I wanted to become the speaker as I believed this would be the best opportunity for me to do what I can for the country, parliament and our party,"" Chung said after the nomination, adding the parliament is facing a grave period amid signs of economic crisis and the incumbent administration inability to push for change.Besides the speakers, lawmakers voted for Saenuri's Rep. Shim Jae-chul and People's Party tapped Rep. Park Joo-sun as the new vice speakers. Shim is a five-term lawmaker while Park has been elected four times.Following Chung's inauguration, Saenuri and Minjoo now hold an equal number of seats in the National Assembly.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon Lee, an independent seven-term lawmaker and former prime minister, is currently visiting the U.S. upon the invitation of the U.S. State Department as a representative of a foundation honoring the late President Roh Moo-hyun.Though he exited The Minjoo Party of Korea in the run-up to the April 13 general election, Lee is still considered a leading opposition figure, likely to return to his home party within the year.He reportedly played a key role in supporting Ban, who was foreign minister at the time, in becoming chief of the international organization in 2006.After his slated meeting with Ban was exposed to the media, Lee expressed his resentment over Ban’s rise as a presidential candidate. “I have seen many diplomats, but none of them made it so far as to the presidential candidacy,” Lee had said Monday.“ are skilled at diplomatic communication, but lack expertise in other areas such as economy, social affairs, policies, culture and education.”Also, the prudent character of diplomats does not fit with politics, which requires quick decisions and bold actions, Lee had added.His words directly pointed at Ban who, during his visit to Korea last month, repeatedly alluded to his bid in the 2017 presidential race. His second, five-year term as U.N. chief is to end at the end of this year.But Lee’s aides claim that the reason for the meeting’s cancellation was more because of the change in Ban’s stance, rather than Lee’s remarks. It was Ban’s side that had suggested the meeting with Lee.“The nature of the occasion, which was supposed to be a private, closed-door tea meeting, has changed,” said an official of the Roh Moo-hyun Foundation, who was accompanying Lee on his U.S. trip.According to local pollster R&Search;, Ban’s support rating as a potential presidential candidate stood at 25.2 percent, down 3.8 percent from the previous week, but still slightly ahead of Moon Jae-in, the top candidate for the Minjoo Party.By Bae Hyun-jung","opposition camp stood out wednesday ,presidential race his second five ,politics the secretariat said tuesday ,2017 presidential race his second ,presidential race his second","['United Nations', 'Ban Ki - moon ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee Han - chan', 'U.N.', 'korean', 'U.N.', 'Ban', 'Lee', 'Ban ’s', 'korean', 'New York', 'Lee', 'U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon Lee', 'U.S.', 'the U.S. State Department', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Lee', 'Ban', 'Ban', 'Lee', 'Ban ’s', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Ban', 'Korea', 'U.N.', 'Ban ’s', 'Lee', 'Ban', 'Lee', 'Roh Moo - hyun Foundation', 'Lee', 'U.S.', 'Ban', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53043038  0.3355729

C. Johnson & Son, Aekyung, SK Planet, Daiso and more. They either produce or distribute the 15 types of household products that come under the ministry’s direct supervision.According to the revised Chemical Registration and Assessment Act that took effect last year, the ministry is responsible for overseeing the safety of 15 new types of household products including detergents, bleaches, fabric conditioners, coating agents, air fresheners, preservatives, insecticides, antiseptics, tattoo dyes, coloring bleaches, antifogging agents and antirust additives. Under the ministry agenda, companies that signed MOUs are required to submit a list of the chemicals used in their products and the amount and purpose of those chemicals by June 25. After the ministry assesses the products’ safety, products with high health risks will immediately be ordered to be recalled or banned from sales. The results of assessments will also be made public. For companies that did not wish to sign an MOU, the ministry still has sent an official letter to require them to hand in the list of substances, based on the current law. Those who do not turn in the list by the end of this month could be fined up to 10 million won .“This is just the beginning for the ministry to ensure the safety of household products, and we will complete a survey on all such products by the end of this year and expand into all biocide-containing industrial and electronic goods from next year,” said Vice Environment Minister Jeong Yeon-man.Vice Environment Minister Jeong Yeon-man  attends a meeting with the toxic humidifier disinfectant victims in Seoul on June 7.

The deadlock on who will sit in the speaker's chair has stalled all parliamentary proceedings such as picking who will chair the 18 assembly committees. The ruling party, however, said it should take the chairmanships of the key steering and legislation committees in return.Saenuri also has been eying the intelligence committees within the National Assembly, while Minjoo wants to chair the steering and national policy committees.Rep. Suh Chung-won, an eight-term lawmaker from Saenuri who has been cited as a potential candidate for the National Assembly speaker, called on his party to look at the bigger picture and asked Saenuri's leadership to yield the speaker's seat to the opposition.Chung then brushed aside speculations raised by the opposition that the presidential office has been behind the ruling party's strategy on the parliamentary formation. The Saenuri whip added it also plans to yield the budget, policy, and finance committees' chairmanships to the opposition.Minjoo greeted the latest decision, adding that the move reflects the public's will as shown through April's poll. The main opposition added it will make effort to move forward on other issues related to the appointment of assembly committee chairs. The ruling Saenuri Party and the Minjoo Party have been wrangling over the formation of the committees as the main opposition managed to take one more seat in the 300-seat unicameral parliament following the April 13 polls.The discussion had faced a deadlock as Saenuri claimed it should take the National Assembly speaker seat, in line with tradition, since the post has with very few exceptions been taken up by the ruling party in the past. The opposition countered that the No. 1 party in terms of the number of lawmakers has priority in picking the speaker.Political pundits earlier said if the parties do not agree on the issue soon, the 20th National Assembly will get off to a rocky start, which bodes ill for cooperation between the parties down the road.","chair has stalled all parliamentary ,ruling saenuri party announced wednesday ,days long stalemate south korea ,stalled all parliamentary proceedings ,has stalled all parliamentary proceedings","[""South Korea 's"", 'Saenuri Party', 'National Assembly', 'National Assembly', 'Saenuri', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'National Assembly', 'Saenuri', 'the National Assembly', 'Minjoo', 'Suh Chung - won', 'Saenuri', 'the National Assembly', 'Saenuri', 'Chung', 'Saenuri', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Saenuri', 'the National Assembly', 'National Assembly']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42312962  0.27701542

More than 300 messages called for the governor’s resignation, while some said they would boycott the sea salt produced in the region.The police revealed details of the case on June 3. The victim’s distress call came in the wee hours of May 22.According to police, the victim had dinner at one of the local restaurants where she was asked to join the three suspects, two of whom are parents of children at her school. The men insisted that the victim drink, despite her repeated refusal as she had plans to explore the village the next day.Once the victim was inebriated, one of the men volunteered to drop her home and raped her at her residence, followed by the other two. The teachers’ residence, a detached house where four female teachers lived, does not have a gate and the nearest CCTV is located over a kilometer away. The victim reported the crime to the police when she regained consciousness. Her soiled clothes and blankets were taken in as evidence. In the morning the victim went to a hospital where DNA evidence was collected from her body. Tests have matched the evidence collected from the victim with those of the three suspects. The police are currently investigating whether this was a premeditated crime, taking into consideration the rape occurred close to the end of her contract as a temporary teacher and she was planning to leave the island. Lawmaker Kim Jung-jae was among many who called the case a savage violation of women’s rights, deserving the harshest punishment. Kim reasserted the need to raise safety measures in far-flung areas and the Education Ministry’s responsibility to enhance the female teachers’ social position.  The South Jeolla Office of Education said it plans to help transfer the victim to a school of her choice, as well as grant her a leave of absence and sick leave. It will hire a lawyer for the victim if the case goes to court.The office said it will run a check on all female teachers’ residences in the remote islands of South Jeolla Province. The Ministry of Education will follow up with nationwide security checks on teachers’ residences. Shinan County had previously been lambasted for abuse of human rights of people with mental disability who worked in the local salt pans in conditions not far from modern day slavery.

Japan pays us a small fraction of the cost, a very small fraction. I want them to pay us at least the cost,"" Trump said in an interview with CNN. ""It's actually less than 50 percent. But a general got on and said 50 percent recently. But, even if it was 50 percent, why aren't they paying us 100 percent?""Trump was talking about Japan and made no mention of South Korea, but the 50 percent part appeared to be about Seoul's cost-sharing because the ""general"" Trump referred to is believed to be new U.S. Forces Korea Commander Vincent Brooks. In a Senate confirmation hearing in April, Brooks said that South Korea currently pays about half the cost, about $900 million a year, to help finance the stationing of some 28,500 troops, and that it would cost more to keep those troops stationed in the U.S. than it does in Korea.Trump insisted that 50 percent is far from enough.""Of course they should pay 100 percent. You're talking about billions and billions of dollars, and you're talking about worse than that. You're talking about World War III. Somebody attacks Japan, and we end up in World War III,"" he said on CNN. He also reiterated that the U.S. should be prepared to end the protection of allies.""You have to be prepared to walk from a deal. You can't go in there saying -- like Hillary said, 'We will never let our partners down. We will never, never, never.' OK, that's wonderful, except, you know what? If I'm Japan, I say good. We'll keep paying the 50 percent,"" Trump said.""You have to be prepared to walk ... these are very smart people we're dealing with, OK? They've been ripping us off for a long time,"" he said.Trump has even suggested that South Korea and Japan develop their own nuclear weapons for self-defense so as to reduce U.S. security burdens.On Sunday, Trump suggested he wouldn't oppose the allies going nuclear, saying ""That's up to them. It's not up to me. It's up to them.""Maximizing U.S. interests through negotiation is the No. 1 point in Trump's ""America First"" foreign policy. Trump and aides have repeatedly emphasized the businessman is an excellent negotiator and is ready to use the skill to regain American interests lost under Democratic administrations.Trump has even expressed a willingness to negotiate with North Korea's leader, saying in a media interview, ""I would speak to him. I would have no problem speaking to him."" The remark also sparked criticism that a meeting with the North would end up bolstering the dictator.On Friday, Trump reiterated the willingness to talk to the North.""They said, 'Would you mind having negotiations with North Korea?' No problem. Who the hell cares? You have a negotiation. I'm not going there. But you have a negotiation. They say, 'We will never talk; we will never talk.'

It marked the first time for Ban to be included in the Realmeter survey, which is one of the key barometers to gauge public sentiment.During his visit to Seoul last month, Ban said he would ""contemplate"" what he would do as a South Korean citizen when he returns to his home country after completing his two terms as U.N. helmsman at the end of this year. He did not directly deny the speculation that he will run for the presidency. Political watchers said if he opts to run, Ban will probably seek the ruling Saenuri Party's ticket, which can put a dent in the opposition's plans for regime change in 2018.Moon Jae-in, former leader of the Minjoo Party of Korea, held 22.2 percent, up 0.7 percentage point from a week earlier. Ahn Cheol-soo, co-chairman of the minor People's Party, saw his approval rate drop 3.2 percentage points to 12.9 percent. Realmeter said if Ban runs for president the race slated for late next year will become a contest between the U.N. chief and Moon. Until Ban hinted at his political ambitions, many here believed the race would pit Moon against Ahn, with any ruling party candidate coming in third.

Security Council sanctions on Pyongyang, which are considered the toughest ever to be imposed on the North, and China has expressed its determination to fully carry out the sanctions. ""The outcome that we're looking for is North Korean agreement to negotiate the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. That's not unconditional surrender,"" Russel said.

The widespread view is that he would seek to warm relations with Beijing at a time of growing international pressure on Pyongyang.On Tuesday, Ri held talks with his Chinese counterpart, Song Tao, minister of the International Department of the Chinese Communist Party, and they agreed to ""strengthen exchanges and cooperation between the two parties,"" the Chinese Communist Party said in a statement.

Dan Sullivan  were made at a luncheon between Lim Sung-nam, a South Korean vice foreign minister and a group of U.S. Republican senators in Seoul earlier in the day, the ministry said.   Sullivan, who leads the U.S. delegation, said that the U.S. Congress and Americans believe that the Seoul-Washington alliance is serving as a ""linchpin"" for peace and stability in the region.   The ministry said that he stressed that the U.S. government and Congress will firmly support the alliance no matter who is elected as the next president.   His remarks came as Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has called for allies to pay more for U.S. defense supports, saying that Washington is protecting wealthy nations including South Korea in exchange for very little in return.   He has even urged Seoul to shoulder 100 percent of the costs necessary to defend against North Korea's threats. His call has spawned speculation that if he is elected, he could withdraw troops unless Seoul agrees to pay more.   Walid Phares, a top foreign policy adviser to Trump, told Yonhap News Agency that it is one of Trump's principles to have South Korea ""share more"" of the costs.   Seoul's foreign ministry added that Lim asked for consistent interest and support from the U.S. Congress over the international community's stronger sanctions on North Korea.    Pyongyang was slapped with the strongest sanctions to date in early March after it conducted a nuclear test and fired off a long-range missile earlier in the year.   In response, Sen. Cory Gardner  stressed the importance of faithful implementation of the U.N. sanctions and the need to strongly press North Korea into giving up its nuclear program, it added.   The three-member delegation, which also includes Joni Ernst , arrived in Seoul on Sunday for a four-day stay.","upcoming presidential election seoul foreign ,visiting republican senator said monday ,the upcoming presidential election seoul ,upcoming presidential election seoul ,of republican senators in seoul","['U.S.', 'republican', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Dan Sullivan', 'Lim Sung - nam', 'south korean', 'U.S.', 'republican', 'Seoul', 'Sullivan', 'U.S.', 'the U.S. Congress', 'Americans', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Congress', 'republican', 'Donald Trump', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', ""North Korea 's"", 'Seoul', 'Walid Phares', 'Trump', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'Trump', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Lim', 'the U.S. Congress', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Cory Gardner', 'U.N.', 'North Korea', 'Joni Ernst', 'Seoul']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.43795121  0.11817746

The National Assembly The ruling Saenuri Party prioritized drafting bills designed to support President Park Geun-hye’s major economic and security initiatives such as business deregulation, labor market overhaul and counterterrorism measures. The main opposition’s top agenda involves seeking measures to address social issues such as compensating the victims of toxic humidifier disinfectant and the Sewol ferry sinking, and funding of the state-led child care program. “Since we face many challenges on the economic and security front, I am hoping that  the 20th National Assembly will devote themselves to improving the people’s lives and serving their interests,” said President Park on Monday in a message released during her visit to Uganda. But a legislative impasse looms large as the three mainstream parties remain deadlocked over how to assign key parliamentary positons and whether to revisit controversial bills that failed to clear the previous Assembly. One of the key issues roiling the upcoming parliamentary session is a bill vetoed by the president last week that grants lawmakers the authority to hold parliamentary hearings on a wider range of issues. The rivaling lawmakers’ views clash over whether they can revote on the bill in the new session.  While the Saenuri Party contends that the bill has been scrapped with the ending of the 19th Assembly, The Minjoo Party of Korea and People’s Party claimed that the bill can still be put to a vote during the upcoming plenary session. On the first day of the new Assembly, the parties gathered their newly-elected lawmakers to share their main legislative goals and take steps to elect new leaderships.The Saenuri Party officially endorsed Kim Hee-ok, a former chief of Government Public Ethic Committee, as the chairman of emergency committee. The party also named a total of nine bills as “major” legislative agenda, including the one designed to address youth unemployment and others related to business deregulation, labor reforms and counterterrorism efforts. The party had proposed similar legislations during the previous assembly, but failed to get them passed due to the pushback from opposition parties. The opposition parties have again vowed to not budge on their stance during the new term. The Minjoo Party members, on their part, announced that they would hold a national convention on Aug. 27 to elect their leadership. The new leadership would replace current leader Rep. Kim chong-in who has been serving as an interim chief since January.  They also vowed to enact bills designed to compensate victims of toxic humidifier disinfectant and the Sewol ferry sinking, and to seek a parliamentary tool to investigate the tragedies and punish those accountable. Another major bill involves implementing measures to fund the state-led free child care program known as the “Nuri” initiative. The government has said that there is not enough budget to sustain the initiative that targets children aged 3 to 5. The third-biggest People’s Party, meanwhile, laid out its own legislative agenda including plans to achieve fair economic growth, create jobs for the young people, relive economic disparity and build robust national security.By Yeo Jun-suk","include presidential race next year ,newly elected lawmakers to share ,last week that grants lawmakers ,presidential race next year with ,presidential race next year","['National Assembly', 'the National Assembly', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun - hye', 'National Assembly', 'Park', 'Uganda', 'Assembly', 'the Saenuri Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'People ’s Party', 'Assembly', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Kim Hee - ok', 'Government Public Ethic Committee', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Kim', 'People ’s Party', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.83365005  0.55559492

""Ban would have felt like riding a flower-decorated palanquin made by the presidential office and the ruling party.""""Ban got too carried away. He is still the head of the United Nations,"" the party whip said. During his visit to South Korea, Ban said he would ""contemplate"" what he would do as a South Korean citizen when he returns to his home country after completing his two terms as U.N. helmsman at the end of this year.Amid the lack of popular figures in the ruling Saenuri Party, as well as conservative factions, recent local polls raised the possibility of the opposition winning the presidential race slated for late 2017. According to the data compiled by RealMeter last week, Moon Jae-in, former leader of the Minjoo Party, topped the survey for the preferred presidential candidate with 21.5 percent, followed by Ahn Cheol-soo, co-chairman of the People's Party, with 16.1 percent. Ban was not included in the poll.A separate study released by a local daily on Monday, however, showed that Ban far outpaced other candidates with an approval rating of nearly 30 percent.As such, the unexpected remark made during Ban's trip to South Korea gave urgency to opposition parties who are now scrambling to counter Ban's possible bid, including asking the legitimacy of an ex-U.N. secretary-general participating in local politics and his overall qualifications as a leader.Chung Sye-kyun, the former head of the Minjoo Party of Korea, said Ban's presidential bid is ""inappropriate"" and will ""damage"" the reputation of South Korea around the globe."" is not receiving a good response around the globe,"" Chung said during an interview with CBS Radio, adding Ban should make efforts to be remembered as a competent secretary-general like Kofi Annan.Chung also claimed Ban will not become a strong candidate for the presidential election even if he actually joins the race.""I worked with him some 10 years ago. I don't know how much he has grown, but I do not think he is capable enough to lead South Korea,"" Chung added. Lee Jong-kul, a former floor leader of the main opposition Minjoo Party who had used foul language to lash out at Ban, meanwhile, apologized for insulting the U.N. chief.""If  becomes the president, his name will be the one we will be throwing out into the gutter,"" Lee told reporters on Sunday. ""The ruling party is trying to invite Ban because they have no other suitable figure to compete in the upcoming election.""It is a disaster that a person like Ban appeared,"" Lee added.Critics of the opposition's bashing of the secretary-general, on the other hand, point out that it was the liberal camp's own icon, late President Roh Moo-hyun, who helped Ban become the U.N. chief in the first place.""If Roh thought highly of Ban, I don't see the logic of the late president's ardent followers questioning his qualifications,"" a local political pundit said.

Thousands of American lives lost,"" Trump said of Obama's visit to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial in a Twitter message Saturday ahead of Monday's Memorial Day.Obama visited Hiroshima on Friday, becoming the first sitting American president to do so since the 1945 bombing despite concern it could dilute Japan's wartime aggression by making the country look more like a victim, rather than the one who started the Pacific War by bombing Pearl Harbor. Just days ahead of the visit, Japan's Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida sought to reinforce the notion of victimhood, saying the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were ""extremely regrettable"" and do not conform to ""humanitarianism.""The visit also raised eyebrows of many World War II veterans and their children who believe that the decision to drop the bombs saved countless American lives that would otherwise have been lost.Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee and now a key supporter of Trump, also denounced Obama's visit as an ""apology lap,"" accusing him of ""dissing our vets."" Speaking at a Trump campaign rally in San Diego on Friday, Palin said the visit amounts to suggesting, ""We were wrong to prove that we would eradicate evil in World War II.""American veterans groups had urged Obama not to visit Hiroshima until the Japanese apologize for the wartime treatment of American prisoners of war, thousands of whom died of abuse and starvation in Japanese prison camps.But Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made clear that he has no plans to visit Pearl Harbor. Instead, Abe sought to emphasize Japan's image as a victim.""In Hiroshima, numerous citizens sacrificed their lives, and even now there are those of us suffering because of the atomic bombing. And what those Japanese people suffering from the atomic bomb desire is never to repeat such tragedy in the world,"" Abe said during a joint news conference after talks with Obama. Obama's decision to go to Hiroshima could be the latest in a series of efforts to build his legacy in his final year in office.It could also be a reward for a nation that has done everything possible to help address American economic and security needs in a region marked by China's rise, including expanding Japan's military roles overseas.White House officials have stressed that the visit wasn't an apology, and that it was aimed at highlighting his commitment to pursuing the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons"" and to honor the memory of all innocents who were lost during the war.During Friday's visit to the Hiroshima memorial, Obama laid a wreath and delivered a long speech honoring all innocent victims of the war, including Korean victims, while underscoring his call for a world without nuclear weapons.Obama's mention of Korean A-bomb victims, which also marked the first time for a U.S. president to do so, was seen as an effort to underscore the point that the visit was aimed at honoring all victims of the atomic bombings and does not represent an apology to Japan.But Obama stopped short of visiting a separate memorial honoring Korean victims.","obama visited hiroshima on friday ,trump also denounced obama visit ,trump also denounced obama ,memorial day obama visited hiroshima ,republican presidential candidate donald trump","['U.S.', 'republican', 'Donald Trump', 'Barack Obama', 'japanese', 'Hiroshima', 'Japan', 'Obama', 'Japan', 'american', 'trump', 'Obama', 'Obama', 'Hiroshima', 'american', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Fumio Kishida', 'Hiroshima', 'Nagasaki', 'american', 'Sarah Palin', 'republican', 'Trump', 'Obama', 'trump', 'San Diego', 'Palin', 'Hiroshima', 'Japanese', 'american', 'japanese', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Abe', 'Japan', 'Hiroshima', 'japanese', 'Abe', 'Obama', 'Hiroshima', 'american', 'China', 'Japan', 'White House', 'Hiroshima', 'Obama', 'korean', 'Obama', 'Korean A - bomb', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'korean']",11,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44254208  1.19251812

""We send them wheat. They send us cars. I'm not angry at them. I'm angry at our grossly incompetent president who allowed this to happen.""Trump did not mention South Korea, but it is not believed to be any meaningful omission.Maximizing U.S. interests through negotiation is the No. 1 point in Trump's ""America First"" foreign policy. Trump and his aides have repeatedly emphasized that the businessman is an excellent negotiator and is ready to use the skill to regain American interests lost under Democrat administrations.But such a stance has unnerved foreign countries, especially such allies as South Korea and Japan, as Trump has said that the U.S. should be prepared to end its protection of allies unless they pay more. He even suggested allowing South Korea and Japan to develop their own nuclear weapons as a way to reduce U.S. security burdens.South Korea currently pays about half the costs, about $900 million a year, to help finance the troop presence, and U.S. officials, including new U.S. Forces Korea Commander Vincent Brooks, said it would cost more to keep those troops stationed in the U.S. than it does in Korea.Trump's top foreign policy adviser, Walid Phares, said in a recent interview with Yonhap News Agency that Trump's remarks made as a candidate should be taken as an expression of principles, rather than policy, meaning that such extreme scenarios as a troop pullout are only for negotiation purposes.","candidate donald trump on sunday ,donald trump on sunday renewed ,republican presidential candidate donald trump ,donald trump on sunday ,presidential candidate donald trump on","['U.S.', 'republican', 'Donald Trump', 'american', 'Japan', 'Saudi Arabia', 'trump', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'trump', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Trump', 'american', 'Democrat', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Trump', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'Vincent Brooks', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'Trump', 'Walid Phares', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'Trump']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55563295  1.1857357

Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon’s six-day trip in South Korea would have been just a routine visit by the world’s top diplomat to his home state -- if not for the growing anticipation on his potential run in the 2017 presidential election Instead, Ban found himself at the center of national attention. Ever since the 71-year-old diplomat hinted on Wednesday at the possibility of his foray into politics, following his previous 10-year tenure, his every step has been interpreted to take on a political connotation.Ban’s presidential scenario seemed to gain further momentum on Sunday when he visited Hahoe folk village, a UNESCO World Heritage site near Andong in North Gyeongsang Province. The southeastern region is viewed as a political hometown to conservative politicians including President Park Geun-hye.U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon visits Hahoe folk village, a UNESCO World Heritage site near Andong, North Gyeongsang, Sunday. YonhapUpon arriving at the historical site, he had a luncheon with local leaders and prominent politicians such as North Gyeongsang Province Gov. Kim Kwan-yong and the Saenuri Party’s chief policymaker Rep. Kim Kwang-lim. “Not only does the trip show his enthusiasm toward a potential bid, but it also tells us his strategy for the next election,” said Yoon Hee-woong, a senior researcher at Opinion Live, a Seoul-based political consulting firm. One of the strategies that Ban might have in mind, Yoon said, is regional coalition between the conservative Gyeongsang region and Ban’s hometown Chungcheong provinces. “Though the regional coalition is not as strong as it used to be, it still carries significant impact,” he said. The Chungcheong area, politically positioned between the conservative Gyeongsang and the liberal Jeolla regions, has served as a bellwether electorate through the decades. Since the 1992 presidential election, the candidates who gathered the largest votes there ended up victorious in the national race.In an apparent move to consolidate his political base, Ban met on Saturday with former Prime Minister Kim Jong-pil. The 90-year-old Chungcheong-born politician had exercised his sway to help Jeolla native then-presidential candidate Kim Dae Jung beat his conservative counterpart Lee Hoi-chang in the 1997 election.“We discussed secret issues,” said the former prime minister after the 30-minute closed-door meeting. Ban told reporters that the two Chungchung natives mostly exchanged pleasantries such as about Ban’s work at the multinational organization. Faced with escalating talks over Ban’s alleged political ambitions, his close aides, mostly consisting of former foreign ministers and high-ranking ambassadors, have described Ban’s run for the 2017 race as a “likely” choice, but reiterated that no decision had yet been made.“The likelihood of Ban running for the presidential election is higher than before ,” said Oh Joon, South Korea’s ambassador to the U.N, who have accompanied most of Ban’s trips to South Korea. But the ambassador added that Ban’s shifted stance toward the local politics does not mean he would enter the politics to run for the 2017 race.“He currently sees his run for the election as one of the possible options, which is a change from his previous position,” Oh said. Political parties wasted no time in responding to Ban’s highly politicized trip. While the Saenuri Party raised expectations that the U.N. chief would run as its candidate, the opposition bloc denounced the move as a desperate attempt to overcome a lack of prominent candidates in the ruling party. The Minjoo Party of Korea’s former floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul on Sunday urged Ban to forgo his presidential bid as a Saenuri candidate, saying that his legacy as the U.N. chief would “go down the drain” should he run for the 2017 race.“Ban appears to move up the calendar for the presidential election,” said political analyst Yoon.“Since his popularity could constrain the rise of prospective candidates, other presidential hopefuls will be forced to make political actions before Ban officially establishes himself as a candidate,” he said.

The tragedy claimed over300 lives and raised questions about public transportation safety.   Earlier this year, the ruling and opposition parties again wrangled over the passage of an anti-terrorism bill that the government said was crucial to protecting its citizens from an ever-growing terrorism threat around the globe, while the opposition parties voiced worries over a possibility of the law being used for political oppression and illegal monitoring of people's lives.    Such infighting among lawmakers continued right up until the end of the parliamentary session.   On Friday, President Park Geun-hye vetoed the revision to the National Assembly Act that was passed despite opposition from the ruling Saenuri Party.    The government believes the revision that allows more hearings would likely put a huge constraint on the administration and allow the opposition to use it as a political tool, but the opposition parties argued it was a better check and balance on the government.   Official data, meanwhile, showed that the outgoing 19th National Assembly opened 34 parliamentary sessions. With the exception of temporary sessions, regular plenary gatherings were convened for 175 days during the past four years.   According to parliamentary data, a total of 18,000 pieces of legislation and resolutions have been tabled, but around 10,000 were thrown out.   Only two petitions for legislation, among 277, were brought to the regular sessions for discussion during the 19th National Assembly.","five months amid political deadlock ,worst performing parliaments of all ,months amid political deadlock over ,the worst performing parliaments of ,the worst performing parliaments","['National Assembly of Korea', 'Park Geun', 'the National Assembly Act', 'Saenuri Party', 'National Assembly', 'National Assembly']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.96388268  0.16348821

In a 2003 survey, 32.1 percent of the parents surveyed said their responsibility continues until marriage, but the number fell to 27 percent in 2006, 23.1 percent in 2009 and to 20.4 percent in 2012.In 2003, 6.3 percent of parents said they will continue to look after their children after marriage if necessary. That number dropped to 4.6 percent in 2012.The new standard for parents was that their duty ends when children graduate from college. While 40.2 percent said so in 2003, a larger 49.6 percent gave the answer in 2012.A separate report by the institute earlier this week showed 31.7 percent of children felt they have to support their aging parents, a staggering drop from 89.9 percent in 1998.The report on parental duty was based on a family life survey held by the institute every three years.In another poll by the institute in the August-September period last year, the results showed the overall thinking on parental responsibility was not all that rigid.The poll was conducted on 1,000 South Koreans  by telephone, asking them to rate four factors related to parents caring for their children between one and five. A higher number meant stronger parental responsibility.The average rating was 2.94 on whether parents needed to financially support children until they got a job. As to monetary help for marriage, the rating was 2.6. A close 2.59 rating was given for assistance in getting a home after marriage, and 2.22 for parental help in raising grandchildren.","aging parents staggering drop from ,their aging parents staggering drop ,their aging parents weakened over ,support their aging parents staggering ,aging parents staggering drop","['the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs', 'South Koreans']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65082294 -0.0504687

Jeff Sessions  said in an interview with CNN that the nuclear armament remark came as Trump underscored the point that South Korea and Japan should pay more for U.S. defense support, but that does not mean he advocated the idea.""With regard to nuclear weapons, he sent Japan and South Korea a message. They're not paying their fair share of their defense and they've got to do more,"" Sessions said. ""He said, well, if you don't want to be under our nuclear umbrella and participate sufficiently, then maybe you need your own nuclear weapons. But he didn't advocate that. He was just using that as a negotiating point.""The issue ""would certainly be a matter to be discussed so carefully with our good allies, Japan and Korea, but they need to do more,"" Sessions said.Trump has displayed deeply negative views of U.S. security commitments overseas, contending the U.S. should stop being the policeman of the world. The real-estate tycoon has said that the U.S. should be prepared to end protection of allies unless they pay more. Maximizing U.S. interests through negotiation is the No. 1 point in Trump's ""America First"" foreign policy. Trump and aides have repeatedly emphasized the businessman is an excellent negotiator and is ready to use the skill to regain American interests lost under Democratic administrations.Last week, Trump even expressed a willingness to negotiate with North Korea's leader. But the remark sparked criticism that such a meeting would end up bolstering the dictator.On Thursday, Trump surpassed the magic number of 1,237 delegates necessary to win the Republican nomination.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon indicated potentially joining next year’s presidential race, frenzied debate was sparked in political circles on its implications for the current political landscape and whether he stands a chance.The 71-year-old diplomat said Wednesday evening that he would “contemplate” what he would do as a South Korean citizen when his term ends in December 2016 in response to widespread speculation of him becoming a presidential candidate for the ruling Saenuri Party.U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon talks with South Korean Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn at the 11th Jeju Forum on Thursday. YonhapWith media outlets and local pundits wasting no time to interpret his remark as tacit acknowledgement to running in the 2017 election, Ban reportedly tried to water down the remarks the next day by commenting that they were taken out of context.   “ reports as if I decided to run for the election, but it was not my intention,” Ban was quoted as saying by Jeju Gov. Won Hee-ryong, who attended the closed-door luncheon alongside foreign dignitaries such as former Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama. In a breakfast meeting that came before the afternoon meeting, Ban reportedly reiterated that South Korea needs a leader that can unite the divided country, echoing his yesterday’s remarks viewed as making the case for his foray into the politics. The rival political parties also roiled over what was considered a step forward from Ban’s previous position not to comment at all on his political plan. The Saenuri Party welcomed the idea, while the opposition parties denounced it as being inappropriate and premature. “If Ban comes to our party , we will win ,” said Rep. Hong Moon-pyo of the Saenuri Party. “It seems to me that the opposition party is intimated ,” he said. But Hong added that Ban must prove himself as a strong candidate during the party primaries by competing with other presidential hopefuls such as Rep. Kim Moo-sung, who had insisted that Ban should win the nomination contest in order to become a party candidate. The Minjoo Party of Korea and the People’s Party, for their part, claimed that it is inappropriate for the incumbent U. N. chief to engage with local politics and urged the world’s top diplomat to bring his focus back on international issues. “Ban’s comment on the presidential bid has brought confusion to the nation,” said Minjoo Party floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho. He accused Ban of hijacking the debate over crucial legislative matters such as how to distribute seats for the parliamentary committees in the 20th National Assembly that opens next Monday. The main opposition’s lukewarm response contrasts with their previous welcoming gesture toward the former foreign affairs minister. The liberal party had contended that Ban should run as their candidate because the liberal Roh Moo-hyun named him as a foreign minister and helped his bid for the U.N. chief. Following the meeting with Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, Ban flew to Japan to attend the G7 summit. He will return on Friday and attend a conference in Gyeonggi Province, before heading down to North Gyeongsang Province to meet with the city’s senior citizens.By Yeo Jun-suk","year presidential race frenzied debate ,next year presidential race frenzied ,presidential race frenzied debate ,presidential race frenzied debate was ,year presidential race frenzied","['U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'south korean', 'Saenuri Party', 'U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'south korean', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Jeju Forum', 'Ban', 'Ban', 'Jeju Gov.', 'Won Hee - ryong', 'japanese', 'Tomiichi Murayama', 'Ban', 'South Korea', 'Ban ’s', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Ban', 'Hong Moon', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Hong', 'Ban', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Ban', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'the People ’s Party', 'U.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's potential bid for the presidency on Thursday, as his possible run in next year's election is raising fresh uncertainties in the fluid political landscape here.The ruling Saenuri Party apparently welcomes Ban as a potential standard-bearer, while opposition parties expressed wariness, nitpicking at his lack of experience in domestic politics beset by relentless factional rivalries and partisan backbiting.In the clearest indication yet of his presidential ambitions, Ban said Wednesday that he would ""contemplate"" what he would do as a South Korean citizen when he returns to his home country after completing his two terms as U.N. helmsman at the end of this year.In a departure from his previously noncommittal stance over domestic politics, he even said that ""political leaders should strive harder for national unity.""Rep. Hong Moon-pyo, the Saenuri Party's acting secretary-general, said that the ""general sentiment"" in his party is in support of Ban as a potential presidential candidate. He also said that should Ban join the ruling party he could clinch a win in the presidential election."" is a figure that is popular at home and abroad, and has experience in various fields including the government and society at large,"" he said in an SBS radio interview. ""His character is more aligned with the Saenuri Party  as he has been seen prioritizing conservative values,"" he added.Rep. Na Kyung-won of the same party also welcomed the possibility of Ban running for the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae as she attended a forum on the southern resort island of Jeju along with Ban.""It couldn't be better should Secretary-General Ban use his experience and capabilities for the people of the Republic of Korea,"" the lawmaker said.Others in the ruling camp said Ban can invigorate the party that has been struggling to find a strong contender to face off against established and well-known opposition contenders.In stark contrast to reactions from the ruling party, opposition lawmakers voiced uneasiness over Ban's potential run in the 2017 election.Rep. Park Jie-won of the minority People's Party said that it is ""inappropriate"" for Ban to hint at the possibility of running for the presidency ""in a strong tone of voice.""""His remarks alluding to his potential presidential run are inappropriate and deserve denunciation,"" he said during his appearance on a YTN radio program.Park also raised doubts that Ban will be able to successfully weather the ""political typhoon"" during an election campaign.""He has lived as a bureaucrat and largely in diplomatic circles, meaning that it would be difficult for him to endure ,"" he said.Kim Boo-kyum, a leading member of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea, also opposed Ban's potential presidential run, saying he wants Ban to remain a ""mediator for the settlement of international conflicts."" ""I hope that he would work as an international leader that goes beyond domestic politics,"" he said during a forum in Daegu.Other opposition officials belittled Ban's presidential prospects, casting him as ""one of the potential presidential contenders."" In recent opinion surveys, Rep. Moon Jae-in, former leader of the Minjoo Party, and Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, co-chair of the People's Party, were polling in first and second place, respectively, although the ranks could be upturned if Ban is factored into the polls. Meanwhile, the presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae refused to comment on Ban's presidential ambitions in an apparent move to avoid getting mired in partisan politics and focus on its agenda for economic revitalization.","potential presidential run are inappropriate ,political typhoon during an election ,presidential ambitions ban said wednesday ,opposition officials belittled ban presidential ,ban running for the presidential","[""South Korea 's"", 'U.N.', ""Ban Ki - moon 's"", 'Saenuri Party', 'Ban', 'Ban', 'south korean', 'U.N.', 'Hong Moon - pyo', ""the Saenuri Party 's"", 'Ban', 'Ban', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Na Kyung - won', 'Ban', 'Cheong', 'Jeju', 'Ban', 'Ban', 'the Republic of Korea', 'Ban', 'Ban', 'Park Jie - won', ""People 's Party"", 'Ban', 'YTN', 'Ban', 'Kim Boo - kyum', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Ban', 'Ban', 'Daegu', 'Ban', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Ahn Cheol', ""the People 's Party"", 'Ban', 'Cheong', 'Dae', 'Ban']",16,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.59655946  0.19343437

He said Vietnam will be one of the countries most affected by the trend of warming temperatures and rising seas.""That could have a huge impact on Vietnam's ability to feed its people, on fishermen, on farmers, and it could be a really big problem if we don't do something about it, so it's going to be up to you to start,"" said Obama, who routinely includes question-and-answer sessions with young leaders on his foreign trips.""One of the great things about your generation is that you're already much more conscious about the environment than my generation was or previous generations were,'' said Obama. He had told a previous questioner that he ``fooled around a lot'' when he was young and wasn't serious about school.""I was more into basketball and girls. I wasn't always that serious,'' Obama said. ``You're already way ahead of me. That's good.''Obama also promoted a 12-nation, trans-Pacific trade pact that includes Vietnam but is stalled in the U.S. Congress and opposed by the three leading U.S. presidential candidates. But he avoided wading too deeply into politics when asked where he sees himself in five years, around the end of his successor's first term. Obama has said on previous occasions that world leaders ask him all the time about the unpredictable election.""Sometimes, our politics doesn't express all the goodness of the people, but usually, eventually, the voters make good decisions and democracy works,'' Obama said. ``So I'm optimistic that we'll get through this period.''As for his future, Obama said he expects to stay involved with public policy issues and return to his roots as an organizer. ``I'll be like a community organizer, except a little more famous than I used to be.''The town-hall event capped Obama's historic visit to Vietnam. He spent three days in the capital of Hanoi, in the north, and in Ho Chi Minh City, in the south, meeting with government leaders and addressing the Vietnamese people in a speech and through less formal encounters, such as when ``people were trying to take selfies'' with him as he worked out in the hotel gym.In a show of how deeply relations between the former wartime enemies had thawed, Obama announced the end of a five-decades-old ban on the sale of arms to Vietnam. He also announced that the Peace Corps would begin operating in the country for the first time.In his appearances, Obama also pressed Vietnam to allow greater freedoms for its citizens, arguing that respect for human rights would improve the communist country's economy, stability and regional power. He returned to the issue Wednesday when a young Vietnamese woman asked about the importance of governments promoting the arts and culture.""You've got to let people express themselves. That's part of what a modern 21st century culture is all about,'' Obama said.Before the event, Obama met privately at the U.S. Consulate with staff and family members. The White House said the meeting included seven Foreign Service nationals who served at the U.S. Embassy during the evacuation of Saigon _ the former name for Ho Chi Minh City _ in 1975 during the Vietnam War.Japan was the next and final stop on Obama's swing through Asia, a region he says helped shape him growing up in his native Hawaii and later in Indonesia. Among the officials greeting him at the airport late Wednesday was U.S. Ambassador Caroline Kennedy. Obama planned to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe late Wednesday before joining his counterparts for a summit of the Group of Seven industrialized nations opening Thursday in Shima, Japan. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Abe would raise the recent arrest of a former U.S. Marine in connection with the murder of a Japanese woman on the southern island of Okinawa.Obama also planned a historic visit Friday to Hiroshima, seven decades after the U.S. ushered in the nuclear age by dropping an atomic bomb to end World War II.

About 2,600 teachers, members of the liberal Korean Teachers and Educational Workers’ Union, vowed they would not use the textbooks made for sixth graders. Since March, sixth graders have been taught with new state-issued history textbooks. The new textbooks, first published in September 2014 on a trial basis, were revised after having been criticized for errors and allegedly biased content. All elementary school students in Korea study with state-issued textbooks and learn history as part of social studies. “The textbook still deleted contents about the sexual slavery enforced by the Japanese government, and justified the May 16 military coup. Teaching incorrect history is educationally dangerous for elementary students who learn the history for the first time,” said the teachers. They urged the Education Ministry to abolish the history textbooks for elementary schools and vowed they would teach students with their own supplementary materials. The ministry, however, has refuted that it deliberately deleted the sexual slavery part, claiming that teaching the children with words such as “sexual slavery” or “comfort women” is not be appropriate. It has also maintained its stance that it would not allow any extra classes that are not approved by school principals in advance. Meanwhile, the government is currently working on publishing state-authored history textbooks for middle and high schools, amid persistent controversy over their reinstatement and the publication process that has mostly been kept confidential, citing security risk for the writers.By Lee Hyun-jeong","school teachers on wednesday rejected ,korean history about 600 teachers ,military coup teaching incorrect history ,history textbooks the new textbooks ,to abolish the history textbooks","['korean', 'Korean Teachers and Educational Workers ’ Union', 'Korea', 'japanese', 'the Education Ministry', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49159658  0.3115606

After having unprotected sex on Saturday night, she decided to get morning-after pills -- also known as emergency contraception pills -- to prevent unwanted pregnancy the day after. “And then I realized it was Sunday,” the 31-year-old told The Korea Herald. “I couldn’t find any gynecologist clinics that were open because it was the weekend. Most pharmacies in my town were closed, too.”Jeong ended up visiting a gynecologist on Monday, more than 35 hours after the incident. “I was really anxious as I knew the drug is most effective when taken as soon as possible,” she said, explaining that although she had been on birth control pills, she had sometimes forgotten to take them. “I thought the doctor would explain how the drug works and its possible side effects, but instead she only asked me two questions – when the intercourse took place and the date of my last period.”And then the doctor scolded Jeong for asking for the drug. “She said I should’ve protected myself better. ... But I don’t think women should be shamed for it,” she said.  According to a government study, 47 percent of all surveyed Korean women said they learn about birth control options, including oral contraceptives, from non-health care professionals. A growing number of Korean women, along with several women’s rights groups are stepping up their demands for access to morning-after pills without prescription, protesting the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety’s recent decision to continue disallowing over-the-counter sales of the drug at pharmacies. Currently, all women are required to have a prescription from a medical professional in order to obtain the drug, which is not covered by the national health insurance. Since 2012, the ministry has been considering the option of designating the emergency contraception pills an over-the-counter drug. As the drug is known to be effective up to 72 hours after unprotected sex, the requirement of a doctor’s prescription may deter prompt access to the pills and reduce its effect, the ministry had said three years ago. Yet after receiving fierce and continuous criticism from the nation’s gynecologists and religious groups, the government announced last week that the pills shall remain a prescription drug here indefinitely. Debate has persisted with religious groups contending that the morning-after pills are equivalent to abortion, which they classify as murder, and that easy access would encourage unruly sexual relationships.Citing its own study with gynecologists and pharmacists, the ministry argued that the drug’s overuse can be a health threat to women, especially young girls, and many are “not informed enough” on birth control in general. The ministry stated last week that it plans to come up with a proposal to better educate the public on the matter. According to the ministry’s study, only 36 percent of young Korean girls aged 15-19 were accurately informed about morning-after pills and its possible side effects. Also, 47 percent of all surveyed women said they learn about birth control options, including oral contraceptives, from non-health care professionals. As of 2014, only 39 percent of sexually active South Korean teenagers used birth control, while 66.1 percent of all teenagers who became pregnant had abortions. The nation’s sex education, which often discourages students from dating but does not provide enough information on birth control, is highlighted as one of the main reasons behind such statistics. “I don’t think Korea is ready for it just yet,” said Lee Im-soon, a gynecologist and professor at Soon Chun Hyang University’s medical school. “Most people are ill-informed about birth control options, including morning-after pills,” said the professor, who also contributed to the decision made by the ministry.“There is also a huge misconception about oral contraceptives, such as that it may cause infertility and increase the risk of cancer. Because of this, only about 3 percent of Korean use oral contraceptives, whereas about 30 to 40 percent of women in Europe and North American do the same. I think people need to be educated first on birth control  before designating the drug an OTC drug.”Yet Yoo Rim from the Center for Health and Social Change, a nongovernment think tank, said it is irresponsible for the government and physicians to point to the “ill-informed” public as one of the reasons for their decision not to designate morning-after pills as an OTC drug. “The government is the reason why people are not informed enough,” the researcher said. “They should make the drug more accessible and educate the public at the same time.”Jeong Yu-jin said there was no benefit to her in visiting her gynecologist to obtain the drug, as the doctor gave no explanation on birth control as well as the pills. “It just cost me more time and more money,” she said. “With or without a prescription, it’s very hard for women to access accurate information about the drug and its effects. So why not just make it an OTC drug and at least allow us to access it as soon as possible?”In order to avoid getting a “scolding” from doctors and unwanted attention from visitors and nurses, she visited different clinics every time she needed the drug, Jeong said.“I think this notion of ‘unwed women are supposed to be sexually inactive,’ still prevails in Korea,” she said. The Korean Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the biggest organization of obstetricians and gynecologists here, has been arguing that the overuse of morning-after pills can cause “serious side effects” to women, since 2012. There are currently a total of 13 morning-after pills available upon prescription in Korea, and among them, 12 of them are levonogestrel-only emergency contraceptive pills .Contrary to the claims made by the largest body of Korean gynecologists, the LNG ECPs, made solely of levonogestrel -- a manufactured hormone used in a number of birth control methods -- are very safe and pose no risk of overdose, according to the World Health Organization. “Levonogestrel is well tolerated, is not a known allergen,  leaves the body within a few days, is not addictive and has demonstrated no toxic reactions,” said a WHO report available online. “Its frequent use can result in increased side-effects, such as menstrual irregularities, although their repeated use poses no known health risks.”The Korean Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology was unavailable to comment when reached by The Korea Herald.Women’s groups said designating morning-after pills as OTC drug would help women save on costs for birth control. “Right now women have to pay doctors for prescription, and pay for the drug at the same time,” said Yeo Gyeong from an NGO named Womenlink. “The prescription alone costs about 10,000 won  while the drug about 30,000 won. It costs more on weekends because emergency clinics charge you more.”Bae Bok-ju, the head of an organization supporting women with disabilities, said disabled women as well as sexual violence victims also need easier access to the drug. “For many women with physical disabilities, oral contraceptives and morning-after pills are the most convenient birth control option,” she said. “Right now rape victims can get a prescription at emergency medical facilities, but it would be easier if they could just get it at pharmacies immediately.”Professor Lee said while getting a prescription can require more time, especially on national holidays and weekends, people can easily find information on pharmacies and medical clinics that run 365 days a year online. “I think such clinics and pharmacies are not hard to find in Korea as it’s one of the most wired countries in the world,” she said.  Yoon Jeong-won, a Seoul-based gynecologist, said although she agrees that the overuse of the drug can be harmful to a woman’s health, it is still better than the possible physical and emotional side effects from an abortion.“I think the most important part of this debate is the lack of sex education in this country,” she said. “Most Korean women don’t know that the LNG ECPs are not effective at all if taken more than twice during their menstrual cycle – the length of time between the first day of one period and the first day of the next. If every woman knows this, no one’s going to ‘overuse’ the drug.”By Claire Lee","having unprotected sex on saturday ,morning after pills without prescription ,visiting gynecologist on monday more ,after pills without prescription protesting ,weekends because emergency clinics charge","['Jeong Yu - jin', 'the Korea Herald', 'Jeong', 'korean', 'korean', 'the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety ’s', 'korean', 'south korean', 'Korea', 'Lee Im - soon', 'korean', 'North American', 'Yoo Rim', 'the Center for Health and Social Change', 'Jeong', 'Korea', 'the Korean Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology', 'Korea', 'korean', 'LNG', 'the World Health Organization', 'levonogestrel', 'who', 'the Korea Herald', 'woman ’s', 'Yeo Gyeong', 'Womenlink', 'Lee', 'Korea', 'Yoon Jeong - won', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'LNG', 'Claire Lee']",7,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.26215658  0.08355279

But he has also avoided taking a stand that will lay to rest his future in Korean politics.Such discussions have again sparked debate here as Ban will visit Korea on Wednesday. The U.N. chief said he has no plans to meet political officials during the visit, but his trip is being carefully scrutinized. ""U.N. secretary-generals have access to confidential information around the globe. If they become officials of a single government, they could abuse the information,"" Park said. The Seoul mayor, however, said the public's opinion and personal willingness will also play key roles in making the final decision.While most U.N. secretary-generals do retire from public life, some, like the late Trygve Halvdan Lie of Norway, have remained very active in domestic politics and even have held several ministerial posts.Meanwhile, a local poll carried out by Realmeter showed Park ranking in fourth place in terms of his approval rating for the next presidential election at 7.6 percent. In a separate survey conducted by Yonhap News Agency and KBS, a local broadcaster in February, Ban topped the list of potential presidential hopefuls by receiving 28.3 percent support.","presidential race after stepping down ,next presidential race after stepping ,the seoul mayor however said ,presidential race after stepping ,korea on wednesday the chief","['Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'United Nations', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Ban', 'U.N.', 'U.N.', 'Park', 'YTN Radio', 'korean', 'Ban', 'U.N.', 'korean', 'Ban', 'Korea', 'U.N.', 'U.N.', 'Park', 'Seoul', 'U.N.', 'Trygve Halvdan lie', 'Norway', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'KBS', 'Ban']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55229604  0.59078109

In a major foreign policy speech last month, he denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement as a ""total disaster"" that ""emptied our states of our manufacturing and our jobs.""Sen. Jeff Sessions , considered a key foreign policy adviser for Trump, has also strongly criticized the free trade agreement with South Korea, saying it brought no benefits to the U.S. and ended up increasing South Korea's exports to the country.The Super 301, which refers to Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974, expired in 1990, but former President Bill Clinton reactivated it three times in the 1990s. A future American president also has the right to revive the trade retaliation tool.The KOTRA report also said that a Trump administration could also threaten to scrap the Korea-U.S. free trade pact in an attempt to renegotiate the deal in a way that increases American interests.Walid Phares, a top foreign policy adviser to Trump, said in a recent interview with Yonhap News Agency and Yonhap News Television that Trump wants to ""go back to ground zero"" and is ready to renegotiate the landmark trade deal that has been in effect since 2012.It was the first time that a Trump campaign official has mentioned the possibility of negotiating the pact that has been viewed as an economic alliance between the two countries.Renegotiation attempts could set off a diplomatic row.","republican presidential candidate donald trump ,foreign policy adviser to trump ,foreign policy adviser for trump ,presidential candidate donald trump ,trump has also strongly criticized","['republican', 'Donald Trump', 'Trump', 'Congress', 'the Korea Trade - Investment Promotion Agency', 'Trump', 'the North American Free Trade Agreement', 'Jeff Sessions', 'Trump', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', ""South Korea 's"", 'Bill Clinton', 'american', 'KOTRA', 'Trump', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'american', 'Walid Phares', 'Trump', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'Yonhap News Television', 'Trump', 'Trump']",12,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51587373  0.65037394

America will face an increasing number of new transnational issues that require it to exercise power with others as much as over others,"" Nye said. Nye, creator of the popular ""soft power"" concept of preferring persuasion over force, pointed out that the real-estate mogul ""extols the virtues of unpredictability -- a potentially useful tactic when bargaining with enemies, but a disastrous approach to reassuring friends.""Trump has unnerved foreign countries, especially such allies as South Korea and Japan, as he has displayed deeply negative views of U.S. security commitments overseas, contending the U.S. should stop being the policeman of the world.Trump has said that the U.S. should be prepared to end protection of allies unless they pay more. He even suggested allowing South Korea and Japan to develop their own nuclear weapons for self-defense so as to reduce U.S. security burdens. ""Alliances not only reinforce US power. They also maintain geopolitical stability, for example, by slowing the dangerous proliferation of nuclear weapons. While U.S. presidents and defense secretaries have sometimes complained about its allies' low levels of defense spending, they have always understood that alliances are best viewed as stabilizing commitments like friendships, not real-estate transactions,"" Nye said.What sets the U.S. apart from the dominant great powers of the past is that ""American power is based on alliances rather than colonies,"" the professor said, citing British strategist Lawrence Freedman.""Contrary to claims that the 'Chinese century' is at hand, we have not entered a post-American world.

Ban, who served as foreign minister in the Roh Moo-hyun administration, has especially been courted by the ruling Saenuri Party, which has yet to identify a clear standout presidential candidate.Aside from a short trip to Japan, Ban is to stay here for six days, attending various forums and conferences and meeting with locals in the Gyeongsang provinces, a political stronghold for the Saenuri Party.U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  talks with South Korean Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn as they attend the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul, Turkey, Monday. Ban’s first stop is the 11th Jeju Forum for Peace and Prosperity, for which he will deliver a keynote speech at the opening ceremony Thursday. Upon his arrival on Wednesday, Ban will meet with members of an association of senior journalists, and is likely to field questions on his political ambitions after his U.N. tenure concludes by the end of this year.Ban had told Korean correspondents in New York that he would appreciate if they “help him bring a successful conclusion to his service as U.N. secretary-general.” He did not directly comment on whether he is considering a presidential bid.On Thursday afternoon, Ban will fly to Shima, Mie Prefecture in Japan, to participate in the G7 summit for two days.After another two days in Seoul with no official schedule, Ban is to visit various regions including North Gyeongsang Province, a destination widely speculated by the local media and watchers as being politically driven. His schedule in Andong and Gyeongju include a visit to UNESCO world cultural asset Hahoe Village and a U.N. nongovernmental organizations conference. A survey by pollster Realmeter earlier this month showed Ban leading ahead of opposition bigwigs Moon Jae-in and Ahn Cheol-soo with 38.9 percent to 34.4 percent and 21.4 percent, respectively.On Tuesday, People’s Party floor leader Rep. Park Jie-won fueled talks on Ban’s political motivation.“As the secretary-general is someone with immense thirst for power,  he can run as a presidential candidate if the pro-Parks  gather to enthrone him at the least,” he said, adding that one of Ban’s strengths is his political neutrality that led all rival parties would consider inviting him to join them.","presidential candidates in korea leading ,presidential bid on thursday afternoon ,presidential candidates in korea ,potential presidential candidates in korea ,considering presidential bid on thursday","['U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'South Korea', 'Ban', 'Korea ’s', 'Ban', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Japan', 'Ban', 'Gyeongsang', 'the Saenuri Party', 'U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'south korean', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Istanbul', 'Turkey', 'Ban ’s', 'Jeju Forum', 'Ban', 'U.N.', 'Ban', 'korean', 'New York', 'U.N.', 'Ban', 'Shima , Mie Prefecture', 'Japan', 'G7', 'Seoul', 'Ban', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'Andong and Gyeongju', 'UNESCO', 'Hahoe Village', 'U.N.', 'realmeter', 'Ban', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Ahn Cheol', 'People ’s Party', 'Park Jie - win', 'Ban ’s', 'Ban ’s']",16,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.73565793  0.72859889

The Saenuri Party’s former leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung and former Financial Minister Choi Kyung-hwan have applied for positions at the Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee, according to party sources Tuesday. Kim leads the faction that challenges loyalists to President Park Geun-hye and Choi is a key member of the pro-Park faction. YonhapAlthough the committee is relatively unpopular among lawmakers whose interest centers on domestic issues that can resonate with local voters, presumptive presidential candidates consider the committee a prime opportunity to gain experience on foreign affairs and national defense.“He has had strong interest in inter-Korea relations since he served as party chairman,” said an aide to the former leader on customary condition of anonymity. Choi’s staff said that the former finance minister needs leadership experience outside financial matters. The assignment of the parliamentary committee seats is determined by negotiation between party members. The parties agreed last week to ensure that the parliamentary committee should be set up no later than June 9, almost a week after the upcoming Assembly kicks off. For political bigwigs at opposition camps, the Strategy and Finance Committee is the most sought-after post as it deals with tax policies and budget review. The committee can also hold parliamentary hearings over state agencies related to economic policies and decide whether to pass contentious business bills.The Minjoo Party of Korea leader Kim Chong-in is reportedly considering serving in the Strategy and Finance Committee to achieve his goal of “economic democratization.” The former economics professor has long advocated this as a means to prevent economic dominance by family-owned conglomerates. Seats on the finance committee are also being sought by progressive Justice Party leader Rep. Sim Sang-jeung and moderate independent Rep. Yoo Seung-min -- former Saenuri lawmaker who defected from the party after a fallout with President Park over her veto of parliamentary law last June. Meanwhile, People’s Party leader Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo reportedly told his party that he hopes to work in the Education, Culture, Sports and Tourism Committee.

But the peaceful mourning was soon disturbed by the arrival of a group of men with their faces covered. They held up placards that read: “Not all men are potential criminals” and “Only those  commit crimes are bad.” Enraged by the placards and by some of the men who attempted to take post-it memos off the walls, scores of female participants asked the men to leave the memorial site. A brawl soon ensued, with them cursing at each other, until the police came to separate them with a police line.  Pro-men activists hold up placards reading, “Not all meat eaters are bad, but only animals committing crimes are bad” and “Hatred cannot be mourning. Let’s make prejudice-free Korea” outside exit 10 of Gangnam Station on Sunday. “We are just here to mourn the death of the girl, hoping that such a murder against women will not happen again. Why do the men behave like that?” said Kim Eun-ji, 25, who dropped by to leave a tribute on her way to a picnic. “I am sick of hearing that women should be careful at night and should not wear short skirts. Why don’t men know that they can also be safe when women are safe?” A makeshift memorial outside exit 10 of Gangnam Station On May 17, a man, only identified by his surname Kim, stabbed a woman to death at a public bathroom near Gangnam Station. The man, who was a stranger to the victim, said that he had committed the crime because he had been “belittled” by women many times in the past. While police defined the case as an “accidental crime” committed by an individual who is mentally ill, thousands of citizens, mostly young women in their 20s and 30s, flocked to the makeshift memorial site to express their fear and anger toward what they see as a hate crime against women. Post-it memos outside exit 10 of Gangnam Station Exit 10 of Gangnam Station soon turned into an outdoor public forum to discuss gender equality and misogyny in Korean society. The majority of the mourners called for better safety for women and an end to gender-based discrimination. But some men expressed discomfort about being branded as “potential criminal."" “I don’t know why women keep talking about misogyny here. The criminal is an animal. An animal does not hunt animals that are stronger than them either,” said a 26-year-old student, who wished to remain anonymous. “People here are obsessed and politicizing the case. Women can kill men, too. It is not right to assume all men are criminals.”Han Ella, one of the volunteers who has been standing watch over the memorial site since Thursday, said that men do not understand discrimination against women, because they are too used to their privileges as men.“They are not happy because women finally spoke up and started talking about discrimination against us. We hate men despising women. We don’t hate all men. Fighting against misogyny is a matter of our survival,” she said. Mourners hold up placards opposing hate crime agasint women outside exit 10 of Gangnam Station on Sunday. Hong Sung-hee, 23, who majors in theater at a university, said that some radical male protestors’ behavior not only saddened but also scared her. “I don’t know how I feel about men anymore. I feel like they will never understand what women go through in society. Why do they have to come here to disparage the movement and incite fear?” she said. “As a person who feels discriminated and sexually harassed in everyday life, I am relieved that I am not the only one feeling sick of the male-dominant society.”A foreign woman prays in front of post-it memos outside exit 10 of Gangnam Station on Sunday. The murder of the young girl has become a watershed moment in society, as it has prompted Korean women to publicly address the subject of misogyny and systematic discrimination against women, experts said. Lee Na-young, a sociology professor at Chungang University, pointed out that misogyny is not a new phenomenon. “It has always existed due to structural discrimination in the society,” she said. “But the new generation of women, who have felt ignored, harassed and insulted, are finally coming forward to speak up about the unfair treatment.”South Korea has a high level of gender inequality -- economically, socially and politically -- ranking 115 out of 145 nations, according to the World Economic Forum last year.“Some extreme behavior by men to deny the misogynist nature of the crime could be part of their attempt to defend the discriminative structure in the society. They are perhaps against distributing privilege to women.”A man holds up a placard reading ""Not all meat eaters are bad, but only those commit crimes are bad"" outside exit 10 of Gangnam Station on Sunday The explicit emergence of modern-day misogyny began about a decade ago, when a new term “Doeonjangnyeo”  started to be widely used on an online platform in 2006. A website Ilbe, infamously known for its right-wing political views, was launched in 2010 and its members started to publicly disparage women online using terms such as “Kimchinyeo” and “Samilhan.” “Kimchinyeo” refers to materialistic Korean women economically dependent on men, while “Samilhan” means that women should be beaten by men at least once every three days.In response to Ilbe members’ misogynist acts, a group of women started a website called “Megalia” in 2015 to show their hatred toward men, adding to tensions between the radical anti-women and anti-men communities. According to a survey on 300 women by the Korea Women’s Development Institute, 83 percent of them said that they have seen such derogatory terms to describe women being widely used online. Nearly 60 percent of them expected the misogynist trend to be aggravated in the coming years. Experts pointed out that the reasons behind the seemingly growing misogyny are the rapidly shifting gender roles, social discontent among young men who are struggling economically and the anonymity offered online.“I think that socio-economic inequality in Korean society is a source of the hatred,” said Park Jin-kyong, a director of the Gender Research Institute. “It seems that some men, who feel marginalized, look for someone to blame for failing to get a job or to get married, for example, amid economic difficulties.”“Their collective anger turns toward women, which is an easy target, cementing their own logic.” Lee Soo-yeon, a researcher from the Korea Women’s Development Institute, said that some men feel insecure about escalating competition for limited resources and jobs in what used to be a male-dominant, patriarchal society. “At home and work, they are at risk of losing a job, while they are not able to support a family without women’s help,” she said. “The reality changes, but they appear to be slower at adapting to the rise in women’s economic, social status.”“Online platforms also contribute to misogyny because of the anonymity ,” she said. “Netizens  started to more radically express hatred on grounds of gender, political ideology and region.” The sex-ratio imbalance at birth is also cited as one of the factors intensifying insecurity among some men. Due to the traditional preference for sons in the 1970s and 1980s, there 1.14 males born for every female, according to the latest census in 2010. But Kim Dong-guen, a head of pro-man rights group NGO for Gender Equality, said that the misogyny fundamentally resulted from reverse discrimination against men in society. “Korean men suffer from reverse discrimination due to policies and institutions favoring women in college admissions and employment,” he said. “Women are biologically designed to give birth and men appreciate it, but that should not mean women can legally take away opportunities from men.”“Korean men in their 20s and 30s have not enjoyed any power or privilege as the older generation, but our duty and responsibility as a breadwinner has not changed.”  A woman shares her stories of living in fear as a girl in Korean soceity outside exit 10 of Gangnam Station on Sunday. As dusk gathered, a peaceful dialogue began among the mourners over gender discrimination and misogyny. Stories of rape, attacks and discriminations were shared, often responded by applause of support.Most of the mourners at the scene frowned upon the extreme groups of men and women slamming each other based on gender. They said in unison that the death of the young girl should pave the way for the public discourse to tackle the discrimination and violence against women. Kim Seong-heon, a 22-year-old university student, said that he was able to learn how much fear and discrimination Korean women have to live with at the memorial site. “I looked back on myself to see whether my remarks have ever hurt women. I was sad to see a post-it message saying that she was sad to be born as a woman,” he said, holing up a placard “As a human being, I feel shame and anger.” Kim Da-young, a 27-year-old officer worker, said that she has no reason to hate men. “I am afraid to take a taxi at night. I am scared when I am alone with a man in an elevator. We are here to talk about the prevailing fear among women in the society,” Kim said. “My brother and boyfriend are all men. I don’t see them as potential criminals. I just hope that the tragic death can shed light on what women in Korea have to bear at home and work every day.”""This is not a war between men and women. I believe that this is an opportunity for both men and women to openly talk about the issue and seek answers together.”By Ock Hyun-ju","the mourners over gender discrimination ,hate all men fighting against ,mourn the death of 23 ,station on sunday the murder ,woman to death at public","['Gangnam Station', 'Korea', 'Kim Eun - ji', 'Kim', 'Gangnam Station', 'Gangnam Station', 'korean', 'Ella', 'Hong Sung - hee', 'korean', 'Lee Na - young', 'Chungang University', 'Korea', 'the World Economic Forum', 'Ilbe', 'korean', 'Ilbe', 'Megalia', 'the Korea Women ’s Development Institute', 'korean', 'Park Jin - kyong', 'the Gender Research Institute', 'Lee Soo - yeon', 'the Korea Women ’s Development Institute', 'netizen', 'Kim Dong - guen', 'Gender Equality', 'korean', 'korean', 'Kim Seong - heon', 'korean', 'Kim Da - young', 'Kim', 'Korea', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.30485347  0.06353585

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon could run in South Korea's presidential race under the right conditions if he receives the support of conservatives.""Ban has considerable political ambitions, and if the pro-Park Geun-hye faction in the ruling Saenuri Party rallies around him, he could run for president,"" the three-term lawmaker who was again elected in the April 13 polls said during an interview held with SBS Radio, a local broadcaster.The veteran lawmaker then said it is much more likely that Ban will opt to champion Saenuri's cause, since that party is struggling to cope with last month's election defeat.""Saenuri has numerous problems right now, while the opposition is showing much more stability than previously thought,"" the floor leader said.He claimed that in the past Ban had considered both the ruling and opposition parties as potential options to advance his political career.Debates have heated up in the country amid speculation that the former South Korean foreign minister will make a bid for presidency in the 2017 race. Ban has declined to comment on issues related with local politics, adding he will instead focus on his duty as the U.N. chief. But he has also avoided taking a stand that will lay to rest his future in South Korean politics.Such discussions have again sparked debate here as Ban will visit South Korea on Thursday. The U.N. chief said he has no plan to meet political officials during the visit, but his trip is being carefully scrutinized. In particular, his planned visit to North Gyeongsang Province has triggered interest because the region is the bastion of power for the conservative Saenuri Party.In a survey conducted by Yonhap News Agency and KBS, a local broadcaster in February, Ban topped the list of potential presidents of South Korea by receiving 28.3 percent support, trailed by Moon Jae-in, a former leader of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea, which posted 17.9 percent.

And there has been, I think, a continued effort on their part not only to develop nuclear weapons, but also deliver them in ways that are reckless and provocative,"" Obama said.""The international community has shunned them for their behavior, but so far they haven't changed their behavior the way they need to,"" he said. Pyongyang's record of nuclear proliferation is also a cause for concern, Obama said. ""North Korea is the worst example but we also have other parts of the world where you'll still see the development of new nuclear technologies that could be very dangerous,"" he said. Obama said that resources for nuclear development should be diverted into such areas as food, health care and education.Obama will be the first sitting U.S. president to visit Hiroshima since the U.S. dropped an atomic bomb there at the end of World War II. White House officials said Obama will use the visit to highlight his commitment to a world without nuclear weapons and to honor the memory of all innocents who were lost during the war.The planned visit, however, raised concern that it could dilute Japan's wartime aggression by making the country look like a victim, even though U.S. officials said the visit shouldn't be interpreted as an apology and Obama won't revisit the decision to use the atomic bomb.When asked during the interview if he's going to offer an apology, Obama flatly said, ""No.""""I think that it's important to recognize that in the midst of war, leaders make all kinds of decisions. It's the job of historians to ask questions and examine them,"" he said.Instead, Obama said he will emphasize ""how we can move forward.""""My purpose is not to simply revisit the past, but to affirm that innocent people die in a war, on all sides, that we should do everything we can to try to promote peace and dialogue around the world, that we should continue to strive for a world without nuclear weapons.

The ceremony came days after the leaders had gathered to commemorate the May 18 democratic uprising and amid simmering political rivalry among parties entering the next parliamentary term.It was The Minjoo Party of Korea, the home camp of the deceased liberal president, which took a leading role in the day’s event, while the ruling conservative Saenuri Party and the runner-up opposition People’s Party paid their respects as guests.“Let us look back on whether we are abiding by the will of the two former presidents who fought their way till the end to defend democracy,” said the Minjoo’s senior advisor Kim Won-ki, in his memorial address.The former parliamentary speaker was referring to late Kim Dae-jung and Roh, the two presidents classified as being progressive in South Korea’s political history.Political leaders sing “March for Our Beloved” during a memorial ceremony for late President Roh Moo-hyun at Bongha Village in Gimhae, South Gyeongsang Province, Monday. From right, Saenuri Party floor leader Chung Jin-suk; The Minjoo Party’s interim chief Kim Chong-in; People’s Party co-chiefs Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo and Rep. Chun Jung-bae; and Justice Party chairwoman Rep. Sim Sang-jeung. Chung was seen not singling along to the controversial song that is opposed by conservatives. The memorial ceremony was held at Bongha Village in Gimhae, South Gyeongsang Province, where Roh was born in 1946 and where he ended his life in 2009.Roh, South Korea’s 16th president in 2003-2008, jumped off a mountain cliff on May 23 that year, amid an intensive prosecutorial probe on corruption charges involving his family members.Attending the event were key members of the main opposition Minjoo Party, including emergency council chief Kim Chong-in, former party chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in and key lawmakers including former Prime Minister Rep. Lee Hae-chan.The Saenuri was represented by its floor leader Chung Jin-suk and floor spokesperson Min Kyung-wook. The People’s Party co-chiefs Reps. Ahn Cheol-soo and Chun Jung-bae, along with floor leader Rep. Park Jie-won, attended as well.Cheong Wa Dae sent the senior presidential secretary for political affairs, Hyun Ki-hwan, to offer condolences, speaking for President Park Geun-hye.The appearance of ranking Saenuri officials has often triggered a backlash from the residents of Bongha, as well as loyalists to Roh, who hold the conservative political powers responsible for his suicide.“You abused your power to drive a former president to his death, yet you fail to regret it,” Roh’s son Kun-ho had blasted then-Saenuri chief Rep. Kim Moo-sung at last year’s memorial event.But this year, junior Roh merely expressed his thanks to the attendees.This pacifist turn largely reflected the growing calls from within the much-divided opposition camp to achieve unity.“I expect that the Minjoo will greet the guests in a mature manner ,” said floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho in a radio interview earlier in the morning.Even after his abrupt death, Roh remained a contentious figure in the opposition bloc.His affiliation with the Gyeongsang region, together with his disapproval of regionalism, led to conflicts with the party’s conventional powers, most of them based in the Jeolla area.It was the non-Roh group that broke away late last year and established the new opposition People’s Party with Rep. Ahn. Their claim was that the then leadership of Moon Jae-in, still called a Roh loyalist, monopolized power and neglected the opposition party’s longtime stronghold of the Gwangju and Jeolla cluster, dubbed the Honam region.The Minjoo-turned-People’s Party members, especially party leader Ahn, faced bitter remarks from Roh supporters in Bongha as he arrived at the memorial, with them calling the divide a “betrayal.”While the Saenuri whip Chung and Blue House official Hyun refrained from speaking at the ceremony, the ruling party focused on the concept of unity.“We pay our respects to late President Roh who struggled to overcome regionalism and achieve unity in politics,” the party said through a statement earlier in the day.“The imminent 20th National Assembly should remember his deeds and work only for the sake of the people and nation.”By Bae Hyun-jung","memorial ceremony for late president ,representatives gathered monday to commemorate ,seventh anniversary of former president ,ceremony for late president ,ceremony for late president roh","['Roh Moo - hyun', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Saenuri Party', 'People ’s Party', 'Minjoo', 'Kim Won - ki', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'Roh', 'South Korea ’s', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Bongha Village', 'Gimhae', 'South Gyeongsang Province', 'Saenuri Party', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'the Minjoo Party ’s', 'Kim Chong - in', 'People ’s Party', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Chun Jung - bae', 'Justice Party', 'Sim Sang - jeung', 'Chung', 'Bongha Village', 'Gimhae', 'South Gyeongsang Province', 'Roh', 'South Korea ’s 16th', 'Minjoo Party', 'Kim Chong - in', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Lee Hae - chan', 'Saenuri', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'Min Kyung - wook', 'the People ’s Party', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Chun Jung - bae', 'Park Jie - won', 'Cheong', 'Dae', 'Hyun Ki - hwan', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Saenuri', 'Bongha', 'Roh', 'Kun - ho', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Roh', 'Minjoo', 'Woo Sang - ho', 'Roh', 'Gyeongsang', 'People ’s Party', 'Ahn', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Roh', 'Jeolla', 'Honam', 'Minjoo', 'People ’s Party', 'Ahn', 'Roh', 'Bongha', 'Saenuri', 'Chung', 'Blue House', 'Hyun', 'Roh', 'National Assembly', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37722388  0.56274408

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Thursday that Ban's upcoming visit to South Korea is no political move, rejecting speculation the trip might be tied to his presidential ambitions.Ban's office announced last week that he will visit South Korea on two occasions beginning May 25 for a series of international conferences. Earlier this week, the office added two new events to Ban's itinerary, a visit to a folk village and a speech near Seoul, fueling speculation about his political future.Ban's visit to South Korea draws keen attention due to the possibility of his running for president.On Thursday, U.N. Under Secretary-General Kim Won-soo, one of Ban's closest confidants, rejected such speculation, saying that the speech at the Rotary International Convention was set up at the last minute due to the complexity of Ban's schedule and the visit to the Hahoe folk village is not unusual as the U.N. chief often makes visits to cultural sites.Kim spoke in a meeting with South Korean correspondents.Ban's visit, which will be his first in about a year, comes after South Korea's ruling Saenuri Party suffered a crushing defeat in last month's parliamentary elections amid speculation it could face a similar fate in next year's presidential election.Ban, whose second five-year term as U.N. chief ends late this year, has long been talked about as a potential candidate for next year's election.

On May 27, Obama will become the first sitting U.S. president to visit Hiroshima since it was hit by an American nuclear bomb in 1945. Along with a second nuclear bombing on Nagasaki, these attacks forced Japan to accept unconditional surrender that hastened the end of World War II. U.S. officials have said that Obama would not make an apology for the nuclear attacks during the historic visit to Hiroshima.  However, concerns persist among Japan's neighbors, which have suffered Japan's wartime atrocities, that the visit by Obama to Hiroshima could allow Japan to portray itself as a victim of the war. ""We hope that, by arranging other countries' leaders to visit Hiroshima, Japan will show the world that it will never repeat the path of militarism which has inflicted grave suffering on its own people and the people of its Asian neighbors,"" China's foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei told reporters. ""The important lesson we have learned from the war is that we should take history as a mirror, prevent the war from happening again, and firmly uphold the post-war international order,"" Hong said. The U.S. atomic bombing on Hiroshima killed 140,000 people and the second bomb dropped on Nagasaki killed 70,000 people.  Next week's visit by Obama to Hiroshima, part of his May 21-28 Asian trip, is also likely to focus attention on North Korea, which has vowed to advance its nuclear weapons program despite international sanctions.","sitting president to visit hiroshima ,atomic bombing on hiroshima killed ,president to visit hiroshima since ,bombing on hiroshima killed 140 ,by obama to hiroshima","['Japan', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'japanese', 'Hiroshima', 'China', 'Obama', 'U.S.', 'Hiroshima', 'american', 'Nagasaki', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'Hiroshima', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Hiroshima', 'Japan', 'Hiroshima', 'Japan', 'asian', 'China', 'Hong Lei', 'Hong', 'U.S.', 'Hiroshima', 'Nagasaki', 'Hiroshima', 'asian', 'North Korea']",11,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48884615  0.47772479

Yoo Seong-min consoles former fellow member Rep. Kim Eul-dong as she cries during their conversation at the National Assembly on Thursday. Yoo’s move to return to the party after leaving upon pressure from the rival faction is part of the burgeoning feud in the ruling party. “I will summon a meeting of senior party members tomorrow and give them an open hearing,” Chung told reporters Thursday morning in his constituency of Gongju, South Chungcheong Province.When asked whether he would succumb to pressure and readjust the composition of the emergency leadership council to include more pro-Park members, he withheld his answer.The Saenuri whip then returned to Yeouido and met with opposition counterparts, Reps. Woo Sang-ho of The Minjoo Party of Korea and Park Jie-won of the People’s Party, to negotiate concerning key agenda items including the allotment of parliamentary committee chairmanships in the upcoming legislature.Chung, who is now effectively representing the party in the absence of official leadership, thereby ended his brief daylong escape from party affairs. After attending a May 18 Gwangju Uprising memorial ceremony on Wednesday, he returned to his constituency, refusing to tend to party affairs.His quick return to the post also came amid escalating speculation that the party may end up splitting. It gained further momentum as Speaker Chung Ui-hwa, whose term ends with the outgoing 19th National Assembly, hinted at creating a new political party.“It could be a political consulting organization or a party,” the speaker told reporters Thursday, elaborating a little on the political entity he had earlier said he would establish.“I will ponder on my path in the next few months and make a decision by October or so.”The veteran five-term lawmaker had earlier said that he would not return to his party after his term as speaker, disapproving of the factional feud in his home camp.“Should the junior politicians do a good job in leading the country, I will remain as adviser, but if not, I may have to make a decision ,” he said.On Tuesday, Saenuri failed to hold two key meetings due to a lack of quorum, and failed to establish an emergency panel and innovation committee to steer the party until an official leadership is formed as early as next month.It was mostly those close to the president who denounced Chung’s temporary leadership as unilaterally excluding the pro-Park faction and blamed him for a lack of communication. Some even demanded Chung resign from his post.“This is not about  winning or losing,” Chung said Thursday, before resuming his duties.“Our politics should be based on beliefs and give trust to people, instead of clinging to the factional frame, and the president is no exception .”Since its crushing defeat in the April 13 general election, the conservative camp has been struggling to elect a new leadership that can regain support of the public. Through the race, the party not only lost its former parliamentary majority, but also gave away several of its symbolic stronghold constituencies -- results largely attributed to the infighting of the pro-Park and non-Park groups.“I neither belong to any faction, nor have significant power within the political circles,” Chung said.“But I received a substantial number of votes, which I take as a sign that the party wanted someone who could maintain neutrality and work in balance, which is exactly what I am striving to do.”One of the reasons the legitimately elected floor leader finds himself powerless against the pro-Park protest, according to observers, is the absence of a pivotal figure who can unite the non-Park members.Previously, the role was played by former party chief Rep. Kim Moo-sung, who stepped down from his post after the party’s election defeat and has remained out of the spotlight ever since. Kim, when approached by reporters on his way to attend the general meeting Thursday, was mum on the party’s ongoing strife.Other senior non-Park members either defected prior to the election after being excluded from nominations or lost in the election. The list includes Rep. Yoo Seong-min, who ran as an independent candidate, and Rep. Chin Young who joined the Minjoo Party.By Bae Hyun-jung","she cries during their conversation ,the president herself for egging ,feud in the ruling party ,uprising memorial ceremony on wednesday ,president who denounced chung temporary","['Saenuri Party ’s', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'Chung', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Saenuri Party', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Kim Eul - dong', 'the National Assembly', 'Chung', 'Gongju', 'South Chungcheong Province', 'Saenuri', 'Yeouido', 'Woo Sang - ho', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Park Jie - won', 'the People ’s Party', 'Chung', 'Chung Ui - hwa', 'National Assembly', 'Saenuri', 'Chung ’s', 'Chung', 'Chung', 'non - park', 'Chung', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Kim', 'non - park', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Chin Young', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.05131652  0.41689491

Prosecutors said his status can change to that of a suspect in the course of the probe if necessary.Some other former and current foreign executives in the summons list include John Lee, who headed the company from 2005 to 2010 and Gaurav Jain, who succeeded Lee until 2012. Lee, the incumbent CEO of Google Korea, led the Korean unit of Oxy when the sales of the sterilizer product was at its peak.Prosecutors said they will soon place a travel ban on the Korean-American.Jain is suspected of orchestrating the fabrication of reports unfavorable to the company when he was the chief executive, according to prosecutors. He is known to be currently in Singapore.Prosecutors said they are not yet at the stage to investigate the company's headquarters in London.The humidifier disinfectant case, one of the worst scandals involving a consumer product using chemicals, came to light after four pregnant women died of lung problems from unknown causes in 2011.

The government's latest move to expand communications with the parties came as the ruling Saenuri Party suffered a defeat in the April 13 polls and failed to secure a majority in the 300-seat National Assembly. Administration critics have claimed that Park's reluctance to listen to various voices from the public led to the defeat in the elections.

Policy officials from the ruling Saenuri Party, as well as the opposition Minjoo Party and the People's Party, will also join the gathering.The kickoff of the first meeting between government-political party offices remained unclear following the clash over the status of the song ""March for the Beloved"" at the ceremony to commemorate the May 18 democracy movement.Since 1997, the uprising's signature song had been officially sung by attendees of the national ceremony every year, but the government of former President Lee Myung-bak decided in 2009 to have a choir perform the song. Parliamentary sources, meanwhile, said the government and parties agreed to hold the meeting as planned to discuss ways to prevent the slowing down of the national economy.The government and the ruling party are expected to focus on rolling out policies on adding flexibility to the local labor market, while the opposition parties are set to demand fundamental solutions to the sluggish economy.","meeting later this week political ,meeting slated for friday ,week political sources said thursday ,the meeting slated for friday ,thursday where they will discuss","['korean', 'Park Geun', 'National Assembly', 'Saenuri Party', 'National Assembly', 'Park', 'Yoo Il - ho', 'Saenuri Party', 'Minjoo Party', ""the People 's Party"", 'Lee Myung - bak']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50278282  0.36511761

Since then, she has not attended the event for various reasons, such as a meeting with Iranian vice president that had coincided Wednesday’s ceremony.The move has been widely seen as a gesture to avoid political conflict. Since its commemorative song “March for our Beloved” was made unofficial in 2009, the ceremony has been at the center of ideological debate.But from the perspective of former foreign correspondents, who were invited to this year’s ceremony in respect for their coverage of the bloodied uprising 36 years ago, Park is the only leader who can resolve the deadlock.“I don’t understand why she is holding back,” said Bradley Martin, who covered the May 18 uprising as a reporter for the Baltimore Sun. “All she has to say is that this song is not about North Korea and the beloved refer to the people of our country and people of our city,” he said in a group interview with The Korea Herald.Right-wing activists and politicians have claimed that the song has an element of being pro-North, claiming the word “beloved” refers to Pyongyang’s late leader Kim Il-sung. The song was written in 1982 to honor the victims of the pro-democracy movement and has been often used during civic demonstrations. From left: Bradley Martin, Donald Kirk, Tim Shorrock and Norman Thorpe Tim Shorrock, who was a reporter for the Journal of Commerce, said that the president should exercise her leadership to embrace the dissenters. “The president can take steps to heal wounds and to push ahead even though you disagree,” said the 64-year-old reporter.On recent reports that former president Chun Doo-hwan denied responsibility for ordering the Army to shoot at the protesters, the veteran reporters said that his claim was not consistent with what they saw in Gwangju. “The shooting went off for several days. But we have never heard of any punishment for anyone. So now if he didn’t order, why didn’t he punish them?” said Martin. “Let’s put it stronger, he is a monster and a fool,” the 73-year-old reporter said. Asked if Chun should make an official apologize for the victims of the families, the reporters said that it was “too late.” Donald Kirk, who was with the Chicago Tribune, said that the man’s gesture would not “create much of an impression” and that the victims wouldn’t take it as a sincere apology.The reporters agreed that the May 18 uprising left a significant impact on the nation’s democratic development as the condemnation against the violent crackdown forced Chung to yield to peaceful transition toward democracy in 1987. “The government couldn’t be trusted to avoid the use of force so the U.S., unlike in 1980, in 1987, told them to keep the Army out of this. There are very important influences from Gwangju that help the transition in 1987,” said Norman Thorpe, a former reporter for the Asian Wall Street Journal.By Yeo Jun-suk","2013 soon after her inauguration ,protesters the veteran reporters ,president that had coincided wednesday ,unofficial in 2009 the ceremony ,bloodied uprising 36 years ago","['Park Geun', 'iranian', 'Park', 'Bradley Martin', 'the Baltimore Sun', 'North Korea', 'the Korea Herald', 'pro - north', 'Pyongyang', 'Kim Il - sung', 'Bradley Martin', 'Donald Kirk', 'Tim Shorrock', 'Norman Thorpe Tim Shorrock', 'the Journal of Commerce', 'Chun Doo - hwan', 'Army', 'Martin', 'Chun', 'Donald Kirk', 'the Chicago Tribune', 'Chung', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'Norman Thorpe', 'the Asian Wall Street Journal', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65508687  0.65295112

Chun Doo-hwan, who took power a year after the assassination of then-President Park Chung-hee, father of President Park Geun-hye. Hundreds of civilians died as Chun ordered the most violent crackdown in the nation’s modern history.The 20-minute ceremony closed with the much-anticipated song “March of Our Beloved,” belted out by about 30 members of a choir on stage.Most participants sang the song, some waving the flag of South Korea, except for several, including Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, whose lips remained sealed throughout the voluntary sing-along.Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn  and political leaders attend a ceremony commemorating the 36th anniversary of the May 18 Uprising at the May 18th National Cemetery in Gwangju on Wednesday. Park Hae-mook/The Korea HeraldThe ceremony marked the ongoing political division some three decades since the nation introduced democracy, with the rivaling groups fighting until the last minute over whether to have the controversial song reintroduced as a ceremonial tune. “We have to take the May 18 democratic uprising as an opportunity to unite the country,” said Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-an in his speech on behalf of President Park, who has not attended the annual ceremony since her first visit in 2013.  Former presidents have also often sent prime ministers in their place. Her conservative predecessor Lee Myung-bak had come to the event in his first year in office. It was also Lee who decided the song should be sang by a choir in 2009. Prior to that, the signature song had involved all participants singing along since 1997. The conservative governments have said the song should be left outside of official protocol, citing persistent controversy over the song that the conservatives claim is pro-North. The liberals have contended that the song is a symbol of democracy and the government’s move is aimed to undermine the democratic legacy.Among those that sang along was Saenuri Party’s embattled floor leader Chung Jin-suk, whose nomination as interim chairman was thwarted by intensified factional feud within the party the day before.Tension at the site reached a high when Park Sung-chun, the head of Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affair, the organizer of the event, was blocked from entering the event. The former army general had angered Gwangju residents with his decision not to change current rules on the song.“It is very unfortunate,” Park told reporters after being blocked by the angered activists and victims’ family. “Whether to designate the song as an official anthem and whether to mandate sing-along in public space is not a choice made by individuals. It need the people’s consensus over the song,” he said. The attending opposition bigwigs, including former Minjoo Party leader Rep. Moon Jae-in, the Minjoo Party’s interim chief Kim Chong-in and People’s Party chairman Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, spared no expenses at criticizing the government’s stance. “I don’t understand the government’s rationale on banning the sing-along. … We will name the song as an official anthem ,” said Moon. “We believe today’s ceremony was organized sloppily by the government,” he said. Rep. Park Jie-won, floor leader of the People’s Party said the party will continue to push the legislation to have the song sung by all participants at the ceremony and to work with the Minjoo Party to have the minister of patriots and veterans affairs resign.By Yeo Jun-suk","18th national cemetery on wednesday ,political leaders attend ceremony commemorating ,cemetery on wednesday as political ,power year after the assassination ,cemetery in gwangju on wednesday","['Chun Doo - hwan', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Chun', 'South Korea', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Park Hae - mook', 'Korea', 'HeraldThe', 'Hwang Kyo', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Lee', 'pro - north', 'Saenuri Party ’s', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'Park Sung - chun', 'Ministry of Patriots', 'Veterans Affair', 'Minjoo Party', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the Minjoo Party ’s', 'Kim Chong - in', 'People ’s Party', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Moon', 'Park Jie - won', 'the People ’s Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.11177621  0.40920568

Of the total 221 victims officially confirmed by the government, 28 used Homeplus’ product, with 12 deaths, the prosecution said.Homeplus sold its toxic humidifier disinfectant that contained PHMG as private brand goods from 2006 to 2011. It manufactured the product from an original equipment manufacturer after it saw the sales growth of Oxy’s humidifier disinfectant, it said. The prosecution looked into whether Homeplus followed the right product manufacturing manual and when customer complaints started to come in over the product use. Civic groups urge the government to protect people from unsafe chemical products and to take fundamental measures over the humidifier disinfectant tragedy, at Gwanghwamun, Seoul, Tuesday. YonhapThe prosecution summoned the head of the original equipment manufacturer surnamed Kim on Monday. Kim was in charge of producing the problematic product for both Homeplus and Lotte Mart. Kim’s company was later found to have mainly produced shoe polishes. Amid the probe that is widening to local distributors, Justice Minister Kim Hyun-woong said Tuesday that he would track back the history of the government’s overall measures over disinfectant control and monitoring.“It is necessary to reveal who is ultimately responsible for the case. It can be said that  is currently conducting the work of checking all the factors ,” said Kim in the National Assembly’s meeting. The products were made and sold since 2001.Meanwhile, the victims’ families and civic groups accused law firm Kim & Chang of attempting to cover up Oxy Reckitt Benckiser’s responsibility by allegedly suggesting that the two universities manipulate the product-toxicity test. Kim & Chang, one of the largest law firms in Korea, has come under fire after a Seoul National University professor, who was arrested for manipulating the toxicity test of Oxy’s product, claimed that the law firm interfered in the test. Kim & Chang has been Oxy RB’s legal representative August 2011. Kim & Chang has refuted this claim, saying that it never interfered with any experiment. The prosecution raided Seoul National University and Hoseo University earlier this month on suspicions that their professors had allegedly fabricated test results in return for money. The victims claimed that the law firm was behind it.“Kim & Chang demanded the two professors to make unreasonable conditions for the experiment and to stop the test when toxicity was confirmed. It also coaxed the victims to make deals with the company by submitting the fabricated test results to the court,” said Choi Ye-Yong, head of the Asian Citizen’s Center for Environment and Health. Since the case broke out, 80 percent of victims who filed a suit against Oxy have made agreements with the company, before the prosecutorial probe was launched, he added.Under the negotiation, Oxy reportedly said it agrees to provide compensation but this does not mean that the company admits its fault. The victims were also asked not to file civil or criminal lawsuits in the future.

If he wants to have leverage over China, how can he be talking about taking troops out of Japan and Korea?"" King said on CBS's ""Face the Nation.""""Does he know that it costs more to take the troops out than to leave them there? And does he realize that that would just weaken our leverage against China?"" the congressman said.Trump has long called for allies to pay more for U.S. defense support, claiming that the U.S. is protecting wealthy nations in exchange for little. He has even called for Seoul to shoulder 100 percent of the costs for American troop presence, suggesting he could withdraw troops unless it agrees to pay more.Walid Phares, a top foreign policy adviser to Trump, said in an interview with Yonhap News Agency that it's true Trump wants Seoul to pay more, but his remarks made as a candidate are an expression of principles and details have yet to be worked out. King also expressed concern about Trump's policy on Russia.""I'm very concerned about this romance he seems to have with Putin,"" the congressman said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office said they had found the Korea Fair Trade Commission’s chemicals labeling report which showed that the company – now formally renamed Reckitt Benckiser Korea -- had received material safety data sheets  on PHMG from ingredient providers, which had specified that PHMG should not be eaten or inhaled by humans. The exact date of when the MSDS was exchanged remains undisclosed.The MSDS is a mandatory document submitted when trading chemicals. Hence, this indicates that the company had known of the toxic chemical, despite Oxy’s claim that it was not aware of the toxicity of PHMG, prosecutors said.Civic activists surround the building of Oxy Reckitt Benckiser Korea’s building in Yeouido in a protest over the humidifier sterilizer case on Monday. YonhapThe KFTC report was made in August 2012 when the agency launched a separate probe into Oxy’s alleged false indication of ingredients. The agency later fined the company 52 million won .The MSDS information was shared in every step of the chemical trading from PHMG manufacturer SK Chemicals to humidifier disinfectant manufacturer Oxy, the KFTC said. Prosecution sources also said that Oxy allegedly destroyed all the MSDS from 2001 to 2011, ahead of the prosecutorial probe launched earlier this year. Meanwhile, the prosecution on Monday summoned an original equipment manufacturer head surnamed Kim, who manufactured disinfectants that Lotte Mart and Homeplus sold as their private brand goods. Of the total official 221 victims, 41 used Lotte Mart’s product, with 16 deaths, and 28 used Homeplus’s product, with 12 deaths. Lotte Mart and Homeplus sold the humidifier disinfectants made of PHMG from 2006 and 2004, respectively, until August 2011 when the government announced the toxicity of the humidifier disinfectant. The prosecution suspects that Lotte Mart and Homeplus copied the manufacturing manual of Oxy, unlike Oxy which developed and tested the product on its own. It has banned the overseas travel of former Lotte Mart head Lee Chul-woo and former Homeplus head Lee Seung-han. Meanwhile, the victims and their families launched a group compensation lawsuit on Monday against the central government, disinfectant manufacturers and distributors. Minbyun, a group of liberal lawyers who are supporting the lawsuit, said 436 people filed the lawsuit to seek 11 billion won of compensation against the government and 22 companies, including Oxy, SK Chemicals and Cefu. Of the plaintiffs, 235 are the actual victims, with 51 dead. Of those victims, 63 are underage and five were killed, Minbyun said. The group said it will seek 50 million won for each dead victim, 30 million won each for those who suffers lung damage, and 10 million for each family member of the victims for mental damage. “The Constitution Article 36 stipulates that the health of all citizens should be protected by the state. The country should have taken clear measures to protect the public,” said lawyer Choi Jae-hong, who leads the group lawsuit. “The prosecution and the Environment Ministry have kept the stance that they are uncertain of their legal accountability, citing the lack of regulations in the past. However, it is likely that the country has compensation responsibility as it did not require the companies to conduct the inhalation-toxicity test, negligently allowing the sales of the problematic products.”By Lee Hyun-jeong","ingredients the agency later fined ,group compensation lawsuit on monday ,humidifier disinfectant the prosecution suspects ,agency later fined the company ,sterilizer case on monday yonhapthe","['Oxy Reckitt Benckiser', 'Seoul Central District Prosecutors ’ Office', 'the Korea Fair Trade Commission ’s', 'Reckitt Benckiser Korea', 'PHMG', 'MSDS', 'MSDS', 'Oxy ’s', 'PHMG', 'Oxy Reckitt Benckiser', 'Yeouido', 'KFTC', 'Oxy ’s', 'PHMG', 'SK Chemicals', 'Oxy', 'KFTC', 'Oxy', 'Kim', 'Lotte Mart', 'Lotte Mart ’s', 'Homeplus ’s', 'Lotte Mart', 'PHMG', 'Lotte Mart', 'Homeplus', 'Oxy', 'Oxy', 'Lotte Mart', 'Lee Chul - woo', 'Homeplus', 'Lee Seung - han', 'Oxy , SK Chemicals', 'Cefu', 'Minbyun', 'Choi Jae - hong', 'the Environment Ministry', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",7,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.38261291  0.15529212

The 32-year-old used to have three cans of coke a day – one after every meal. “I loved the sensation of carbonation and the sweet taste,” he told The Korea Herald. “It felt like drinking coke helped digestion. It was just a nice way of finishing meals, especially heavy ones. ”Kim developed his love for coke while he was serving his military duty about five years ago. Coke became a daily necessity for him then, and this continued for over three years. “I’d feel anxious whenever I ran out of it in my fridge,” he said.A recent government study has shown that many South Koreans eat too much sugar, particularly in the form of sugar-sweetened beverages such as coke.The report revealed that as of 2013, the sugar consumption of Koreans aged 3-29 was alarmingly high, accounting for more than 10 percent of their daily calorie intake. The largest proportion of the surveyed Koreans -- 31 percent -- was consuming sugar by drinking sugary beverages, including soda, sports and energy drinks.For Park, his daily habit of drinking coke had to come to an end as it started to take a toll on his health. He gained more than 10 kilograms and developed four serious cavities that required him to get dental implants. The dental procedure cost him about 4 million won . According to the World Health Organization, the high consumption of such drinks can lead to an unhealthy diet, weight gain and increased risk of chronic diseases. Dental problems are also the most prevalent symptom worldwide and its treatment cost is expensive, leaving people vulnerable to pain, anxiety and tooth loss, according to the agency.Other local and overseas studies have also shown that sugary drinks increase the risk of a number of diseases, especially heart disease, gout and diabetes. According to a report by Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in the U.S., people who consume sugar-sweetened drinks regularly -- one to two cans a day or more -- have a 26 percent greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes than those who rarely drink such drinks.The report cited a 22-year study of 80,000 women, which found that those who drank a can of sugary drink daily had a 75 percent higher risk of gout than women who did not. In its measures against sugar released last month, South Korea set guidelines to cut down on schoolchildren purchasing certain food products with high sugar levels. It also advised that carbonated drinks and coffee be removed from school vending machines. “We plan to collaborate with the Education Ministry and the state-run Center for Children’s Foodservice Management to better educate young children on healthy diets and protect them from the health risks of carbonated soft drinks,” said an official from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. Park said he has lost more than 5 kilograms since he cut coke from his diet. He explained that he had also started to take bolder moves to improve his health such as by not drinking and changing his job that had previously required long work hours. “I definitely feel healthier,” he said. A 2012 U.S. study published in the American Academy of Sleep Medicine found that when individuals are sleep deprived, their reward activation centers in the brain are in fact greater, thereby making it more difficult to resist sweets.Even in Korea’s traditional medicine, obesity is viewed as a condition that is often caused by consuming too much greasy or sweet foods, physical inactivity, stress and the lack of “gi” – the vital energy that corresponds to the functions of an organ. When there is not enough gi in the body, waste fluids in the digestive system cannot be transformed properly which may result in weight gain and physical fatigue. “I think sugar and its taste are more addictive than other nutrients in general,” said Jang Dong-hyuk, a doctor of Korean medicine. “But there is a difference between sugar in natural foods such as watermelon and sugar contained in processed foods such as deserts. Not all sugar is bad – even rice contains sugar – and I think it’s important to differentiate what’s potentially harmful and what’s not.”Park said he still loves the carbonated drink, and indulges his coke habit sometimes. “I’ve made my own rules,” he said. “I only drink it when I go out for movies. I love the taste and I don’t want to give it up.”By Claire Lee","cut coke from his diet ,three cans of coke day ,drinking coke the 32 year ,stop drinking coke the 32 ,kilograms since he cut coke","['Park Hyung - jun', 'the Korea Herald', 'Kim', 'South Koreans', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'Park', 'the World Health Organization', 'Harvard T.H.

The products were pulled off the shelves in 2011 after the unexplained deaths were belatedly linked to them by local health agencies.An investigation so far has unraveled serious lapses by all parties, including the company neglecting needed tests for safety and the cover-up and twisting of reports that warned of possible harm.Public fury and concern showed in sales at retailers. Lotte Mart said Friday that sales of bleach fell 22.6 percent between April 18 and May 3, when the Oxy Korea investigation was heading to a peak. Deodorants fell 16.8 percent in sales, as well as air fresheners , fabric softeners  and dehumidifiers .At E-Mart, sales of bleach fell 38 percent and dehumidifiers 44 percent in the April 18-May 11 period.The pattern was the same at online shopping malls such as Auction and Ticket Monster, records showed.Products based on more natural ingredients, on the other hand, like baking soda, saw sales rise 30 percent more. Specialists in environmental safety advise consumer awareness in dealing with the growing fears.""Non-pharmaceutical medical products have been verified for safety, so they can be used without concern,"" Lee Jong-hyun from environmental consulting firm EHR&C; said.

White House officials said Obama wants to use the visit to ""highlight his continued commitment to pursuing the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons"" and ""to honor the memory of all innocents who were lost during the war.""But the planned visit raised concern that it could dilute Japan's wartime aggression by making the country look like a victim, even though U.S. officials said the visit shouldn't be interpreted as an apology and Obama won't revisit the decision to use the atomic bomb.On Thursday, White House Asian Affairs spokesman Myles Caggins reaffirmed that the visit is aimed at honoring not only innocent Japanese A-bomb victims, but also all innocents killed in the war.""President Obama's visit is designed to honor the memory of all innocents lost in World War II, including at Hiroshima,"" Caggins told Yonhap News Agency.As many as some 140,000 were killed in the Hiroshima bombing on August 6, 1945, and some 20,000 of them were Koreans. The U.S. dropped another atomic bomb in the city of Nagasaki three days later, leaving as many as 80,000 people dead, and some 10,000 of them are believed to be Koreans.Whether Obama would visit Hiroshima on the sidelines of a Group of Seven summit has been a focus of attention since Secretary of State John Kerry made a landmark visit to the city last month and said he would convey to Obama what he saw in Hiroshima and ""how important it is at some point to try to get here.""Obama has sought to make the initiative for building a nuclear-free world a key legacy of his presidency, launching the Nuclear Security Summit of world leaders aimed at reducing the stockpile of fissile material and keeping it out of the hands of terrorists.","obama would visit hiroshima ,the atomic bomb on thursday ,the war president obama visit ,killed in the hiroshima bombing ,obama would visit hiroshima on","['U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'japanese', 'Hiroshima', 'japanese', 'U.S.', 'the White House', 'Obama', 'Hiroshima', 'White House', 'american', 'U.S.', 'White House', 'Obama', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'Obama', 'White House Asian Affairs', 'Myles Caggins', 'japanese', 'Obama', 'Hiroshima', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'Hiroshima', 'Koreans', 'U.S.', 'Nagasaki', 'Koreans', 'Obama', 'Hiroshima', 'Group of Seven', 'State', 'John Kerry', 'Obama', 'Hiroshima', 'the Nuclear Security Summit']",11,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.69167787  0.84823215

The White House has said Obama aims to ""highlight his continued commitment to pursuing the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons.""Inside the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, where Obama is expected to visit, the skeletal ruins of what used to be the Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall serve as a reminder of the atomic bombing.In 1996, Japan recommended the building, commonly called the Atomic Bomb Dome, as a candidate site for the UNESCO World Heritage List.The move was met with opposition from China and the U.S., which highlighted the suffering caused by Japan during the war.""The United States is dissociating itself from today's decision to inscribe the Genbaku Dome on the World Heritage List,"" the U.S.said in a statement to the World Heritage Committee, posted on UNESCO's website. Genbaku Dome is the Japanese name for the site.The U.S. noted the close friendship and alliance between the two nations, saying they cooperate on security, diplomatic, international and economic affairs around the world.""Even so, the United States cannot support its friend in this inscription,"" the statement said. ""The United States is concerned about the lack of historical perspective in the nomination of Genbaku Dome. The events antecedent to the United States' use of atomic weapons to end World War II are key to understanding the tragedy of Hiroshima. Any examination of the period leading up to 1945 should be placed in the appropriate historical context.""The dome was designated a world heritage site in December 1996.With Obama's visit, the apparent shift in Washington's stance could be attributed to a converging of interests in recent years as the U.S.-Japan alliance has grown stronger in the face of a rising China, observers say.Cho Yang-hyun, a professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy, however, cautioned against exaggerating the political undertones.""The visit will serve a greater purpose for President Obama's personal agenda for a world without nuclear weapons,"" he said.""Framing it as reconciliation with history is unrequited love on Japan's part.""South Korea, which suffered under Japanese colonial rule from 1910-45, has refrained from making direct comments on the U.S. decision. More than 20,000 Koreans were direct victims of the Hiroshima bombing.""This is an issue of considerable interest to us, so our interests have been explained to the U.S.,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Cho June-hyuck said during a regular press briefing.

A number of residents who preferred to remain anonymous have revealed their distress“The thought of it sickens me to the core,” one said. “I keep feeling like I’ll throw up.” Another said, “My children drank from the tap. I’m worried they may develop health problems.” On Monday at an apartment in the city of Gumi, North Gyeongsang Province, a decomposing corpse was discovered in the water tank after residents complained of a putrid smell from the tap water.The police identified the man as 38-year-old Chinese surnamed Wong who had worked as a crew member of a ship in the nearby coastal town of Pohang. According to the police, Wong had left a note next to the water tank claiming he had not been paid his wages. Why he had traveled to Gumi and to that particular apartment is not known. Based on the level of decomposition of the body, the police estimate that he had been dead for more than 10 days. Records showed Wong arrived at the apartment on April 20, the day after which he left his clothes and shoes at the entrance of the apartment’s first floor and disappeared. Out of the 30 families that lived in the apartment, 12 have moved out. The 50 remaining residents of the afflicted apartment are negotiating to advance the date of their move.The apartment had been earmarked for demolition and reconstruction before the case was uncovered. Residents were scheduled to move out by June 18 at the latest. The apartment management has decided to provide the people with bottled water up to their date of their relocation rather than cleanse the tank. The Gumi city administration said the 0.2ppm residue chlorine in the tap water would have killed the germs from the corpse. No spread of disease has so far been detected.A preliminary autopsy by police revealed no external violence on Wong’s body. The police will conduct further tests for poisoning and alcohol.By Lim Jeong-yeo","water tank after residents complained ,after residents complained of putrid ,develop health problems on monday ,health problems on monday ,tank after residents complained","['Gumi', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'Chinese', 'Wong', 'Pohang', 'Wong', 'Gumi', 'record', 'Wong', 'Gumi', 'Wong ’s', 'Lim Jeong - yeo']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37646413  0.24069577

Lee is currently an advisor for LG International Corp.He only brings a limited background in sports, having served as an advisor for PyeongChang's Olympic bid committee in 2006 and as the head of the bidding committee for the Gwangju Summer Universaide in 2008.Lee's appointment is apparently aimed at bolstering sponsorships and marketing activities for PyeongChang.The POCOG said Lee offers ""administrative capacity, marketing expertise and a wide network among the business leaders and communication skills"" to act as an effective coordinator among the various levels of government and stakeholders.","first winter olympics on thursday ,olympics on thursday lee candidacy ,winter olympics on thursday lee ,the country first winter olympics ,winter olympics on thursday","['Commerce', 'Lee Hee - beom', 'Lee', 'the PyeongChang Organizing Committee', 'Paralympic Winter Games', 'Seoul', 'the Ministry of Culture , Sports and Tourism', 'Lee', 'Hanjin Group', 'Cho Yang - ho', 'Lee', 'the Korea International Trade Association', 'the Korea Employers Federation', 'STX Heavy Industries Co.', 'STX Energy Co.', 'Lee', 'LG International Corp.', 'PyeongChang', 'the Gwangju Summer Universaide', 'PyeongChang', 'Lee']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54634869  0.65296209

Woo Sang-ho said Wednesday.He expressed little hope of the meeting yielding any breakthrough and said it could be considered a success if they are able to freely share their thoughts.The Minjoo Party of Korea’s floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho  talks with People’s Party counterpart Rep. Park Jie-won at the National Assembly on Tuesday. Cheong Wa Dae had announced earlier this week that President Park Geun-hye will invite floor leaders of the three main parties. This is the first gathering since the April 13 general election that stripped the ruling Saenuri Party of its majority status. Both Saenuri and Minjoo are without formal chairmen and are currently run by interim chiefs.Last month, Park said she would utilize more opportunities to talk with the legislature during a meeting with the press.Woo held a preparatory meeting with his team for the presidential talks. The party is set on raising issues such as jobs for youth, housing measures for lower-income groups, private education cost and household debt.Aside from the face-to-face talks at Cheong Wa Dae, the party completed the formation of its policymaking committee earlier this week and is lining up its policy initiatives and offenses for the incoming 20th National Assembly. The Minjoo Party is expected to tackle the government’s economic policy focused on deregulation, the stalemate in the North Korean relations and the nuclear problem, as well as its avoidance of controversial bills including that on the Sewol ferry fact-finding committee.Interim chief Kim Chong-in said at a party meeting on Wednesday, “The government is making announcements as if abolishing regulations are the only way to activate the economy. … Economic regulations have been eased over the past four years, but have failed to provide any help.”Woo, for his part, said the ruling party was still reluctant to endorse some of the most socially sensitive bills. They include the bill to fast track compensation for victims of toxic humidifier sterilizer and expand the scope of recognized damages.The third largest People’s Party also vowed to be vocal. “We will hear out the president, but we will also say what needs to be said,” the party’s whip Rep. Park Jie-won said.The People’s Party stands on the same ground with regard to the bills on extending the operation of the committee investigating the Sewol ferry sinking that claimed 304 lives, and on the humidifier disinfectant victims.","with the president on friday ,team for the presidential talks ,the president to unilaterally seek ,the president on friday ,the president on friday during","['the Minjoo Party', 'Korea ’s', 'Woo Sang - ho', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea ’s', 'Woo Sang - ho', 'People ’s Party', 'Park Jie - win', 'the National Assembly', 'Dae', 'Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri', 'Minjoo', 'Park', 'Cheong Wa Dae', 'National Assembly', 'the Minjoo Party', 'north korean', 'Kim Chong - in', 'People ’s Party', 'Park Jie - won', 'the People ’s Party']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.69648385  0.67627788

The real estate mogul provided the lot for the South Korean company to build a top-luxury condominium with 376 residential units, two underground and 70 above-ground floors.The $ 240 million project turned out to be a success for both Daewoo and Trump when completed in October 2001, the units being easily sold to give profits to both parties.While building the Manhattan structure, Daewoo in late 1997 was pursuing a high-rise residential building, a popular form of real estate at the time, in Yeouido, western Seoul. While trying to find ways to set itself apart from competitors and grab public attention, the company decided to act on a suggestion by one of its CEOs to use the existing connection with Trump. Daewoo's New York office chief proposed and negotiated a deal with Trump to use his name in the new building in return for a brand fee.""The chief architect and the head of the New York office briefed Trump in person on the building design and service facilities and got the approval to use the Trump name,"" a former senior official of the South Korean company, who had been involved in advancing the project, said of how things had progressed. ""The two parties were already in a joint business in New York, and the contract wasn't hard to reach.""The Trump World in Yeouido adopted many of the markings of the Trump World Tower of Manhattan. An entire floor was dedicated to shared facilities such as a fitness gym, a swimming pool, banquet halls and a library, while the entrance floor was designed to mimic a hotel lobby to guarantee privacy, a novel concept at the time. It also departed from the conventional practice of using only a steel frame, opting for reinforced concrete that fit better for residential units.Daewoo continued the brand partnership to six more buildings throughout the country, amounting to $6 million-$7 million in payments to Trump as the brand fee, including $840,000 for the Yeouido condominium.Trump visited South Korea twice at the invitation of Daewoo E&C; -- in June 1998 and May 1999, the latter to promote the sale of the Yeouido units.During the first visit, in his tour of a Daewoo shipyard, the U.S. businessman said he will order a destroyer to use as his private yacht. The remark never developed into an actual order.In his second trip, he said he saw merits in South Korea's real estate market and wanted to engage in property development in the country.

484,484,[FEATURE] English immersion still prevalent at private schools,"A 34-year-old teacher surnamed Park at a private elementary school in central Seoul witnesses young students struggling with piles of homework every day, not just for their regular classes but also after-school courses run by the school -- especially focused on English. “I often see my students under immense pressure from school, after-school programs and private academies.

They have told me that they are fed up with the homework, but it seems there is no way to escape,” Park told The Korea Herald. Many after-school programs at private elementary schools are different from those at public schools. While public school students usually do various activities in the after-class programs, private school students often have extra English classes on top of them. Parents of private elementary school students in Seoul hold a rally against the government’s decision to ban immersion education in November 2013. YonhapSuch intensive English classes, often conducted in the form of immersion, remain prevalent at private elementary schools, despite it being illegal for first- and second-graders.In February this year, the Constitutional Court ruled that the Education Ministry’s ban on English immersion programs was constitutional. The complaint against the ban was filed in December 2013 by parents of students attending Young Hoon Elementary School in Seoul, which introduced its English immersion program in the late 1990s.The English immersion program, designed to let lower-grade students improve their English proficiency, consisted of mandatory English-only classes with foreign textbooks under foreign faculties. The subjects ranged from English language to math and science. The school claimed that the program, which soon spread to other private schools, was in accordance with the law that allows private schools to draw up their own curriculums. The Education Ministry prohibited the immersion program in 2012 for the first two grades, raising concerns about the Korean language ability of young students and excessive private education fever. Later grades also received a time limit on their immersion classes. Objecting to the ministry’s decision, some 1,000 parent of Young Hoon students filed the constitutional appeal, claiming that there is no scientific proof that the intensive English classes for low-grade students affect the learning of their mother tongue. The parents also filed an administrative lawsuit against the ministry but the court dismissed the case in 2014. Despite the two courts’ decisions, many private schools have resorted to an anomaly operation, by running the “optional” English immersion program after school. While the ministry has also banned advanced learning at schools since last year, there is no specific restraint on how after school classes are conducted.Private elementary schools have abused this loophole by branding their English immersion curriculums as after school program. Some schools even hold regular midterms and finals in their after school schedules, just like a regular curriculum.“Although the extra after-school classes are optional, it’s practically mandatory because students cannot follow the regular curriculum without them,” said an anonymous mother of a student who goes to a private elementary school in Seoul. According to the civic group World Without Worry About Shadow Education, 52 out of 76 private elementary schools in the country violate English class-related rules. Of the total 39 schools in the capital, the majority of the schools run the English immersion program for first and second graders in the after-school schedule. The civic group pointed out that the programs are being run as compulsory courses under their regular curriculum. “Although the regular English classes are allowed from the third grade, the actual difficulty level is designed for those who have studied English in the two previous years. Students cannot help but attend the immersion program,” said Choi Hyun-joo, researcher at the WWSE. The civic organization has urged the education authorities to conduct stern monitoring on the schools, arguing that the English immersion program triggers excessive private education costs. According to Rep. Park Hong-keun of The Minjoo Party of Korea, some private elementary schools were found to have charged students about 10 million won  a year solely for the English immersion program, with some exceeding 11 million won. The after-school programs of public schools cost around 50,000 won per month on average.“This English immersion program not only abuses the education rules but also affects the equal opportunity of education. Although private schools may have discretion to design their own curriculum, there are still some curriculum rules that they have to follow,” said English language education professor Lee Byung-min at Seoul National University. “Elementary education is mandatory for all nationals, which means that it is the basic education for Korean citizens. That is why all the hours of curriculum such as Korean history are fixed by the ministry. Studying with foreign textbooks and learning in a foreign language also raises a question as to which country the students are being educated in.” The efficacy of the immersion program has also been questioned.“It is important to assess if the immersion program practically involves immersion into English. The real immersion is only possible when students, who use English in daily life, learn new concepts in English. At private schools, they just review the concepts in English that they previously learned in Korean. It’s just a modified version of immersion,” said English education expert Lee Wan-ki at Seoul National University of Education. “The ideal immersion is realistically impossible in the Korean system.”The more concerning aspect of the intensive English program is the impact on the linguistic ability development of the low graders, some experts pointed out.“I see many low graders showing slower understanding in other courses, not because of their intellectual level but because of their poor Korean ability. Excessive exposure to a foreign languages before they fully learn their mother tongues seems to have affected both their linguistic ability and understanding level,” said private elementary school teacher Park. “I think it is right to teach foreign languages at least after the third grade.” The WWSE said it has urged the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education to conduct a curriculum inspection of the private elementary schools since late last year, the office has remained lukewarm.Once illegalities in school operation are confirmed, the concerned school can be punished with measures such as limiting the admission quota. However, none of the schools have faced such penalties.“ has conducted special monitoring in January and February. It’s considering undertaking a third monitoring based on the earlier reports,” said an official from the SMOE.By Lee Hyun-jeong","private elementary schools have abused ,piles of homework every day ,korea herald many after school ,pressure from school after school ,said private elementary school teacher","['Seoul', 'Park', 'the Korea Herald', 'Seoul', 'the Constitutional Court', 'the Education Ministry ’s', 'Young Hoon Elementary School', 'Seoul', 'english', 'the Education Ministry', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'english', 'Choi Hyun - joo', 'WWSE', 'english', 'Park Hong', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'english', 'Lee Byung - min', 'Seoul National University', 'korean', 'korean', 'Korean', 'Lee Wan - ki', 'Seoul National University of Education', 'korean', 'english', 'korean', 'Park', 'WWSE', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.15252592  0.32094997

Chung Jin-suk said Monday.Saenuri Party floor leader Chung Jin-suk attends a meeting of first-time lawmakers-elect at the National Assembly on Tuesday.The newly elected whip also suggested that senior lawmakers be seated in the front rows to show active participation in parliamentary proceedings.The National Assembly Act states that the placement is to be decided upon the consensus of the parliamentary speaker and the representative of each bargaining unit.It has been customary, however, to place the largest party at the center of the fan-shaped floor, the runner-up party on its right, and the remaining minority parties on its left.Under this plan, it is the 123-seat main opposition party, The Minjoo Party of Korea -- which is to take the central position, shoving out the 122-seat ruling Saenuri.The Assembly secretariat’s Proceedings Bureau reported, in reply to the Saenuri whip’s inquiry, that seats may be rearranged upon consensus as long as they remain fixed for the sake of electronic voting. It also suggested the idea of placing lawmakers according to their committee affiliation.The Minjoo Party, however, is reluctant to revise the current rule that it sees as acting in its favor.“ may cause some disorder in the floor,” said the opposition whip Woo Sang-ho on Tuesday.“It would be more efficient to let parties group together so that they can discuss urgent issues right away.”Vice floor leader Rep. Park Wan-ju also added that a change of seats is not a solution to improving inter-party communications.Rep. Park Jie-won of the People’s Party echoed the Minjoo’s remarks, calling the relocation “unnecessary.”Both opposition parties nevertheless promised to include the issue on the agendas of their floor meetings for further discussion.“In order to create a policy-focused legislature, it may be an idea to reallocate lawmakers according to their committees,” said Kim Hyung-joon, a professor of political science at Myongji University.Northern European states such as Sweden and Norway section their lawmakers based on elected regions, while the United Kingdom adopts a non-designated seat system with the ruling party members sat opposite the other parties.

""Through this investment plan, we plan to generate jobs, and by creating jobs, our ambitious aim is to root out the poverty level that amounts to one-third of our population.""South America's second-largest economy has grappled for years with an economic recession that has eroded the livelihoods of a large proportion of the country's 43 million people. Last year, the country posted a growth rate of 0.4 percent and an inflation rate of 26.9 percent.Michetti underscored the importance of working with the private sector at home and abroad to reverse that trend.""I hope we will be able to build good partnerships with the many advanced companies in South Korea to generate jobs in our country,"" she said, pointing to various investment opportunities in infrastructure development, energy, autos and agricultural goods.Last year, South Korean firms invested a total of US$180 million in Argentina, which is also rich in natural resources such as copper and lithium.""Our new government is opening a new era that is unprecedented in Argentina,"" Michetti said, taking a swipe at the previous administration of then President Cristina Fernandez. ""We must do away with all the troubles the previous populist government caused with its incorrect practices. We have to normalize the country this year and that means revealing all statistics and economic data in a realistic and transparent manner.""Michetti also expressed an appreciation for the Korean community in her country whose number has expanded to about 30,000 since the first generation of Korean farming immigrants arrived in 1965.""Through them, we have learned about Korean culture and they have made large contributions to Argentina's development,"" she said.In recent years, the so-called Korean Wave of popular Korean culture -- from TV dramas to artwork and pop music -- has won the hearts of many young Argentinians, she added.When asked, the vice president spoke calmly about the 1994 car accident that paralyzed the lower part of her body and left her in a wheelchair.Asked how she overcame the personal tragedy, she credited her family and friends as well as medicine and her Catholic faith.""Through education, I also had the intellectual ability to distinguish between what's important and what's less important, and that was also an important factor,"" Michetti said.She acknowledged that while she was privileged to be born into a middle-class family that could afford the medical costs, there are many others in similar situations but without access to the same resources. Michetti is a grandniece of former President Arturo Illia.""In such cases, I believe the state should actively intervene and provide help,"" she said.Michetti's visit came at the invitation of Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn. During her stay, she held talks with Hwang, paid a courtesy call on President Park Geun-hye and received an honorary doctoral degree at the Catholic University of Daegu, some 300 kilometers southeast of Seoul.","korea tuesday to help lift ,south korea tuesday to help ,tuesday to help lift millions ,macri arrived in seoul sunday ,korea tuesday to help","['Argentina', 'South Korea', 'Argentinians', 'Buenos Aires', 'Gabriela Michetti', 'Mauricio Macri', 'Seoul', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'the Maeil Business Newspaper', 'south korean', 'America', 'South Korea', 'south korean', 'Argentina', 'Argentina', 'Cristina Fernandez', 'korean', 'korean', 'korean', 'Argentina', 'Korean Wave', 'korean', 'Argentinians', 'catholic', 'Arturo Illia', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Park Geun', 'the Catholic University of Daegu', 'Seoul']",7,[2.         0.         0.         ... 0.07012862 0.11020273 0.30669281]

He also serves as the first chairman of the National Defense Commission and the supreme commander of the Korean People's Army.The seventh party congress served as a venue to reaffirm Kim's dual pursuit of nuclear and economic development, and to highlight the role of the WPK as the paramount political body in the North.The current leader's late father Kim Jong-il advocated a military first, or ""songun,"" policy, highlighting the role of the military, but the young leader has shifted his focus to the WPK while simultaneously pursuing nuclear and economic development. At the party gathering, Kim has made it clear that he will ""permanently"" defend the pursuit of his signature policy of developing nuclear weapons in tandem with boosting the country's moribund economy, commonly known as the ""byeongjin"" policy.The party congress has decided to enshrine the leader's policy of simultaneously pursuing nuclear and economic development in its revised party rules, according to the Rodong Sinmun, the country's main newspaper.The North's leader conducted a reshuffle of top party officials but not in a drastic manner, experts said.The KCNA said that at a plenary meeting, the WPK's central committee elected five members to the standing committee of the party's politburo, including the North's leader.The four other members are ceremonial leader Kim Yong-nam; Hwang Pyong-so, director of the general political bureau of North Korea's armed forces; premier of the Cabinet Pak Pong-ju; and Choe Ryong-hae, a party secretary.The party's central committee also elected 19 members and nine alternate members of the party's political bureau, according to the KCNA.North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Su-yong was named as one of the 19 Politburo members. Kim Yo-jong, the younger sister of the North's leader, was not mentioned on the list, but she became one of the party's 129 central committee members.The committee also decided to set up a new political affairs bureau named ""the Executive Policy Bureau,"" which will be led by the North's leader.""The latest reshuffle did not involve a dramatic generational change,"" said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior researcher at the Sejong Institute. ""It means that the North's leader has consolidated his power in a stable manner.""Experts said that it is noteworthy that Choe Ryong-hae has been tapped as a member of the standing committee of the party's politburo, an indication that he has become a key aide to the North's leader.Choe served as a standing member of the political bureau in 2014 and 2015, which effectively made him the third-highest ranking person in the communist country at the time.But he is believed to have lost favor and received re-education at a rural farm late last year as punishment for his mishandling of a newly built hydroelectric power plant project.At the latest shakeup of party elites, Choe has also become a vice chairman of the newly created bureau of political affairs.""Choe has returned as one of the closest aides to the North's leader,"" said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies. ""He is now seen as the No. 2 man in the party.""North Korean top diplomat Ri's ascent to a politburo member was also noteworthy due to a possibility that he may have replaced Kang Sok-ju, a secretary handling international relations at the party, analysts said. Kang is known to be in poor health.Ri is believed to have served as a guardian of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un when Kim studied at an international school in Switzerland in the 1990s.Meanwhile, the North's military official Ri Yong-gil was found on the list of alternate members of the party's political bureau, trumping rumors that he might have been executed.South Korea's spy agency said in February that Army Gen. Ri, a former chief of the General Staff of the Korean People's Army, was executed on corruption and other charges, and replaced by Ri Myong-su, a former minister of people's security.The sudden disappearance of North Korean officials is usually viewed by outside analysts as being linked to a possible purge or punishment.Since taking power, the North's leader has executed around 100 party and military officials to take a firmer grip on power, according to South Korea's Institute for National Security Strategy.","state media said tuesday move ,party north korean top diplomat ,north leader the latest reshuffle ,north state media said tuesday ,kcna north korean foreign minister","['North Korea', 'Kim Jong - un', ""Workers ' Party of Korea"", 'the Korean Central News Agency', 'WPK', 'WPK', 'WPK', 'the National Defense Commission', ""the Korean People 's Army"", 'Kim', 'WPK', 'Kim Jong - il', 'WPK', 'Kim', 'the Rodong Sinmun', 'KCNA', 'WPK', 'Kim Yong - nam', 'Hwang Pyong - so', ""North Korea 's"", 'Pak Pong - ju', 'Choe Ryong - hae', 'kcna.north korean', 'Ri Su - yong', 'Politburo', 'Kim Yo - jong', 'the Executive Policy Bureau', 'Cheong Seong - chang', 'the Sejong Institute', 'Choe Ryong - hae', 'Choe', 'Yang Moo - jin', 'the University of North Korean Studies', 'korean', 'Kang Sok - ju', 'Kang', 'Ri', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Kim', 'Switzerland', 'Ri Yong - gil', ""South Korea 's"", 'Army', 'Ri', ""the Korean People 's Army"", 'Ri Myong - su', 'north korean', ""South Korea 's"", 'Institute for National Security Strategy']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42024001  0.67608523

Moon Ja-in is also rebounding, recent polls showed.Realmeter said Sunday that in its survey on 1,517 adults nationwide from May 2-4, the Minjoo Party’s approval ratings rose 7.6 percentage points to 35.2 percent in Gwangju and Jeolla provinces, compared to the third-largest People’s Party, which saw its approval ratings decline by 14.8 percentage points to 35.8 percent.The turnaround was also apparent for Moon and People’s Party co-chief Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo. Moon received an approval rating of 31.3 percent, up by 8 percentage points from the week before. Ahn dropped to the second place for the first time since the election at 25.5 percent, falling 10.4 percentage points.The Minjoo Party of Korea’s new floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho  introduces his team at the National Assembly on Sunday. In the April 13 general election, the region, also known as Honam, gave the People’s Party 23 seats out of 28. The Minjoo Party only landed three seats while another two went to the ruling Saenuri Party. The results were widely perceived as disgruntled constituents judging the main opposition for its factional feuds that allegedly undermined representatives hailing from the region. The People’s Party was launched just months before the election by Minjoo Party defectors that had turned against then-chairman Moon.Upon the election, however, the tide appears to be turning, as the People’s Party – with its policy stance still ambiguous – has hinted at cooperating with the ruling party in the upcoming National Assembly. The People’s Party has risen as the group with swaying power, with 38 seats. The Saenuri has 122 seats while the Minjoo Party has 123 seats.“If President Park Geun-hye apologizes for her maladministration and seeks for cooperation,  have the Saenuri Party  become the Assembly speaker,” a Jeolla native and the People’s Party’s new whip Rep. Park Jie-won had said last week. The party’s co-chief Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo suffered a setback recently for making controversial comments, such as by saying that education policies should become more autonomous and that there is no need for the Education Ministry.Prior to the election, Moon had visited the Honam region and pleaded for support, saying he would retire from politics should the constituents decide not to vote for the Minjoo Party. But despite the crushing defeat in the region, Moon has remained low key, with opposition supporters widely split on whether he should follow through with his promise.The two party’s new whips, meanwhile, are to meet for the first time since their endorsements on Monday. The Minjoo Party has elected former student-activist and moderate Woo Sang-ho, while the People’s Party picked Park, the veteran and former aide to President Kim Dae-jung. The Minjoo Party is counting on cooperation from the People’s Party in its legislative rivalry with the Saenuri Party.But so far, the Saenuri Party’s new floor leader and lawmaker-elect Chung Jin-suk seems to have beat the Minjoo Party to it, by visiting Park the day after his election accompanied by the press, hugging him and calling him “Hyeongnim,” an endearing term addressing a person of higher age and rank.Park and Woo have reportedly maintained a tense relationship, and they have locked horns in a factional power struggle, as Woo had countered Park’s accusations against the party’s mainstreamers supportive of Moon.“ is someone who could become the floor leader  with the help of chairman Ahn Cheol-soo,” Woo had said.","korea is regaining approval ratings ,election at 25 percent falling ,party approval ratings rose percentage ,in last month parliamentary election ,is also rebounding recent polls","['the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'the Minjoo Party ’s', 'Moon Ja -', 'the Minjoo Party ’s', 'Jeolla', 'People ’s Party', 'Moon', 'People ’s Party', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Moon', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Woo Sang - ho', 'the National Assembly', 'Honam', 'the People ’s Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Saenuri Party', 'the People ’s Party', 'Minjoo Party', 'Moon', 'the People ’s Party', 'National Assembly', 'the People ’s Party', 'Saenuri', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Park Geun', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Assembly', 'Jeolla', 'the People ’s Party ’s', 'Park Jie - won', 'Ahn Cheol', 'the Education Ministry', 'Moon', 'Honam', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Moon', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Woo Sang - ho', 'the People ’s Party', 'Park', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'the Minjoo Party', 'the People ’s Party', 'the Saenuri Party', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Woo', 'Woo', 'Park ’s', 'Moon', 'Ahn Cheol']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.92437565  0.5698815

The follow-up measures will be taken care of by the Prime Minister’s Office, instead of the current Environment Ministry, the officials said.Families of the victims, and the members of the opposition parties, have been calling for parliamentary action to uncover those responsible and ensure compensation.“The National Assembly will launch a parliamentary probe and hearing, and speed up its efforts to revise necessary regulations,” said Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk.“The government should also report  how products which were unauthorized in other countries could be sold in the local market, and check if any other hygiene products in sale are chemically safe,” he added. The prosecutorial probe, meanwhile, is expected to widen to foreign officials of Oxy Reckitt Benckiser amid escalating public uproar over the massive number of deaths, sources said Sunday. The Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office is reportedly setting up schedules over when to summon several foreign executive board members of Oxy, who are knowledgeable about the company’s operation. These include two former CEOs -- John Lee, a 48-year-old Korean national with American citizenship, and a 47-year-old. Lee served as the CEO from June 2005 to May 2010, succeeding Shin Hyun-woo who was summoned late last month. Sales of the problematic product surged while Lee was holding the post, the prosecution said. Lee is suspected of pushing ahead with the product sales despite continuous health complaints from users. The second man, who worked from May 2010 for two years, is suspected to have been a key person who directed to conceal key evidence.Prosecutors said that it was around the time he was holding a post in the company, that Oxy changed its corporation type and allegedly sought to manipulate Seoul National University’s experiment report over the product toxicity test. The prosecution will also look into whether these former leaders served as a link between the Korean branch and the U.K. headquarters by sharing information and reports over the toxic product case, they added. A Seoul National University professor surnamed Cho was arrested Saturday on charges of manipulating evidence in favor of Oxy. Cho, 57, is suspecting of making up an experiment report that is allegedly advantageous to Oxy’s stance over the product toxicity. In an alleged attempt to refute the government’s health probe that pointed out humidifier disinfectant as the culprit behind more than a hundred deaths in 2011, the company had requested that Cho conduct a toxicity test of PHMG, the main ingredient of the humidifier disinfectant. Oxy allegedly handed over 250 million won  to Cho for the experiment cost. Toxicity was found in the initial reproduction-toxicity test but Oxy allegedly bribed Cho to release an inhalation-toxicity test report in favor of the company. Prosecutors found that the company had sent a total of 12 million won to Cho’s personal account on three occasions, separate from the experiment fee. In the following year, Cho released a health report that causality between the product use and the lung damage was not clear. Cho denied the allegations and said the company had not asked him for such a favor. Meanwhile, it was revealed that a 2013 report by the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that use of the humidifier disinfectant could increase lung risk by 116 times. Based on a comparison between PHMG-exposed people and others under the same condition, the health agency confirmed that longer exposure to PHMG could lead to higher lung risks. The report was not released to the public, citing that the result was similar to the government’s health probe result already released in 2011, the health authorities said. The report was published in international science journal PLOS ONE in March this year.Meanwhile, Kim Deok-jong, 40, a father who claims to have lost his son to Oxy’s humidifier sterilizer said Saturday he will file a compensation suit against the British company later this month. Kim had gone to the U.K. headquarters last week to urge CEO Rakesh Kapoor to visit Seoul and officially apologizeHe said he decided to file the damage suit after the CEO refused his demand to visit South Korea to make an apology in front of the sterilizer’s victims. His 5-year-old son died in 2009 due to a respiratory disease.The company, however, said in its press release that the CEO had sincerely apologized to them.“Mr. Kapoor repeated his heartfelt apology to all those victims who used Oxy HS products in Korea and extends his apology to all victims.

Woo Sang-ho was elected as a floor leader of the main opposition party on Wednesday in a race against five to spearhead the party’s legislative negotiations in the new parliament opening later this month. With Woo’s election, floor leaders of all three major parties have now been settled, as they face the joint challenge of regaining public trust in politics and seizing the lead in the legislative battle toward next year’s presidential race.Rep. Woo Sang-ho, a prominent student protester from the democratic movements of the 1980s, will serve as a chief negotiator against the ruling Saenuri’s Chung Jin-suk and the People’s Party’s Rep. Park Jie-won. Woo, who will be serving his third term, will keep the post for a year and work alongside party leader Kim Chong-in until the party elects new leadership between July and August. The first order of business is to hammer out a deal over the allocations of seats for National Assembly’s speaker and high-profile parliamentary committees. The 53-year-old politician won the runoff against another activist-turned-politician Rep. Woo Won-sik. Having come in second to Woo Won-sik, the new whip beat his competitor by 63 to 57 votes. Out of 122 members of lawmakers-elect, 120 casted their votes in the runoff election. The new floor leader vowed to “unify” the liberal party by bridging differences among the factions. The former democratic activist is known to be close with the faction of the former party leader Rep. Moon Jae-in, but has got along well with non-Moon factions. The Minjoo Party's new floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho. Yonhap“We will be united as one and win ” said the floor leader. “I urge fellow lawmakers to transform our party into the one that can win the people’s trust and achieve a change of government,” he said. The new whip became a lawmaker in 2004 when the liberal Uri Party won the elections. Though he had failed to be reelected in 2008, he was elected in the 2012 and 2016 elections.

Some Republican leaders remain acutely wary of the bombastic billionaire and have insisted they could never support him, even in a faceoff against Clinton.    Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, who has consistently said he could not support Trump, wrote on Twitter Tuesday that he was being asked if the Indiana results changed his views. ""The answer is simple: No,'' Sasse wrote.    Republicans such as Sasse worry both about Trump's views on immigration and foreign policy and his over-the-top persona. Hours before clinching victory in Indiana, Trump was floating an unsubstantiated claim that Cruz's father appeared in a 1963 photograph with John F. Kennedy's assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald _ citing a report first published by the National Enquirer.    Trump still needs about 200 delegates to formally secure the nomination, but Cruz's decision to end his campaign removed his last major obstacle.    ""Ted Cruz -- I don't know if he likes me or he doesn't like me -- but he is one hell of a competitor,'' Trump said of his last fierce competitor, whom he had dubbed 'lyin' Ted.'' Trump, in a victory speech that was much lower-key than usual, promised victory in November, vowing anew to put ""America first.''Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is joined by his wife Melania, daughter Ivanka and son Eric as he speaks during a primary night news conference on Tuesday. AP-Yonhap    The campaign of Gov. John Kasich, who has won only in his home state of Ohio, said in a Facebook post: ``Tonight's results are not going to alter Gov. Kasich's campaign plans. Our strategy has been and continues to be one that involves winning the nomination at an open convention.'' Kasich trails Trump by nearly 900 delegates.    Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders eked out a victory over Clinton in Indiana, but the outcome will not slow the former secretary of state's march to the Democratic nomination. Heading into Tuesday's voting, Clinton had 92 percent of the delegates she needs.    ""I know that the Clinton campaign thinks this campaign is over. They're wrong,'' Sanders said defiantly in an interview Tuesday night. But Clinton already has turned her attention to the general election.    She and Trump now plunge into a six-month battle for the presidency, with the future of America's immigration laws, health care system and military posture around the world at stake. While Clinton heads into the general election with significant advantages with minority voters and women, Democrats have vowed to not underestimate Trump as his Republican rivals did for too long.    Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus declared the GOP race over, saying on Twitter that Trump would be the party's presumptive nominee.    ""We all need to unite and focus on defeating HillaryClinton,'' he wrote.    Indeed, Trump's first challenge will be uniting a Republican Party that has been roiled by his candidacy. While some GOP leaders have warmed to the real estate mogul, others see him as a threat to their party's very existence.    Even before the Indiana results were finalized, some conservative leaders were planning a Wednesday meeting to assess the viability of launching a third party candidacy to compete with him in the fall.    Indiana was viewed as the last gasp for Cruz, the fiery Texas conservative. He campaigned aggressively in the state, securing the support of Indiana's governor and announcing businesswoman Carly Fiorina as his running mate but lost momentum in the closing days.    Cruz had clung to the hope that he could keep Trump from reaching the 1,237 delegates needed for the nomination and push the race to a rare contested convention. But aides said he made the decision to drop out early Tuesday evening, shortly after most polls in Indiana had closed.    ""I've said I would continue on as long as there was a viable path to victory; tonight I'm sorry to say it appears that path has been foreclosed,'' Cruz told a somber crowd in Indianapolis.    Only about half of Indiana's Republican primary voters said they were excited or optimistic about any of their remaining candidates becoming president, according to exit polling conducted by Edison Research for The Associated Press and television networks. Still, most said they probably would support the GOP winner.    Clinton, too, needs to win over Sanders' enthusiastic supporters. The Vermont senator has cultivated a deeply loyal following, particularly among young people, whom Democrats count on in the general election.    Sanders has conceded his strategy hinges on persuading superdelegates to back him over the former secretary of state. Superdelegates are Democratic Party insiders who can support the candidate of their choice, regardless of how their states vote. And they favor Clinton by a nearly 18-1 margin.    With Sanders' narrow victory Tuesday, he picked up at least 43 of Indiana's 83 delegates. Clinton now has 2,202 delegates to Sanders' 1,400. That includes pledged delegates from primaries and caucuses, as well as superdelegates.    Trump now has at least 1,047 delegates. Cruz exits the race with 565, while Kasich has 152.","underestimated trump victory in indiana ,republican presidential candidate donald trump ,trump victory in indiana tuesday ,widely underestimated trump victory ,ted trump in victory speech","['Donald Trump', 'the Republican Party', 'democratic', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Trump', 'Indiana', ""Ted Cruz 's"", 'republican', 'republican', 'Clinton', 'Nebraska', 'Ben Sasse', 'Trump', 'Indiana', 'Republicans', 'Sasse', 'Trump', 'Indiana', 'Trump', 'Cruz', 'John F.

""Frank discussions between the United States and China, together with South Korea, and Japan could enable both sides to find more areas of agreement than have existed in the past.""Key issues that should be discussed include what near term actions would U.S., South Korean, and Chinese forces take in the event of a regime collapse, how could conflict on the peninsula between those forces be avoided and how to secure the North's nuclear weapons and materials, Sherman said.Other issues include whether American troops stay on the peninsula, how the Korean peninsula would be governed, what would replace the armistice and who would cover the economic costs of reconstruction, she said.""These are just a few of the topics that will need to be addressed in order to help build, over the longer-term, a better understanding of the emerging strategic thinking of all of the parties,"" Sherman said.

There has been speculation that Pyongyang may conduct a nuclear test ahead of its ruling Workers’ Party of Korea congress on Friday. Han said that it has been confirmed that the North currently has 40 kilograms of plutonium. “The military is using all resources and cooperation of our allies to counter North Korea’s nuclear threats,” he said. Defense Minister Han Min-koo attends a parliamentary committee meeting on Tuesday. But Han added that there is no evidence to believe that the North has already succeeded in miniaturizing nuclear warheads. Making small enough warheads -- conventionally under 1 ton -- to mount onto a ballistic missile is a critical step toward acquiring nuclear capacity.The minister reiterated his stance that Pyongyang’s nuclear testing on Jan. 6 -- which sparked powerful international sanctions -- is unlikely to have been a hydrogen bomb test as the communist country has claimed. He said based on the magnitude of the detonation, it is possible that the bomb could have been a boosted fission weapon, which is more efficient that a conventional nuclear weapon. Experts like Karl Dewey of the U.K.-based IHS Jane’s also said that there is a possibility that the North’s device is a boosted weapon.In a prereleased parliamentary report, the Defense Ministry said that “strategic provocation” by the North can also involve firing ballistic missiles. In an unprecedented move, the North fired its Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missile three times in the past month, all of which appear to have ended in a failure. It also fired its KN-11 submarine-launched ballistic missile on April 23, which some experts say was a partial success in that it demonstrated a successful underwater cold launch.“In reaction to our  media’s reports on ‘failed missile launches,’ the North has been clinging to regain credibility for its ballistic missile programs,” the ministry said. It also said there is a possibility of spontaneous clashes near the Northern Limit Line, the de facto sea border between the Koreas. Minister Han also addressed Pyongyang’s SLBM threats. While the ministry has assessed that North Korea could use the SLBM within the next three or four years, Han said concentrating the state’s effort may speed up the process. “I don’t believe we have ample amount of time ,” said Han, adding that the April 23 launch demonstrated some accomplishments in terms of ejection, ignition and initial flight of the missile.The military has been touting the potential deployment of the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system here as an effective measure against the North’s ballistic missile threats, along with its own Korea Air and Missile Defense and the “Kill Chain” missile defense system slated to be established in around the early 2020s. Han refrained from presenting a timeline on negotiations for stationing THAAD here, but assured the parliament that the U.S. will shoulder the cost of the deployment.The minister’s parliamentary report also pointed out that the North has been concentrating its efforts in preparation for Friday’s party congress, which marks the first one in 36 years. It also noted that the combined pressure of the U.N. sanctions and preparation for the event has sparked North Korean citizens’ complaints toward the Kim regime.

Please join us for filing a petition with the National Human Rights Commission of Korea!” and a piece of paper to collect signatures on a makeshift table during a May Day rally held in central Seoul, Sunday. “We aim to pressure the party and raise awareness on illegality of its discriminatory election pledges,” Osori, an activist working for Solidarity for LGBT Human Rights of Korea, told The Korea Herald. “We want the human rights watchdog to confirm that the Christian Party’s inflammatory acts are illegal and in violation of equal rights.”The petition came amid growing debate over the anti-gay and discriminatory pledges by the new Christian Libertarian Party that fielded their candidates in the April 13 parliamentary election. “The Christian Libertarian Party officially and publicly incite homophobia and xenophobia through their election pledges on flyers, banners and in media,” said a human rights lawyer Han Ga-ram, who is preparing to lodge the petition along with other pro-LGBT activists. Protestant groups hold a counter rally during a gay pride parade held on June 28, 2015 The Christian Libertarian Party has largely opposed three things: creation of a Halal town, passage of an antidiscrimination law and homosexuality. The party said in its election flyers and posters that the plan to build Halal factories would invite at least 300,000 Muslims, which they said would put the country at higher risk of terrorism and sexual crimes against Korean women. The move drew ire from the Korea Muslim Foundation which called it “vicious defamation against a specific region” and demanded the nation’s election committee withdraw the anti-Muslim campaign flyers. Posters and flyers distributed across the nation during the April 13 election campaign read “Korean churches made it!” and “Let’s join the petition to establish Republic of Korea which can stop spread of homosexuality and invasion of Islam.” The Protestant-backed party also vowed to stop the National Assembly from passing the pending antidiscrimination law which it sees as expanding homosexuality and undermining the Bible’s teachings. It also said that homosexuality is against humanity and causes sexual diseases such HIV-AIDS on its campaign trail. “The party’s presence poses a fundamental threat to human rights and democracy. We could not sit back and stay silent when the party is now entitled to government subsidies,” the lawyer Han said. In South Korea, any political party with a seat in the parliament or with more than 2 percent of votes in the election can receive political funds from the government.The Christian Libertarian Party earned 2.63 percent of total votes. Another religion-backed Christian Democratic Party took 0.54 percent of the votes, putting the combined votes for the Christian bloc at over 3 percent. The Christian Libertarian Party failed to secure any seats in the 300-seat National Assembly, but it is expected to receive about 400 million won in the second half of the year and 1.9 billion won in 2017. Anti-gay groups hold placards that read ""Holy Korea"" and ""Homosexuality Out"" in Seoul Plaza, central Seoul, during a pride parade held on June 28, 2015. The party also violates international law, said the lawyer Han. “As the international law is effective as domestic law, the NHRCK should base the international law to confirm the party’s inflammatory policies as discriminatory.” The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by the United Nations General Assembly, which took effect in Korea in 1990, prohibits any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that incites discrimination, hostility or violence. It also stipulates that all persons are entitled to protection against discrimination on grounds such as race, sex and religion.“On one hand, freedom of speech in the political arena should be allowed to the fullest,” said law professor Hong Seong-soo from Sookmyung Women’s University. ”On the other hand, politicians’ opinions inciting discrimination against minorities and different religions in public should be regulated because such actions make those on the edge of society impossible to lead their lives.” “Currently, South Korea has no law that can ban discrimination and inflammatory remarks in public,” Hong said, adding that the Constitution stipulating antidiscrimination values cannot serve as legal deterrence. Thousands of spectators participate in the opening ceremony of the 16th Korea Queer Festival's pride parade in Seoul Plaza, central Seoul, during a gay parade held on June 28, 2015 Antidiscrimination laws aimed at rooting out bigotry on such grounds as gender, disability, age, race, marital status and religion have been submitted to the National Assembly since 2007. But they remain deadlocked in the face of Protestant groups’ fierce resistance to equal rights for sexual minorities.For now, the NHRCK receives complaints and opens an investigation when discrimination based on sexual, religious and racial grounds takes place. If needed, it imposes recommendations, but they have no legally binding force. But the prospects for the upcoming petition against the Christian party do not seem rosy, with the NHRCK official mulling over whether it is within its authority to investigate a political party’s election pledges. “When we receive a petition on discrimination, we decide whether the discrimination occurred in such sectors as employment, education. If not, we are likely to dismiss the case.” The lawyer Han said that he hopes to receive a “proper answer.” “What is more serious than discriminatory action itself is the fundamental structure that continues to allow discrimination to spread across the country,” he said. “It is the human rights watchdog’s responsibility to fix the structure.

The police said the 39-year-old surnamed Park had worked as a 7th grade civil servant for two months, before breaking into tears in front of his mother complaining of his work being “too tough” and disappearing shortly after. His mother reported him as missing to the police, who tracked the location of Park’s cell phone and found his body at a motel located in Jegi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu next to burnt-out coal briquette. He left no will.  Park had suffered a fifth class brain lesions, which meant he could carry out most of the essential daily acts such as maintaining personal hygiene and climbing up and down stairs, albeit with minor difficulties.He first held a position as 5th public official in special service at the National Assembly, then as a 9th grade public official at another government agency, before he was hired as a 7th grade official at the Seoul City Hall this January. He received a month’s training before being assigned to the department where he worked until his death.The Seoul City spokesperson expressed condolences and regrets at Park’s death, saying that he never showed particular signs of distress at work.The spokesperson cautiously offered that Park had “debts from the business he ran prior to getting governmental job. We knew that he took sleeping pills.” Around the end of last year, two public officials took their lives by jumping off the 13-story Seosomun Building in Seoul, provoking some to lash out at the rigid working culture and the pressure for promotion that led to overheated competition among civil servants.In a move to alleviate workplace pressures, Seoul City in March had put forth a number of measures to innovate group culture. It actively recommended officials to take holidays, while drawing up guidelines for work according to each official’s position and year of experience. Those who had more work than they could handle had their duties redistributed while those placed in so-called undesired departments were interviewed to analyze individual cases.

A government-led investigation confirmed a connection between more than 100 people who died of lung problems and the chemicals used to clean household humidifiers.""I offer my heartfelt apology on behalf of Oxy Reckitt Benckiser... I also represent headquarters in the UK,"" Ata Safdar, CEO of Oxy Reckitt Benckiser, said during a press conference in Seoul, bowing in front of cameras. ""We will make every effort to assure the victims have necessary support and fair compensation.""It is the first time since the release of Oxy's sterilizer 15 years ago that the company has made an apology.The CEO's admittance of responsibility in public came after its April 21 email apology denying its culpability in the case sparked a strong backlash from victims of the families.Following the creation of a 5 billion won  ""humanitarian fund"" in 2014, Oxy Reckitt Benckiser said it will additionally spend 5 billion won to help compensate the victims.The Oxy official also proposed other makers of questionable disinfectant put concerted efforts to compensate victims. Lotte Mart and Homeplus, two of South Korea's biggest discount chains, also made and sold similar products.The problematic products were withdrawn from the local market in 2011. Prosecutors have expanded their investigation into the Korean unit, summoning former Korean CEO Shin Hyun-woo and two other senior officials last week. The focus of the investigation will be on whether the company's high-ranking executives approved the sales of its disinfectants while knowing the health risks.Safdar said his company will fully cooperate with South Korean authorities and conduct its own investigation to ""get to the bottom of the case and hold those accountable.""The latest move comes as the boycott of the British firm's products has gained steam among retailers, pharmacists and consumers. Hundreds of victims also plan to lodge a collective suit against the company later this month.The snowballing case has also come under the radar of President Park Geun-hye, who urged prosecutors to thoroughly investigate the case. The repeated apology, however, was not enough to solace those who have long suffered from unidentified diseases.Jung Mi-ae accompanied her 14-year-old son, who is undersized, wheelchair-bound and wore a nasal cannula connected to a green oxygen tank to aid his breathing. ""Do you think you can compensate my son's pain and suffering?,""the 40-year-old from Yongin, south of Seoul, said. ""My son has never been able to attend school because of his health condition.""""Why didn't you apologize in the first place? You are too late!,"" an angry father shouted, pointing his finger at him. Safdar begged the victims' families to accept his apology. ""I'm so sorry. I'm a father of three sons and I understand how you feel."" Another mother, full of tears, responded, ""No, you don't understand. My son died.""Later on Monday, the representatives for the victims filed a complaint with the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office seeking an investigation into eight board members of the British firm Oxy Reckitt Benckiser, including its chief executive officer Rakesh Kapoor.The headquarters in Britain is responsible for not conducting due safety checks since the product was first sold in 2001, they said in a press conference held in front of the prosecutors' office in southern Seoul.","after four pregnant women died ,four pregnant women died of ,four pregnant women died ,unit summoning former korean ceo ,women died of lung problems","['Oxy Reckitt Benckiser', 'korean', 'british', 'Oxy Reckitt Benckiser', 'UK', 'Ata Safdar', 'Oxy Reckitt Benckiser', 'Seoul', 'Oxy', 'Oxy Reckitt Benckiser', 'Oxy', 'Lotte Mart', 'Homeplus', ""South Korea 's"", 'korean', 'korean', 'Shin Hyun - woo', 'south korean', 'british', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Jung Mi - ae', 'Yongin', 'Seoul', ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' office"", 'british', 'Oxy Reckitt Benckiser', 'Rakesh Kapoor', 'Britain', 'Seoul']",7,"[ 1.          0.          5.         ... -0.42955753  0.23223235

Park Joon-young of the People’s Party, who served as governor of South Jeolla Province, denied the charges before entering the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office in southwestern Seoul. “I did not receive the money. There must be a misunderstanding,” the 69-year-old told reporters at the scene. “It is a shame that the situation turned out this way. I apologize to my supporters.” Park Joon-young appears for questioning at the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office in Seoul on Monday. Park said, adding that he would cooperate with the investigation. Park is suspected of accepting hundreds of thousands of won in illicit campaign funds on multiple occasions from a secretary-general of a small political party, identified only by his surname Kim. Park had formerly headed the party composed of followers of the late president Kim Dae-jung before joining the People’s Party in March. Prosecutors suspect Kim of offering the funds to Park in exchange for favors in the nomination process for the People’s Party. Kim, however, was not included on the list of the party’s proportional representation candidates. Prosecutors arrested Kim and Park’s accounting manager and searched Park’s residence and office in South Jeolla Province last month. Prosecutors said they would decide whether to indict the lawmaker-elect before the 20th National Assembly opens later this month.Later in the day, Ahn Cheol-soo, cochairman of the People’s Party said that he would respond to Park’s case in accordance with the party’s principles and rules.

The games included those played on computers, televisions and smartphones. The level of addiction was gauged according to the students’ self-assessment of the negative effects their gaming hours had on their school life, such as their ability to pay attention in class and complete assignments. The results pointed to a difference between male and female students. For male students, there was an inverse proportion between the number of hours they spent playing games and the academic interest they showed at school. However, those who said they had a close relationship with their father seemed to experience less negative impacts on their school life, despite spending three to four hours per day playing games. Their relationships with their mothers showed no apparent correlation. Likewise, female students who thought of themselves as game addicts had relatively well-performing academic records when they had close emotional ties with their mother. Regardless of how severe they considered their addiction, the ones who said they had a good relationship with their mother experienced fewer side effects on their academic performance.  However, the relationship with their father was irrelevant. The Yonsei research team said there needs to be additional discussion to determine the differences between male and female students but that they have tentatively reached conclusions that the way the students identified themselves with the parent of the same gender may have affected the results. The team also said the girls’ academic performance in general were less influenced by the number of hours they spent playing games, possibly due to their playing ‘casual’ games that require a shorter time span and have less burden on their studies.

Their sales promotion included buy-one-get-one-free events and discounts.YonhapThe distributors explained that the event was simply part of regular sales promotion held each season, adding that they would withdraw all Oxy products from the list.“The sales promotion was planned three months in advance and it was practically difficult to exclude Oxy’s products. But we admit that our actions were not thoughtful enough,” an official from Lotte Mart was quoted as saying. Lotte Mart, one of the toxic humidifier disinfectant makers and distributors, is blamed for the loss of 22 lives who used its in-house brand Wislect’s humidifier disinfectant. A boycott backed by the civic group Asian Citizen’s Center for Environment and Health has so far been targeting Oxy, which is allegedly responsible for 103 out of the 143 deaths recognized by the authorities as being caused by the humidifier sterilizers.

Peter King  said on CNN. ""It certainly, you know, it weakens the leverage we have against China and it, in effect, makes China more a Pacific power than we are right now."" In a major foreign policy speech earlier this week, Trump said that allies are not paying their fair share for U.S. defense support, and the U.S. must be prepared to ""let these countries defend themselves"" unless they foot more of the bill for the defense.The real-estate tycoon has long made the case, but the address was seen as carrying more weight than before because it was the first time Trump has outlined his foreign policy priorities in such a formal and refined manner.Though Trump made no mention of South Korea, the remark suggested that if elected, he could seek to pull 28,500 American troops from the Asian ally unless Seoul agrees to pay more. King pointed out that South Korea already shoulders much of the cost for the upkeep of U.S. troops.""Right now, they are picking up a large percentage of it. And it is cheaper for us to keep troops in Japan and Korea than it is to have them back here in the United States. So, it is saving the U.S. money by having troops in Japan and Korea,"" he said.""But if we want to negotiate a slightly higher amount, that's one thing. But the fact is that amount has gone up in the past. And right now, again, it saves the U.S. money by having our troops stationed in those two countries,"" he added.In 2014, the two countries renewed their cost-sharing agreement, known as the Special Measures Agreement, with Seoul agreeing to pay 920 billion won  for the upkeep of the U.S. troops in 2014, a 5.8 percent increase from a year earlier.Moreover, the American military presence on the peninsula is seen as in line with U.S. national interests in a region marked by a rising China.Earlier this month, Gen.

They occur almost every two months.”Distributors are holding special promotions for toys in time for Children’s Day. On an ordinary day, it is still costly to keep a child looking decent, feed him organic food and have him attend various classes -- including math, Korean and English. If you are surrounded by people who do all this, it is extremely hard to be the odd one out. Kim regularly meets a group of mothers to share information on a wide range of products and programs, to make each of their kids “a leader” in their classes. The standard 7-year-old leader would look good, be tall and study well, she said. Kim is one of many Korean parents eager to spend their hard-earned money to satisfy the needs of their children and raise them to become an above-average person, as a future elite school graduate with a decent job. And it all starts at an early age.From name-brand clothes to organic food and tailored education tools for toddlers, the market for kids has grown fast and wide to the point of being overrated.The size of the baby market -- for basic needs such as diapers, toys and baby gears -- is estimated at 1.7 trillion won . Industry insiders say the kids market may be the only one that will not be affected by a slowing economy. According to Auction, an online shopping site, sales of kid’s furniture jumped by 23 percent from Jan. 1- April 21 this year compared to the same time period last year. Popular items were premium products made out of eco-friendly materials. CJmall, another online shopping service, said the sales of toys increased by 15 percent in April compared to March. Each customer spent an average of 170,700 won, a 2.3-fold increase from 72,200 won in 2013.Companies and private education institutes have also jumped into the fray to cash in on the competition and anxiety of the parents.The state-run Korea Institute for Child Care and Education’s February report shows that the size of private education for children aged five and younger reached 3.23 trillion won in 2015, up 22.2 percent from the year before. “No parent wants to force their kids to do something they don’t want to. But in reality, it is not easy to let that expectation go,” said Oh Soo-hyun, the mother of a 5-year-old boy.“After all, Korea is a competitive society, and admission to an elite school is a ticket for a promising future. No parent would miss that opportunity, no matter the cost.”By Cho Chung-un","latest lego series nexo knights ,korean parents eager to spend ,the latest lego series nexo ,the latest lego series ,box from the latest lego","['Kim Young - eun', 'Seoul', 'child ’s Day', 'Children ’s Day', 'Chuseok', 'child ’s Day', 'korean', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'korean', 'Auction', 'CJmall', 'Korea Institute for Child Care and Education ’s', 'Korea', 'Cho Chung - un']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5219332   0.31410557

Civic groups, however, have argued that a total of 1,528 users were affected, with 228 dead. Unrecognized users have not been eligible for financial support from the government. The ministry said it would conduct more health research to confirm the clearer causality between the health damage and the product use. Meanwhile, the boycott against humidifier sterilizer manufacturer Oxy Reckitt Benckiser is expanding across the country, with Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon joining the move calling it an “immoral company.”“The society will only become healthy if immoral companies or labor-management relations that step beyond social magnanimity are punished,” he said during a live-cast on Facebook late Thursday.“As far as I know, the  City Hall is using some Oxy products. I’ll make sure we do not use them anymore,” he said, calling the humidifier sterilizer case “the bedroom version of Sewol ferry disaster.”The boycott movement has started both online and off-line amid public uproar over the belated investigation and company apologies related to the disinfectant products that have been blamed for deaths of at least 143 since 2011. A total of 13 manufacturers and distributors are involved in a lawsuit filed by the victims and their families. Four are under investigation by the prosecution. Oxy Ssak Ssak was the most used brand by the alleged victims -- around 70 percent.“We should make sure that products of such immoral companies cannot set foot in the market as soon as the prosecutorial probe result is released,” Park said.The boycott began to spread this week, with pharmacists being the most active. Oxy has been selling more than 120 household items and five medicine products here, including sore throat medicine Strepsils and antacid Gaviscon. On Tuesday, a group of pharmacists in Busan vowed to stop selling Oxy products, urging the company to take social and moral responsibility. The group comprises of some 3,000 pharmacists.Other pharmacists across the country have also individually taken part in the moveThe Korean Pharmaceutical Association said that it fully understands the boycott movement. “ shares the same awareness that  should take this case as an opportunity to classify public health-related products as ‘sanitary aid’ and raise the safety standards,” said the KPA after holding an urgent meeting Friday.Political parties also accelerated their moves to help the victims. While President Park Geun-hye on Thursday ordered that relevant organizations take appropriate measures for the victims. “As the government has provided 3.7 billion won  for damages to victims so far, there is a need to compensate them first by enacting a special regulation, and then exercising the right to indemnity against the company,” said Rep. Kim Jung-hoon of the ruling party on Friday. “The government should also check whether the victims had suffered damage to other organs other than the lungs because of the humidifier disinfectant. A parliamentary hearing should be held after the ongoing probe is finished.”Earlier this week, The Minjoo Party of Korea said it would consider enacting a special law that would allow the compensation for victims and holding a parliamentary hearing if necessary. The People’s Party joined the Minjoo’s move on Thursday, saying that it was urgent to systematically overhaul the system to prevent a reoccurrence. Meanwhile, the prosecution has reportedly found that the company Butterfly Effect, whose toxic humidifier disinfectant Cefu it says killed 14 and injured 13, had manufactured the product without any professional knowledge. The company head, surnamed Oh who was summoned Thursday, reportedly testified that he had obtained the manufacturing formula on the Internet, research data and dissertations. Cefu contained a chemical known as PGH, which is thought to be more harmful than PHMG, which Oxy had used as its main ingredient. Unlike PHMG, PGH solution is not toxic when ingested and causes little irritation, but its toxicity through inhalation has not been tested. The investigators suspected that Oh overlooked the potential health impacts of inhaling PGH and skipped the safety test. Oh and his colleague allegedly exported the ingredient from a Danish company and mixed it with water. At the time, the company had only about 10 employees, none of which had expertise in chemical manufacturing or chemical research, the prosecution said. The company which sold Cefu from 2009 to 2011, recorded the third-largest number of dead victims. Oxy recorded the highest with 70, followed by Lotte Mart with 16. The investigators are seeking accidental manslaughter charges against Oh. Prosecutors continued the probe Friday by questioning two more Oxy officials.

According to the report, the life vest used by soldiers during a boat drill in Hangang River was designed to have higher buoyance on the back than the front, which led to the device forcing the soldiers’ face under water.The Ipo irrigation pool at the southern stretch of Hangang River in Yeoju-si, Gyeonggi Province. The daily claimed that investigation report obtained from the Army headquarters said that the November 2010 accident of four drownings at the Ipo irrigation pool in Yeoju-si, Gyeonggi Province, was due to the faulty design of the life jacket the soldiers wore at the time. The report read, “If the soldiers lost consciousness while being swept in the current, it can be presumed their centroid was tilted to their torso, which could have submerged their heads under water.” “There appears to be a need for a thorough research to improve the life jackets.” When the boat capsized during the military drill, the soldiers were swept away in the current and were later found drowned with their backs turned up facing the sky. The floatable jackets they wore had 55 percent buoyancy on the back and 45 percent on the chest. The military is being accused of allegedly covering up the faulty life jackets to avoid taking responsibility for the death of the four soldiers. A military insider, whose identity was withheld to protect the source, said in an interview with the local daily that the reason the life jackets were designed in such a manner was due to misconstrued notion that it would allow the soldiers to always maintain a front-facing posture. Unlike the army life jackets, the navy’s kapok life jackets have extra buoyancy at the front, with only one-third of chest buoyancy at the back.  The insider claimed the jackets were not the direct cause of soldiers’ drowning, however the incident has served as a trigger to run a check on safety gears and improve on them. “The buoyancy was corrected so that the chest would have 10 percent higher buoyancy than the back.”The military will distribute the new life jackets to each military unit by the end of this year. A budget of 1.7 billion won  was allocated to the military for this.By Lim Jeong-yeo","2010 accident of four drownings ,soldiers drowning however the incident ,accident of four drownings at ,four drownings at the ipo ,accident of four drownings","['Yeoju', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Army', 'Yeoju', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Lim Jeong - yeo']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51734906  0.02122309

Donald Trump  (...","Donald Trump, the flamboyant Republican front-runner for the 2016 U.S. presidential election, reaffirmed his claim that the America’s allies are not shouldering what he viewed as a “fair share” of the costs for U.S. military support.The prominent candidate’s remarks raised speculation in South Korea about the possible changes that the new U.S. administration may bring after November’s elections. Donald Trump  Democrat Hilary Clinton and Trump appear all but certain to clinch their spots as candidates for the upcoming votes. And local observers have begun to wonder if the election of the new leader will prompt any shifts in the South Korea-U.S. alliance. At the center of such concern is Trump, who has voiced opposition against the U.S. retaining troops in wealthy countries like South Korea and Japan, and even suggested nuclear armament of the said countries to counter threats like that from North Korea.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un recently ordered his engineers to conduct a nuclear weapons test, touching off speculation that the communist country may carry it out ahead of the May 6 ruling party congress. Trump on Wednesday said that cost-sharing with the allies was one of the main weaknesses in U.S. foreign policy and that he could pursue U.S. troops’ withdrawal upon being elected unless Seoul agrees to pay more.“Our allies must contribute toward their financial, political, and human costs, have to do it, of our tremendous security burden. But many of them are simply not doing so,” he said, although he refrained from specifically mentioning South Korea as before. He denounced U.S. President Barack Obama for watching “helplessly” as Pyongyang expanded its nuclear programs. The Republican hopeful’s foreign policy ideas have been controversial, even after the real estate tycoon named several of his foreign policy advisers last month.He has both on Wednesday and in the past indicated reducing U.S. commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Trump had told the U.S. media that he did not want the U.S. to decrease its role, but decrease spending in NATO. His team of advisers include counter-terrorism expert Walid Phares, energy consultant George Papadopoulos, and former Defense Department inspector general Joe Schmitz and is led by Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions. The senator is well known for his tough stance on immigration, as is Trump. According to evaluation by the U.S. media, none of the revealed advisers are leading figures in the Republican foreign policy establishment, many of whom publicly opposed Trump. Hilary Clinton  It is a different story for Clinton, a former secretary of state. Jake Sullivan, who is thought to have in-depth knowledge about peninsular matters, resumed his role as her top adviser, a position which he held while Clinton worked at the State Department. Clinton’s sizeable team of advisers also include Derek Chollet, a former assistant defense secretary for international security, along with Wendy Sherman and Daniel Benjamin, both of whom worked alongside Clinton at the State Department. After having served as the highest-rank member of the Obama administration, Clinton’s policy toward the North and Seoul-Washington alliance is not expected to differ greatly from that of the current administration. While she has yet to formally announce policies concerning the alliance and the Korean Peninsula, she stressed that the U.S. should defend its allies against the North after Pyongyang’s Jan. 6 nuclear test.Mark Landler of New York Times assessed that Clinton has displayed “instincts on foreign policy that are more aggressive than those of President Obama and most Democrats,” describing her as a hawk who believes in the importance of American intervention.In spite of their differing views, both candidates have stressed the importance of China in resolving the current situation with North Korea.Trump’s brash words have had local observers concerned over a potential security gap on the peninsula.“It is clear that Trump will pressure Seoul to shoulder more of U.S. Forces Korea’s costs, or they will withdraw. … I believe it is time to consider whether the U.S.’s nuclear umbrella protection will be more beneficial to South Korea’s national interest than actual nuclear armament,” said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior research fellow at the local think tank at Sejong Institute.But South Korea’s Defense Ministry said that the U.S. already knows that Seoul is financially contributing a “considerable mount” to retaining the U.S. forces here. Earlier in the month, Gen. Vincent Brooks, the commander-nominee for the U.S. Forces Korea, trumped Trump’s suggestion of possibly pulling the troops out of the peninsula. He said keeping the U.S. troops in Korea would cost less than sustaining the forces in the U.S.By Yoon Min-sik","elections donald trump democrat ,the forces korea trumped trump ,runner for the 2016 presidential ,after november elections donald trump ,donald trump the flamboyant republican","['Donald Trump', 'republican', 'U.S.', 'America', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Donald Trump', 'Democrat', 'Hilary Clinton', 'Trump', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Trump', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'Pyongyang', 'republican', 'U.S.', 'the North Atlantic Treaty Organization', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'NATO', 'Walid Phares', 'George Papadopoulos', 'Defense Department', 'Joe Schmitz', 'Alabama', 'Jeff Sessions', 'Trump', 'U.S.', 'republican', 'trump', 'Hilary Clinton', 'Clinton', 'Jake Sullivan', 'Clinton', 'the State Department', 'Clinton', 'Derek Chollet', 'Wendy Sherman', 'Daniel Benjamin', 'Clinton', 'the State Department', 'Clinton', 'North', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'North', 'Pyongyang', 'Mark Landler', 'New York Times', 'Clinton', 'Obama', 'Democrats', 'american', 'China', 'North Korea', 'trump ’s', 'Trump', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'South Korea ’s', 'Cheong Seong - chang', 'Sejong Institute', 'South Korea ’s', 'Defense Ministry', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Vincent Brooks', 'the U.S. Forces Korea', 'Trump ’s', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'Yoon Min -']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43769568  0.37003952

Though Trump made no mention of South Korea, the remark suggests that if elected, he could pursue U.S. troop withdrawal from the Asian ally unless Seoul agrees to pay more.""Our allies are not paying their fair share, and I've been talking about this recently a lot. Our allies must contribute toward their financial, political, and human costs, have to do it, of our tremendous security burden. But many of them are simply not doing so,"" Trump said during the speech at a Washington hotel.""We have spent trillions of dollars over time on planes, missiles, ships, equipment, building up our military to provide a strong defense for Europe and Asia. The countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense, and if not, the U.S. must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves. We have no choice,"" he said.If elected president, Trump said he would call for ""a summit with our NATO allies and a separate summit with our Asian allies"" to ""discuss a rebalancing of financial commitments but take a fresh look at how we can adopt new strategies for tackling our common challenges.""On North Korea, Trump said U.S. President Barack Obama watched ""helplessly"" as Pyongyang ""increases its aggression and expands further and further with its nuclear reach."" He said the communist nation is now ""totally out of control.""He again stressed that the U.S. should make China use more of its influence with Pyongyang.""Our president has allowed China to continue its economic assault on American jobs and wealth, refusing to enforce trade deals and apply leverage on China necessary to rein in North Korea,"" Trump said. ""We have the leverage. We have the power over China, economic power, and people don't understand it. And with that economic power, we can rein in and we can get them to do what they have to do with North Korea, which is totally out of control,"" he said.Trump has long made unfounded claims that the U.S. has been protecting wealthy nations like South Korea and Japan in exchange for little and should end such protection unless those countries agree to pay more. He has even suggested allowing the allies to arm themselves with nuclear weapons so as to reduce U.S. security burdens.About 28,500 American troops are stationed in South Korea to deter North Korean aggression, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War that ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, leaving the divided peninsula still technically at war.Seoul has long shared the cost of stationing U.S. forces. In 2014, the two countries renewed their cost-sharing agreement, known as the Special Measures Agreement, with Seoul agreeing to pay 920 billion won for the upkeep of the U.S. troops in 2014, a 5.8 percent increase from a year earlier.Moreover, the American military presence on the peninsula is seen as in line with U.S. national interests in a region marked by a rising China.Earlier this month, Gen. Vincent Brooks, who has been nominated to be commander of U.S. Forces Korea, said that Seoul is shouldering a ""significant load"" of the costs for the stationing of American troops in the country.Brooks also said that South Korea is funding most of the cost for a massive $10.8 billion project to relocate American troops farther south, which he called the ""largest DOD construction project we have anywhere in the world.""He also said it would cost more to keep those troops stationed in the U.S. than it does in Korea.","presidential front runner donald trump ,runner donald trump said wednesday ,wednesday address trump laid out ,wednesday address trump laid ,in wednesday address trump laid","['U.S.', 'republican', 'Donald Trump', 'american', 'U.S.', 'american', 'trump', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'asian', 'Seoul', 'trump', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'Trump', 'NATO', 'asian', 'North Korea', 'Trump', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'Pyongyang', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Pyongyang', 'China', 'american', 'China', 'North Korea', 'trump', 'China', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'american', 'South Korea', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'the Special Measures Agreement', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'american', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Vincent Brooks', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'american', 'Brooks', 'South Korea', 'american', 'DOD', 'U.S.', 'Korea']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63873166  0.5717324

It is this humble gesture of introspection and allusion to betterment that touches the doubting heart amid challenging situations.President Park Geun-hye, however, seems to be in denial of such dynamics as she has once again pointed her finger at political parties instead of shouldering blame as the nation’s top official in charge.When Park invited the chief editors of local media to a luncheon meeting on Tuesday for the first time in three years, anticipation rose that the state leader may at last be open to criticism and show a willingness to change.But throughout the 130-minute session, the president sidestepped most of the issues that called her to account.“The presidential post is to assume unlimited responsibility toward the people and the nation, but I found that there was very little I could do as president,” she said.“I have visited the National Assembly, invited key officials for talks, repeatedly called for their support in revitalizing the economy, but to no avail.”These self-defending remarks, in fact, came in response to a question asking whether she considered the result of the April 13 general election as the people’s disapproval of the current administration.Park, instead of mentioning the underachievement of the ruling conservative Saenuri Party, shifted the blame to the opposition, mainly The Minjoo Party of Korea.“The people felt the need to pull out the parliament from its bipartisan feuds and legislative stagnancy, which is why they created a new tripartite frame, hoping for improved power balance,” she said, referring to rise of the runner-up opposition People’s Party.She neither recognized the public’s criticism of the government, nor mentioned her feud-ridden home party, which lost its parliamentary majority and slipped to the No. 2 in-house party.The evasive answers naturally failed to satisfy the senior journalists, leading another participant to rephrase the question.“I would like to ask, once and for all, whether you consider the election result as a judgment solely upon the legislature or also upon  state affairs,” said one of the chief editors present at the luncheon.Even this hard-hitting query could not elicit a meaningful response from Park.“Based on various analysis and criticism regarding the election result, I am seeking to better embrace the public sentiment and to improve people’s livelihoods by cooperating with the parliament,” was her reply.Park also spent several minutes elaborating on her own hardships.“I have come all the way to presidency to improve the lives of the people, I sleep fitfully at night, struggling to realize such goals, yet I feel helpless and hurt that I should be held back ,” she said.The president’s self-centered attitude tested the patience of even the most administration-friendly newspapers. Chosun Ilbo, the leading conservative paper here, in its editorial questioned the cogency of her words which it described as buck-passing.Park may take this negative turn from the media as a “betrayal” of public sentiment, but it may now be time for her to ponder whether or not she was the one who betrayed people’s expectations.Looking back on her turbulent 18-year political career, she should certainly remember that it was often her unassuming attitude amid troubled times that won her the most cheers.By Bae Hyun-jung","luncheon meeting on tuesday for ,turbulent 18 year political career ,session the president sidestepped most ,heart amid challenging situations president ,most administration friendly newspapers chosun","['Park Geun - hye', 'the National Assembly', '”these', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'People ’s Party', 'Park', 'Chosun Ilbo', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51352555  0.50651604

514,514,Suspicions grow over ultraconservative rallies,"Amid snowballing suspicions over the government’s alleged involvement in pro-government rallies by a right-wing organization, President Park Geun-hye on Tuesday loosely denied her office’s ties with the group. “I was briefed that it was not true that (a Cheong Wa Dae official was behind the right-wing group’s rallies),” she said in a meeting with editors in chief held at the presidential office.Questions have be...","Amid snowballing suspicions over the government’s alleged involvement in pro-government rallies by a right-wing organization, President Park Geun-hye on Tuesday loosely denied her office’s ties with the group. “I was briefed that it was not true that ,” she said in a meeting with editors in chief held at the presidential office.Questions have been thrown around in recent days upon news reports that Cheong Wa Dae and a business lobby group were allegedly behind the ultraconservative group the Korea Parent Federation, with progressive civic groups demanding prosecutors investigate the case.Asked what she thought about the right-wing group’s pro-government activities, Park said that it was “inappropriate” for the president to publicly offer opinions on civic groups’ activities, as they all pursued their own values.The Korea Parent Federation -- a nongovernmental group of conservative senior citizens -- has been actively holding rallies since 2014 in favor of controversial government policies. They include the reinstatement of state-authored history textbooks for secondary school students, the comfort women deal struck between South Korea and Japan and passage of labor market reform bills and an antiterrorism bill. The radically conservative group has also stirred the pot by staging rallies against the families of victims of the Sewol ferry disaster, blasting them for politicizing the Sewol ferry issue and being North Korean sympathizers.According to local news reports and legal industry sources, the group had received about 520 million won  from the Federation of Korean Industries to orchestrate pro-government rallies between 2012 and 2014.Members of the Korea Parent Federation collide with activists participating in a regular rally held in front of the comfort women statue in Seoul on Jan. 6. The FKI -- a private interest group representing the nation’s big businesses like Samsung and LG -- wired the money to the parents’ group through a bank account under the name of the now-defunct Bethel Missionary Foundation, the report claimed. The missionary group is thought to be a “paper company” to funnel the money. The FKI has remained silent, refusing to confirm whether it provided funds to the parents’ group. Part of the money was allegedly spent on giving 1,259 North Korean defectors 20,000 won each to participate in some 39 rallies held by the group, weekly magazine Sisa Journal reported last week.It also suggested that Heo Hyun-joon, a low-ranking official at Cheong Wa Dae, had asked the secretary general of the KPF to hold a demonstration in support of President Park’s settlement with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on the wartime sexual enslavement last year. Cheong Wa Dae repeatedly denied its alleged meddling in hosting such pro-government rallies by the parents’ group. Heo sought a court injunction Friday to ban the sale of the weekly magazine and filed a complaint against Sisa Journal and its reporter demanding compensation. He also asked the Press Arbitration Commission correct the reports.   The National Intelligence Service is also suspected of influencing the right-wing group to sway public opinion in favor of President Park during the 2012 presidential election. Prosecutors on Monday argued at the trial of the former chief of the spy agency that an NIS official gave instructions to the parents’ group. Choo Sun-hee, secretary-general of the KRP, recently made comments indicating a potential link to the government, saying he had exchanged text messages and phone calls with the Cheong Wa Dae official in regards to the demonstration. He also said the group had received funds “indirectly” from the FKI through the missionary foundation. He claimed money was mostly used to feed the elderly and North Korean refugees. But he denied their activities had any political ambition or motivation.“What we have done was for this country. We will not sit back and bear any acts denouncing our motive. We have fought hard to protect the nation’s identity and freedom,” Choo said in a press briefing Friday in its office in central Seoul. “We will take stern action against the press trying to annihilate us. ... We don’t take orders from anyone and we do only the things we would like to do.” Since the press conference, Choo has stayed out of the public eye. The KPF planned to hold a rally in front of local broadcaster JTBC’s building in Seoul on Monday, but that was canceled without prior notice. The Citizens’ Coalition for Economic Justice and an association of seven students’ groups recently stepped up calls for the prosecution to investigate the suspicions surrounding the alleged state and conglomerate-sponsored rallies, filing a complaint with the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office. “The public is outraged by ugly connections among Cheong Wa Dae’s order, the FKI’s funds and the KPF’s demonstration,” the students’ group said Friday in front of the prosecutors’ office. “The government has a duty to investigate the case and the FKI should reveal its bank statements on funding the parents’ group.” By Ock Hyun-ju","presidential election prosecutors on monday ,korean refugees but he denied ,snowballing suspicions over the government ,tuesday loosely denied her office ,election prosecutors on monday argued","['Park Geun', 'the Korea Parent Federation', 'Park', 'the Korea Parent Federation', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'north korean', 'the Federation of Korean Industries', 'the Korea Parent Federation', 'Seoul', 'FKI', 'Samsung', 'LG', 'Bethel Missionary Foundation', 'FKI', 'north korean', 'Sisa Journal', 'Heo Hyun - joon', 'Cheong Wa Dae', 'KPF', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Cheong', 'Dae', 'Sisa Journal', 'the Press Arbitration Commission', 'the National Intelligence Service', 'Park', 'NIS', 'Choo Sun - hee', 'KRP', 'FKI', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'Choo', 'KPF', 'Seoul', 'the Citizens ’ Coalition for Economic Justice', 'the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Cheong', 'FKI', 'KPF', 'FKI', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39174122  0.70946926

The Saenuri fell behind by 3.4 percentage points at 28.1 percent.In Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province, the Saenuri Party collected 47.5 percent, a 1 percentage point drop from the week before. The party had suffered a 3 percentage point decline in the previous week as well.President Park Geun-hye Approval ratings for President Park also dropped by 0.1 percentage point to 31.4 percent, while negative assessment rose by 1.2 percentage points to 63.5 percent.Park’s negative evaluation exceeded positive ones in Daegu and North Gyeongsang region -- 49.2 percent to 46.6 percent -- for the first time in 15 months.Park’s approval ratings dropped more significantly by 8.8 percentage points to 34.1 percent in Daejeon, Sejong and Chungcheong regions.The Minjoo Party, meanwhile, maintained its slight lead since the April 13 general election, and marked another 1.1 percentage point increase. The gap between the Saenuri and the Minjoo, however, is within the margin of error.Among the potential presidential candidates, the Minjoo Party’s former chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in kept his lead at 27 percent. He topped the list in all regions except in Gwangju and Jeolla provinces, the original stronghold for his party that mostly elected People’s Party candidates this time. People’s Party’s co-chief Rep. Ahn Cheo-soo beat Moon in the region with 31.4 percent but his overall popularity dropped slightly to 18.4 percent. Following Moon and Ahn were the Saenuri Party’s Oh Se-hoon and Kim Moo-sung, although both marked small declines in ratings.Alarmed by the election defeat and reeling under low approval ratings, Cheong Wa Dae has indicated the president would broaden her means of communication. On Tuesday, Park is to hold talks with 46 chief editors of the country’s leading newspapers and TV stations, the second such meeting since her inauguration in 2013.Sources from Cheong Wa Dae said Park is also mulling holding talks with chiefs of major parties soon.“It will be important to expand the scope of dialogue starting with the media and continue to create common ground to promote consistent reforms to break through the structure of low growth,” a presidential official said.","months park approval ratings dropped ,34 percent in daejeon sejong ,low growth presidential official said ,second week the saenuri party ,park approval ratings dropped more","['Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun', 'Daegu', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'realmeter', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Saenuri', 'Daegu', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Approval', 'Park', 'Park ’s', 'Daegu', 'North Gyeongsang', 'Park ’s', 'Daejeon', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Saenuri', 'Minjoo', 'the Minjoo Party ’s', 'Moon Jae -', 'Jeolla', 'People ’s Party', 'People ’s Party ’s', 'Ahn Cheo - soo', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'Se - hoon', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'Park', 'Cheong Wa Dae', 'Park']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.70376891  0.36076161

Prosecutors said that Oxy -- formally renamed Reckitt Benckiser Korea since 2014 -- submitted a 77-page report recently that sought to refute the claims, saying the deaths may have been triggered by other risk factors such as yellow dust in spring or separate germs generated from humidifiers. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously confirmed in 2011 that there was a significant association between the health impacts and the use of humidifier disinfectant Oxy Ssak Ssak.The report was submitted in January this year as the prosecution began to speed up the probe into the humidifier disinfectant tragedy. Having summoned several Oxy officials last week, the prosecution said it would also call in Oxy’s former CEO Shin Hyun-woo later this week. Shin is considered the key figure for the investigation, as he worked at the company from 1991 to 2004. The product in question was sold from 2001 onward.Prosecutors will also look into whether the company attempted to distort the report to cover up the case. Speculations have grown that Oxy had allegedly distorted the report on experiments the company had requested from two institutions for toxicity tests in 2011.Right after health authorities confirmed the causal link between the products and the deaths in an August 2011 report, the British company reportedly asked for a toxicity test of the problematic ingredient, PHMG, from Seoul National University and Korea Conformity Laboratories. In Seoul National University’s reproduction-toxicity test, the research team reportedly found out that 13 babies born to 15 pregnant mice died, adding credibility to the government’s health probe. In a separate inhalation-toxicity test, however, the research team allegedly concluded that the causality between the disinfectant and lung diseases was not clear. Despite the two different results, the company allegedly submitted only the latter to the prosecution this year. News reports said that the company did not collect the KCL’s report, which had a similar test results to the university’s reproduction-toxicity test. Oxy reportedly paid over 200 million won  to each institution for the experiments, the prosecution said. Prosecutors are probing whether the two institutions deliberately manipulated the test results or whether there was an under-the-table deal. Meanwhile, families of the humidifier disinfectant victims slammed the recent apologies offered by the disinfectant manufacturers and distributers Sunday. “The companies that had remained unperturbed for the past five years have begun to move as the prosecution’s probe began to rapidly gain speed. Lotte Mart and Oxy, which had remained unmoved, started pretending to apologize in front of the press, all the while still ignoring the voices of the victims. One thing is clear in that we have heard nothing from these companies,” said Kang Chan-ho, representative of the group of the families of victims.Lotte Mart made an apology to the victims on April 18, with a support fund of 10 billion won, a day before the prosecution started to summon the disinfectant company’s officials. Oxy also released a letter of apology Thursday to victims of the humidifier disinfectant, saying it would offer 5 billion won in humanitarian assistance in addition to another 5 billion won in funds it had previously pledged.The families also urged the government to take stronger measures for the victims and potential victims who are waiting for their health causality test results. About 750 disinfectant users requested a health causality test last year to be recognized as official victims of the humidifier disinfectant. Only 221 so far have officially been confirmed to have been affected by the product. The full results are expected to be released late next year. They also urged the government to set up a report-receiving center for other potential victims who have not been officially recognized for the damage due to relatively mild symptoms.

She added excessive spending on welfare could have an impact on the country's long-term fiscal health.The chief executive also advocated special administrative rules like the ""pay-go"" system. The system makes clear that any additional outlays must be offset by spending cuts or revenue increases. ""The problem of maintaining long-term fiscal soundness is something that is agreed upon by the people,"" the president pointed out.`At the meeting that sets government guidelines on spending, the Ministry of Strategy and Finance said it will maintain its expansionary fiscal policy mode for the next five years to prop up the economy. It, however, said every effort is going to be made to cut unnecessary outlays.The ministry moreover has been moving to streamline the public sector to get rid of overlapping institutions. This can save money and lead to a more efficient fiscal spending structure.The chief executive's latest remarks apparently came after the political parties spearheaded different welfare pledges in the lead-up to the April 13 parliamentary elections.Kim Chong-in, interim chairman of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea, stressed the importance of ""productive welfare,"" saying that the expanded welfare policy will eventually induce growth in related industries, such as health and medical services.Kang Bong-kyun, a campaign chief of the ruling Saenuri Party, meanwhile, agreed with Kim on the need for the expansion of social welfare but warned against irresponsible policies that leaned toward populism.

If successfully built, they will be the first of such schools established in the city since 2003. As of this year, a total of 29 special education schools are running in Seoul. This is part of medium-term support measures for the disabled, with the country marking its 36th Disabled Persons Day on Wednesday, officials said. Members of the civic group Korean Parents’ Network for People with Disabilities urge the city government to draw up support measures for children with developmental disabilities at Seoul City Hall, on Monday. Concerns, however, remain over potential opposition from neighborhood residents. Previous plans to build a job training center and two schools for the disabled had hit a snag due to opposition from vocal residents who claimed the facilities would hurt their communities’ image and effect real estate prices. “Many people still view special schools as ‘unpleasant institutions.’ Selecting the location for the schools will be most crucial. Unless the office successfully determines the region and deals with the communities’ opposition, it will be tough to build schools,” said Kim Chi-hun, the disability policy and research director of the Korean Parents’ Network for People with Disabilities.The office said it would discuss available sites for the schools with the Seoul Metropolitan Government. Of some 13,000 disabled students in the city, 35 percent attend special schools while the rest go to general schools. Due to scarcity of the schools, out of some 4,600 disabled students, about 42 percent spend on average about 30 minutes to one hour commuting to school, according to the survey by the education office. Of those surveyed, 3 percent said their commute time was about one to two hours on average.Overcrowded classrooms are also another hurdle for the disabled.Most of the special schools in the city are overcrowded, with an overpopulation rate exceeding 150 percent in some schools.

But in what is a usually vibrant and lively fish market drawing some 30,000 customers a day, tension is running high. Red ribbons reading “Opposition to relocation of fish market” or “Please save the Noryangjin Fish Market” flutter above the fish stalls.  On the second floor, all the restaurants to which customers could bring their purchase to cook and eat are shut, with a big X sign and “demolition” in red spray paint on their glass doors.Seoul’s oldest and largest fish market is currently witnessing a fierce battle between its fish vendors and managing company National Federation of Fisheries Cooperation, or Suhyup in Korean.Merchants continue their business at the old Noryangjun Market in Seoul on April 4. Citing the decaying and structurally dangerous facility, Suhyup’s management opened a new state-of-the-art facility on March 12 and asked the fishmongers to move in. It plans to demolish the original building and develop the real estate into a resort. The majority of the seafood vendors, however, have protested the relocation plan, claiming that the stalls allotted to each vendor in the new building are too small and expensive. They said the move will also destroy “a tradition” that they have built in the current site over the past 89 years. Instead of moving to the new location, the vendors want the old market to be refurbished. “A market should be like a market, not a department store,” said a 52-year-old fishmonger in the old market, who wished to be identified by only his surname Kim. “Yes, the facility is in a bad condition, but we can improve it by renovating this place. Would you clear out Gyeongbokgung Palace just because it is old?”“This place has served as a historic market for decades and the value of the market cannot be calculated with money,” Kim said, donning a red vest with a slogan “Fight for rights for living.” “We built a tradition that cannot be replaced elsewhere.” Kim also cited practical issues, such as narrower space, low ceiling and higher rent at the new facility. “If rental fees go up for a stall in the new building, we will have to raise fish prices and restaurant owners will have to raise the price of soju. It is loss for customers, too.” The Noryangjin Fish Market, which has been in operation since 1927, has become an iconic landmark in Seoul, offering over 800 seafood varieties at wholesale prices around-the-clock. South Koreans as well as some 200,000 foreigners visit the market each year, with TripAdvisor placing it at No. 38 out of 678 tourist attractions in Korea. Suhyup, which has managed the fish market since 2002, reached an agreement to modernize the run-down facility with vendors through 23 rounds of negotiations in 2009. The eight-story building, which cost Suhyup a whopping 523 billion won , was completed in October and opened on March 16. A month after its opening, however, only 200 of the 680 vendors moved to the new building, with tourists and customers still flocking to the old market. Most of the spaces in the new Noryangjin Market building remain unoccupied as of April 4. A handful of vendors were doing business on the first floor of the new market, displaying clams, crabs, and salmon, as well as fresh fish in their small tanks. They seemed to be unfazed by the ongoing wrangling in the old market, welcoming new changes. “The old marketplace is so dirty and smells like a sewer. I had to live with rats there,” said Chung Jin-suk, chattering with a group of vendors at a corner of the market. “This building is well polished and equipped with parking facilities and escalators, which my customers like a lot.”Park Tae-jin, 50, who sold fish for 23 years in the old market, said that everything in the new market was satisfactory. “The space is a bit smaller, but facilities are advanced and it is clean here. If I have to pay more as rent, I don’t mind.” Conflicting interests have divided the vendors as well, according to a 58-year-old fish retailer, who wanted to be identified by her surname Lee.Lee speculated that most of the vendors against moving to the new facility are those reaping benefits from the current location of their stalls in the old market. “In the market, the location of each stall makes a huge difference in sales. Those who could not make profits in the old market quickly moved into the new facility to choose a spot they wanted.” “I also opposed the relocation plan at first, but the conditions here turned out to be much better than expected. The remaining merchants in the old market keep complaining without trying,” she said. “They even call me a betrayer.” In the midst of conflicting interests, accusations and stepped-up moves to relocate the old vendors, things have turned radical in recent weeks.On April 1, a vendor was arrested for attempted murder after stabbing a Suhyup official with a knife. Earlier in March, violence erupted when guards hired by an agency attempted to block a parking lot and tear down makeshift restaurants in the old market. On Monday last week, Suhyup partially cut off the water and power supply, which prompted outrage among the remaining vendors. Lee Chae-ho, secretary general of the emergency committee representing vendors, blasted the agency for “unilaterally” and “forcibly” pushing for the plan without sufficiently consulting vendors. “Only a few merchants approved of the new plan, with most of the vendors having no idea of the details of the relocation,” Lee said in his office in the old market. “We were all shocked about how small the space was and how our requests were dismissed when Suhyup first revealed the new building to the public.”A Suhyup official, who requested not to be named, accused the vendors of “illegally” occupying the current site and misleading the public to defend their own interests. “We provided them with a design map and they signed all the documents indicating rent and location of stalls,” an official from Suhyup said, refusing to be named. “We spent extra budget to extend the construction period to meet their demands.” “In the new building, we allocated exactly the same size to each vendor. But vendors are complaining because they cannot use corridors and passages, which is illegal, to display their stuff any longer,” he said. “We also settled the dispute over rental fees in previous negotiations.” The Suhyup official also refuted the vendors’ claims that the company is pushing ahead with the relocation plan to make money from real estate development. “All the vendors agreed to revitalize the neighborhood to draw more customers to the market.” Suhyup applied for a license last year to establish a commercial resort including a casino after demolishing the old market. It aims to make the neighborhood a tourism hub by 2018. Unaware of the fierce behind-the-scenes bickering, scores of customers interviewed by The Korea Herald were generally happy with the new facility. “As a customer, I like the new market more because it is more convenient to shop and park,” said Hwang Jin-tae, a 55-year-old retiree, while checking out the new market with his wife. “Tradition is important, but I will go where it is convenient.” Song Kyo-yeon, a housewife in her 50s, said that she had hated the smell and unhygienic conditions in the old market. “Have you come to this place in summer? It is disgusting. I really want the merchants to move to the new building.” But some others expressed regret and worries about scrapping the old market. “The new building might be clean, polished and shiny, but the smell and mess are what I like about this place. It is traditional. I love this place,” said Jeremy Morris, a musician from England who has visited the fish market four times. “If this market gets demolished, I would be devastated.”Jung Min-jae, a 29-year-old student, hopes the old market stays as it is. “It seems like we  break down everything in the name of modernization. But serving as a fish market for 90 years itself is its identity.” The fishmongers in the old market stage a protest for 30 minutes every morning and plan to bring the case to Seoul and the central government. Suhyup, on the other hand, is set to file suit against the vendors for eviction and compensation and recruit new tenants at the new building. The Noryangjin Fish Market is not alone in fighting against the relocation plan. In eastern Seoul, more than half of the vendors at the Garak Market Seoul are also refusing to move into a new six-story building, saying it cannot function as a wholesale market due to the small space and multiple floors. Its managing company Seoul Agro-Fisheries & Food Corporation also plans to file an eviction suit to expel the tenants. Cho Myung-rae, an urban planning professor at Dankook University, pointed out that “lack of communication” leads to such dispute surrounding the city’s renovation plan for some traditional locations and neighborhoods. “Traditional markets are unique in that they are designed and operated without plans,” Cho said. “But this contradicts standardized and modernized way of business operation. That’s why conflicts erupt between vendors sticking to their traditional way of doing business and experts designing the city with reasonable yardsticks.”Cho suggested that Suhyup and the vendors ask the Board of Audit and Inspection to look into the situation, find wrongdoings, cross-check facts and seek solutions. “If Suhyup had sufficiently interacted with vendors and had not unilaterally pushed for the scheme, many of the problems would have not occurred,” Cho said. “It takes time, but it is important to seek consensus in development projects.” By Ock Hyun-ju","sunday afternoon fishmongers cheerfully call ,fish market drawing some 30 ,800 seafood varieties at wholesale ,afternoon fishmongers cheerfully call out ,on sunday afternoon fishmongers cheerfully","['the Noryangjin Fisheries Wholesale Market', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'National Federation of Fisheries Cooperation', 'Suhyup', 'Korean', 'Noryangjun Market', 'Seoul', 'Suhyup ’s', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Seoul', 'South Koreans', 'TripAdvisor', 'Korea', 'Noryangjin Market', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Suhyup', 'Lee Chae - ho', 'Lee', 'Suhyup', 'Suhyup', 'the Korea Herald', 'Hwang Jin - tae', 'Song Kyo - yeon', 'Jeremy Morris', 'England', 'Seoul', 'the Noryangjin fish Market', 'Seoul', 'Seoul Agro - Fisheries & Food Corporation', 'Cho Myung - rae', 'Dankook University', 'Cho', 'the Board of Audit and Inspection', 'Suhyup', 'Cho', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53952068  0.5842005

A restaurant owner involved in the social project is quoted by the community center as having said, “Seeing the customers consciously put in bottle caps in the collection bin, I feel the society still has warmth and caring sentiments left for the weak.”The Yonggang community center plans to tie in collaborative deals with regional social communities and liquor companies such as the Lotte Liquor and the Hite Jinro. Nearby Mapo Subway Station and Gongdeok Subway Station in Yonggang-dong is a “food culture street” where a many worthy restaurants can be found in one spot.

Indeed, protracting economic doldrums, the party’s factional fighting, and the Park Geun-hye government’s inflexibility and lack of interaction with the legislature, ordinary citizens and other members of society are blamed for the party's landslide loss in Wednesday's general election, observers said.Saenuri Party chair Kim Moo-sung pauses during a news conference at the National Aseembly on Thursday.  Since she took office about three years ago, the conservative president has rolled out a series of policy packages focusing on robust security and economic revival. While little signs of a growth recovery have surfaced, Cheong Wa Dae has failed, or refused, to consult with the parliament and reflect public opinions to build consensus as it pushed ahead with contentious plans, such as the reintroduction of state-authored history textbooks. It instead denounced opposition lawmakers and other critics as a stumbling block for its statecraft. On top of the schoolbook drive, the administration has been taking flak for attempting to overpower anti-government protesters and dissent on social media, as well as a legislative push to make it easier for family-run conglomerates to fire workers. Such heavy-handed moves invited international criticism that the country is backpedaling on democratic freedoms, reminiscent of the era of military rule by the president’s late father and longtime strongman Park Chung-hee. During his visit here last January, U.N. Special Rapporteur Maina Kiai pointed to a trend of “gradual regression on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association -- not a dramatic shutdown of these rights, but a slow, creeping inclination to degrade them.”Immersed in political infighting and partisan bickering, the ruling Saenuri Party was seen focusing on carrying through the presidential office’s initiatives without taking an in-depth analysis on any policy’s possible outcome and public repercussions. As a result, there have been a string of abrupt shifts in the government’s long-held policies or clashes between the related state agencies. The counterterrorism act, for which opposition members demanded further revisions through a days-long, world record-breaking filibuster on concerns of potential privacy breaches, was passed early last month with the ruling party’s nearly unanimous endorsement. Cheong Wa Dae spokesperson Jeong Yeon-kuk pauses during a news briefing on Thursday. “The  Minjoo Party benefited from the voters’ desperation to block the Saenuri Party from winning the election once again,” Cho Jin-man, a political science and international studies professor at Duksung Women’s University, said at a seminar Thursday in Seoul. The minor opposition’s seizure of greater-than-expected 13 proportional seats was also the result of the voters’ “stern judgment” of the major opposition Minjoo Party, he added. “On its campaign trail, the Minjoo Party was seen putting more energy into attacking the minor opposition People’s Party rather than keeping the ruling party in check, among other missteps,” Cho said. “But overall I think the people made wise choices, even though the parties remain unwise.”Park Sang-in, a professor at Seoul National University’s Graduate School of Public Administration, echoed the view, adding that the voters appear to “have lost confidence” in the current economic policies. “Though the Park presidency is in its fourth year, there’s no sign that the growth rates will go up, while the polarization only continues to deepen,” he said. ‘If the opposition camp wishes to nail another victory in next year’s presidential election, it should present detailed policies and foster trust that it can deliver, rather than approaching the economy in abstract and emotional terms under the slogan of ‘economic democratization.’”By Shin Hyon-hee","party landslide loss in wednesday ,for the party landslide loss ,landslide loss in wednesday general ,landslide loss in wednesday ,loss in wednesday general election","['Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'the National Aseembly', 'Park Chung - hee', 'U.N.', 'Maina Kiai', 'Saenuri Party', 'Jeong Yeon - kuk', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Cho Jin - man', 'Duksung Women ’s University', 'Seoul', 'Minjoo Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'People ’s Party', 'Cho', 'Seoul National University ’s Graduate School of Public Administration']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61638403  0.08038755

The following are some of the election winners who garnered nationwide attention in their race for a parliamentary seat. Observers note that the election for the 20th National Assembly will be remembered for candidates of major parties -- Saenuri Party and The Minjoo Party of Korea -- winning in constituencies that had traditionally been their rival’s stronghold.Rep. Lee Jung-hyunSaenuri Party’s Lee Jung-hyun retained his seat in Suncheon, located in the longtime liberal base of South Jeolla Province. Lee, a close confidant of Park, had taken the constituency in the 2014 by-elections. The ruling party’s Chung Woon-chun also won a seat in Jeonju, North Jeolla Province. He became the first ruling party lawmaker from the liberal city in 20 years.But it was not just the conservatives who took victory in what was considered their rival’s home turf.Jeon Hyun-heeDecades-old Saenuri Party dominance in the traditionally conservative Gangnam-gu in Seoul was challenged by Minjoo Party candidate Jeon Hyun-hee winning the Gangnam-eul constituency. Jeon, a dentist-turned-lawyer-turned-politician, became the first opposition lawmaker from the affluent region in 24 years.Kim Boo-kyumPresident Park Geun-hye’s own political stronghold of Daegu also fell to the opposition as the Minjoo Party’s Kim Boo-kyum beat out former Gyeonggi Gov. Kim Moon-soo. It was the first time in 31 years an opposition candidate has won in the city.  Kim’s win sparked speculation for his candidacy in next year’s presidential election.Many of the high-profile independents who defected from the ruling party amid the recent nomination fiasco also emerged victorious.Rep. Yoo Seong-min, who voiced his intent to return to Saenuri upon reelection, won with over 75 percent of the votes in Daegu. Yoon Sang-hyun from Incheon was another Saenuri defector who was elected Wednesday. He was excluded from the ruling party’s nomination after an expletive-laden phone call with an acquaintance about party leader Kim Moo-sung was revealed to the public. Fellow Incheon winner Ahn Sang-soo on Thursday become the first Saenuri Party defector to formally apply to return to his old party. The party’s bigwigs have made it clear that they will not allow the return of defectors, but it also needs at least two more members to retake its position as the majority party. Rep. Suh Chung-wonAll the news was not grim for the ruling party, as its Rep. Suh Chung-won, a close associate to President Park, won his eighth term as a lawmaker. He is the longest serving incumbent lawmaker, and only six politicians -- including former President Kim Dae-jung -- have served eight or more terms. Park Ju-min Among opposition figures, first-time lawmaker Park Ju-min of the Minjoo Party is best known for legally representing the bereaved families of victims that perished in the 2014 sinking of the Sewol ferry. Upon being elected from Eunpyeong-gu, Seoul, he vowed to revise the Sewol Special Law for an extended period and get more investigation-related rights for the Sewol special investigative committee.Chin Young of the Minjoo Party has a rather peculiar resume, as he was a lawmaker for the Saenuri Party merely months before the election, but defected after failing to be nominated. The former health minister had been considered a pro-Park faction figure before he had a run-in with the president in 2013 over the government’s scaled-down basic pension plan, and then resigned as minister.Rep. Lee Hae-chanOpposition stalwart Lee Hae-chan -- a former prime minister -- also prevailed in the election, winning in the Sejong constituency as an independent after the Minjoo Party did not nominate him. Lee on Thursday visited the grave of former President Roh Moo-hyun and expressed his wish to return to the Minjoo Party. Minjoo Party leader Kim Chong-in’s refusal to nominate Lee was only one of the controversies that pelleted the main opposition’s nomination process. The dispute was fueled further by Kim’s decision to nominate himself at the No. 2 spot on the party’s proportional representation list.At the height of inner party strife, Kim even offered to resign last month, but reversed his decision after a talk with former party leader Moon Jae-in.In June, Kim will commence his fifth parliamentary term after leading his party to a surprising win over the Saenuri Party.

In the election, the opposition bloc made an unexpectedly strong showing, defying the expectations of local pollsters and analysts, who thought that the ruling conservative party would easily regain the majority. Saenuri took 122 seats in the 300-member National Assembly, while The Minjoo Party of Korea won 123 seats and the new People’s Party secured 38, according to the National Election Commission. City officials in Chuncheon, Gangwon Province, on Thursday take down the posters for Wednesday‘s general election. / YonhapIn Seoul’s heavyweight match in Jongno district, for example, polls widely predicted a victory for former Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon. But five-term lawmaker Chung Sye-kyun of the Minjoo Party defeated Oh by nearly 13 percentage points. In the highly contested Yongsan district in central Seoul, polls suggested that political newcomer Hwang Chun-ja of Saenuri Party would beat Chin Young, a former health minister and defector from the ruling party. In the end, Chin finished ahead of Hwang by 3 percentage points. In Seoul’s Nowon-A district, polls put Ko Yong-jin of the Minjoo Party at least 15 percentage points behind, but he ended up crushing his rival Lee No-keun of the Saenuri Parity by nearly 3 percentage points.  In Busan, polls predicted that the ruling Saenuri party would lose only in two constituencies. But independent and Minjoo Party candidates scored six victories. In Suncheon in South Jeolla Province, Rep. Lee Jeong-hyun of the governing party saw an unexpected upset over his liberal contender Roh Kwan-kyu, in contrast to opinion polls. Electorates remain skeptical of opinion polls, too, raising questions about the credibility of pollsters. Lim Jae-young, 27, who voted in the competitive Nowon-A constituency, told The Korea Herald that he received same phone calls asking about his intentions in the election on five occasions. “I think that opinion polls can give distorted results because it is based on selective sampling,” he said. “The polls did not impact my vote as they were widely seen among my peers as not trustworthy.” According to a survey by Realmeter on 1,054 eligible voters in early April, one in two Koreans did not trust the opinion polls. Nearly 52 percent of them thought that the polls leaned in favor of the governing party, while only 20.4 percent saw them as fair. Experts pointed to unrepresentative poll samples and heavy reliance on landline phones when conducting surveys as reasons for pollsters’ irrelevance.“The method  is not wrong, but random survey on those likely to stay at home and pick up a phone, for instance, could lead to results in favor of conservative bloc.” said Kim Myung-joon, director of Global Research. While all general election polls are carried out through landline phones in Korea, pollsters are finding it increasingly difficult to widen their range of respondents due to growing usage of mobile phones. Respondents are randomly chosen according to age and gender.Young voters, who are not usually available to answer the telephone at home, are thought to be under-represented in opinion polls. Lee Taek-soo, head of local pollster Realmeter, admitted that it is no longer possible to gauge voter sentiment through the current method. He called for a need to curb regulations and revise relevant laws to boost fairness in polls. The NEC has recently slapped penalties on some pollsters for reflecting respondents’ past voting tendencies in analyzing the results, which according to Lee is an effective way of combing out the biased pool of respondents. The election law also bans pollsters from surveying electorates through mobile phones. “The election law should also be revised to expand pollsters’ access to mobile phone numbers of electorates in polls,” he said. “The NEC should also scrap the period in which pollsters cannot reveal their survey results so that the public’ rights to know can be properly upheld.” By Ock Hyun-ju","upset over his liberal contender ,wednesday general election yonhapin seoul ,wednesday parliamentary election with questions ,election law also bans pollsters ,party candidates scored six victories","['Saenuri', 'National Assembly', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'People ’s Party', 'the National Election Commission', 'Chuncheon', 'Gangwon Province', 'wednesday‘s', 'Seoul', 'Jongno district', 'Seoul', 'Se - hoon', 'Chung sye - kyun', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Yongsan', 'Seoul', 'Hwang Chun - ja', 'Saenuri Party', 'Chin Young', 'Chin', 'Seoul', 'Ko Yong - jin', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Lee No - keun', 'the Saenuri Parity', 'Busan', 'Saenuri', 'Minjoo Party', 'Suncheon', 'South Jeolla Province', 'Lee Jeong - hyun', 'Roh Kwan - kyu', 'Lim jae - young', 'Nowon - A', 'the Korea Herald', 'Koreans', 'Kim Myung - joon', 'Global Research', 'Korea', 'Lee Taek - soo', 'realmeter', 'NEC', 'Lee', 'NEC', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61210084  0.40159625

It said 6.7 percent were caught because they used unauthorized methods to sway votes.Prosecutors said the method of election violations have been clearly shifting from bribery to spreading lies. The total number of people booked on charges of election-related offenses during this year's general elections reached 1,451 so far, with 31 people currently in custody. The figure is up 32.4 percent from that of the previous general elections which stood at 1,096.In the latest elections, the main opposition Minjoo Party and the People's Party won 123 and 38 seats, respectively.

By law, she cannot seek re-election. ""I once again want to thank the people of Nowon,"" Ahn said, saying that he will pay back by improving livelihoods and seeing better politics.The party also grabbed a total of 38 seats, far more than 20 which allows the party to form a parliamentary negotiation bloc.Meanwhile, it was a total defeat for Kim Moo-sung, chairman of the ruling Saenuri Party, although he managed to obtain his sixth parliamentary seat by beating Kim Bi-oh of the Minjoo Party in the southern port city of Busan.The Saenuri Party vowed to win a parliamentary majority, but it has to settle for just 122 seats, after it has suffered a blow due to an internal feud over the candidate nomination process.The party's victory would have been a boon for Kim's presidential chances, but its defeat has raised doubts about his leadership and appeal as a presidential contender. The lawmaker, who had been at the center of controversy offered to step down as chairman on Thursday following the polls.Moreover, the latest poll showed that 12.9 percent of people supported Kim in a potential presidential race, even behind former Seoul mayor Oh Se-hoon of the Saenuri Party, according to the NEC.The poll also showed 20.7 percent of people supported Moon Jae-in, former chairman of the Minjoo Party, in a potential presidential. Ahn is trailing behind with only 10 percent of support in the poll, although this may change with the election results.In Jongno district in central Seoul, Oh lost to Chung Sye-kyun of the Minjoo Party, who garnered more than 50 percent of the vote, said the NEC.""I will take the time of self-reflection and deeply examine myself,"" said Oh, noting that the voters are still angry at him for giving up his mayorship years ago.Meanwhile, Chung, who will take his sixth parliamentary seat, newly emerged as a new potential presidential hopeful from the liberal bloc by defeating Oh in Jongno, which is considered one of the most crucial electorates in Seoul.As for Moon, it is neither a victory nor a failure.The party successfully grabbed 123 seats, much higher than its initial goal and even managed to take three districts of wealthy Gangnam in southern Seoul, a traditional stronghold for the ruling party.However, the party was able to take victory in only three out of 28 electorates in Honam, referring to the southwestern region that has traditionally been a bastion of support for liberal parties like Minjoo.The People's Party, on the other hand, took a sweeping victory in the region by taking 23 Honam seats.Moreover, Moon earlier promised that he will retire from politics and not participate in the presidential elections if the party losses support from its home turf of the Honam.Kim Chong-in, interim chairman of Minjoo, secured his fifth parliamentary term by taking the second spot in the liberal party's 47-member proportional representative seat lineup.Of 300 lawmakers, with 253 of them to be selected through direct elections and the remaining 47 proportional representation seats to be allocated to parties according to the numbers of votes that they receive overall.Kim is the first lawmaker to be elected five times on a proportional ticket.Among the distinguishable winners is Suh Chung-won, who managed to obtain his eighth parliamentary seat after taking the victory in an electorate in Hwaseong, just south of Seoul.Suh is most likely to be elected a new parliamentary speaker, succeeding National Assembly Speaker Chung Eui-hwa.Meanwhile, a number of political heavyweights from both the ruling and opposition parties failed to enter the 20th National Assembly.Rep.

It also marks the highest turnout in 12 years since 63.9 percent was recorded in the parliamentary elections in 1996.Election officials attributed the higher-than-expected voter turnout to the highest voter turnout of an early voting that took place last week.During the two-day early voting period from Friday to Saturday, 5.13 million voters, or 12.2 percent, cast their ballots at more than 3,000 polling stations.""People's attention to politics was very high during the 19th general elections four years ago as it took place just before the presidential election,"" said an NEC official on the condition of customary anonymity, attributing to the effect of the early voting.The early voting system, adopted in the 2013 by-elections, is different from absentee voting in that it does not require voters to sign up in advance. Eligible voters can simply show up at a polling station during the pre-voting period and cast their ballots.Election officials forecast that the voter turnout could reach 60 percent during the next parliamentary elections four years later if more people are aware of the early voting system.The total turnout rate also includes the results of overseas voting that took place earlier this month in 113 countries worldwide,A total of 63,797 out of 154,217 registered overseas Koreans participated in the six-day poll, resulting in a turnout of 41.4 percent.By region, South Jeolla Province saw the highest voter turnout of 63.7 percent, followed by the administrative city of Sejong, with 63.5 percent.The southeastern industrial city of Daegu recorded the lowest voter turnout with 54.8 percent, trailed by the southern port city of Busan with 55.4 percent, the NEC said.The capital city of Seoul and its surrounding areas, which are forecast to be closely contested, saw a preliminary voter turnout of 59.8 percent.Political and survey analysts say Wednesday's voter turnout affected the outcome of the polls since a higher turnout usually means more young voters participated in the balloting.The opposition parties are traditionally more popular among younger voters, while older voters are more supportive of the conservative ruling party. During the 2004 parliamentary elections, the then-liberal party took the sweeping victory when the turnout rate was 60.6 percent.Meanwhile, the predecessor of the ruling Saenuri Party won the next elections in 2008 when the turnout rate marked 46.1 percent.","saturday 13 million voters ,to saturday 13 million voters ,national election watchdog said thursday ,saturday 13 million voters or ,korean voters cast their ballots","['south korean', 'National Assembly', 'the National Election Commission', 'NEC', 'NEC', 'Koreans', 'South Jeolla Province', 'Sejong', 'Daegu', 'Busan', 'NEC', 'Seoul', 'Saenuri Party']",19,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.29935914  0.9025439

The Vietnam War veteran is an advocate of a hawkish stance toward North Korea and has cast his ballot for conservative parties since the 1987 elections.  Saenuri Party leaders, including floor leader Rep. Won Yoo-chul , watch the exit polls Wednesday at the party headquarters in Yeouido. But this time around, he decided to exercise his right “not to vote” — a measure he believes would punish the conservative Saenuri Party mired in factional strife and its counterpart The Minjoo Party of Korea for failing to offer an alternative. “They deserve the punishment,” Cho said, venting his anger at the establishment parties. “Whether they are conservative or liberal parties, they are the same when it comes to treating the people as pushovers. They’d better know what it means when people like me refuse to vote,” he said. The mainstream parties had hailed the election as a means for the public to evaluate each sides’ legislative and political performance. But the electorate appeared to increasingly doubt that going to polling stations would address their frustration at the nation’s faltering economy, security threats and political standoffs. In many conversations on the street, cynicism appears to run deep toward elite politicians who are aloof about the interests of voters — unless it comes to asking for their votes.“I don’t know or care about who is running in our constituencies,” said Koo Jung-hoi, a 27-year-old office worker living in Suwon, south of Seoul. “Whoever represents our neighborhood doesn’t solve my problem. If I met someone who says otherwise, I would be shocked,” he said. Korean politics, with their legislative deadlock and partisan struggles, have long been blamed for voters’ frustration and antipathy. The process leading up to Wednesday’s election stood as a microcosm of the tangled political interests and power struggles. The rival parties failed to meet the deadline for enacting a law to determine the number of parliamentary seats and redraw constituencies. They managed to determine electoral rules just about a month before the election. The stalemate reached its climax when both parties were engulfed in factional infighting over nominations for the election. The parties ended up “strategically” nominating candidates based on factional interests, countering their earlier pledges to screen candidates through internal primaries. Those dropped from the nominations switched parties, leaving constituents confused, betrayed and left out.“It seems as if political frustration is sweeping across the electorate,” said Lee Byoung-hoon, a sociology professor at Chung-Ang University. “Voters no longer expect the political process to find where they hurt and solve the problem. They view it as a way of protecting established politicians,” he said.

It would also have maximized her influence in searching for a potential successor from the pool of heavily competitive candidates.President Park Geun-hye The disappointing results put a dent in Park’s long-held nickname, the “queen of election,” a title she once again attempted to revive this time at the risk of stoking debate over her obligation to stay neutral during elections, such as by making regional support visits up until right before the election day.Park’s loyalists, for their part, are expected to turn the blame onto current chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung for the lackluster results, seizing an opportunity to quell Kim’s faction, which has been unfriendly with the pro-Parks. On the legislative front, the loss of majority means the Saenuri Party would lose the force to push for changes and reform the president had highlighted since the beginning of the year. Park and the ruling party had been pushing to pass a series of bills on economic revitalization and labor reform. One such reform bill is provisionally called Basic Act on the Development of the Service Industry, which provides legal basis for financial support and deregulation in the service sector. Park said Tuesday that the bill would create 690,000 jobs within the next 15 years. But the opposition and the labor industry have opposed the act, pointing out that it also applies to fields that have been provided largely on a public level, such as medicine and education. They say that the bill will pave way for the privatization of the medical services, which will result in a gigantic surge in medical costs.The labor reform bills are also pending at the National Assembly. Park has said that this is crucial to creating jobs, while opponents said it will allow “easy layoffs” or workers and expand the number of nonguaranteed contract workers. Rival parties have also clashed over revising the National Assembly Advancement Act, which stipulates that at least 60 percent of the lawmakers must agree on a contested bill to pass it. The opposition has been fiercely opposing Saenuri‘s plan to revise the bill, which was one of the ruling party’s election pledges in the general election.Local observers have raised the possibility that the Saenuri Party might allow defectors to return in order to procure the majority, despite prominent members of the pro-Park faction like Rep. Choi Kyung-hwan saying they would never allow them to return.Rep. Yoo Seong-min, the former Saenuri floor leader who left the party amid the recent nominations fiasco, has publicly said that he would immediately return to his old party upon being elected. Dong-gu, Daegu handed him a resounding victory Wednesday with over 70 percent support.Park publicly said that the people should “judge the politics of betrayal,” which was widely perceived as targeting Yoo and those who opposed her welfare policies.

The turnout is 3.8 percentage points higher than in the previous general election in 2012, according to the National Election Commission. The official turnout was set to be announced early Thursday.The higher turnout is credited to record-high early voting participation and the presence of a new centrist party seen as an alternative to the long-standing two-party system. The turnout was notably high in constituencies in Jeolla Province where two opposition parties — The Minjoo Party of Korea and People’s Party — fiercely competed. The country saw the highest voter turnout in South Jeolla Province at 63.7 percent, followed by the administrative city of Sejong at 63.5 percent and North Jeolla Province at 62.9 percent. Conservative bastion Daegu recorded the lowest turnout of 54.8 percent, with Busan ranking second-lowest at 55.4 percent. Seoul’s turnout was 59.8 percent, slightly higher than the nation’s average. Early voting on Friday and Saturday, held for the first time for a parliamentary election, hit a record high of 12.2 percent. The system was first introduced for by-elections in June 2013. More than 40 percent of South Korean voters living abroad have also cast ballots, accounting for around 3.2 percent of the total. Overseas voting took place at 198 polling booths across 113 countries.A higher turnout is generally thought to advantage the liberal camp, which has the broad backing of young voters, while a low turnout is thought to benefit the conservative bloc. The liberal party won big in the selection of the 17th National Assembly in 2004, when the turnout was 60.6 percent. The right-wing party had a strong showing in the next election in 2008 when the turnout was 46.1 percent. Rain seems to have held voters at home earlier in the day. But the turnout exceeded that of the previous election by around 1 p.m. as the weather cleared up and early voting turnout was included. When it rained in 2008 and 2012, voter turnout was among its lowest at 46.1 percent and 54.2 percent, respectively.But the turnout was relatively higher on sunny days, with the 15th general election in 1996 recording 63.9 percent and the aforementioned 60.6 percent in 2004.

Moon Jae-in had the lead with an approval rating of 20 percent.He was followed by the ruling Saenuri Party-affiliated former Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon, the newborn minority People’s Party cochairman Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo and incumbent Saenuri chief Rep. Kim Moo-sung.Current Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon and Saenuri defector Rep. Yoo Seong-min also kept their names on the list.The Minjoo Party’s Moon, having stepped down from leadership and renounced candidacy for the April parliamentary race from the beginning, has kept a relative distance from the election. The essential variable for him is the outcome in the Gwangju and the Jeolla provinces, dubbed the Honam region, where voters have hinted at withdrawing their longtime political loyalty to the party. Recovering support from the region is considered crucial for Moon to cement his bid for the nation’s top job.Voters in the nation’s southwest belt have increasingly accused the Busan-based Moon of neglecting and mistreating the longtime opposition stronghold.“Should  withdraw its support from me, I will readily move off the political frontline and renounce my candidacy in the presidential election,” Moon had said last Friday, addressing the citizens of Gwangju.“An opposition candidate who fails to mirror the Honam spirit may be considered unqualified .”Though he did not specify the number of seats that will determine his political fate, the runner-up of the 2012 presidential election made it clear that he will not bypass public sentiment in the key strategic area.One big hurdle for Moon is the People’s Party, which has embraced a number of senior Honam-based Minjoo defectors. The party has been widely forecast to make a stable landing as the third largest parliamentary group.People’s Party’s cochief Ahn Cheol-soo continues to face a dilemma of how to reach out to those that remain loyal the Minjoo Party, or to persuade future voters of his political identity.Saenuri chief Kim, meanwhile, has underlined that this year’s parliamentary election is to be his last and that he will step down from party leadership after the polls, regardless of the results. This was taken as a sign that he will be shifting his prime focus to the presidential election.“I wish to play a greater role, so help me,” he said several times while campaigning in his Busan constituency.The lack of endorsement from President Park Geun-hye has been Kim’s weakest point, as pro-Park members are reportedly considering backing other high-profile figures such as U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the party’s presidential ticket.To make up for such vulnerability, Kim had been striving to steer the party to a solid majority victory and thus prove his leadership -- a plan which turned sour as the Saenuri fell short of its ambitions.Former Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon, too, drifted a step away from potential presidency after losing to ranking opposition rival in Seoul’s politically symbolic district of Jongno, based on exit polls.Oh, who had resigned from his mayoral seat in 2011 amid a dispute with the city council over free school meals, sought to make a comeback, leaning on his public recognition, as well as the subtle support of the pro-Park faction.One of the newcomers on the list is Rep. Yoo Seong-min, who successfully ran as an independent in his current constituency in conservative-leaning Daegu. The relatively reformative lawmaker, who was once seen as one of the closest aides to the president, came into public spotlight through his feuds with the party leadership and Cheong Wa Dae.The peak of the conflict was when then-floor leader Yoo agreed with the opposition to revise the parliamentary advancement bill which had been motioned by President Park.Yoo’s obvious exclusion from party nomination, which led to his defection at the eleventh hour, created an image of martyrdom and boosted his position among non-Park conservatives.By Bae Hyun-jung","ranking among potential presidential runners ,aggressive challenges recent public polls ,potential presidential runners the greater ,presidential election wish to play ,the parties potential presidential runners","['the Minjoo Party', 'Korea ’s', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Saenuri Party', 'Seoul', 'Se - hoon', 'People ’s Party', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Saenuri', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'the Minjoo Party ’s Moon', 'Jeolla', 'Honam', 'Moon', 'Busan', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Honam', 'Moon', 'the People ’s Party', 'Honam', 'Minjoo', 'People ’s Party ’s', 'Ahn Cheol', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Saenuri', 'Kim', 'Busan', 'Park Geun', 'Kim', 'U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Kim', 'Saenuri', 'Seoul', 'Se - hoon', 'Seoul', 'Jongno', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Daegu', 'Cheong', 'Yoo', 'Park', 'non - park', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66325164 -0.00519936

An official counting exit polls questions citizens at a polling station in Ulsan on Wednesday. The 15th general election in 1996 say 63.9 percent of votes, which henceforth continued to remain lower at 57.2 percent in 2000, 60.6 percent in 2004, 46.1 percent in 2008 and 54.2 percent in 2012.It rained in both 2008 and 2012 where the voter turnout was one of the lowest in history.This year, observers have cautiously predicted the ratio to surge nearly 60 percent, considering the highest voter turnout for early voting at 12.2 percent.It has been a popular belief, although never numerically proven, that good weather is more benefiting to a conservative party and bad weather is more favorable for a liberal party.It was based on the notion that younger voters tend to spend the day on outings if the weather is sunny instead of voting.But neither party appeared to depend too much on the meteorological aspect of the polls.Recent election outcomes also shun this theory.While the 15th to 17th elections were conducted in sunny days, the voter turnout among 20s and 30s was lower than in the 18th and 19th election when it rained.This time, regardless of the weather condition, young voters have shown relatively stronger determination to vote, observers note.According to Realmeter, of the 2,536 eligible voters surveyed nationwide on April 4-8, 72.3 percent of those in their 30s said they will “actively vote.” It was the highest percentage out of all age groups.","19th election when it rained ,voters surveyed nationwide on april ,an official counting exit polls ,polls recent election outcomes also ,of the polls recent election","['National Assembly', 'Korea Meteorological Administration', 'weather', 'Ulsan']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.78546029  0.44724056

Each voter is asked to cast two ballots: one for a candidate and the other for a party.Voting opened at 6 a.m. and will close 12 hours later.Voter turnout stood at 16.1 percent as of 11:00 a.m., with 6.79 million of the total 42.1 million eligible voters having cast their ballots, the National Election Commission said. The turnout rate is lower than that recorded in the previous regional elections in 2014, when the number reached 18.9 percent at the same point in time. The NEC expects the final voter turnout may reach some 60 percent although full official tallies are not expected until about 2:00 a.m. Thursday. The competition is basically a two-way race between the ruling Saenuri Party and the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea, with Saenuri forecast to win an easy victory, although it may lose some seats in its traditional strongholds to independents.However, many also forecast that the splinter People's Party will grab more than 20 seats, which would allow it to form a parliamentary negotiation bloc.Voter turnout will affect the outcome of the polls as a higher turnout would mean more young voters participated in the balloting.The opposition parties are traditionally more popular among younger voters, while older voters are more supportive of the conservative ruling party. The surveys conducted by four local pollsters last week showed that Saenuri could grab between 150 to 175 seats, while the Minjoo Party of Korea will likely secure fewer than 100 seats, shy of its initial goal of 107 seats.The People's Party is likely to win 28-32 seats on the strong backing of voters in the Honam region in the southeastern part of the country, according to the surveys.A majority win for the ruling party will allow Park to exercise control over state affairs more effectively and make it possible for her to push for various economic and social reforms.Wednesday's elections are also a crucial test for potential presidential hopefuls, including Kim Moo-sung, head of the ruling Saenuri Party; Moon Jae-in, former leader of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea; and Ahn Cheol-soo, who left the Minjoo Party to create the People's Party.South Koreans will go to the polls in December 2017 to elect a new president to succeed Park, whose single five-year term ends in early 2018. By law, she cannot seek re-election.Kim, who is seeking his sixth parliamentary term in the southern port city of Busan, has a lot to prove to party members although the party's victory could help smooth over the recent feud between various factions.Moon's election victory would also solidify his image as a competent presidential candidate, while Ahn's successful achievement of taking more than 20 seats would prove his credentials as a potential leader.Eligible voters in Wednesday's polls total about 42.1 million, more than 80 percent of South Korea's 50 million population, the NEC said.Voters will cast their ballots at a total of 13,837 polling stations across the country, it said.","presidential race the quadrennial polls ,2017 to elect new president ,of next year presidential race ,wednesday elections are also crucial ,year presidential race the quadrennial","['National Assembly', 'Park Geun', 'the National Assembly', 'the National Election Commission', 'NEC', 'Saenuri Party', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Saenuri', ""People 's Party"", 'voter', 'Saenuri', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', ""the People 's Party"", 'Honam', 'Park', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Saenuri Party', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Ahn Cheol', 'the Minjoo Party', ""the People 's Party"", 'South Koreans', 'Park', 'Kim', 'Busan', 'Moon', 'Ahn', ""South Korea 's"", 'NEC']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.74022168  0.40028879

The competition rate is 3.7 to one, compared with 3.76 to one in the previous parliamentary elections in 2012, the country's election watchdog said.Leaders of the ruling Saenuri Party visited Seoul and its surrounding areas Tuesday, as up for grabs are 122 constituencies in the so-called capital city region, cited as a crucial battleground.Chairman Kim Moo-sung first traveled to Suwon, just south of Seoul, to help bolster the chances of a Saenuri Party candidate there.""The Saenuri Party's sweeping victory is the only way to revitalize the economy and to bring hope to young people by creating more jobs,"" Kim said during a street rally in Suwon.After making a dozen stops, Kim traveled to his own electorate in the southern port city of Busan and will cast his ballot on election day.He and other Saenuri leaders have accused the opposition of holding up crucial legislation that can boost the country's economic competitiveness in such areas as the labor market.The latest surveys show that the Saenuri will take an easy victory, although it may lose some seats in its traditional strongholds to independents who defected from the party.The leadership of the Minjoo Party of Korea also focused its campaigns in the same areas, pleading for voter support to keep Saenuri in check.Kim Chong-in, after traveling to the southern resort island of Jeju, visited nearly 20 electorates in Seoul that are forecast to be closely contested.""The Saenuri will grab another chance if voters pick an opposition party that is not the proper one,"" Kim said during a street rally on Jeju Island, apparently warning voters not to cast their ballots for the People's Party. Minjoo has maintained that voting for the rival opposition party is tantamount to handing victory over to the Saenuri.Kim called for the judgment of the incumbent administration's handling of the economy, saying the government and Saenuri failed to improve the people's livelihoods.The People's Party, which is likely to grab more than 20 seats on the strong backing of voters in the Honam region in the southeastern part of the country, focused its attention on Seoul.Securing 20 seats would allow the party to form a parliamentary negotiation bloc.Ahn Cheol-soo, the party's co-chairman, made visits to a dozen electorates in Seoul and its surrounding area that the party believes its candidates has chances of winning.""Saenuri and Minjoo both failed even when they had so many opportunities,"" said Ahn during a Seoul street rally. Ahn, who has many supporters in the 20-40 age bracket, finished his campaign trail at his electoral district of Nowon in northern Seoul to woo voters.","at midnight wednesday general elections ,up their official campaigns tuesday ,midnight wednesday general elections ,their official campaigns tuesday ,midnight wednesday general elections are","[""South Korea 's"", 'National Assembly', 'Saenuri Party', 'Seoul', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Suwon', 'Seoul', 'Saenuri Party', '""The Saenuri Party \'s', 'Kim', 'Suwon', 'Kim', 'Busan', 'Saenuri', 'Saenuri', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Chong - in', 'Jeju', 'Seoul', 'Saenuri', 'Kim', ""the People 's Party"", 'Minjoo', 'Saenuri', 'Kim', 'Saenuri', ""the People 's Party"", 'Honam', 'Seoul', 'Ahn Cheol - soo', 'Seoul', 'Minjoo', 'Ahn', 'Seoul', 'Nowon', 'Seoul']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.69408643  0.53123391

Chung Jin-seok’s canvassing in South Chungcheong Province. Rep. Chung is an uncle of Lee’s husband, Chung Ho-young.Actress Lee Young-ae joins a campaign in support of ruling Saenuri Party’s candidate Rep. Chung Jin-seok on Monday. “I have known Rep. Chung for a long time and he is a sincere and honest man. I hope you all support him,” said Lee to potential voters.Trot singer Tae Jin-ah made an appearance at a mini concert on Sunday during a campaign to garner votes for Rep. Park Duk-hyum of the Saenuri Party in North Chungcheong Province. Actor Song Il-guk also stepped in to help his mother Rep. Kim Eul-dong of the Saenuri Party, a second-term lawmaker who is running for a position in Seoul’s southeastern Songpa-C district.Political parties have traditionally aimed to share in the popularity of well-established social influencers to maximize stumping.Celebrity endorsements are nothing new in Korea, although until the 1970s, TV stars’ participation in politics usually served as a means for the iron-fisted government to expand their propaganda. With democratization, more voluntary forms of political involvement by entertainers were seen, with stars using their status to voice out on various social issues.More recently, with the advent of social media, more celebrities have begun to voice their political views. The rise of such “politainers” -- celebrities who freely participate in political and social issues -- include singer Lee Hyo-ri, an animal rights advocator who also supports laborers, and Kim Jang-hoon, a vocal campaigner for the Dokdo Islets. Their political participation, however, has also sometimes garnered backlash, as they were often scrutinized for their “biased” views by those opposed, or for slips of the tongue.An actor, who has been featured in 10 or more TV dramas and commercials, told The Korea Herald that expressing his political preference always comes with caution.“I am very concerned about my image as an actor and how my preference may influence my choice of works in the future,” said the actor, who wished to remain anonymous.While celebrities are raising their voices in political issues with risk, stars such as TV show host Kim Je-dong have allegedly faced trouble for having expressed political preferences. In 2015, Kim participated in a one-man protest against the government’s publishing of state-authored Korean history textbooks for middle and high school students.Singer Kim Jang-hoon also confessed to local media that he has experienced disadvantages in performing on stage because he took part in campaigns for the Dokdo Islets and Sewol ferry accident.Experts say despite different reactions to stars’ involvement in the political scene, the role of celebrities in political issues will continue.“Politicians and entertainers have one thing in common: they live by their social images,” said professor of media communications Song Hae-ryong from Sungkyunkwan University.“Celebrities will always get involved in politics and they will always have the opportunity to influence public opinion,” he added.But the changes that their actions may bring are generally difficult to measure.“Stars may have far-reaching power, especially in the political scene, because the general public considers politics as something difficult and an issue that they are not involved in,” professor of psychology Lee Taek-kwang from Kyunghee University told The Korea Herald.“But celebrities’ political participation can be viewed as populism unless their endorsement brings practical change to policies and current political circles,” added Lee.By Kim Da-sol","voters on monday actress lee ,week for wednesday general election ,voters on monday actress ,concert on sunday during campaign ,wednesday general election drawing mixed","['Lee Young', 'Tae Jin - ah', 'Lee Young', 'Saenuri Party ’s', 'Chung Jin - seok', 'South Chungcheong Province', 'Chung', 'Lee ’s', 'Chung Ho - young', 'Actress Lee Young - ae', 'Saenuri Party ’s', 'Chung Jin - seok', 'Chung', 'Lee', 'Tae Jin - ah', 'Park Duk - hyum', 'the Saenuri Party', 'North Chungcheong Province', 'Song Il - guk', 'Kim Eul - dong', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Seoul', 'Songpa - C', 'Korea', 'Lee Hyo - ri', 'Kim Jang - hoon', 'the Dokdo Islets', 'the Korea Herald', 'Kim Je - dong', 'Kim', 'korean', 'Kim Jang - hoon', 'the Dokdo Islets', 'sewol', 'Song hae - ryong', 'Sungkyunkwan University', 'Lee Taek - kwang', 'Kyunghee University', 'the Korea Herald', 'Lee', 'Kim Da - sol']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63863581  0.43437788

The latter will decide the parties’ approval rating and consequently allocate the number of proportional representatives.Officials check the ballot count equipment set up at a high school in Yeongdeungpo, Seoul, Tuesday. According to NEC data, this year’s electorate consists of some 42 million nationals, up 4.7 percent from the last parliamentary election in 2012.The 5.1 million who cast their ballot in advance during the early voting from Friday to Saturday last week are excluded from Wednesday’s main vote.While the outcome remains hazy due to close races in many constituencies, ranking political parties devoted their last reserves of strength to canvassing metropolitan areas.Leading political parties spent the last legitimate day of electioneering on rallying votes in the Seoul-Gyeonggi zone, which contains nearly half of the nation’s constituencies and the largest ratio of undecided swing voters.“Our party will face a momentous crisis, unless those who care for us step out and vote, helping us achieve the parliamentary majority,” said ruling conservative Saenuri Party’s chief Rep. Kim Moo-sung, stumping for party candidates in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province. “The Saenuri’s victory is the only way to revitalize the economy and to offer jobs to the youths.”Kim also mentioned the increasing military threat from neighboring North Korea, in a bid to remind voters that economy and national security have always been within the conservative camp’s forte.Expressing concerns on the relatively low early turnout in the party’s stronghold regions and on the decrease of political zeal from elderly age groups, the senior politician continued to call for union and action from conventional advocators.Regardless, the ruling party is inwardly anticipating achieving its target number of parliamentary seats, or more, thanks to the split of opposition votes.The Saenuri Party, which was once forecast to take as many as 180 out of the 300 seats, has lowered its ambitions to 150.The party’s chief election strategist Rep. Kweon Seong-dong, however, claimed that the detailed estimation as of Tuesday was about 145 seats.The main opposition, The Minjoo Party of Korea, is hoping to make it over the 100-seat mark, possibly up to 107, which is the figure that party chief Kim Chong-in pledged to achieve.The lower limit for the party is 90 seats, in which case it will have yielded most of its longtime stronghold electorates in Gwangju and Jeolla provinces to the fledgling minority People’s Party.Party spokesperson Kim Sung-soo said in a radio interview Tuesday that the party is not likely to make it over 100 seats, even assuming victory in tightly contested areas and including proportional representatives.With such sense of crisis, the party’s incumbent and former chiefs Kim Chong-in and Moon Jae-in urged voters to gather forces for the main opposition party so as to curb the political monopoly of the ruling party.“If  uphold an unqualified opposition party, it will only act in the benefit of the Saenuri Party,” said Kim, referring to the People’s Party, which has been undermining his party’s votes.Rep. Moon, during his eleventh-hour visit to Gwangju, demanded that voters cast their ballots for Minjoo Party candidates in their districts and divert their party approval ballots to other minority parties.His approach was taken as a second-best plan, in awareness that the “Honam” region, which has been growing apart from the main opposition party, would not readily give out both of their votes.The People’s Party, on the other hand, is confident of winning in the southwestern Gwangju-Jeolla belt and has eyes on buoying its parliamentary seat number to 35-40. Its current figure is 20, the minimum number required for a party to constitute a parliamentary bargaining unit.Meanwhile, the party’s election teams remained tense on the weather circumstances, as the Meteorological Administration forecast rain on polling day.According to private weather forecaster K-Weather, the turnout in past parliamentary elections fell under the influence of the weather. In the 1996, 2000 and 2004 elections, when the weather was sunny, the nation’s average turnout stood at around 60 percent. Over the past two recent elections, however, the figures fell to as low as the 40 percent range.The impact is expected to be the most conspicuous for senior citizens aged 60 or more, who account for 23 percent of the nation’s entire electorate.The age group, however, has been less enthusiastic over voting. A public survey conducted by the NEC showed that 75.7 percent of the 60 or older group were actively willing to vote, which was down 4.9 percent from the last election.By Bae Hyun-jung","presidential election wednesday parliamentary race ,next year presidential election wednesday ,election wednesday parliamentary race ,presidential election wednesday ,presidential election wednesday parliamentary","['National Assembly', 'Voter', 'Assembly', 'the National Election Commission', 'Yeongdeungpo', 'Seoul', 'NEC', 'Saenuri Party ’s', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Suwon', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Saenuri', 'North Korea', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Kweon Seong - dong', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Kim Chong - in', 'Jeolla', 'People ’s Party', 'Kim Sung - soo', 'Kim Chong - in', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Kim', 'the People ’s Party', 'Moon', 'Minjoo Party', 'the People ’s Party', 'K - Weather', 'NEC', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43831307  0.06428424

The Minjoo Party for its part, has predicted less than 100 seats for itself, considerably less than Saenuri’s prediction of 120 for the main opposition. The Saenuri Party on the other hand is predicting that it will get 145 seats while Minjoo has put its prediction for the ruling party as high as 180. While the modest numbers have been widely perceived as a ruse to rally support, some experts say that their predictions may be accurate.“I don’t think they  are pretending to be weak. The Saenuri’s prediction of 145 is realistic, and it is hard for the Minjoo Party to gain 100 parliamentary seats,” said Shin Yul, a professor of political science at Myongji University.  The recent polls by Gallup Korea revealed earlier in the month showed 37 percent support for Saenuri, 21 percent for the Minjoo and 12 percent for the People’s Party.“Polls represent a trend. Support for Saenuri is clearly dropping, support for the Minjoo is stagnant and the People’s Party is trending up,” he said. Despite the faltering support for Saenuri, the divided opposition bloc makes prospects grim also for the Minjoo, as votes for opposition candidates can be split. Even the Saenuri Party’s election strategy director Kweon Seong-dong, who has been projecting modest numbers for his party, admitted that the three-way race was beneficial to Saenuri.Traditionally, prominent opposition candidates for a major election would “unify” under the common cause of beating the ruling party candidate. This would result in all but one of the candidates dropping out of the race. This was apparent in the 2012 presidential election, when then-independent candidate Ahn Cheol-soo forfeited his candidacy in support of Moon Jae-in, his rival in the opposition bloc. Moon narrowly lost the election to President Park Geun-hye.Four years on, the former allies have turned on each other as they battle for the votes.The two parties have been fighting particularly for support in the North and South Jeolla provinces, traditionally a political stronghold for the opposition. With several prominent Jeolla-based opposition politicians including Chung Dong-young and Park Jie-won defecting to the People’s Party from the Minjoo Party, the minor opposition party has rapidly been gaining momentum and prominence. “I cannot but hold former Minjoo leader Moon Jae-in responsible for the division of the Jeolla provinces and the opposition,” Park said on his Facebook page.In the waning moments of the election campaign, Moon visited the Jeolla areas to win back Minjoo’s campaign. People’s Party’s coleader Ahn, on the other hand, concentrated his efforts in Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi Province.Moon and Minjoo have been recommending “tactical voting,” in which voters support a candidate more likely to win instead of for their most-preferred candidate. Some supporters of minor opposition parties have opted for this method, voting for a candidate from the main opposition in a bid to prevent Saenuri dominance. Korean voters pick both a candidate and a political party they support in the general election, and the parliament’s proportional representative seats are given to parties based on the percentage of the votes each of them receive.  Regardless of the results, experts warned that losing support of the Jeolla region could be fatal for the Minjoo Party. “In Korean politics, a political party without a stronghold  cannot survive,” said professor Shin. He took the example of former President Roh Moo-hyun’s now-defunct Uri Party, which won a majority in the 2004 general election but ultimately lost prominence due to a failure to win support from the Jeolla region. The traditionally conservative North and South Gyeongsang provinces have given over 80 percent of their votes to Saenuri candidates, while progressive Jeolla regions have given equally overwhelming support to the opposition.“It will be a confusing time for the opposition bloc , as the parties could go through a major overhaul,” Shin said.

According to Real Meter, a poll conducted last week showed that the highest turnout for “active voters” was among those in their 30s at 72.3 percent. This was followed by those in their 40s and 20s at 70.3 and 65.1 percent, respectively. The figure was 59 and 54.7 percent respectively for those in their 50s and people aged 60 or above. YonhapThe overall ratio of people who said they were determined to vote rose by 5.9 percentage points from 63.9 percent a week before, Realmeter said.By political disposition of the respondents, 73.2 percent of those that identified themselves as progressives said they would definitely vote. The respective ratios were 67.6 percent among moderates and 61.7 percent among conservatives.The pollster, however, indicated that the higher ratio among liberals does not necessarily lead to better chances for progressive candidates.“While comparatively lower, those in the  age groups with conservative tendencies have also shown an increase in the level of determination to vote. … This generation is also perceived as a group with high voter turnout regardless of their initial indication to vote or not,” Realmeter said in the report.With two days remaining to polling day, both the ruling and main opposition parties have continued to project modest numbers for their potential parliamentary seats in an attempt to rally support.The recent strategies of both the ruling Saenuri and the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea have been to try to win sympathy from their supporters, many of whom have expressed disappointment at the parties’ nomination fiascos. Both Minjoo and Saenuri have been insisting that their rivals will do better than anticipated.Rep. Kweon Seog-dong, Saenuri’s election strategy director, said in a radio interview that the party is expected to win 142 to 145 parliamentary seats in the election. He added that Minjoo will win at least 120 seats.It marked a stark contrast to what Jeong Jang-sun, chief strategist for the Minjoo Party in the election, had said the day before. Jang said that his party would win less than 100 seats.“The Minjoo is saying false predictions to win more votes by rallying its supporters,” Kweon said.By Yoon Min-sik","will actively vote in wednesday ,election poll showed monday ,64 percent of koreans said ,vote in wednesday general election ,actively vote in wednesday general","['Koreans', 'Meter', 'Realmeter', 'Saenuri', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Minjoo', 'Saenuri', 'Kweon Seog - dong', 'Saenuri ’s', 'Minjoo', 'Jeong Jang - sun', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Minjoo', 'Kweon', 'Yoon Min - sik']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39646873  0.5033049

Many of the policies also resemble one another, making them less of a factor for voters in casting their support.The ruling Saenuri Party, for one, pledges to take a “tailored” approach toward their welfare policies by offering targeted recipients with the required assistance. The conservative party had promised to adopt universal welfare policies during previous elections, such as free education and child care for all. Citizens watch a general election campaign in Wonju, Gangwon Province. Yonhap“In order to maximize efficient use of limited resources, we need to shift from universal welfare programs toward tailored policies,” said Kang Bong-kyun who manages the Saenuri Party’s election campaign. “Based on the tailored approach, we have determined our election pledges,” he said. Except for a commitment to “gradually” provide free education to all high school students, the Saenuri Party decided to remove universal welfare programs from their manifestos. Instead, they introduced programs targeting specific recipients. Among them is the pledge to increase the basic pension for senior citizens “without measures to live their retirement.” The party said that it would determine who needs assistance the most and raise the pension to 400,000 won per month. The main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea introduced a broader but similar approach toward senior citizens. The liberal party vowed to raise the basic pension to 300,000 won by 2018 for all senior citizens outside the top 30 percent by income. Even though both parties scaled back, they have still failed to come up with specific ways to fund these welfare programs. According to the parties’ manifestoes, the Saenuri Party’s initiative would cost about 56 trillion won and the Minjoo Party’s would cost some 148 trillion won. The Saenuri Party seeks to collect more taxes by “revitalizing” the economy, while the Minjoo Party vows to increase corporate taxes and divert money from National Pension Fund to help fund the programs. “It would cost more than 200 trillion won for the parties to implement those programs. But their plans do not sound like viable plans to secure money,” said Lee Kwang-jae, the secretary-general of the Korea Manifesto Center, a civic group to monitor the parties’ election pledges. Other aspects of the parties’ welfare promises, in the meantime, are almost identical, the observers noted, right down to how they are abstract without details.All three parties -- Saenuri, Minjoo and the People’s Party -- vow to provide services to support women who have had their career suspended due to childbirth and child care. The Gender Ministry already runs 136 such agencies nationwide.Both the Saenuri Party and the Minjoo Party promise to improve the learning environment of “classrooms suffering from sweltering heat or freezing temperatures.”All three parties pledge to build more infrastructure to help mobility of the disabled, without any details.The two leading parties also touch on helping women and children victims of abuse, a topic of attention this year following several high-profile cases, also, without clear details.For the elderly, the pledges continue to be “populist,” according to critics.The Saenuri Party vows to create more than 500,000 jobs by creating a special economic zone for local companies returning home after operating overseas. The Minjoo Party pledges to create more than 700,000 jobs for young people by expanding mandatory youth employment measures to not just state-run institutions but also private companies. The liberal party argues that the plan could create more than 250,000 jobs. But critics have said that the Minjoo Party’s plan is a measure that could distort the labor market and accused the Saenuri Party’s program of duplicating former election pledges made during President Park Geun-hye’s presidential campaign. “The parties’ pledges to create more jobs need to be thoroughly monitored and assessed,” said Baak Kyung-hoon, a vice president for the Youth Forum. “We should be worried about rosy promises with fancy numbers,” he said.

Kim Moo-sung, the outspoken leader of the ruling conservative Saenuri Party, made direct shots at individual opposition candidates. The Minjoo Party of Korea’s Kim Chong-in, in contrast, kept his aim at the ruling party in general and the incumbent Park Geun-hye administration.Saenuri Party chief Rep. Kim Moo-sung  has lunch while campaigning in Junggu, Busan, Monday. The Minjoo Party of Korea chief Kim Chong-in urges voters to cast their ballot wearing a picket on a street in Seonneung, southern Seoul, on Monday. The Saenuri’s Kim started off his day in Ulsan, an industrial city in the conservative southeastern corner of Korea.“Someone who used to belong to the unconstitutional Unified Progressive Party should not be elected as representative,” Kim said in Ulsan’s Dong-gu constituency, while stumping for party candidate Ahn Hyo-dae.He thus fired directly at independent candidate Kim Jong-hoon, who rivals Ahn in the area.The far-left minority UPP was disbanded back in 2014 after being defined by the Constitutional Court as an unconstitutional political unity based on National Security Law.On the previous day, the Saenuri chief had hurled a similar ideological attack upon former Minjoo Party leader Rep. Moon Jae-in.“The Minjoo Party contributed to the infiltration of pro-North figures into the National Assembly by uniting with the UPP back in the 2012 general elections,” Kim said Sunday during his Seoul campaigning tour.“Moon, who has never apologized for the consequences, is once again plotting to ally with pro-communist cliques.”When cheering for Rep. Kim Eul-dong in Seoul’s southeastern Songpa-C on the same day, Kim depicted Minjoo candidate Rep. Nam In-soon as a radical who advocates homosexuality.“Homosexuality is an outrage against humanity, yet candidate Nam is seeking to pass a bill to allow such disorderly actions within the Army,” Kim claimed. The opposition lawmaker had motioned a revised military criminal law in 2013, expanding the scope of what is considered rape in the army from “women” to “people,” stating that men could also be victims of sex crimes.According to the revised article, consensual homosexual relationships may no longer be punished by the military court.The main opposition party, whose motto is to judge the economic misadministration of the current government, chose to reiterate what they branded as “the greater cause.”“A powerful opposition party is absolutely necessary in order to stop the monopolizing ruling party from disregarding and mocking the people,” said Minjoo chief Kim in a speech to the nation on Monday.“This year’s parliamentary election is all about judging the errors of the Saenuri Party and of the Park Geun-hye government.”Kim also stayed largely aloof amid attacks on his affluent assets, following news reports over the weekend in which the ruling party cited his wealth as a contradiction for opposition leader who speaks of economic democratization and distribution of wealth.“The ruling party should be ashamed of its false, fault-finding propaganda,” said the party’s spokesperson Kim Sung-soo.Both Kims headed to Jejudo Island later in the afternoon to canvass the self-governing province which has three legislative seats.Jejudo is the place of the 1948 April 3 movement, in which numerous civilians were killed while fighting against the military rule. Considered a longtime opposition stronghold, the island has voted in Minjoo lawmakers with landslide majorities for the past 12 years.But this year, the ruling party is eyeing a possible victory, as two of the three constituencies are caught in neck-and-neck races within the margin of error, reflecting a split in opposition votes due to the newborn centrist minority People’s Party.People’s Party cochairman Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo greets citizens at Bupeyong Station in Incheon on Monday. Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, on the other hand, continued to criticize the nation’s bipartisan frame, underlining the necessity of a counterbalancing third party.“It’s the politics, stupid,” Ahn said Monday, quoting former U.S. President Bill Clinton’s famous remarks on the economy back in the 1992 election.“There will be no real solution to anything as long as the No. 1 and No. 2 parties keep on brawling.”While parties geared up with their last-minute sprint, the presidential house once again came under fire for making regional trips amid election campaigns.Last Friday, which was also the first day of early voting. President Park visited the creative economy innovation centers in North Jeolla and North Chungcheong provinces.Cheong Wa Dae claimed that the trip was a “economic action short of political intentions” to review the achievements of state-backed organizations, but opposition parties blasted upon the president’s “timely” schedule as an obvious to exert her influence.By Bae Hyun-jung","monday to stump for party ,amid election campaigns last friday ,their campaign tours on monday ,campaign tours on monday ,campaigning in junggu busan monday","['Kim Moo - sung', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Kim Chong - in', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'Junggu , Busan', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Kim Chong - in', 'Seonneung', 'Seoul', 'Saenuri', 'Kim', 'Ulsan', 'Korea', 'Progressive Party', 'Kim', 'Ulsan', 'Ahn Hyo - dae', 'Kim Jong - hoon', 'Ahn', 'UPP', 'the Constitutional Court', 'National Security Law', 'Saenuri', 'Minjoo Party', 'Moon Jae - in', '“the Minjoo Party', 'the National Assembly', 'UPP', 'Kim', 'Seoul', 'Kim Eul - dong', 'Seoul', 'Songpa - C', 'Kim', 'Minjoo', 'Nam', 'Nam', 'Army', 'Kim', 'Minjoo', 'Kim', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Kim Sung - soo', 'Kims', 'Minjoo', 'People ’s Party', 'People ’s Party', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Ahn Cheol', 'U.S.', 'Bill Clinton', 'Park', 'North Jeolla', 'Dae', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24962054  0.25905657

According to analysis by local daily Joongang Ilbo, it would take the future 20th National Assembly more than 1 quadrillion won  to carry out their pledges, far exceeding this year’s national budget set for 380 trillion won -- which is already a 10 trillion won increase from the year before.  National Assembly The Joongang Ilbo, together with Korea Manifesto Center, gathered the data by requesting from the 935 candidates running for a seat in the National Assembly their five core policies and the budget required for them. The request had a less-than-half answer rate of 44.8 percent.Article 66 of the current election law stipulates that, unlike presidential elections, candidates in a general election are not obligated to produce printed policy booklets or state their intended mode of securing funds.Although only 419 out of 935 candidates gave answers, their combined estimated budget already went over the predetermined national budget of 380 trillion won. The 419 candidates said they would need 407 trillion won in total to carry out their regional policies, which mostly concerned construction of social overhead capital projects, like highways, railways and subways, while also including large-sized themed parks and tourism districts.Candidate Kim Yung-rok from The Minjoo Party of Korea aspired to build an underwater high speed rail link connecting South Jeolla Province and Jejudo Island and a railway linking the seaport town Mokpo and the green tea town Boseong. Kim said his policies alone would require funding of 22.6 trillion won. Regarding how he would secure the money to realize his plans, Kim hoped to push his plans as national projects upon winning election.Kim’s rival candidate Yoon Young-il of the People’s Party did not submit his policy budget. Apart from regional policies, if national policies were also included in the picture -- rosy but unrealistic policies such as free nationwide high school education and additional free medical care for children under the age of 15 -- the total budget would stretch to 1.017 quadrillion won. The reason for the fuss about the money issues is that all this staggering increase in budget would translate to increases in taxation.Lee Gwang-jae, secretary general of the Korea Manifesto Center, argued for a revision to the current election law. “The Public Official Election Act should be revised to obligate the aspiring members of the National Assembly to clearly set out their planned time of policy implementation and their ways of securing funding,” Lee said.Yoon Jong-bin, professor of politics and foreign affairs at Myungji University, also called for establishing a monitoring body under the central election committee to discern the veracity of the policies proposed by candidates.

The corresponding turnout in the 2014 local elections was 11.5 percent.South Jeolla Province, in the southwest of the country that is leaned toward the opposition, had the highest turnout, while the conservative stronghold city of Busan had the lowest. Seoul’s turnout was close to the national average.Once voting hours ended, the boxes were sealed with a special sealing paper in the presence of election officials and observers, and then transported from individual polling stations to regional NEC offices.For equity’s sake, the NEC will be storing the early ballot boxes within restricted areas of its local offices until the closing of polls on the main voting day, officials said.Also, security cameras were installed at the 253 storage spots nationwide to record the entire process until the ballot boxes are opened Wednesday night.Should any of the candidates or parties raise objections on the delivery, storage or opening of the ballots, the NEC will release the relevant recorded video files, according to officials.Despite such precautions, however, controversy was stirred as some ballot boxes were found to be unsealed. An election supervision official at an early voting station in Incheon erroneously opened the seal of a ballot box late on Friday, the NEC Incheon office said Saturday.“The official mistook the box as containing extra-jurisdictional ballots and tore the seal off,” a representative from the NEC commented.“The unsealing took place under the supervision of the election supervisors and none of the district’s candidates raised an objection.”In Daegu, candidate Kim Boo-kyum of The Minjoo Party of Korea blasted his rival from the ruling Saenuri Party, Kim Moon-soo, for offering transportation to local voters during the early voting period and thus inducing them to vote in his favor.The Saenuri candidate’s camp, however, denied the allegations and lashed back that the Minjoo Party’s Kim violated election regulations by placing his campaigners at the doors of polling stations.The NEC had earlier announced that it would clamp down on acts of expressing support or opposition against a specific candidate within 100 meters of polling spots, as well as on the provision of transportations to voters.By Bae Hyun-jung","voting for wednesday parliamentary election ,election closed with record high ,ballot box late on friday ,turnout announcing rather successful kickoff ,early voting for wednesday parliamentary","['the National Election Commission', 'South Jeolla Province', 'Busan', 'Seoul', 'NEC', 'NEC', 'NEC', 'Incheon', 'NEC Incheon', 'NEC', 'Daegu', 'Kim Boo - kyum', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moon - soo', 'Saenuri', 'the Minjoo Party ’s', 'Kim', 'NEC', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40942019 -0.05352514

Voters go to the polls on Wednesday to pick the lawmakers who will serve a four year term.The latest findings showed the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea will likely secure 83-100 seats, with the splinter People's Party winning 28-32 seats on the strong backing of the voters in the Jeolla region in the southeastern part of the country. If the People's Party wins more than 20 seats, it can form a negotiating bloc in parliament.The forecast showed almost no change from poll results released by Yonhap on March 13 when Saenuri was expected to win 155-175 seats, but numbers for Minjoo fell while People's Party's prospects improved.Last month's polls showed the main opposition party likely to secure 95-110 seats, with the People's Party getting 10-20 seats.Pollster said that while the ruling party will probably win a majority, there is a chance that more than 10 independents will be elected.""With many having left Saenuri after failing to win party tickets, their return will likely generate attention after the elections,"" one polling official said. Saenuri, in particular, is keeping close tabs on the election outcome in Daegu, some 300 kilometers southeast of Seoul, that had been its power base for generations. At present, former Saenuri whip Yoo Seung-min is expected to win at the polls despite running as an independent.The source then said if the Minjoo party fails to secure less than 100 seats, it will have to concede failure, with the political landscape becoming a three-way situation.Others said that while the People's Party popularity has been on the rise, it may not be able to win too many seats outside of the Jeolla region.""With the exception of party chairman Ahn Cheol-soo's constituency in Nowon, Seoul, the People's Party may not be able to pick up seats outside of Jeolla,"" a political watcher estimated.Of the 122 seat up for grabs in Seoul and the surrounding regions of Gyeonggi Province and Incheon, Saenuri is expected to win 57-67, with 52-61 expected for the Minjoo Party.Experts, however, said that in the Seoul and surrounding regions, the high percentage of undecided voters can change the outcome of the elections by as much as 15 seats, with the turnout of people in their 20-30s and those over 60 to decide which party wins and which losses.Younger people generally tend to favor liberal parties like the Minjoo Party, while the older generation has been staunch loyalists of the conservative Saenuri Party.","four local pollsters last week ,wednesday to pick the lawmakers ,lawmakers who will serve four ,party winning 28 32 seats ,getting 10 20 seats pollster","['Saenuri Party', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'Saenuri', 'National Assembly', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', ""People 's Party"", 'Jeolla', ""the People 's Party"", 'Yonhap', 'Saenuri', 'Minjoo', ""People 's Party 's"", ""the People 's Party"", 'Saenuri', 'Saenuri', 'Daegu', 'Seoul', 'Saenuri', 'Yoo Seung - min', 'Minjoo', ""the People 's Party"", 'Ahn Cheol', 'Nowon', 'Seoul', ""the People 's Party"", 'Jeolla', 'Seoul', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Incheon', 'Saenuri', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Seoul', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Saenuri Party']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.95674092  0.77446556

560,560, Military culture infuses throughout every part of society,"On an ordinary weekday morning, throngs of executives line up by rank at the lobby of a sprawling glass building in Seoul that houses the headquarters of one of the country’s biggest family-run conglomerates. They are awaiting the chairman, who is about to make his entrance in about half an hour. As he emerges through the door, a vacuum-like, fleeting stillness sweeps through the pack, followed by waves of deep bows...","On an ordinary weekday morning, throngs of executives line up by rank at the lobby of a sprawling glass building in Seoul that houses the headquarters of one of the country’s biggest family-run conglomerates. They are awaiting the chairman, who is about to make his entrance in about half an hour. As he emerges through the door, a vacuum-like, fleeting stillness sweeps through the pack, followed by waves of deep bows from the waist. In the evening, on the other side of town, a group of college students gathers at a nearby pork belly restaurant. They hold a welcoming ceremony for the new members of an a capella club, with two long rows of glasses filled with a blend of beer and soju, or “somaek.” A senior member shouts as he raises his glass, “All of those younger than me have got to drain their glasses in one gulp.”The scenes epitomize shades of deep-rooted military culture that diffuses into nearly every part of South Korean society. From the public and corporate sectors to academia, fields of arts and sports, juniors are better off when they toe the line without talking back to their bosses. Boot camp has long been a must for staff of all grades and newbies of any organization. “Lacking military discipline” is a universal expression used to scold subordinates. “At our company, there were catchphrases to chant at the beginning and the end of executive meetings,” said Hong Ji-hyun, a 31-year-old who previously worked at another major corporation in Seoul. “The catchphrases would change once in a while, one of them I remember was ‘Let’s be No. 1!’ And they said it was the chairman’s instruction.” As the country increasingly embraces diversity, many aspects of the rigid, hierarchical culture have faded in line with the democratic progress following the demise of iron-fisted rule in 1980s. But a military-style leadership still prevails in male-dominant areas. Remnants of military culture may live on in a traditionally Confucian society, some people say, even long after the two Koreas are reunited. South Korean armed forces partake in winter training. In a 2013 poll commissioned by Hankook Ilbo daily to SurveyMonkey, 610 out of 625 respondents, or 97.6 percent, said they have felt that military culture persists within organizations outside the barracks, including workplaces, schools and sports clubs. Though largely deemed inevitable given the ongoing standoff with the North, the influence of Korea’s conscription system has become deeply embedded in all corners of society, often becoming a perennial source of gender discrimination.The compulsory draft allows young men to not only prepare for a potential emergency on the peninsula but also to learn organized social life through strict military discipline. In return, those who complete their service generally get extra credits when applying for a job, receive higher pay than their female colleagues, and climb up the ladder faster under the same conditions as women. Such values as leadership, loyalty and perseverance are also required for women in order to stand out in the male-dominated society. Many successful female leaders have pushed their way through the top by putting work over everything else, staying later than their male competitors and exercising even more stringent discipline. “I think the country’s overall workplace atmosphere is built on apprenticeship where juniors have to painstakingly follow the directives of their mentors just like you do in the Army,” Kim Chang-hwan, a 32-year-old former editor at a Seoul-based publishing house where the absolute majority of the staff were women and he was the only one who served in the military. Across the sectors, the top brass still chiefly consist of people who either have firsthand experience in military dictatorship or the offspring of the elite from the era when men were even banned from growing their hair and women from wearing short skirts as part of the efforts to establish uniformity and discipline. “There is certainly a bright side to the system -- you can quickly get professional know-how and tips and innately foster teamwork. But on the other hand, it could limit the scope of your thinking and your problem-solving ability. Or even if you manage to find your own methods, someone would say that’s wrong because it’s different from how they’ve done things.”With the maturing of fast-paced society and women’s growing entry into leadership roles, there is a growing call among both old and young generations that the current shift away from military-style culture would only continue to take hold. “In the past, the population was much less educated than now and the military provided one of the few pools of well-disciplined and trained human resources, while businesses, schools and other institutions courted retired officers to teach entry-level workers and refurbish management structure,” a government official in his 50s said. “Things have significantly changed compared with when I started some 30 years ago, though there are still vestiges such as in document writing, reporting and even drinking culture. The trend will evolve, albeit gradually, toward pragmatism with generational changes at higher echelons.” By Shin Hyon-hee","sprawling glass building in seoul ,weekday morning throngs of executives ,morning throngs of executives line ,morning throngs of executives ,another major corporation in seoul","['Seoul', 'south korean', 'Hong Ji - hyun', 'Seoul', 'confucian', 'Koreas', 'south korean', 'Hankook Ilbo', 'SurveyMonkey', 'Korea', 'Army', 'Kim Chang - hwan', 'Seoul', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",13,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.40000954  0.64736849

YonhapThe early voting, which will be run from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Friday-Saturday, enables voters to cast their vote at a designated polling station, according to the National Election Commission.The voter is only required to suggest a personal identification. No advance registration or document is necessary.The election watchdog also installed three polling booths at Seoul Station, Yongsan Station and Incheon International Airport, offering voting convenience for travelers, officials said.Early votes, despite the limited number of participants, are seen to mirror the final election results.Back in the 2014 local election, when the early voting system was implemented for the first time, the early turnout acted as a litmus test of the results. While the early votes are opened and counted concurrently on the actual voting day, the turnout rate is deemed to serve as a stimulus in encouraging undecided voters to turn up. In 24 out of the 25 districts in Seoul, the candidate who took the lead in early voting also ended up victorious.This year’s early voting rate stood at 3.92 percent as of 3 p.m. Friday, involving some 1.6 million of the nation’s voting pool. On Friday, the first day of the preliminary voting for the April 13 general election, soldiers, police and young voters cast their ballot at polling stations nationwide. YonhapPressed by the lack of time remaining up to the final race, key party leaders focused their energy on canvassing the metropolitan region, consisting of 122 out of 253 constituencies and embracing the largest number of fluctuating voters.Rep. Kim Moo-sung of the ruling conservative Saenuri Party toured Seoul’s outskirt areas, from Anyang, Bucheon, Gimpo, Goyang and Paju, making a second trip to Gyeonggi Province since the official campaigning period began.He continued his low-profile stance, offering apologies for the party’s infighting over candidate nomination and asking for “one more chance.”His opposition counterpart, Kim Chong-in of The Minjoo Party of Korea, started off his day by stumping in Seoul’s northwestern Eunpyeong-B district and moved to Incheon’s Yeonsu-B for early voting.He then swept the rest of Incheon, as well as the northern Gyeonggi areas such as Gimpo, Goyang, and Paju, before returning back to Seoul for late afternoon electioneering.Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo of the No. 3 People’s Party took part in a vote-encouraging campaign held at Seoul Station early morning.Former Minjoo chief Rep. Moon Jae-in, on the other hand, made his appearance in the nation’s southwestern city of Gwangju and the surrounding Jeolla Provinces for a two-day visit.The potential presidential candidate’s move was a head-on challenge to reconcile with the longtime opposition stronghold, where the public sentiment has reportedly turned against the main opposition party for allegedly neglecting the region.By Bae Hyun-jung","seoul for late afternoon electioneering ,afternoon electioneering rep ahn cheol ,voting pool on friday ,late afternoon electioneering rep ,afternoon electioneering rep","['South Korea', 'Seoul', 'the National Election Commission', 'Seoul', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Saenuri Party', 'Seoul', 'Anyang', 'Bucheon', 'Gimpo', 'Goyang', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Kim Chong - in', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Eunpyeong', 'Incheon ’s', 'Incheon', 'Gyeonggi', 'Gimpo', 'Goyang', 'Paju', 'Seoul', 'Ahn Cheol', 'People ’s Party', 'Minjoo', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Jeolla Provinces', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.25868294  0.4151493

Voting will take place between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on both Friday and Saturday.Won Yoo-cheol, floor leader of the ruling Saenuri Party, visited a polling station in his electorate of Pyongtaek, 70 km south of Seoul, early on Friday.A number of the party's proportional candidates also visited a polling station in Yeouido, western Seoul, to draw more voters to the polls.Chairman Kim Moo-sung, meanwhile, is scheduled to vote on election day in his electorate in the southern port city of Busan.Several former Saenuri lawmakers, including Yoo Seong-min, participated in early voting as well, with Yoo voting in his electorate in Daegu.Yoo, a former floor leader, defected from Saenuri and is running as an independent candidate after failing to get a party ticket.Seol Hyun of girl group AOA, who was named an honorary ambassador for this year's general elections, is also scheduled to visit a polling station in southern Seoul.The early voting system, first adopted during the 2013 by-elections, is different from absentee voting in that it does not require voters to sign up in advance.Eligible voters, who may be busy or away on election day which falls on Wednesday, can simply show up at a polling station during the early voting period and cast their ballots.

563,563,[ELECTION 2016] Conservative Gangnam unmoved by election,"It is hard to feel that the parliamentary election is just around the corner for Lee Jae-jung, a 32-year-old office worker who lives in an affluent apartment complex in Dogok-dong, Gangnam in Seoul.　“I have never seen a campaign banner for political parties or a vehicle that carries candidates blasting their campaign songs and election pledges,” said Lee. “It is kind of weird because I can see those banners and v...","It is hard to feel that the parliamentary election is just around the corner for Lee Jae-jung, a 32-year-old office worker who lives in an affluent apartment complex in Dogok-dong, Gangnam in Seoul.“I have never seen a campaign banner for political parties or a vehicle that carries candidates blasting their campaign songs and election pledges,” said Lee. “It is kind of weird because I can see those banners and vehicles a lot in other neighborhoods,” he said. Around the complex crowded with high-rise buildings and fancy restaurants, signs of a heated race for the 20th National Assembly are nowhere to be seen. No election banners or campaign vehicles were spotted over the span of several hours. Instead, there was a placard urging the government to accelerate a residential redevelopment program, a lucrative housing project for the wealthy residents. Gangnam, indeed, is considered the heart of the nation’s most affluent residence. Aside from the sky-high real estate prices, the monthly income of its three districts -- Gangnam-gu, Seocho-gu and Songpa-gu -- is more than any other districts in Seoul, according to Seoul city government’s statistics.  Such economic status has long turned Gangnam into the conservative’s stronghold. In the 2012 general election, the Saenuri Party won all seven seats allocated to the region. In the election to choose Seoul’s mayor in 2010, the three districts were the only ones that chose conservative candidates over liberal contenders.“The Gangnam voters cast their ballot in their economic interest,” said Kim Min-jeon, a political science professor at Kyung Hee University. “Though some middle-income voters might vote for liberal candidates, top-class high-income voters definitely favor conservative candidates,” she said. Rep. Kim Jong-hoon of the Saenuri Party. YonhapSuch a trend was reflected in the attitude among the candidates and their supporters toward their election campaign.Rep. Kim Jong-hoon, the Saenuri lawmaker seeking reelection in Gangnam-gu B district, said that his aides and supporters often told him to “take a break” from the election campaign. The supporters for main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea’s candidates, such as Jun Hyeon-hee, the former lawmaker competing with Kim in the same constituency, suffered from weak popularity among the conservative voters.“When we said we were from opposition candidate, the people would just walk away,” an official from Jun’s election campaign told the Korea Herald. When her supporter went onto a stage to tout her credentials and pledges, there was not a single pedestrian that stopped walking or listened to the speech. The unwelcoming mood toward the liberals was not always the case. When former President Lee Myung-bak was in power from 2007 to 2012 with low popularity ratings, political pundits and media outlets coined the term “Gangnam leftists” and predicted that the liberal-minded high-earners would transform the region’s political landscape.  Though the idea was often dismissed by critics and failed to bring election victory to the liberal parties, there were some cracks among voters in the conservative districts. For instance, residents in Songpa district voted for the former civil activist Park Won-soon in the 2011 election for Seoul mayor“For Gangnam voters, politics is a complicated procedure filled with rancorous debates,” said Lee Taek-gwang, a professor of cultural studies. “The challenge for the liberals is whether they can change disinterest toward politics and the system dominated by establishment conservative party,” said Lee. Entrepreneur Shin Yeong-soo, 53, who has been a long-time supporter for the Saenuri Party, said he thinks that the party has been too “complacent” toward developing policies tailored for the region. “When I look at the candidates’ posters describing their political careers, I couldn’t help but notice that they are not the best pool of politicians,” said Shin. In the latest 2012 election, out of seven candidates elected in the region, five were rookies.By Yeo Jun-suk","lawmaker seeking reelection in gangnam ,2011 election for seoul mayor ,seoul mayor for gangnam voters ,election for seoul mayor ,election for seoul mayor for","['Lee Jae - jung', 'Dogok - dong', 'Gangnam', 'Seoul', 'Lee', 'National Assembly', 'Gangnam', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Gangnam', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Seoul', 'Kim Min - jeon', 'Kyung Hee University', 'Kim Jong - hoon', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Kim Jong - hoon', 'Saenuri', 'Gangnam', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea ’s', 'Jun Hyeon - hee', 'Kim', 'Jun ’s', 'the Korea Herald', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Gangnam', 'Songpa', 'Park Won - soon', 'Seoul', 'Gangnam', 'Lee Taek - gwang', 'Lee', 'Entrepreneur Shin Yeong - soo', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Shin', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",15,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.10171425 0.50539482 0.13504522]

It also immediately blocked entrances at the basement floor of the Seoul Government Complex in central Seoul that are connected to subway line No. 3 Gyeongbokgung Station, and will increase nighttime patrols.Public officials line up to enter the Seoul Government Complex in downtown Seoul on Thursday as security checks were fortified upon the recent break-in case. Ahn Hoon/The Korea Herald The move followed a break-in by a 26-year-old candidate for civil service exam, identified by his surname Song, who sneaked into the Seoul Government Complex to change his test results that had been saved on a computer in the Ministry of Personnel Management office. Song appears to have sneaked into the building four more times at night from March 5 to 26, according to authorities. He was arrested on Wednesday. He was reportedly desperate to get a job of public servant’s Grade 7 position.According to the police, Song stole three public official’s ID cards from gym lockers on the first floor of the government complex. He then went up to the 16th floor where the Ministry of Personnel Management is located, entered the office using a password, hacked into the computer of the official who manages test results and added his name on the list to make him eligible for the next round of tests. Song reportedly said passwords to open the office door were written on a wall -- apparently used by cleaners and security guards.The National Police Agency is investigating, as software for computer hacking and password removal were found in Song’s personal computer at home in Jejudo, where he studies at a university. Police said they are not sure whether he had an inside accomplice.“We feel grave responsibility that the government complex was breached during a terror alert period,” said Kim Sung-lyul, deputy minister of the Ministry of the Interior, in a statement.“The ministry will roll out and implement renovated security regulations at all government complexes by May, from steps to strengthen discipline to giving out security education to all officials,” he added.By Kim Da-sol","government vowed thursday to overhaul ,in downtown seoul on thursday ,seoul on thursday as security ,downtown seoul on thursday ,thursday as security checks","['the Interior Ministry', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Ahn Hoon', 'the Korea Herald', 'Song', 'the Ministry of Personnel Management', 'the Ministry of Personnel Management', 'song', 'the National Police Agency', 'Kim Sung - lyul', 'the Ministry of the Interior', 'Kim Da - sol']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57601476  0.4589349

The survey was conducted earlier this week on the organization’s official website.The top dishonor was given to Kim Seok-ki, a former commissioner general of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency who had resigned from his post in 2009, after directing a violent suppression that led to 29 casualties, including the deaths of six.Kim, who later took on the post of president of the state-run Korea Airports Corporation, is running in Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province, where the Saenuri Party is enjoying steady support.The list included ranking Saenuri Party figures such as party chief Kim Moo-sung, former Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon, former Deputy Prime Minister Hwang Woo-yea and former Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan. Na Kyung-won and Yoon Sang-hyun were also listed, with the former being included due to recent allegations of influence-peddling over her daughter’s college admission and the latter for making abusive remarks against party chief Kim over candidate nominations.The civic group started its anti-campaign on Wednesday against Oh, a candidate in Jongno.“Oh’s administration was a typical case of budget wasting and antienvironmental show-off business,” the group said at a press conference in front of Oh’s election camp headquarters.“Not only did he stand against policies that are crucial to the economically needy, but he also abused the free school meal issue for his own political needs.”The former mayor stepped down in 2011, after a referendum on free school meals had floundered.

The ruling conservative Saenuri Party -- with former Finance Minister Kang Bong-kyun as chief policy strategist -- chose to focus on job creation, connecting its campaigns to President Park Geun-hye’s plan to revitalize the economy and unshackle the labor market.The party’s key economic platforms are as follows: create jobs for youths by boosting corporate investment; implement a quantitative easing macroeconomic system; improve income distribution through tax revision; expand welfare support to socially disadvantaged clusters; improve the business environment for owner-operators; solve real estate problems; and accomplish the Park administration’s reform plans.Though its list included some progressive issues, the gist of it was to stimulate economic growth. The concept of economic democratization, which the party had adopted as a key slogan back in the 2012 election, was nowhere to be seen.A report released by the Economic Reform Research Institute on Thursday described the ruling party as “resuming its former persona as a typical conservative party.”“The Saenuri Party’s pledges show that it has completely discarded economic democratization,” the report stated.One of the representative pledges of the party is to create some 500,000 new jobs by establishing a special economic zone for companies that relocate their overseas sites back to South Korea.The plan, however, failed to suggest a valid financing mechanism, as well as possible incentives that may lure firms back home.Another controversy is the quantitative easing program to increase liquidity in the market and reduce household debt.The party said Thursday that it would, in follow-up measures, revise the Bank of Korea Act so as to allow the nation’s central bank to purchase bonds of state-run banks.But the BOK and the Ministry of Strategy and Finance indicated their resistance, as well as doubts, over the financial program.Both Finance Minister Yoo Il-ho and BOK Gov.

The Minjoo Party of Korea, steered by senior economist Kim Chong-in, chose to shore up the idea of economic democratization.The forte of the main opposition party is its consistency -- having maintained its relatively progressive policy stance -- but its weakness is that most of the plans are a deja vu of the 2012 election campaigns.The party’s key economic slogan is the “777 plan,” aimed at pulling up per capita gross national income, labor income share, and the proportion of middle class to the 70 percent mark.“The 777 plan is more or less a copy of the Lee Myung-bak administration’s 747 plan or the Park Geun-hye government’s 474 plan,” said the Saenuri policy chief Kang, challenging Minjoo’s Kim to an economic policy debate.The party’s goal to enforce a ban on the top 10 conglomerates’ cross-shareholding was also a revival of a similar pledge from 2012.The opposition party also vowed to create 700,000 new jobs by expanding the youth employment quota in public organizations and to increase the legal minimum wage to 10,000 won  per hour.But it faced criticism that it was shifting economic responsibility to the public sector and that the figures announced were financially unsound.“Not only do these economic pledges lack practicality, but they also tend to mislead voters, making them believe that a political party has the full discretion to implement its promises,” said an official of the Korea Manifesto Center.By Bae Hyun-jung","next week general election political ,announcing new economic pledges daily ,attends press conference on thursday ,new economic pledges daily hoping ,fizzle out after the elections","['Finance', 'Kang Bong - kyun', 'Saenuri Party ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'Finance', 'Kang Bong - kyun', 'Park Geun', 'Park', 'the Economic Reform Research Institute', 'Saenuri Party ’s', 'South Korea', 'the Bank of Korea Act', 'BOK', 'the Ministry of Strategy', 'Finance', 'Yoo Il - ho', 'BOK', 'Lee Ju - yeol', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Kim Chong - in', 'Joo Jin - hyeong', 'Hanwha Investment and Securities', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Kim Chong - in', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Saenuri', 'Kang', 'Minjoo', 'Kim', 'the Korea Manifesto Center', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.02381313  0.42599037

Nike Korea removed the sneakers from its stores last month after the controversy.“We understand the sensitivity of this issue and we apologize for any offense caused. The Air Jordan 12 will no longer be sold in Korea,” Nike Korea told The Korea Herald in a statement. But Koreans are left wondering what the leading sportswear company’s position is on the contentious design.Seo Kyoung-duk, professor of general education at Sungshin Women’s University, sent a letter of complaint to Nike and Michael Jordan about the matter but he has yet to receive a reply.“Although Nike Korea issued an apology and stopped selling it in Korea, it is still being retailed all over the world. Imperial Japan inflicted pain upon many Asian countries; It is not just a matter between Seoul and Tokyo,” said Seo, adding he will continue raising the issue to Nike.Retired basketballer Jordan remains one of the most popular sports icons in the world, as do his famous sneakers. The original version of the Air Jordan 12 was worn by the NBA legend during the 1996-97 season after the Chicago Bulls achieved an all-time high of 72 wins, a record that still stands today. But fans in Korea have expressed disappointment with their hero for remaining silent on the controversial sensitive issue.“If Jordan knew about the Rising Sun flag and the historical relationship between Korea and Japan but chose to remain silent anyway, I am disappointed in him,” said 34-year-old basketball fan Jang Jae-ah. “The Japanese colonialism is long over, but its aftereffects are an ongoing issue in Korea.”Scars of colonialismKorea and Japan remain at odds over how to view Japan’s crimes during World War II, namely Japan’s sexual slavery of women from Korea and other parts of Asia for its soldiers. The Seoul government recently asked Tokyo to revise its history textbooks to clarify that the victims -- euphemistically called “comfort women” -- were forced into sexual slavery and that their human rights were infringed upon.The 44 surviving comfort women are a testament to the lasting scars left by Japan’s 1910-45 colonialization of Korea, making any reminder of Japanese imperialism a taboo in Korean society.Earlier in the year, Maison Kitsune stirred up controversy by using designs bearing images of the Rising Sun flag, after which the French fashion label issued an official apology. Some local celebrities have also came under fire for wearing clothes bearing the controversial design.“Some people talk of freedom of expression in wearing such designs. But I think there’s a limit to such freedom, and a historically important matter should be an exception,” said 20-year-old Yoon Yeong-bin who attends Hansung University in Seoul.“I think people wearing such designs lack a sense of history. There is no present without the past. Freedom of expression? It’s nonsense,” said Jang.Depicting the sun and its rays, the Rising Sun flag dates back to the ancient Edo period  when it was used by Japanese warlords. In 1870, the Meiji government adopted it as the war flag of its army and subsequently as the symbol of its navy. The flag was used by the Japanese military during World War II when Japan invaded Asian countries in the 1940s.It is now used by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, but it is more commonly used by the general public and in commercial products as it has traditionally meant good fortune and vigor. Despite the widespread controversy, the retro Air Jordans were also a massive hit in Korea. A visit to a Nike store in Seoul in early March showed that nearly all the sneakers had been sold, except small sizes for children. As of Tuesday, it is being sold online at prices as high as 470,000 won , more than double its retail price.“Air Jordan collectors may find it hard to give up on their collection just because of the design. They may justify their choices by saying that it was probably not inspired by the Rising Sun flag because a U.S.-based company designed it,” said a 41-year-old basketball fan.Nazi swastika and the Rising Sun Many who oppose the use of the Rising Sun flag compare it to the Nazi swastika, which was a religious symbol until Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany adopted it as their emblem. Since then, it has become highly stigmatized due to its association with Nazism. Lee Jang-hie, professor emeritus of law at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, said the difference in the two symbols lies in the differing attitudes and actions of Germany and Japan after the war. “Most of the German war criminals were prosecuted at the Nuremberg trials, and Germany itself saw to it that punishments would be implemented. Also they worked hard to ensure that symbols, writings and propaganda linked to the Nazis would be taboo,” he said. “But during the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in Tokyo, many of the  war criminals were released to play prominent roles in Japan’s political, economic, academic circles as well as the media.”Among those not prosecuted was Nobusuke Kishi, grandfather of incumbent Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. “You can say that Japan has failed to fully part ways with its militaristic past,” Lee said.He said that the new history textbooks in Japan that glorify “Kamikaze” suicide fighters and condone symbols like the Rising Sun flag is part of the country’s attempt to justify its past.“Through their efforts to punish those related to Nazism, Germany managed to regain trust from the international society and is playing a crucial part in the EU. ... Japan, on the other hand, is trying to water down its imperial past,” he said.Surveys indicate that neighboring countries in Northeast Asia remain discontented with one another.Last year, Korea’s Foreign Ministry conducted a survey on 14 countries in Asia, Europe and North America. It showed that 77 percent of Japanese disliked China and 41.7 percent of Chinese had no affection for Japan. Another survey by Seoul Digital University last month showed that 86.1 percent of its students said that Korea and Japan have a bad relationship. Professor Seo said that the biggest problem behind the use of the Rising Sun symbol is that foreigners do not think that it is an issue at all.“The Japanese national team uniform in the 2014 FIFA World Cup had a design resembling a Rising Sun flag. The symbol is being used in fields that are most exposed to the general public, and most people do not recognize what it stood for. ... Many foreigners think that it is just a design that is often used in Japan,” he said.“Japan’s intent may be to include imperialistic symbols into cultural content to promote them, so the general public will openly accept them,” said Seo. Even some Koreans fail to recognize the meaning of the controversial design, pointed out Seo.Hansung student Yoon said she did not know what exactly the Rising Sun flag represented until a controversy involving a local celebrity broke out. “We  need to step up education not only on history, but also on how to address outside attempts to distort historical facts,” Seo said.By Yoon Min-sik","basketball legend michael jordan sneakers ,nba superstar michael jordan mctbut ,former nba superstar michael jordan ,then basketball legend michael jordan ,nba superstar michael jordan","['Spike Lee', 'Air Jordan', 'Michael Jordan ’s', 'Mike', 'NBA', 'Michael Jordan', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Air Jordan', 'Taipei', 'Taiwan', 'Seo Kyoung - dukWhile', 'japanese', 'Koreans', 'Nike Korea', 'Korea', 'Nike Korea', 'the Korea Herald', 'Koreans', 'Seo Kyoung - duk', 'Sungshin Women ’s University', 'Nike', 'Michael Jordan', 'Nike Korea', 'Korea', 'Imperial Japan', 'asian', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'seo', 'Nike', 'Jordan', 'NBA', 'the Chicago Bulls', 'Korea', 'Jordan', 'rise Sun', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Jang Jae - ah', 'japanese', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'japanese', 'korean', 'Maison Kitsune', 'Rising Sun', 'french', 'Yoon Yeong - bin', 'Hansung University', 'Seoul', 'rise Sun', 'japanese', 'Meiji', 'japanese', 'Japan', 'asian', 'Japan', 'Air Jordans', 'Korea', 'Nike', 'Seoul', 'Jordan', 'Rising Sun', 'nazi', 'the rise Sun', 'rise Sun', 'Nazi', 'Nazi Germany', 'Nazism', 'Lee Jang - hie', 'Hankuk University of Foreign Studies', 'Germany', 'Japan', 'german', 'Nuremberg', 'Germany', 'Nazis', 'the International Military Tribunal', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'Nobusuke Kishi', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Japan', 'Lee', 'Japan', 'Kamikaze', 'rise Sun', 'Nazism', 'Germany', 'EU', 'Japan', 'Korea ’s Foreign Ministry', 'Japanese', 'China', 'Chinese', 'Japan', 'Seoul Digital University', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Seo', 'japanese', 'Japan', 'seo', 'Koreans', 'Yoon', 'rise Sun', 'seo', 'Yoon Min - sik']",11,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52685386  0.55438161

The early voting will run from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. until Saturday. Three preliminary voting polls are also installed at Seoul Station, Yongsan Station and Incheon International Airport as part of efforts to encourage voter participation, the authorities said.  Ballot boxes will only be opened after the election ends. Polling booths are set up at Incheon International Airport ahead of the preliminary voting for the 20th National Assembly on Thursday. This is the first time the early voting system has been used for a general election. The system, introduced in 2013 to provide better convenience for voters and to raise the turnout, has previously been run for by-elections and local elections.Observers have noted that early voting may be a game changer in neck-and-neck districts, citing the consistently rising preliminary voting rate with more young voters taking part.Voter turnout, which recorded 4.9 percent in the first early polling, jumped to 11.5 percent in local elections in 2014. In the latest round of early voting in 2014, those in their 20s took part the most, at nearly 16 percent, followed by those in their 60s at 12.2 percent and 50s with 11.5 percent. Meanwhile, the absentee voting rate reached 41.4 percent with about 64,000 Korean voters. This is 4.3 percentage points down compared to the previous general election in 2012, officials said. Absentee voting was held in 113 countries from March 30 to April 4. The overall voting rate of the general elections, which reached the highest in 1996 with 63.9 percent, dropped to 46.1 percent in 2008. But it rebounded to 54.2 percent in 2012.

The stark differences in their stances toward hotly debated topics like dialogue with Pyongyang, human rights in the oppressive state and how to achieve a future reunification used to define each party’s identification. This time, however, both the ruling Saenuri Party and main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea introduced packages that appeared rather colorless and lacking substance. The minor opposition People’s Party, which initially did not present any security commitments at all, released a five-point set of pledges last week. Meanwhile, there have been many eye-catching -- yet populist -- pledges such as a cut in the length of the mandatory military service and a hike in soldiers’ salaries. In a rare show of unison, the two leading parties set atop their agendas robust defense readiness against North Korea based on the South Korea-U.S. alliance, though detailed action plans vary. To boost the South Korean military’s response capabilities, both sides reaffirmed support for plans to establish the Kill Chain and Korea Air and Missile Defense preemptive strike systems by the early 2020s, and to adopt more monitoring and reconnaissance assets. The People’s Party also displayed support for the KAMD project, but protested against the planned stationing of the U.S.’ Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system here, citing “astronomical” deployment costs relative to its effectiveness and the high possibility of diplomatic discord with China and Russia. The Saenuri Party’s candidate for the Gangnam constituency, former Trade Minister Kim Jong-hoon. On cross-border ties, the Saenuri Party has focused more on shoring up the government’s drive to ramp up pressure on Pyongyang to denuclearize, whereas the Minjoo Party has called for simultaneous efforts to defuse tensions and build confidence, such as through a joint military committee. Saenuri Party also vowed to help improve the communist state’s grim living conditions, such as by formulating a basic framework on North Korean human rights in line with recently enacted legislation. The conservative party also laid out plans to revive exchanges between separated families, expand assistance to defectors and reinforce unification preparations through research, public events and education, among others. The Minjoo Party is seeking to normalize the joint Gaeseong industrial park that was shut down in February following the North’s latest nuclear and missile tests, while pursuing a Korean-style “freikauf” model, the money-for-prisoner scheme used by the former West Germany, to bring more North Koreans into the South. As part of its initiative for a “new economy on the Korean Peninsula,” the liberal party envisaged creating new joint economic zones in border regions and related organizations. It also aims to revitalize stalled inter-Korean business and people-to-people exchange programs including a tour to the Mount Geumgangsan and Mount Baekdusan resorts, Pyongyang and Gaeseong. Lambasting the controversial settlement on the “comfort women” issue with Japan, the Minjoo Party pledged to reopen negotiations so as to “help the victims regain their honor and the people their pride.” The Minjoo Party of Korea’s proportional representative candidate Lee Soo-hyuk, a former deputy foreign minister and chief nuclear negotiator. The People’s Party, for its part, vowed to reopen the Gaeseong industrial complex, saying it does little to thwart Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs, but rather inflicts economic losses on the South Korean businesses and government. It also calls for a restart of the six-party denuclearization talks, the launch of four-way peace dialogue with the North, the U.S. and China, and the establishment of an economic cooperation zone covering parts of the two Koreas, northeastern China and Russia. The parties are most evidently split over the counterterrorism act, which was passed early last month with the ruling party’s nearly unanimous endorsement despite a days-long, record-breaking filibuster by opposition lawmakers. The Minjoo Party promised to push through a revision, saying the law carries “potential sources of human rights violations,” making way for the National Intelligence Service to step up spying activities on civilians and political maneuvering. In the longer term, the party seeks to abolish the scandal-ridden agency and launch an organization gathering intelligence on North Korea and from overseas. The minor opposition People’s Party also sees an amendment as essential, though it acknowledges the fundamental need for such legislation, citing “unacceptable” concerns that it may “seriously damage the people’s basic rights.” On compulsory military service, Saenuri is looking to allow student enlistees to take more online courses at barracks and receive credits for military training by the end of 2017. It also wants to gradually raise the daily compensation for reserve troops to 30,000 won  through 2021 from the current 12,000 won. The Minjoo Party has unveiled a more ambitious proposal, including shortening the service period by three months to 18 months and jacking up the monthly salary of soldiers on average 100,000 won, or up to 300,000 won step by step. But the prospects for most of the promises remain bleak -- similar ideas have been floated ahead of past elections, but few of them materialized due to budget shortfalls or other administrative setbacks. Rather than touching on issues such as troop salaries or service length, the People’s Party simply introduced plans to overhaul the soldier management system and reinforce therapy and consultation programs to contain suicides and accidents within barracks.  “The Saenuri package falls short of addressing the pressing issues, especially with regard to North Korea, among others, as well as providing detailed rationales behind anticipated effects of its proposals and financing ideas,” the Korea Manifesto Center said in its analysis. “Minjoo’s ‘new economy’ initiative was significant in presenting a peaceful resolution to an inter-Korean stalemate, which is the most pressing issue at hand.”But to move forward with their plans, national consensus should build first, the nongovernmental organization noted, pointing to prevailing dampened sentiment at home and abroad toward any major business cooperation with a nuclear-armed, recalcitrant Pyongyang.“A more scrupulous examination is also needed such as on the reasons why the exchange projects were frozen previously. Given the current cross-border situation and international resolutions, controversy could also arise as to the pledge’s timeliness and viability,” the center added. “As for the People’s Party, it claims to stand for radical center in its creed, but its overall package did not place stress on security matters in favor of promoting fair distribution of wealth and new growth engines.”The lack of weightage given to foreign and security policy in election promises is partly reflected in the absence of specialists at each party’s policymaking core, critics say. Apart from some retired military generals mostly at Saenuri including Reps. Hwang Jin-ha and Kim Sung-chan, few experts in North Korea and foreign affairs and former government officials have been giving advice or secured nominations for the upcoming vote. While former Trade Minister Kim Jong-hoon set sights on serving for another four years, first-term Saenuri member Rep. Shim Yoon-joe who was a deputy foreign minister was defeated in a primary. Kim Keun-sik, a North Korea expert at Kyungnam University and People’s Party hopeful, has dropped his bid in support of former Unification Minister Chung Dong-young. The Minjoo Party’s specialist delegation is led by Lee Soo-hyuk, a former deputy foreign minister and chief nuclear negotiator who is forecast to enter the assembly with his 15th position in the party’s proportional representative list. Others include former unification minister adviser Rep. Hong Ihk-pyo and Ha Jung-yul, a retired one-star general and former head of the private Korea Institute for Security and Unification who is running in the Jeongeup and Gochang constituency in North Jeolla Province. “It’s regretful that diplomacy and security were put on the back burner in the election pledges, while a very small number of experts and former policymakers in the fields made it to the proportional representation system or are giving policy advice at least,” a government official said, requesting anonymity. “The economy should understandably be the top issue, but the current level of attention is very alarming, especially given that North Korea recently conducted its fourth nuclear test.” By Shin Hyon-hee","election campaigns all three major ,breaking filibuster by opposition lawmakers ,three major parties are failing ,back burner in the election ,north korea evolving nuclear threats","['North Korea ’s', 'Pyongyang', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'People ’s Party', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'south korean', 'the Kill Chain', 'Korea Air', 'Missile Defense', 'the People ’s Party', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Russia', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'Gangnam', 'Trade', 'Kim Jong - hoon', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Pyongyang', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Saenuri Party', 'north korean', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Gaeseong', 'North ’s', 'korean', 'West Germany', 'North Koreans', 'inter - korean', 'Mount baekdusan', 'Pyongyang', 'Gaeseong', 'Japan', 'the Minjoo Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Lee Soo - hyuk', 'the People ’s Party', 'Gaeseong', 'Pyongyang', 'south korean', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Koreas', 'China', 'Russia', 'the Minjoo Party', 'the National Intelligence Service', 'North Korea', 'People ’s Party', 'Saenuri', 'the Minjoo Party', 'the People ’s Party', 'Saenuri', 'North Korea', 'the Korea Manifesto Center', 'inter - korean', 'Pyongyang', 'the People ’s Party', 'Saenuri', 'Hwang Jin - ha', 'Kim Sung - chan', 'North Korea', 'Trade', 'Kim Jong - hoon', 'Saenuri', 'Shim Yoon - joe', 'Kim Keun - sik', 'North Korea', 'Kyungnam University', 'People ’s Party', 'Unification', 'Chung Dong - young', 'the Minjoo Party ’s', 'Lee Soo - hyuk', 'Hong Ihk - pyo', 'Ha Jung - yul', 'Korea Institute for Security and Unification', 'Gochang', 'North Jeolla Province', 'North Korea', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",14,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.49177405  0.19828466

But this year, the Saenuri Party is also taking the situation seriously, as various reports suggest it is not just the young -- potentially more progressive -- who are reserving their votes.According to Gallup Korea’s survey, 23 percent of those aged 60 or more were counted as swing voters, visibly up from the 13 percent late last year. Other surveys similarly indicated that an increasing number of senior citizens have moved over to the politically centrist zone.The partial breakaway of elderly voters even pushed the conservative party to announce an “emergency” following apprehension that it may not be able to secure the 150 parliamentary majority, much less the original target of 180-200 seats.It is also amid such background that the ruling party has been highlighting a set of pledges to improve the nation’s economy and to pull up the employment rate, seeking the support of pragmatic centrist voters.The Minjoo Party of Korea’s candidate Geum Tae-seop running in Gangseo-1 of Seoul greets passers-by on Wednesday.

Mattner said that she was drugged, abducted and raped in late September in Seoul.She said that while the sexual assault haunted her, the botched investigation into her case by police further broke her down.  After the story surfaced and consequent public attention was paid to the incident, the police station in charge of the investigation decided to post an open letter addressed to Mattner on Facebook on April 1, defending their position.Amid allegations that the police had not properly investigated the crime, the Yongsan Police Station revealed details of the probe and refuted the victim’s statements in both Korean and English in the public letter. An open letter posted by police on Facebook “You are claiming that  police questioned contemptuously while questioning. The police recorded all of the process and has kept the record. We confirmed that there was no insulting question,” a part of the post read. The police also said that they had no way to contact the victim apart from through the Australian Embassy because she had left the country and there were language barriers. They notified her of the investigation process, they claimed. The police even added the link to the Facebook page on Mattner’s campaign on the GoFundMe site. She has shared her story about sexual assault and raised funds to pursue justice in England through the campaign.“It made me feel shocked, unsafe and upset. They tried to harass me by engaging me in the public conversation on Facebook, though they knew formal channels to contact me regarding any information about me or my investigation,” Mattner told The Korea Herald in a phone interview.  In earlier emails exchanged between Mattner and the Korean police, the police admitted that they had the direct email address to reach the victim. According to Mattner, she had emailed the police initially through an email address provided to her, attaching photos of the suspected rapist. However, all the police did was acknowledge the email and then cease communication, she said.Mattner said she had learned about the details of the investigation results regarding her DNA evidence only after the police responded to media about her case and posted the message on Facebook, all without her consent. “They could have directly emailed me or contacted the embassy, but they chose to harass me publicly on Facebook,” she said. “And they had yet to provide evidence supporting any of their claims about the probe.” The post on Facebook prompted outrage on the Internet, with many online commenters condemning the police for failing to protect the victim and publicly humiliating her in public to “save face.”A comment written by a Facebook user Seolhee Park read: “The Yongsan police, you should be ashamed of yourselves to reveal all the details of the victim this way and defending yourselves by refuting the victim’s claims to save your reputation. It is a humiliation to show this badly translated police statement to foreigners. What police should do is to catch the suspect.” The Korea Herald learned that comments written by 12 different people had disappeared from the page. Police admitted to “hiding” the messages. “The comments focused on how police were wrong about posting an open letter, but what we wanted to say to the public was that her claims were different from the truth,” another police officer, in charge of the Facebook page, told The Korea Herald. “We hid some of the messages from being shown, because we were worried that they were missing the point.” One of the comments -- which was captured via screenshot before it disappeared from the Facebook page -- by user Dennis KH Kim read: “I think that it is appropriate to delete this post which includes the victim’s personal information and investigation process as it is an ongoing case.”Cho Ki-woong, a police officer in charge of crimes related to women and juveniles at the Yongsan Police Station, said that they had felt obligated to publicly defend themselves against the “defamatory action.” “Given the victim’s claims in the media, it may seem that police mishandled the case. That’s why we posted the letter to straighten the facts,” Cho told The Korea Herald. “The victim first revealed her own story on her GoFundMe page. We were just refuting her claims that police’s response to the case were not sufficient. What she claims was completely different from what was true.”Cho said the police had never released any information about the probe that the victim had not been aware of. “There must have some miscommunication in the process. We certainly informed that the DNA was collected and CCTV footage was obtained to the victim through the Australian Embassy.”The police’s decision to take her story public on Facebook might neither be legitimate nor appropriate, experts and lawyers pointed out. “This is a typical form of secondary damage facing rape victims. It is shocking that police handled the case this way by revealing the victim’s case in public without her consent,” said Kim Bo-hwa, a senior researcher from the Korea Sexual Violence Relief Center. “This kind of action by police could cause additional damage to the victim’s distress.”“Investigators and judges have a duty to keep victims’ secrets. Posting an open letter including investigation results is a violation of rights,” she said, citing the act on the punishment of sexual crimes and protection of victims enforced in 1994. The law stipulates that victims should not be disadvantaged, and public officials should not reveal victim’s private secrets and personal information learned while performing duties, among other points.  Choi Hee-jin, head of the counseling center for Korea Women’s Hot Line, took issue with low awareness on how to deal with victims of sexual crimes in society. “In Korea, there have been many victims suffering from insensitivity among investigators. The investigators, who do not specialize in sex crimes, tend to suspect the validity of victims’ testimonies and require them to prove their suffering during the investigation process,” she told The Korea Herald. “But such actions can further traumatize the victims.” “There is also a social atmosphere blaming victims for sexual crimes. When victims are turned down by the nation’s justice system, who else can help them?” she posed. “We have a good legal system and institutions to protect victims, but they are not properly implemented.”Lawyer Goh Ji-woon questioned the legitimacy of the police’s decision to reveal personal information via social media, though her story was already public on the GoFundMe campaign page. “The victim can file a lawsuit to seek compensation from the state for failing to properly investigate the case and collect evidence,” she said. “It does not seem to be legitimate for authorities to publish a public letter on social media against the victim.” By Ock Hyun-ju","rape victim to the media ,the sexual assault haunted her ,posted by police on facebook ,online commenters condemning the police ,gofundme campaign page the victim","['Airdre Mattner', 'Korea', 'Mattner', 'Seoul', 'the Yongsan Police Station', 'korean', 'the Australian Embassy', 'Mattner', 'gofundme', 'England', 'Mattner', 'the Korea Herald', 'Mattner', 'korean', 'Mattner', 'Mattner', 'Seolhee Park', 'Yongsan', 'the Korea Herald', 'the Korea Herald', 'Dennis KH Kim', 'Ki - woong', 'Cho', 'the Korea Herald', 'gofundme', 'CCTV', 'the Australian Embassy', 'Kim Bo - hwa', 'the Korea Sexual Violence Relief Center', 'Choi Hee - jin', 'Korea Women ’s Hot Line', 'Korea', 'the Korea Herald', 'Goh Ji - woon', 'gofundme']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63039798 -0.12054483

Though I haven’t decided yet, my parents and grandmother are leaning toward the conservative party.” he said. It is easy to find more voters like Heo’s family in Yongin, home to some 980,000 residents, 60 percent of them comprised of senior citizens spending their retirement and young couples commuting to work by subway -- a 40-minute ride to downtown Seoul.Saenuri Party’s candidate for Yongin Lee Sang-il shows his jacket lined with messages from supporters during his campaign on April 2. Such demographic breakdown and geographical proximity has made Yongin and nearby city Suwon serve as a litmus to predict the outcome of elections in the Seoul metropolitan area, the biggest battleground region where 122 seats are up for grabs out of the 253 constituencies elected via direct vote in constituencies. In the past parliamentary polls, the election results in Yongin and Suwon have been similar to those of the Seoul metropolitan areas.In the 2004 and 2008 general elections, the political parties winning the parliamentary majority were the ones that won the most seats in the two cities. Liberal parties claimed the majority of seats in the National Assembly. In the latest 2012 general election, liberal opposition parties lost the parliamentary majority to the ruling Saenuri, but won the majority of seats in Seoul metropolitan areas. Coincidentally, the cities also gave the majority of votes to liberal candidates, by electing four from the liberal parties, out of seven constituencies.The Minjoo Party’s chief Kim Chong-in supports the party’s Yongin-gu candidate Pyo Chang-won  during a campaign on Monday. With the conservative Saenuri Party and the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea now competing neck-and-neck in the Seoul metropolitan areas, the closely fought race has also been playing out in these swing cites. Among those closely watched races is that held in the Yongin D district. The new constituency pits Rep. Lee Sang-il, who had served as a spokesman during the presidential campaign for then-candidate President Park Geun-hye, against Pyo Chang-won, a former criminology professor popular with young voters. The opinion polls show different results according to pollsters. A survey conducted by national newspaper Hankookilbo showed that Pyo enjoyed a lead over Lee, with 36.9 to 29.4 percent, while local newspaper Kyeongyilbo showed that Lee held the lead over Pyo at 39.2 to 32.8 percent.  “We will bring justice to North Korea dictator Kim Jung-un” said Pyo, also a former police officer, at a rally to support Rep. Baek Kun-ki. Baek was wearing a battle dress uniform for the Special Warfare Command. The former four-star general served as the commander of the SWC. He is running for election to represent the Yongin A constituency. Pyo Chang-won and Rep. Baek Kun-ki give speech to their supporters at Cheoin-gu, Yongin. Yeo Jun-suk/The Korea Herald“I think our party is more up to the task than the Saenuri Party because most of their party members have never served military service,” the former policeman and general said, giving a salute to the audience that ranged from the elderly to young people. The audience response to the 30-minute speech was mixed. Younger voters, such as 35-year-old Kim Jin-ah described Pyo as a trustworthy law enforcement officer, while elder attendees, such as 58-year-old Kim Sung-hwan, dismissed Pyo as a typical liberal-minded politician using fancy rhetoric. But Kim, who has spent his entire life in Yongin, noted that he would cast his ballots for Baek Kun-ki in the direct voting from the constituencies, while choosing the conservative Saenuri Party for the seats elected through proportional representation. “I like his soldierly manners, disciplined attitude and the way we contributed to our constituencies,” the Yongin native told The Korea Herald. “Though I have voted for the conservative parties throughout my life, this time around I’d like to give Baek a chance to win the elections.” he said.By Yeo Jun-suk","raised in seoul most affluent ,downtown seoul saenuri party ,born and raised in seoul ,seoul the 27 year old ,to downtown seoul saenuri party","['YONGIN', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Seoul', 'Gangnam - gu', 'Yongin', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Gangnam', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'the Korea Herald', 'Gangnam', 'Yongin', 'Seoul', 'Saenuri Party ’s', 'Yongin Lee Sang - il', 'Yongin', 'Suwon', 'Seoul', 'Yongin', 'Suwon', 'Seoul', 'the National Assembly', 'Saenuri', 'Seoul', 'the Minjoo Party ’s', 'Kim Chong - in', 'Pyo Chang - win', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Lee Sang - il', 'Park Geun', 'Pyo Chang - won', 'Hankookilbo', 'Pyo', 'Lee', 'Kyeongyilbo', 'Lee', 'Pyo', 'North Korea', 'Kim Jung - un', 'Pyo', 'Baek Kun - ki', 'Baek', 'the Special Warfare Command', 'SWC', 'Pyo Chang - won', 'Baek Kun - ki', 'Yongin', 'Yeo Jun - suk', 'Korea', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Kim Jin - ah', 'Pyo', 'Kim Sung - hwan', 'Pyo', 'Kim', 'Yongin', 'Baek Kun - ki', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Korea Herald', 'Baek', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5485788   0.35778764

With the parties’ public debate and media appearances dedicated to elaboration on their election pledges and policy agendas, a less formal and easygoing approach appears to be the norm on the ground where the politicians meet with voters face-to-face.Saenuri chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung gives a piggyback ride to Park Jong-hee, the party’s candidate for Suwon in Gyeonggi Province. The ruling Saenuri Party’s chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung, for instance, is making full use of his “big brother” charm -- he is known by his supporters to be hearty and valorous. The chairman, who has been elected for five consecutive terms in Busan since 1996, has showcased his ability to engage with voters -- sometimes using self-deprecating jokes to vouch for candidates.“This guy can get the president on the phone, which is something I can’t do,” said Kim on Monday at a rally he attended to support former presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook. The former journalist is running for the Yeonsu district in Incheon. One of Kim’s signature tactics on the campaign trail is “giving a piggyback ride” to some of the party’s other candidates. The seasoned politician has been traveling to constituencies likely to be closely fought to give candidates a boost, touting that candidates he has supported have never been defeated at the polls. The Minjoo Party of Korea’s chief Kim Chong-in dances with supporters during a campaign in Gangseo-gu, Seoul. The main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea’s leader Kim Chong-in appears to be following in the footsteps of the Saenuri leader Kim. The 76-year-old politician set a causal tone for the election campaign by wearing a wig colored in the party’s official hue, dancing alongside younger supporters of the party. The move represents a shift from the usual style of the former economist who has often made elaborate speeches on the economy and policies centering on statistics. Kim has never been elected via a direct vote in a constituency, but has served four terms through proportional representation. On April 1, the first day of the party’s official campaign, Kim filled his speech with pledges containing numbers and statistics. “We will give the young people 700,000 jobs. ... We will give a 300,000-won  pension to all senior citizens whose income falls in the bottom 70 percent,” he said.People’s Party cochairman Rep.

Once considered to be too “aloof” toward realpolitik, the new party’s cochairman is allegedly the first of the party’s leaders to suffer from a hoarse throat during the campaigning period. “I think I am the healthiest and strongest one among our staff,” said Ahn on Friday when he launched the party’s official campaign in the Nowon district of Seoul. The party official noted he has never been late for his or his supported candidates‘ election campaign stops.

Ahn Cheol-soo at a forum hosted by broadcasting journalists.The main opposition party’s chief Kim had suggested the coalition to the newborn minority party, calling for their common goal to take down the current conservative administration and to achieve a change of government.But Rep. Ahn, while acknowledging the need for unity, claimed the Minjoo had no true intention of joining hands on equal terms.With the united opposition bloc scenario crossed out, the Minjoo camp decided to adopt a select-and-concentration strategy, focusing on censuring the administration and on the relatively free-flowing metropolitan area.“We will no longer cling on to the implausible unity as the true essence of the elections is to judge the economic failure of the current administration and ruling party,” said the Minjoo Party’s election planning chief Jung Jang-sun.Party leader Kim Chong-in reiterated his call to citizens to participate in the vote, counting on the election rule that a high voter turnout tends to act in favor of the opposition.“Only your votes may prevent the monopoly of power, promote democracy and take our nation’s economy in the right direction,” he said while stumping for the party’s candidates in the metropolitan areas, including Seoul, Seongnam and Suwon.The Seoul-Gyeonggi cluster has always been the ultimate battlefield in key elections.In the 2012 parliamentary elections, the voting outcomes of 48 constituencies nationwide were decided by a gap of less than 5 percentage points, among which 31 constituencies were located in the metropolitan zone. This also means that candidates in such tightly challenged electorates are desperate for the slightest momentum, including a candidacy unification.“Rep. Ahn, if he truly intends to judge the current administration, should not stand against opposition coalition,” said Kim Byung-kwan, the Minjoo Party candidate for Seongnam’s Bundang-B in Gyeonggi Province.Kim pointed out that Ahn’s concession in the 2011 Seoul mayoral by-election led to the victory of Park Won-soon and of the opposition camp.While the party’s leadership set to focusing on the Seoul-Gyeonggi area, however, former party leader Rep. Moon Jae-in went his own way by showing up in the Gwangju-Jeolla regions, seeking to whip up votes in the long-standing opposition stronghold zone.“Kim is doing a great job in expanding the party’s outer boundaries, but we should also work on our conventional supporters,” Moon said Sunday, upon visiting the southwestern area.Incumbent chief Kim had earlier attempted to dissuade Moon from marking his presence in the so-called Honam region, where public sentiment is largely against the Busan-based Moon.“ is free to go , but I doubt that any of the party’s candidates there would want his appearance ,” Kim told reporters.By Bae Hyun-jung","registered candidates officials said monday ,ultimate battlefield in key elections ,candidates officials said monday candidates ,2011 seoul mayoral by election ,candidates officials said monday","['the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Saenuri Party', 'the National Election Commission', 'Minjoo Party', 'People ’s Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'the People ’s Party', 'Saenuri', 'the Minjoo Party ’s', 'Kim Chong - in', 'the People ’s Party', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Kim', 'Ahn', 'Minjoo', 'Minjoo', 'the Minjoo Party ’s', 'Jung Jang - sun', 'Kim Chong - in', 'Seoul', 'Seongnam', 'Suwon', 'Seoul', 'Kim Byung - kwan', 'Minjoo Party', 'Seongnam ’s Bundang - B', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Kim', 'Ahn ’s', 'Seoul', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Moon', 'Kim', 'Moon', 'Honam', 'Busan', 'Moon', 'Kim', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27126974  0.25584373

The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles on candidate agendas, election trends and notable runners leading up to the race. This is the 14th installment. –EdStruggling to add momentum to their campaigns leading up to the April 13 general election, political parties canvassed key swing constituencies over the weekend, posing as troubleshooters for the people’s economic hardships.The ruling conservative Saenuri Party stepped up its aggression against the opposition camp for holding back the nation’s economy by deterring a series of economic revitalization and labor reform bills.The Minjoo Party of Korea urged voters to “pass judgement on” the Park Geun-hye administration’s economic failures, blaming the conservative side for deepening the nation’s social and economic inequality.“Our goal is to create jobs for the people, but it is the Minjoo Party that has been standing against the idea,” Saenuri chief Rep. Kim Moo-sung repeated on Saturday while canvassing the metropolitan city of Incheon in support of the party’s candidates.Incheon, with 13 constituencies and a considerable pool of undecided swing voters, is considered a highly strategic campaign field both for the ruling and opposition parties.Also, due to its high density of manufacturing industrial complexes and distribution centers, the western seaport city is sensitive to the change in economic policies.  The ruling Saenuri Party chief Rep. Kim Moo-sung  cheers on Saturday for Rep. Hwang Woo-yea, candidate for Incheon's Seo-gu-B constituency.

Hwang Woo-yea.“But it is the Saenuri Party that has been taking real action to revitalize the economy, create jobs and reduce social gaps.”In a matching move, the party’s election committee chief and former Finance Minister Kang Bong-kyun on Sunday released new economic policies, including a plan to pull up the legal minimum wage to 8,000 won  or more from the current 6,030 won over the next four years.“Distribution measures, such as an increase in corporate tax, not only have limited impact but may also weaken the nation’s industrial competitiveness in the long-term,” Kang said.“The key solution is to promote growth first, and then move on to income distribution.”This was a direct attack against the economic democratization platform led by the Minjoo chief Kim Chong-in. The Minjoo Party of Korea chief Kim Chong-in urges citizens to vote, while stumping for party candidates in western Seoul on Sunday. YonhapIn retaliation, the Minjoo Party reiterated its call to judge the Park administration for the nation’s economic difficulties.“It is the Saenuri administration that is liable for our economic reality today,” said party chief Kim Chong-in while campaigning in Gwangju and the Jeolla provinces on Saturday.“Unless we secure seats in the next parliamentary term, the Saenuri Party will continue its misled economic policies.”The ruling party leadership has been largely confident of winning at least 180 seats -- that will allow the party to pass contentious bills without the consent of the opposition.The Gwangju and Jeolla regions -- referred to as the Honam area -- have long been a stronghold for the Minjoo Party and its former incarnations. But due to the defections of several lawmakers who joined the new centrist People’s Party led by Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, the main opposition is expecting a hard battle this year.“We have successfully placed economic issues at the top of the election agenda,” said Minjoo Party spokesperson Kim Sung-soo.“Many voters will agree that it is the current administration and ruling party that should hold responsibility for the economic reality.”The People’s Party, on the other hand, chose to stay away from the economic frame and to criticize the conventional political circles, in an aim to whip up swing votes.“People who have been disappointed over the incompetence of the National Assembly over the past four years are ready to judge both leading parties,” said spokesperson Kim Jae-doo.Sim Sang-jeong of the left-wing Justice Party claimed that the top three parties, obsessed with their power struggle, had failed to suggest distinctive economic policies.By Bae Hyun-jeong","april 13 general election political ,next presidential election kim ,seoul on sunday yonhapin retaliation ,party candidates incheon with 13 ,candidate agendas election trends","['South Korea', 'National Assembly', 'the Korea Herald', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Incheon', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'Incheon', 'Yonhap“The Minjoo Party', 'Kim', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Finance', 'Kang Bong - kyun', 'Kang', 'Minjoo', 'Kim Chong - in', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Kim Chong - in', 'Seoul', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Park', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Chong - in', 'Jeolla', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Jeolla', 'Honam', 'the Minjoo Party', 'People ’s Party', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Minjoo Party', 'Kim Sung - soo', 'People ’s Party', 'the National Assembly', 'Kim Jae - doo', 'Sim Sang - jeong', 'Justice Party', 'Bae Hyun - jeong']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.572182    0.58328146

Cho Won-jin, the second-term lawmaker running in Dalseo district in the city, said to the supporters in a heavy Daegu accent. “If we lose Daegu, it is not just a defeat of the Saenuri Party. It is a defeat to the Republic of Korea and its liberal democracy,” he said.  Rep. Cho Won-jin gives speech to his supporters at the Saenuri Party`s Daegu office. Yonhap.The two-hour event, packed with Saenuri bigwigs and fervent supporters who punctuated the occasion with resounding applause and cheers, represented a snapshot of the conservative party’s stronghold. It is the political hometown of President Park and her father late President Park Chung-hee. Being elected as a lawmaker first in Dalseong district of Daegu in 1998, the female president began her political career aided by strong supports of Daegu residents. Her popularity culminated in the 2012 presidential elections where almost 80 percent of Daegu voters cast their ballots for the daughter of the late president, who also spent most of his earlier life in Daegu.  The city's strong conservativsm is featured in the breakdown of its representatives in the National Assembly and the municipal parliament. All of the lawmakers representing the region at the 19th Assembly and the city’s municipalities are Saenuri members – making the city the only region that has a legislative body monopolized by a single party. “I don’t know about politics and I think all politicians are basically thieves. But, if I have to choose one among those thieves, I will definitely choose a thief from our town,” a 40-year-old man, who runs a sushi restaurant at Pyeonghwa commercial district downtown of the city, told The Korea Herald. Another resident offered more specific rationale to his support for the ruling party. A 50-year-old pharmacist running his business for more than 30 years in the city said that he would support the Saenuri Party to help Park avoid lame-duck presidency and allocate more budgets to boost the city’s faltering economy. One of the candidates seeking to leverage such sentiment was Chung Jong-sup. The former interior minister runs in Dong-gu A district to compete with Rep. Yoo Sung-kull, a former Saenuri lawmaker who left the party in protest against his nomination drop.Saenuri’s Chong Jong-sup talks to a seller at a market on his campaign trail in Daegu. Yeo Jun-suk/The Korea Herald“If you photocopied President Park, I would be what you’d get,” said Chung in an interview with The Korea Herald. “I believe that the president and I see eye-to-eye on the philosophy to govern the nation. In that sense, I am a perfect fit because I have spearheaded the tasks as a cabinet member,” he said. Such enthusiastic loyalty had put Chung on a hot seat. Last year, the former minister was accused by the main opposition party of violating election laws when proposing a toast in favor of the Saenuri Party. One of his ministry’s tasks was to oversee fair parliamentary elections However, Chung and his aides did not bother to dispel such an image on the campaign trail. Instead of elaborating on election pledges and policy agendas, they chanted ""pick the candidate listed number one” to the voters who hold strong allegiance to the conservative party being allocated a top spot at the ballot.  But Chung’s strategy appears to face an exceptional challenge: contesting against his former colleagues who have left the Saenuri Party in the wake of the party’s infamous factional strife. Of the 11 defectors, four were incumbent lawmaker in Daegu, and all of them seek reelection bids as independents.Independent runner Yoo Seong-min shakes hands with citizens in Daegu. Spearheading the group is Rep. Yoo Seong-min. The former whip quit the party months after President Park displayed disapproval toward him for objecting to her policy initiatives. The conservative party dropped him from the nomination list last month, claiming that Yoo’s political stance clashes with its identity. “The Saenuri Party used to boast a wide spectrum of ideologies ,” said Yoo in an interview with The Korea Herald. “But that spectrum has become too narrow over a short period of time. I will help those being excluded from the nomination and discuss election strategies among us,” said Yoo.What could help the Daegu native’s case for reelection is the region’s worsening economy. The former economics professor said in a media interview that he was the right choice to steer the city in the right direction after President Park finishes her term in 2017. One of the economic hurdles facing the city, once home to Korea’s textile industry in the 1980s, is lack of job opportunities for young people. According to the 2015 statistics from Daegu Gyeongbuk Development Institute, the city’s youth unemployment was 11.4 percent, the third biggest employment rate nationwide. “There are no big companies or conglomerates in Daegu. The most lucrative option for young people is working at local Daegu banks,” said Jang Wang-ki, the 48-year-old man who has run an auto repair shop for 23 years in the downtown of the city. “If the Saenuri Party keeps nominating politicians who don’t have any association with the region, then the city’s economy will pay the price,”, said Jang, referring to the candidate Chung, who he said came to the city just a month ago. The Minjoo Party’s Kim Boo-kyum waves to citizens in Daegu. With most of the city’s constituents divided between the Saenuri candidates and the party defectors, one lawmaker from the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea aims to crack the duopoly by offering alternatives to the voters.He is Rep. Kim Boo-kyum. Having been defeated by conservative candidates by a narrow margin in the 2012 parliamentary elections and 2014 race to choose the city’s mayor, the third-term lawmaker is the only liberal candidate ahead of the Saenuri candidate in opinion polls in the constituency. In a survey conducted by local pollster Realmeter, The Minjoo Party’s third-term lawmakers enjoyed a hefty lead over his counterpart Kim Moon-soo, the former governor of Gyeonggi Province, with 52.7 percent to his 38.2 percent in the Suseong A district. “While citizens of Daegu may have strong patriotism and allegiance to the president, they are undoubtedly outraged at the way the local  is headed. I am committed to breaking the nation’s deep-rooted regionalism” said the Minjoo Party candidate said in an interview with The Korea Herald. By Yeo Jun-suk and Lee Seul-gi  South Korea will elect new National Assembly members in a general election on April 13.

In Asia, China and Japan have reported several isolated cases, although neither have reported a full-fledged outbreak.The first infection case in South Korea raised some concerns over the possible spread of the virus here following an outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome last year. Many experts, however, said the chances of a full-blown outbreak are slim, especially in the cooler months when mosquitoes are not active. The virus can be passed on through blood transfusion or sexual intercourse.The virus is almost always non-life threatening and only poses health concerns for pregnant women and their unborn babies, who may be born with abnormally small heads and improperly developed brains.""We will ramp up efforts to prevent the Zika virus from spreading within the military, based on our experience of containing the MERS virus,"" the ministry said.","ministry on thursday to strengthen ,mosquito borne virus last month ,ordered the ministry on thursday ,chemicals to kill off mosquito ,borne virus last month after","[""South Korea 's"", 'Zika', 'Brazil', 'China', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Zika']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40329674  0.54051876

But with tensions in North Korea and the South China Sea running high, the meetings that Asian leaders have on the sidelines could attract more attention than the summit itself.    President Barack Obama has put ...","WASHINGTON   The leaders of China, India, Japan and South Korea are among the heads of government converging on Washington for a summit on countering the nightmarish threat of nuclear terrorism. But with tensions in North Korea and the South China Sea running high, the meetings that Asian leaders have on the sidelines could attract more attention than the summit itself.    President Barack Obama has put a premium on expanding ties with Asia, in part to counter the rise of China. The U.S. has deepened ties with India, and strengthened long-standing alliances with Japan and South Korea while prodding these two core East Asian allies to overcome their historical differences. Despite the strategic rivalry, Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping have also striven to cooperate, which has yielded mixed results. Here's a look at who will be meeting in Washington and the dynamics that will be in play:    JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA: RELUCTANT ALLIES    Obama will reprise a joint meeting he had with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean President Park Geun-hye at the last nuclear security summit held in The Hague in 2014. That marked a concerted, but subtle U.S. push for Tokyo and Seoul to resolve the acrimony between them over Japan's colonial occupation of the Korean Peninsula in the first half of the 20th century and its military's use of Asian sex slaves during World War II. In December, Japan and South Korea reached an agreement including an indirect apology from Abe and a Japanese pledge to provide 1 billion yen  to a fund for the South Korean victims. That has calmed the tensions between the U.S. allies, but uncertainty remains over the implementation of the agreement.    One thing Japan and South Korea have rarely disagreed over is North Korea, whose missiles could target both countries. The White House says Obama, Abe and Park will on Thursday discuss responses to the North Korean threat after its recent nuclear test and space launch and security cooperation.    WHAT OBAMA WANTS FROM CHINA, AND WHAT CHINA WANTS     Obama's meeting with the Chinese leader comes just six months since their last talks in Washington during a state visit. There will be less grandeur this time, but the stakes may be higher. Obama will be urging China to implement the tough U.N. sanctions it signed up to for use against North Korea, its traditional ally. Xi will want the U.S. to restart negotiations with the North, although the prospects appear slim unless sanctions bite and the North makes nuclear concessions. Since annual U.S.-South Korean war games began this month, Pyongyang has been testing missiles and artillery, and has threatened nuclear strikes on Washington and Seoul.    Also on the agenda will be China's island-building and construction of military facilities in the disputed South China Sea. Tensions there look set to intensify with an upcoming ruling from an international tribunal that could challenge the legal basis of Beijing's sweeping territorial claims. China accuses the U.S. of stoking tensions by sending military ships and planes through the area on freedom of navigation maneuvers.    WHO'S TALKING AND NOT TALKING AT THESE TALKS?    Obama's presidency is in its final year, but he's not the only center of attention this week in Washington. Park is set to meet Xi in a sign of how South Korea and China have grown closer through their economic bonds and Beijing's disaffection with North Korea. Park is also slated to meet separately with Abe as Japan-South Korea tensions ease. But with Japan-China relations still hampered by a territorial dispute and historical grievances, Japanese officials say there's no plan for Abe to meet Xi.    Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will also be at the nuclear summit, but there's no prospect for reconciliatory talks with archrival Pakistan because its prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, canceled his Washington trip following a suicide bombing targeting Christians in Lahore that killed more than 70 people.","china wants obama meeting ,rivalry obama and chinese president ,china wants obama meeting with ,strategic rivalry obama and chinese ,south korea reluctant allies obama","['WASHINGTON', 'China', 'India', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Washington', 'North Korea', 'asian', 'Barack Obama', 'China', 'U.S.', 'India', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'east asian', 'Obama', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'Washington', 'JAPAN', 'SOUTH KOREA', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'south korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'the Hague', 'U.S.', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'asian', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Abe', 'japanese', 'south korean', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'the White House', 'Obama', 'Abe', 'Park', 'north korean', 'CHINA', 'chinese', 'Washington', 'China', 'U.N.', 'North Korea', 'Xi', 'U.S.', 'u.s.-south korean', 'Pyongyang', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Beijing', 'China', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'Park', 'Xi', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Beijing', 'North Korea', 'Park', 'Abe', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'Abe', 'Xi', 'indian', 'Narendra Modi', 'Pakistan', 'Nawaz Sharif', 'Washington', 'Christians', 'Lahore']",14,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.8036958   0.39042827

Bae Hyun-jung/The Korea HeraldOh Se-hoon, candidate for the ruling conservative Saenuri Party and former Seoul mayor, announced the start of his election campaign by the Cheonggyecheon Stream, which cuts across Jongno-gu and neighboring Jung-gu.The initiation ceremony, cohosted by Oh and the party’s Jung-gu candidate Ji Sang-wook, was considered a win-win strategy for the two who each have different political circumstances.The urban stream of Cheonggyecheon, redeveloped by former Seoul Mayor and President Lee Myung-bak and refined by his successor Oh Se-hoon, is considered a major administrative achievement of the conservative camp.Through his choice of location, Oh sought to remind the citizens of his mayoral career and to revive his former glory.“I shall make the best use of my administrative experience as Seoul mayor, this time to improve Jongno,” read his campaign banners.Ji, who is relatively more low profile, is more widely known as the husband of retired actress Shim Eun-ha. He has little to lose from his strategic union with Oh, a popular presidential aspirant on friendly terms with President Park Geun-hye. Despite his unrivaled lead in the polls, Ji has been striving to improve ties with the party’s pro-Park group, after winning in an in-party primary against former presidential spokesperson Kim Haeng.Oh, should he wind up victorious in Jongno, will reinstate himself as a ranking party figure, breaking the long political pause since stepping down from his mayoral post in 2011 amid disputes over free school meals.But due to such rising political leverage, he also received feeble support from party chairman Kim Moo-sung.Much in contrast to his opposition counterparts, Kim neither showed up at the party’s Jongno campaign scenes, nor offered encouraging gestures to Oh upon their encounter at the Seoul National Cemetery earlier in the morning.In a public survey conducted last week by local pollster Realmeter, the former mayor soared to No. 3 among presidential hopefuls with 13.8 percent in approval ratings, on the heels of Kim’s 14.4 percent. The Minjoo Party of Korea chief Kim Chong-in  accompanies Rep. Chung Sye-kyun, running in Jongno-gu district, Thursday. The Minjoo Party of Korea’s interim chief Kim Chong-in, on the other hand, spared no efforts in endorsing former party chief Rep. Chung Sye-kyun for his heavyweight match in Jongno.“This April 13 election is about judging the Saenuri Party’s economic maladministration over the past eight years,” Kim said, while stumping for Chung during his early morning campaign at Dongmyo Station.“As former Commerce Minister and economic expert, Chung will play a great role in solving the people’s pending economic hardships.”Kim also stayed by Chung’s side throughout the party’s election campaign ceremony, confirming his support for the party’s key player.Chung made a dramatic comeback in the 2012 general election for the then-Democratic United Party when he achieved a sweeping victory against a ranking pro-presidential aide in the symbolic Jongno. His commitment was taken as a risky self-sacrifice as he had given up his guaranteed win in his longtime constituency in North Jeolla Province upon the leadership’s call.But with former mayor Oh now in the picture, the odds seem to turn against the opposition candidate.Most local polls revealed last week that the incumbent representative Chung was falling behind Oh by a maximum of 11 percentage points.“Years-long election experiences have taught me that one should never rely too much on public polls,” said Chung, shrugging off his supporters’ concerns.“Having been here with the people for the past four years, I firmly feel and believe that the voter sentiment is on our side.”He highlighted his favorable evaluation as having implemented 83.6 percent of his 2012 election pledges.People’s Party cochairman Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo  shakes hands with a citizen while helping the campaign for the party’s Jongno-gu candidate Park Tae-soon on Thursday. Bae Hyun-jung/The Korea HeraldThe newborn centrist minority People’s Party, despite having lower chances of winning in Jongno, nevertheless paid significant attention to the district.While campaigning in Hyehwa-dong, cochairman Ahn Cheol-soo volunteered to usher in and introduce passers-by to his party’s Jongno candidate Park Tae-soon. Citizens, excited to meet the former presidential candidate in person, did not hesitate to give Park well wishes.“The Minjoo Party needs to tune its opinion ,” Ahn told reporters, reiterating his objection to the Minjoo-led unity talks.“Former chief Moon speaks of party solidarity, yet current chief Kim says otherwise.”The Minjoo candidate Chung has been repeatedly calling for a coalition of opposition parties for Jongno, to gather dispersed opposition votes and maximize the probability of government change.By Bae Hyun-jung South Korea will elect new National Assembly members in a general election on April 13.

The Education Ministry said it would run four healing support centers for teachers on a trial basis as part of its efforts to support the mental treatment of those who suffer abuse by students. The photo shows a contract teacher being hit by his students with a broom during class in December in Incheon, Gyeonggi Province. YonhapStarting in Daejeon, Busan, Daegu and Jejudo Island, healing support centers will be established in all municipalities by next year, the ministry said. They will provide a range of systematic support services from mental health checkups, psychological counseling, legal counseling and adjustment checkups. The move came after public concerns grew over lax measures to protect the teachers’ well-being after several high-profile violent incidents at schools. In December last year, five 16-year-old high school students in Icheon, Gyeonggi Province, repeatedly attacked a male contract teacher with a broom while he was checking attendance. Prosecutors sought a one-year jail term for two students last week after the video footage prompted a police investigation earlier this year. A similar incident took place at an elementary school in North Gyeongsang Province earlier this month. A male fourth grader punched his female home room teacher when she disciplined him and told him to apologize to his friend over a quarrel. The teacher received medical treatment for two weeks. According to the Korean Federation of Teachers’ Association, more than 24,500 cases of breach-of-authority were reported in the last five years from local schools, with 95 percent being verbal and physical abuse, sexual harassment and interfering with classes.  A separate survey, conducted on some 1,600 teachers in 2013, showed that nearly 97 percent considered themselves as “emotional laborers.” About 78 percent said their stress level was serious.Despite the large number of cases and reports of mental stress, little support has been provided for teachers so far. In the case of Seoul City, of more than 700 cases reported from March to December last year, only 39 were provided with legal and psychological support.Some municipalities are taking their own initiatives. The Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education on Wednesday said it had recruited a full-time lawyer -- a former teacher -- to provide professional legal services for teachers. Although Seoul City education authorities set up a special legal counseling team of 38 outside lawyers last year, their role has been limited to providing basic consultations, the office said. Experts welcomed the various moves by central and municipal governments but stressed the importance of prevention measures. “Initiatives such as establishing healing centers and strengthening legal counseling are positive moves, but they are all actions to help repair the damage after the fact,” said Cheon Seong-moon, an education professor at Kyungsung University in Busan.“The government should simultaneously come up with effective prevention measures that can be taken before teachers’ rights are affected.” By Lee Hyun-jeong","fourth grader punched his female ,profile violent incidents at schools ,repeatedly attacked male contract teacher ,broom during class in december ,centers for teachers on trial","['korean', 'the Education Ministry', 'Incheon', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Daejeon', 'Jejudo Island', 'Icheon', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'the Korean Federation of Teachers ’ Association', 'Seoul City', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education', 'Seoul City', 'Cheon Seong - moon', 'Kyungsung University', 'Busan', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29019964  0.20253931

""Negotiations aimed at ending nuclear weapons can be possible only when we have powerful means corresponding to nukes.""Cheong Seong-chang, senior research fellow at the state-run South Korean think tank Sejong Institute, has also openly called for nuclear armament, saying it will bring a number of benefits to the country, including maintaining military balance between the two Koreas.""The time has come for Seoul to consider nuclear armament from the standpoint of self-defense rather than relying only on the U.S. nuclear umbrella or U.N. Security Council sanctions,"" Cheong said in an article contributed to a local magazine.But the government dismissed the idea, saying it runs counter to the principle of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.American security experts have also called either for allowing Seoul to seek its own nuclear deterrent or for greater efforts to reassure the Asian ally so as to dissuade it from such a temptation. Doug Bandow, a Korea expert and senior fellow at the Cato Institute, said in an article earlier this month that U.S. policymakers ""should consider the possibility of a nuclear South Korea,"" arguing that protecting the South is ""not worth creating an unnecessary existential threat to the American homeland.""Many experts say that it won't be difficult for South Korea to develop nuclear weapons as the country has a robust nuclear industry in which nuclear reactors produce large quantities of spent fuel that could be reprocessed into weapons-grade plutonium.Mark Fitzpatrick, a nonproliferation expert who heads the U.S. office of the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, said in a recent book that if a new nuclear-armed state were to emerge in Northeast Asia, it would most likely be South Korea. Most American experts, however, don't buy the case for Seoul's nuclear armament.""South Korean proposals for the return of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons to the peninsula or the development of an indigenous nuclear program are the result of declining trust in U.S. resolve.Neither proposal is practical,"" Bruce Klingner, a senior Korea expert at the Heritage Foundation, told Yonhap News Agency.The U.S. ground-based nuclear weapons removed in the 1990s no longer exist and placing U.S. sea- and air-based nuclear weapons into storage bunkers in South Koea would be counter-productive and provide Pyongyang with a high-value target to strike preemptively, he said.""A South Korean nuclear program would divert large portions of the South Korean defense budget from critical requirements to duplicate an existing U.S. capability. A better policy proposal would be to study how best to affirm the value and strength of the US nuclear deterrent to reassure our allies,"" he said.Richard Bush, a senior researcher at the Brookings Institution, said it's premature to take Trump's idea seriously.""Trump is not yet the nominee, and even if he is the nominee he won't necessarily be president,"" he told Yonhap. ""Even if he becomes president, he may gain a more favorable view of South Korea's contribution to American security, of the US's extended nuclear deterrence pledge to the ROK, and of the importance of sustaining the credibility of that pledge in the hearts and minds of Koreans,"" he added.Evans Revere, a former U.S. diplomat and senior adviser for the Albright Stonebridge Group, also strongly criticized the idea, saying it reflects a ""profound lack of understanding of the importance of the international non-proliferation regime. ""Trump's encouragement of a nuclear-armed Japan and South Korea would exacerbate an already complicated security situation in Northeast Asia and turn the region into a potential powder keg,"" Revere said. ""It would justify an even larger and faster nuclear buildup by North Korea.

Kim Moo-sung in Busan and the newborn People’s Party cochairman Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo in the Nowon-A constituency in northeastern Seoul.Rep. Moon Jae-in of The Minjoo Party of Korea has been laying low since he stepped down from the party leadership earlier this year.The Minjoo Party of Korea’s former chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in attends a meeting in support of a candidate running in Daegu on Wednesday.Saenuri head Kim expects little difficulty in winning his sixth parliamentary term in the southeastern conservative stronghold.Adding to his unrivaled lead in public polls, the risk-taking chairman revved up his presence within the party last week when he stood up to what he saw as President Park Geun-hye’s interference in the party’s nomination process.Saenuri Party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung attends a debate in Seoul on Wednesday. By successfully preventing the party from allocating candidates to run against ranking defectors such as Lee Jae-oh and Rep. Yoo Seong-min, Kim consolidated his position as the leader of the “non-Park” faction.Having distanced himself from the current administration, Kim’s goal is to lead the party to victory, in which case he may gain the political momentum for his presidential candidacy.Moon, on the other hand, faces a more complicated battle.His greatest plus-point as of now is that he has stayed out of the nomination dispute and the consequent negative public sentiment, which has let him keep his reputation relatively intact.According to most local pollsters in the third week of March, Moon had the highest support among potential presidential runners, maintaining a 10-week lead.But for his presidential bid to be competitive, he will need two things: incumbent leader Kim Chong-in’s cooperation, and a strong Minjoo Party presence in the Assembly.The interim chief Kim, who is listed as the party’s No. 2 candidate for proportional representation, has been seeking to erase the legacies of Moon’s leadership, as well as that of former President Roh Moo-hyun, who belonged to the party’s predecessor.People’s Party co-chairman Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo speaks during a rally held for the metropolitan constituencies at the National Assembly on Wednesday. Minor party representative Rep. Ahn faces a double whammy. Not only does he have to lead his new party into winning 40 seats as promised, but he also has a harder fight than Kim in his Nowon-A constituency, where he is closely rivalled by Saenuri candidate Lee Jun-seok.While the respective ranking figures face their battle, parties are striving to win an upper hand in the Seoul-Gyeonggi metropolitan region, which is often considered a central barometer of the nation’s political sentiment. In the 2012 elections, amid heightened public resentment against the former Lee Myung-bak government, the opposition bloc took a sweeping 61.6 percent of votes in Seoul-Gyeonggi. But in the 2008 elections, which came soon after Lee’s election, the then-Grand National Party won 72.9 percent, reflecting the support for the new administration.South Korea will elect new National Assembly members in a general election on April 13. The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles on candidate agendas, election trends and notable runners leading up to the race.

Won Yoo-chul  attend a campaign launch ceremony for Gyeonggi Province at the party office in Suwon on Tuesday.“But this year, frankly speaking, I have been so skeptical about voting that I even considered casting a void ballot.”Kim has long been a firm supporter of the now-opposition camp which is currently represented by The Minjoo Party of Korea, despite successive changes of its name and identity.“Though I didn‘t agree with every decision made by the Minjoo camp, I believed that the conservative-led politics needs to be challenged and changed,“ he said. Members of the “THE CUT” team, comprised of former preliminary candidates including Rep. Jung Cheong-rae who have been dropped from nominations, hold a press conference at the National Assembly on Tuesday declaring their support for the party’s election win. “But looking back on parliamentary history, I am no longer sure that the current opposition is a valid alternative after all.”Kim is among numerous young voters in their 20s and 30s who remain undecided on who to show political support for. “Over recent years, the public’s interest in elections has visibly faded, while its aversion has soared, which means that the voter turnout will continue its current downtrend,” said Bae Jong-chan, senior analyst at local pollster Research & Research.The official thus predicted that voter participation for this year’s general election is likely to dip lower than 50 percent.Other experts choose to look on the bright side.“The early voting system may pull up the turnout to a certain extent by allowing passive voters to head to the polls,” said Yoon Hee-woong, senior researcher at Opinion Live.Starting from this year’s elections, the National Election Commission is to adopt an early voting system, enabling voters to cast their ballot in advance, within a week prior to the voting day.However, few disagree that the public is showing a growing level of fatigue toward the election or politics in general.“The factional feuds that marred the recent candidate nominations rekindled the public’s chronic fatigue toward politics” said Lee Nae-young, professor of politics at Korea University.“But the rise of new alternatives, including a centrist third party, has also expanded the range of selection for swing voters with no specific party affiliation.”It is still uncertain whether the undecided swing voters and disappointed party supporters will turn to the new centrist People’s Party, but the two leading parties certainly lost some ground over the past weeks.According to a survey last week by local pollster Realmeter on 2,522 voters nationwide, the ruling Saenuri Party and the Minjoo Party’s general ratings stood at 38.3 percent and 24.9 percent, down 3.2-3.4 percentage points respectively.The greater impact was that both parties saw a decline in areas considered their unfaltering strongholds. Saenuri lost 14 percentage points in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province, while the Minjoo Party lost 6.1 percentage points in Gwangju and the Jeolla Provinces.What divided the solid conservative voter pool was the clash between non-mainstreamers and those close to President Park Geun-hye, which led to defections such as that of high-profile Daegu lawmaker Rep. Yoo Seong-min. Putting the Minjoo Party at peril has been the appearance of the People’s Party and the consequent defection of several Jeolla-based members.Though the immediate impact was more conspicuous for the conservative pool, observers noted that it is the opposition camp that may suffer a greater blow from voter apathy.“The unchanging rule is that the higher the voter turnout, the more beneficial for the opposition side,” said Yoon.In line with such a theory, the ruling Uri Party had won 41.99 percent support in the 2004 general election, beating the then-opposition Grand National Party, which is now the Saenuri Party. The voter turnout at the time exceeded 60 percent, reflecting the public‘s resentment toward the GNP’s impeachment of then-President Roh.In contrast, in the following elections in 2008, the turnout stood at a mere 46.1 percent, and the conservative camp succeeded in securing a parliamentary majority.By Bae Hyun-jung South Korea will elect new National Assembly members in a general election on April 13.

The real-estate mogul has also said he would allow South Korea and Japan to go nuclear.Seoul has so far refrained from commenting on such accusations, saying it does not interfere in the domestic politics of another country.However, responding to growing calls for the government to address the issue, a ministry spokesman stressed that South Korea continues to make large contributions to the U.S. military presence here and remains committed to keeping nuclear weapons off the peninsula.""Our government contributes to and plays a role in maintaining and strengthening the South Korea-U.S. joint defense posture and creating stable conditions for the stationing of U.S. forces in Korea,"" Cho June-hyuck said during a regular press briefing.""Our government is closely monitoring the U.S. presidential election and the foreign policies of key candidates,"" he added. ""We have made and will continue to make outreach efforts to the campaigners of key candidates, including Mr. Trump, to learn about their policies on the Korean Peninsula and deliver our positions on foreign policy issues.""About 28,500 American troops are stationed in South Korea to deter North Korean aggression, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War that ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, leaving the divided peninsula still technically at war.Seoul has long shared the cost of stationing U.S. forces. In 2014, the two countries renewed their cost-sharing agreement, known as the Special Measures Agreement, with Seoul agreeing to pay 920 billion won for the upkeep of the U.S. troops in 2014, a 5.8 percent increase from the year prior.Moreover, the American military presence on the peninsula is seen as in line with U.S. national interests in a region marked by a rising China.","republican front runner donald trump ,camp of key presidential candidates ,runner donald trump to improve ,campaign camp of key presidential ,japan to go nuclear seoul","['South Korea', 'U.S.', 'republican', 'Donald Trump', 'the Foreign Ministry', 'South Korea', 'Trump', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'Cho', 'U.S.', 'Trump', 'american', 'South Korea', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'the Special Measures Agreement', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'american', 'U.S.', 'China']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40738967  0.13447571

This was when TV sets were becoming popular in Korea and served as the center of home life.But times have changed and it is rare to come across such a scene nowadays. A man is eating alone at a restaurant specially designed for “honbobjok,” people who eat alone, in Sinchon, Seoul. YonhapShin Hyang-gi, 50, who lives in Seoul with her husband and three children, said she cannot remember the last time she watched TV with her family.“Even when all my children are at home, they spend time separately watching their favorite shows on streaming websites via smartphones,” said Shin.According to a survey released this week on 6,637 individuals who live with their family in Korea, one-third of them said they watched TV alone at home.Of the 2,190 respondents who watched TV alone, 67 percent cited lack of time with family members as the reason, while 27.2 percent prefer different channels and 5.6 percent do so in order to prevent children from binge-watching.South Korea has traditionally valued a family-oriented lifestyle largely influenced by Confucianism that highlights filial piety, however, modern-day Koreans now have different lifestyle patterns.Society these days centers on work and involves long commuting hours. The lifestyle of youths also has a heavy emphasis on studies. Such factors are gradually dissolving the definition of family here, experts said.“Koreans are living a dull monochromatic life. The young generation does not have enough time to spend with their family after studying or working late. Those in their 50 and 60s have worked for their entire life so they do not know how to spend quality family time,” said professor Lee Taek-gwang from Kyunghee University.According to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the average working hours for Koreans is the highest at 2,285 hours annually, about 30 percent higher than the average.  Data from Statistics Korea also stated that in 2015, just 43 minutes out of a total of 4 hours and 28 minutes of daily spare time was spent with other people including family members. Family bonds are also being reshaped by the soaring number of single-person households, who tend to eat meals or spend leisure time alone at home. This lifestyle trend has even led to a new word being coined in Korean, “honbobjok,” which directly translates to “people who eat meals alone.”“It’s actually more comfortable to eat alone. I think it’s better to save energy and time not having to talk with others while eating,” said 31-year-old worker Bae Chung-yoon. He added that he normally eats at home while listening to music on earphones, with his eyes fixed on his smartphone.According to statistics, single-person households made up about 26 percent, or 5 million, of the total households tallied in 2015. By 2035, this number is expected to swell to 7 million, or 34 percent of total households. Experts anticipate that this lifestyle trend will continue. “In fact, being alone in Korean society has its upside as it can help people to achieve high quality performance, since they do not have to unnecessarily worry about mingling or reading others’ emotions,” professor Gwak Geum-ju from Seoul National University told The Korea Herald.“Families are certainly a source of support and a medium for sharing emotions. But obsessive dependence on each other has also often become a bane for familial relationships in Korea,” she added.“Koreans should make use of their family in a wiser way, along with changing lifestyles and the social definition of family.”By Kim Da-sol","eating alone at restaurant specially ,her family while watching television ,eat alone in sinchon seoul ,watched tv with her family ,having meal with her family","['Korea', 'Korea', 'Sinchon', 'Seoul', 'Hyang', 'Seoul', 'Shin', 'Korea', 'South Korea', 'Koreans', 'Lee Taek - gwang', 'Kyunghee University', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'Koreans', 'Statistics Korea', 'Korean', 'Bae Chung - yoon', 'korean', 'Gwak Geum - ju', 'Seoul National University', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea', 'Kim Da - sol']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50496227 -0.06921095

The Education Ministry said the score of the College Scholastic Aptitude Test, or Suneung, will be invalid if test-takers do not sit for the Korean history exam. The new rule is part of the ministry’s guidelines and plans for the CSAT this year. The ministry annually releases the basic scheme for the national college entrance exam at the start of the school year. The test will be will held on Nov. 17 nationwide. The ministry decided in 2013 to make the Korean history test mandatory, upon the Park Geun-hye administration’s push to strengthen Korean history education. CSAT director Lee Chang-hoon of the Korean Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation speaks during a press briefing on this year’s CSAT rules in Sejong City on Tuesday. The move, however, sparked heated debate, with those who supported it citing the need for more emphasis on history education. Those who opposed the move said that it would put excessive academic burden on students. Proponents of the mandatory history exam highlighted the need to raise “national spirit” through history education. Others claimed that the move would only lead to the growth of the private education market. In 2013, only 7.1 percent of Suneung takers chose Korean history for their optional test courses, indicating lack interest in the subject.  In response to public concern that the new requirement would result in greater dependency on private education, the Education Ministry stressed that the mandatory Korean history test would be easy, with only 20 questions. The test will also be graded under absolute evaluation to reduce the burden on students, it added. The education authorities will come up with more details of the exam in July. The incumbent government’s emphasis on history education has often led to debates over its social, political and ideological implications.The latest controversy was the government’s decision in November last year to officially reinstate state-issued history textbooks for secondary education from next year. The government had argued that the majority of high school history textbooks are left-leaning. It will be the first time since 1974 that history textbooks used for secondary education will be authored by the government. The state-issued history textbooks have drawn fierce opposition from progressives over the decision making and publication process which has remained largely undisclosed. Opponents have also claimed the state’s direct involvement will lead to biased descriptions of modern history, including the past dictatorship.The government has so far finalized 47 members of the textbook review committee but only revealed the name of one of them -- Shin Hyung-sik, a professor emeritus at Ewha Womans University. They said the other names of others will remain undisclosed for security reasons. The government had initially vowed to keep the entire publication process transparent. In December last year, some civic groups, including Minbyun, or Lawyers for a Democratic Society, brought the textbook case to the Constitutional Court, claiming that reinstating state-authored history textbooks “infringed the impartiality of education.” The new history textbooks will be used in schools from March next year.

But they dismissed Trump's remarks as part of his ""surreal and populist"" campaign rhetoric.""His mentions of the South's nuclear armament and the potential withdrawal of U.S. forces from the Korean Peninsula are quite worrisome,"" said Chang Yong-seok, a senior researcher at the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies at Seoul National University.""But that may be just empty talk as he caters to the public opinion in the U.S. that the South should stand on its own feet militarily  rather than depending on what he claims to be a costly U.S. security umbrella.""Whether Trump's remarks were part of his aggressive bid for the White House, his stance gave a boost to those who argue that Seoul should consider building nuclear arms or asking Washington to redeploy tactical nuclear arms that were withdrawn from the peninsula shortly before an inter-Korean denuclearization accord took effect in 1992.Calls for nuclear armament reemerged here after Pyongyang's nuclear test in January and long-range rocket launch in February.A series of prominent politicians and scholars such as former Saenuri Party leader Chung Mong-joon and the party's current floor leader Rep. Won Yoo-chul have demanded that Seoul consider arming itself with nuclear bombs.The demand for the South's nuclearization has risen amid growing misgivings about U.S. security commitment. Some observers noted that under the U.S.' ""retrenchment"" policy of reducing international engagement and expenditures, Washington might feel reluctant to immediately engage in a contingency on the peninsula.A security expert here said that the South should nurture at least ""latent"" nuclear weapons capabilities to better deal with the evolving nuclear threats from the North and potential threats from neighboring states.""We need to seriously review the nuclear option, meaning we should own the capabilities to develop nuclear arms in a minimum period of time in order to use them in case of a contingency here,"" he said, declining to be identified for the sensitivity of the issue.""We should consider potential threats not only from the North but also from a nuclear-armed China and Japan, with which we have a long-standing territorial feud.""Those in support of the South's nuclear option say that a nuclear-power status would enable the South to bolster national pride and secure a more balanced relationship with its superpower ally, the U.S., and curtail heavy expenditures on its conventional military buildup.Opponents, however, emphasized that the benefits of nuclear arms should be weighed against the ""heavy costs,"" which they say will range from international isolation to the dismantlement of the South Korea-U.S. alliance.In particular, they said that the South, if it were to opt to go nuclear, would jeopardize the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that the U.S. has so avidly cherished even with a declaration of a ""nuclear-free"" world.""So far, North Korea is the only country that tried to develop nuclear arms under the NPT regime though it later withdrew from the treaty,"" said Park Ihn-hwi, an international studies professor at Ehwa Womans University.""India, Pakistan and Israel have pursued nuclear arms, but they were not NPT members. So should it pursue nuclear arms, the South, now regarded as an exemplary non-proliferation state, would deal a blow to the NPT order.""Park added that the South with an ""export-driven economy"" could be slapped with crippling international sanctions should it go nuclear. Exports contribute about 70 percent of the South's annual economic growth.       ""The South's economy would not be able to withstand the stress from the sanctions even for half a year,"" he said.The sanctions for the South's nuclearization would also include a ban on its import of fuel to power its 23 nuclear reactors that account for some 30 percent of its total electricity production, analysts said.Kim Tae-hyun, international politics professor at Chung-Ang University, said that it would be ""wiser"" for the South to utilize the calls for nuclear arms to pressure the U.S. to bolster its nuclear deterrence against the North.""To allay rising public security concerns here, Seoul can demand that Washington explore ways to enhance the credibility of its security commitment to the defense of its crucial Asian ally,"" he said.","debate over seoul potential nuclear ,nuclearization but they dismissed trump ,republican front runner donald trump ,seoul should consider building nuclear ,washington to redeploy tactical nuclear","['republican', ""Donald Trump 's"", 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'the New York Times', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'China', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Trump', 'U.S.', 'Chang Yong - seok', 'the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies', 'Seoul National University', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Trump', 'the White House', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'inter - korean', 'Pyongyang', 'Saenuri Party', 'Chung Mong - joon', 'Won Yoo', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'China', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'North Korea', 'NPT', 'Park Ihn - hwi', 'Ehwa Womans University', 'Pakistan', 'Israel', 'NPT', 'NPT', 'Kim Tae - hyun', 'Chung - Ang University', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'asian']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52719057  0.43540359

The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles on candidate agendas, election trends and notable runners leading up to the race. This is the ninth installment. --EdAt the April 13 general election, voters here will see a significant change in the balloting process, with an improved system to guarantee reliability and accuracy.The National Election Committee announced that it would be implementing new electoral rules that mandates polling stations use holographic technology to authenticate ballot boxes. This method to prevent counterfeit notes will be attached to the boxes and used to unlock them. The election watchdog said that the changes were designed to increase efficiency in managing votes compared to the previous use of near-field communication technology. According to officials, the NFC-based system had cost a huge amount of taxpayers’ money and was also time-consuming for public workers. “The use of NFC to verify ballot boxes was quite a complicated process,” said Lee Jae-yoon, a public relations official from the election watchdog group. Participants try casting ballots under the new system at the National Election Commission’s district office in Changwon on March 17. Yonhap    NFC chips were previously installed on the boxes to act as locks. Ballot counters had to verify them by downloading a mobile app to read the NFC code. The app was also only available for android phones.The authorities highlighted that the new system is as reliable as the previous one because the holographic images are only accessible via a digital watermark. Election officials will be assigned to the polling stations to oversee the process. The holographic images are also designed in a way that prevents duplication and reuse. They are also cheaper than the previous system by around 10 to 20 million won as they only require printing expenses. The use of holographic images is one of the measures that the election watchdog group is taking to address concerns among some progressive lawmakers and activists about the reliability and accuracy of the nation’s vote-counting system.Officials demonstrate the ballot-counting machine at the National Election Commission’s district office in Changwon on March 17. YonhapOther measures include the decision to remove wireless LAN cards from laptops used by the election watchdog. Lawmakers, such as Rep. Jung Chung-rae from the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea, had raised concerns that the laptops are vulnerable to hackers aiming to rig the elections. The election watchdog also changed the appearance of ballots to reduce undervotes. There will be spaces between the names of candidates on ballots so that voters will be less likely to cast nullified votes by marking on the boundaries. “Since the previous ballots did not have spaces between the names of the candidates, some votes marked on the boundary and were counted as null,” said Lee. “We are less likely to debate whether some ballots should be nullified or not,” she added. Other changes include the introduction of machines to count and sort ballots. There will also be a tool to assist those with difficulties in using their hands to cast ballots by using their wrists or mouth. An official demonstrates how to use equipment designed to help people who have difficulties using their hands to cast ballots at the National Election Commission’s district office in Changwon on March 17. YonhapThe election next month will also be the first parliamentary election in which balloters can vote in advance without having to preregister themselves as legitimate voters. Advance voting will take place from April 8 to 9. Those who will not be able to make it on the actual election date can visit designated polling stations, identify themselves and vote. In the past, balloters had to register themselves as legitimate voters beforehand to cast their ballots in advance. Sailors at sea will also be able to cast their ballots on board ships for the first time. They will mark their ballots on the vessel and send them to election authorities via telecommunication. The ballots will be sent to the NEC sealed, a measure to prevent the NEC from revealing the sailors’ votes.Such advanced electoral system has attracted attention from abroad. Earlier this year, the NEC signed memorandum of understandings with the election watchdog groups of other countries -- including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Maldives and Republic of Uzbekistan -- to share balloting technology.“The focus of cooperation is how to build an electronic voting system that can prevent vote-rigging and improve vote counting,” said Kim Young-tak, a NEC official dealing with the agency’s foreign aid programs. “They place more trust in an electronic counting system than manual ones,” he said. The official added that there are talks underway with the Kenyan and Ecuadorian governments to provide them with technical support in their upcoming elections. He highlighted that the Korean system appeals to these nations due to its accuracy and rapid process of vote counting. Kyrgyzstan, a nation that became independent country in 1991, was the first country to use Korea’s electronic voting system at its parliamentary election. Seoul provided the fledgling democracy with financial support to establish electronic voting machines and improve its electoral procedures.

The Saenuri Party plans to announce Monday a collective leadership that includes factional big shots and a former cabinet member. Its leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung, whip Rep. Won Yoo-chul, Reps. Rhee In-jae and Seo Cheong-won and former finance minister Kang Bong-kyun would serve as cochairmen. Faced with public pushback from the now-infamous clashes between the faction close to President Park Geun-hye and dissenters led by party leader Kim, the party renewed its pledge to recover its parliamentary majority. With the recent chain defections, the Saenuri currently holds 146 out of the 292 seats.The Saenuri Party’s Busan office holds a convention to launch an organization tasked with leading the election campaign. Yonhap“Our future would be at stake if the Saenuri lost a majority ,” said party chief Kim, who had set the goal for the upcoming April elections as winning 180 or more seats, a number required for the party to pass contentious bills without negotiating a deal with opposition parties.The Minjoo Party is expected to flock around interim leader Kim Chong-in, who will also lead solo the party’s election campaign. Kim has recently survived a leadership crisis over the proportional representation list, in which he had listed himself as a top-priority candidate.Defining the upcoming elections as a “judgment” of what it viewed as “flawed” economic policies of the Park administration, the main opposition party is set to focus its election pledges and party platform upon economic issues. While Kim publicly said that his goal is to keep the party’s current 107 seats, some key members suggested they could win up to 130 seats, if the opposition parties agreed to nominate a single candidate in battleground districts where several opposition candidates are set to compete with one another.    “Our goal is to win between 120 and 130 seats,” said the Minjoo Party’s former whip Rep. Woo Yoon-keun in a media interview. “ we have to send a single candidate to constituencies such as Seoul and its neighboring cities.”  Out of the 253 seats elected through direct votes in constituencies, 178 seats were being contested between a single candidate from the ruling party and multiple candidates from the opposition parties. Among them, 105 seats were in Seoul and nearby metropolitan areas. The Minjoo Party of Korea holds a convention at Gwangju to introduce its candidates to the voters. YonhapBut the prospect of building a coalition remains bleak as the minor opposition parties -- the centrist People’s Party and the more progressive Justice Party -- have refused to accept the offer, criticizing the Minjoo Party for “exploiting” its status as the main opposition during negotiation.  The Peoples’ party vowed to reprimand those candidates seeking to negotiate a deal without the approval of the party leadership. The 21-member party aims to win more than 20 seats, a number that allows the newborn party to secure government funding and exercise tie-breaking vote in the legislative process.   The Justice Party, which has been counting on building an opposition coalition, followed suit after the main opposition named its candidates in the constituencies of the minor party’s leader Rep. Shim Sang-jung and its whip Rep. Jeong Jin-hoo.By Yeo Jun-suk","for the upcoming april elections ,2017 presidential race the saenuri ,election campaign yonhap our future ,party plans to announce monday ,until the 2017 presidential race","['Saenuri Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'Won Yoo', 'Seo Cheong - won', 'Kang Bong - kyun', 'Park Geun', 'Kim', 'Saenuri', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'Saenuri', 'Kim', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Kim Chong - in', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'the Minjoo Party ’s', 'Woo Yoon - keun', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'People ’s Party', 'Justice Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'the Justice Party', 'Shim Sang - jung', 'Jeong Jin - hoo', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54612237  0.14068466

The competition rate is 3.7 to 1, compared with 4.84 to 1 in the 2004 parliamentary elections.It also noted 158 candidates are vying for the remaining 47 seats, which will be allocated to political parties according to the numbers of votes that the parties receive overall under proportional representation.","week for april parliamentary race ,next four years election organizers ,april parliamentary race that will ,years election organizers said sunday ,for april parliamentary race","['Saenuri Party', 'the National Assembly', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Saenuri', 'National Assembly Advancement Law', 'Cho Dong - won', 'Kim', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Chong - in', 'Park Geun', 'Lee Yong - seob', 'Kim', ""People 's Party""]",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.79168844  0.2077852

The election law requires candidates from political parties to be endorsed by their leaders and independent candidates to be endorsed by between 300 and 500 supporters.Since the law bans candidates from launching their election campaigns before March 30, they are not able to hold rallies until then. Instead, they can publicize themselves via text messages. Only the candidate can send such text messages to voters at a maximum of five times for each respondent. Candidates Rep. Lee Jung-hyun  of the Saenuri Party, Noh Gwan-gyu of The Minjoo Party of Korea and Koo Hee-seung of the People’s Party leave after registering themselves with the election commission office at Suncheon, South Jeolla Province, Thursday. “Those seeking to represent the people have to observe the laws on the campaign trail,” said Lee In-bok, the chairperson of the National Election Commission, urging a fair race up to April 13. “If the candidates violate the rules, they will be held accountable,” he said. The violations include slandering candidates by spreading false rumors, bribing voters and manipulating opinion polls. The candidates also have to make public their total assets, criminal, military and tax records, among others. The transition to the election campaign came after mainstream parties finished their nomination process. Some 33 percent of incumbent lawmakers were denied opportunity to run in the elections. Out of 288 incumbents, 96 were denied nomination by their parties. The Saenuri Party managed to replace about 38 percent of its incumbents with political rookies, while the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea and the People’s Party achieved turnout rates of almost 29 percent and 24 percent, respectively. But the parties were far from achieving the goals that they had set before the nomination battle. The Saenuri Party, who had promised to select all candidates through opinion polls and primaries among grassroots members and average voters, only chose 56.4 percent of the candidates through the process. Instead, the ruling party returned to old tactics – nominating political heavyweights supported by factions close to the president without preliminary competition. “It was the worst nomination process that stifles our democracy,” said Rep. Cho Hae-jin who defected from the party to run as an independent.  The same was true for the Minjoo Party. It had vowed to allocate 30 percent of parliamentary seats elected through proportional representation to female politicians, but only 12 percent of the applicants was included in the list. The main opposition’s pledge to attract more young politicians was overshadowed by the power struggle between the hawkish wing of the party and its interim leader Rep. Kim Chong-in. Some prospective candidates protested against what they view as an “unilateral” decision to exclude them from the list.Both parties’ No. 1 picks for the proportional seat were scientists, a move reflecting the country’s current infatuation with artificial intelligence sparked off by the Go match between Lee Se-dol and AlphaGo earlier this month.The rival parties, meanwhile, failed to embrace ethnic diversity in proportional nomination. Most foreign immigrants were either excluded from the list or ended up being placed far in the back with unlikely chances of winning. “It was a huge disappointment for people,” said Lee Jung-hee, political professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. “The parties have to show their political agendas through the nomination, but they didn’t. I am afraid that it could worsen peoples’ frustration with politics,” said Lee.

The number of participants for this year will be the largest since the program was initiated in 2013, the ministry said. Previously, only 20 participants went overseas annually to help developing countries in their education programs as a project for Official Development Assistance  through the Korea International Cooperation Agency .Under the ODA project so far, South Korea has sent teachers to eight countries, mostly those that are developing such as Ethiopia and Swaziland. But this year, South Korea will dispatch some to non-ODA countries, according to the NIIED.As a long-term stay program, some 140 teachers will lecture at regular schools on such subjects as Korean language, mathematics, science and computers. However, 10 positions were open to retired teachers, university professors and educational administrators with more than 10 years of experience. They will be assigned to serve as advisers for the host countries' education-related divisions.During their one-year stay starting in August, the teachers going to the ODA countries will receive a monthly payment of 2.5 million won  in addition to monthly living expenses of 1 million won plus air fare.Those going to non-ODA countries will be paid a similar salary by the host countries with living expenses and air fare covered as well.The 160 university students will serve as teachers for roughly one month during their vacation period.The students to be dispatched overseas will have air fare and living expenses covered if they file education program proposals to NIIED.Long-term applications will be accepted until April 22 while short-term applications will be accepted by April 29.

That makes me feel a sense of responsibility about my decision on whether to leave the office,” he said.  The leader pledged to overhaul the party that has been marred by factional strife. He warned against party dissenters who he viewed as an obstacle to the party winning the parliamentary and presidential elections. Kim’s decision came after the party’s former leader and other key figures pleaded with Kim to stay in the feud-ridden party and bring it to election victory. The party leadership apologized to the interim leader for “angering” him. Kim had contended that he had taken the helm to “salvage” the beleaguered party. The Minjoo Party of Korea chairman Kim Chong-in receives questions from reporters at the National Assembly. YonhapThe feud left Kim with enhanced authority to steer the party into the post elections. The party leadership endorsed the nomination list that assigns him the No.2 slot for the seats elected through proportional representation. “The designation  shows the strong determination that Kim will spearhead the election campaign as the face of our party and bring us to the victory,” said Minjoo Party’s spokesman Rep. Kim Sung-soo. The leader described the nomination of himself as an “an inevitable choice” to lead the party after the elections. Although Kim’s recommendation for the first spot -- math professor Park Kyung-mi -- made it into the final version, most of his other choices for the proportional candidates were either excluded or placed down the list. Instead, figures recommended by the former leader Rep. Moon Jae-in managed to be included near the top of the list.The Minjoo Party had suffered days of tug of war between the interim leader and the hawkish wing of the party, which had protested his decision to exclude them from the nomination and place his choices near the top of the party’s choices for proportional representations. The leader had responded by threatening to resign, prompting former party chairman Moon Jae-in to visit his home to persuade him to stay. Other members of the party’s leadership had offered to resign in exchange.By Yeo Jun-suk","victory in the april elections ,post elections the party leadership ,will spearhead the election campaign ,days left before the elections ,threatening to resign prompting former","['Minjoo Party', 'Kim Chong - in', 'Kim', 'the National Assembly', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Kim Chong - in', 'the National Assembly', 'yonhapthe', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Minjoo Party ’s', 'Kim Sung - soo', 'Kim', 'Park Kyung - mi', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65071476  0.26904494

609,609,[ELECTION 2016] Parties brush voters aside in battle to win,"Decades of regionalism seem to have left South Korean voters with a certain political inertia -- one in which they continue to vote for a specific favored party, regardless of its policies or the candidate.It is this voter allegiance that often gives political parties the confidence, as well as the discretion, to freely move their candidates from one constituency to another, without sweating over its impact at the ba...","Decades of regionalism seem to have left South Korean voters with a certain political inertia -- one in which they continue to vote for a specific favored party, regardless of its policies or the candidate.It is this voter allegiance that often gives political parties the confidence, as well as the discretion, to freely move their candidates from one constituency to another, without sweating over its impact at the ballot box.But such arbitrary reallocation, though considered a useful deployment strategy in elections, may also backfire on the parties and candidates, should voters disapprove.Supporters of the Saenuri Party’s Rep. Lee Jae-oh protest the party’s decision to drop his nomination in Seoul on March 16.  A recent example is the ruling conservative Saenuri Party’s incumbent fifth-termer Rep. Hwang Woo-yea, who shifted his affiliation to a new neighboring constituency after failing to receive the party’s nomination for his current district.“Based on my experience of boosting the international city of Songdo, I will now work on developing the northwestern belt so as to create an economically powerful Incheon,” Hwang said.The lawmaker was granted candidacy in the Seo-gu-B constituency in Incheon last week, after being shoved out of his current Yeonsu-gu constituency, located just south of Seo-gu.The former deputy prime minister and minister of education had lost favor for his lukewarm support of state-authored history textbooks, a project strongly propelled by the party leadership and President Park Geun-hye. But by volunteering to run in the challenging new constituency, which is considered an opposition stronghold, he made his way back onto the candidate list.The Saenuri Party has also been blamed for designating former presidential officials to advantageous constituencies, regardless of their regional affiliation or the local voter sentiment.The exception was Cho Yoon-sun, a former gender equality minister and presidential secretary for state affairs, who declined to be sent to another constituency after losing the regional primary in her current Seocho-A constituency.A party member of The Minjoo Party of Korea is blocked while trying to enter the party chairman’s office to protest Kim Chong-in’s nomination on March 21. The main opposition party, too, is prone to shuffling candidates.Ever since it cut off popular activist figure Rep. Jung Cheong-rae and nominated the party’s chief publicist Sohn Hye-won to his Mapo-B constituency in Seoul, The Minjoo Party of Korea has been swamped with protests by Jung’s supporters and some local voters.The protests died down once Jung pledged his support for Sohn, but complaints persisted on the party’s centralized nomination process.Supporters of members who have been omitted from the People’s Party nominations clash with party officials at the National Assembly on March 21. Both rival parties also came under fire over their lists of proportional representation candidates, which in voters‘ eyes have turned into a fraternal list of who to share the next parliamentary seats with, rather than choosing candidates that represent the party’s main policy directions.The Saenuri Party’s list, for instance, includes controversial figures such as the former chief of the state-run railroad company KORAIL, who was accused of responding excessively to a strike by employees at what they called a move toward privatization. The list also includes President Park Geun-hye’s former aides at Cheong Wa Dae.The proportional candidate list of the Minjoo Party is no less controversial, the latest point being the disputed nomination of interim chief Kim Chong-in as No. 2 on the party list. The spot -- the highest available for a male candidate -- has usually been taken by a figure representing politically marginalized people.Political observers noted that parties may at some point lose sympathy with the public, should they neglect the voter sentiment.“In this year’s elections, parties are marked for their electoral engineering strategies, meaning that they will take any unconventional and controversial actions, if only to win,” said Choi Chang-ryul, professor at Yongin University.“The average voter may find such moves confusing and eventually disapprove of the party or the candidate.”Shin Yul, a political professor at Myongji University, was more critical of the constituency carousel.“Even veteran politicians are too preoccupied with the turf wars,” he said.“It seems that politics is no longer about noble visions of serving the people and improving the nation, but just a profitable vocation.”By Bae Hyun-jung South Korea will elect new National Assembly members in a general election on April 13.

YonhapWhile Kim refused to attend the day’s scheduled party meetings, the party decided to push Kim back to No. 14.The issue also rekindled the underlying conflict between the high-handed Kim and conventional party members.  While the majority of the leadership described the “self-nomination” as a selfish and inappropriate abuse of authority, Kim lashed back at what he saw as the party’s persisting factional exclusivism and slandering against him.“I will not tolerate their insults, the way they make it look as if I had applied for the proportional representative seat for personal greed,” an infuriated Kim told reporters while leaving his home for his private office downtown instead of heading to the party’s headquarters.“I have no intention of working for a party which treats me in such a  manner.”In protest against the growing criticism, Kim refused to show up at the party’s emergency committee and central committee meetings. As interim chief, Kim had the exclusive right to name up to three proportional nominees and it was based on this that he announced his own name.Under the proportional representation system, which allocates non-regional parliamentary seats to each party depending on its total approval rate, the No. 2 position was sure to guarantee Kim a seat in the 20th National Assembly.The leadership, however, readjusted his ranking to No. 14, meaning that his spot in the National Assembly depends on the party’s performance in the April general elections.The system is often used to provide parliamentary status to a party leader or potential presidential candidate ahead of elections, but high-priority numbers are usually allocated to the party’s underdogs.The mainstream response within the party was that Kim should either step back and yield the position to political rookies or symbolic figures, or at least slide down to a lower number -- both of which Kim refused to accept.“I do not cling , but in order to pull the party together, it is crucial that I hold a representative seat ,” he said.“Why does it matter that I was listed as No. 2 or any other number on the list?”The interim chief, however, did not offer a detailed explanation as to why he should be listed above other candidates.“Kim is not the kind of man to refrain from exercising his power,” Cho Kuk, professor at Seoul National University Law School, wrote on his social media account Sunday.“He was invited in as administrator, but has now positioned himself as an unchallenged monarch.”In addition, there were other complaints over the rest of the proportional representative list. Among the disputed members were a professor who allegedly plagiarized a paper and a former Air Force chief suspected of influence peddling over his son’s military service.“The list is totally in discord with our political identity,” said Rep. Kim Hyun-mee, a former top aide to the late President Roh Moo-hyun.“Where are the socially disadvantaged, agricultural representatives, and all those we are set to speak out for?”The Minjoo Party’s platform states that youth and labor representatives, as well as those who have worked in disadvantageous regions, should be listed as priority when selecting proportional representation nominees.Former party leader Rep. Moon Jae-in, who resigned from his post earlier this year to give way to Kim, has refrained from commenting on the issue.By Bae Hyun-jung","month general election sparked backlash ,general election sparked backlash against ,election sparked backlash against the ,election sparked backlash against ,general election sparked backlash","['the Minjoo Party', 'Kim Chong - in', 'Kim', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Kim Chong - in', 'Seoul', 'YonhapWhile Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'National Assembly', 'the National Assembly', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Cho Kuk', 'Seoul National University Law School', 'Air Force', 'Kim Hyun - mee', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'for?”The Minjoo Party ’s', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Kim', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.87168127  0.10208654

With the Saenuri Party’s Supreme Council and nomination committee failing to reach a consensus over whether to select Rep. Yoo Seong-min as a parliamentary candidate, the committee’s key members noted that the only way to solve this gridlock would be if the third-term lawmaker decides to quit the race. The Saenuri Party’s chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung receives questions from reporters at the National Assembly on Monday. Yonhap“I am waiting for Yoo’s decision ,” the committee’s chairman Rep. Lee Hahn-koo said, when asked about whether the body would exclude Yoo from the nomination. “I think it is the best way to help us minimize pushback.”The move was seen as an effort by the pro-Park faction -- which runs the nomination committee -- to avoid public criticism by tossing the decision over to Yoo, who has been laying low in recent weeks due to the nomination feud. It had been reported that Yoo would not drop his bid unless the party forced him to. They have to finalize the nomination list by Wednesday. The Saenuri Party leadership, meanwhile, indicated earlier in the day that it planned to put Cho Yoon-sun, a former presidential secretary for political affairs, back on the nomination list. Cho, however, refused to accept the proposal. If the former gender equality minister had been nominated, she would have competed with Rep. Chin Young at Yonsan district in Seoul. Cho had lost a nomination battle to fellow party member Lee Hye-hoon by a narrow margin the day before in Seocho constituencyApart from Cho, others working as top aides to President Park have also struggled to outperform those outside the pro-Park faction in the nomination contest. Reps. Kim Jae-won, Joo Ho-young and Yoon Sang-hyun, lawmakers who doubled as presidential secretaries for political affairs, were excluded from the nomination. As factional strife continued over the nomination battle, President Park blamed the legislative deadlock on the lawmakers who she described as “being preoccupied” with their own political careers, while setting aside legislative affairs such as passing pending business bills. “The legislative process has been left in limbo because of the election campaign,” said Park during a meeting with her top aides. “If the politicians continue to engage in their own politics, the Assembly will lose the opportunity .”By Yeo Jun-suk","cho had lost nomination battle ,legislative deadlock on the lawmakers ,over the nomination battle president ,park blamed the legislative deadlock ,lost nomination battle to fellow","['Saenuri Party', 'the Saenuri Party ’s Supreme Council', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'the National Assembly', 'Lee Hahn - koo', 'Yoo', 'Yoo', 'Yoo', 'Saenuri Party', 'Cho Yoon - sun', 'Cho', 'Chin Young', 'Yonsan', 'Seoul', 'Cho', 'Lee Hye - hoon', 'Cho', 'Park', 'Kim Jae - won', 'Joo Ho - young', 'Yoon Sang - hyun', 'Park', 'Assembly', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.12215323  0.59320647

The boats are updated versions of the Yoon Young-ha-class boats that are already in service with the armed forces.Seoul is expected to launch some 20 of these patrol killer guided B  boats in the coming years to replace the existing fleet of smaller and less capable Chamsuri-class patrol boats that entered service in the 1970s.""The new boats are a follow-up to the Yoon Young-ha-class PKG-As, with construction work to start this year,"" according to the official.The 440-ton Yoon Young-ha class patrol killers were first deployed along the Northern Limit Line, the de factor sea border with North Korea, in June 2009, under the Patrol Killer Experimental project. A total of 18 vessels have been launched. Yoon Young-ha, was named after a lieutenant commander who was killed in a maritime skirmish with North Korea in the western NLL in 2002. The planned deployment of the new boats in the NLL area could significantly enhance the military's operational mobility and ability to respond to North Korean provocations in recent years.In March 2010, North Korea torpedoed the South Korean Navy corvette Cheonan in the area and 46 sailors were killed or went missing in the incident. ""The new PKG-B vessels will carry lighter weapons and be able to move faster so they could maneuver in the front line area more easily,"" a Navy official noted. ""They will make it easier for us to carry out hit-and-run operations."" For the weapons system, the boats will carry guided missiles which are currently under development, according to the military.

The student later filed a complaint with the NHRCK. He claimed that it was a violation of human rights to treat him like a criminal by forcing him to take a urine test. Participants pose for a photo at an event to celebrate the declaration of Student Rights Day on Jan. 26 in Seoul. YonhapThe school, however, refuted this by saying that such a test was necessary to prevent students from mixing the urine with water so as not to get caught. The school, which promotes anti-smoking programs, has taken various measures to curb teenage smoking. It allows urine tests to be conducted upon students’ consent whenever they are suspected of smoking in school. “The human rights of students must be better respected during smoking crackdown and anti-smoking measures. Although the school says it has conducted the test upon their consent, the consent itself is unlikely to have been voluntary,” said the watchdog. Incheon Metropolitan City Office of Education has recommended schools to use a carbon monoxide measuring instrument for smoking tests rather than urine tests, after a similar incident took place in another school in the city in 2013.South Korea has often faced criticism for placing discipline above the protection of the human rights of students, including banning students from growing their hair out, wearing makeup and expressing religious beliefs.“There’s a prevalent social perception that students are immature. The basic value of human rights is mutual understanding. If the way teachers treat students is applicable to adults, it is not human rights violation. They need to treat them the same as they treat adults,” said youth welfare professor Kim Yoon-na from Seoul Cyber University.In light of such criticism, municipalities have been moving to better ensure student rights, such as by enacting ordinances.Since 2010, starting with Gyeonggi Province, more than 15 cities and provinces have introduced human rights ordinances for students. These comprehensively cover issues such as freedom of expression, religion, physical punishment and regulations regarding hairstyle and attire. In January, the Seoul Metropolitan Government Office of Education declared Jan. 26 as Student Rights Day. It vowed to map out a set of measures to boost the rights of teenage students.

The meeting had convened despite being called off by chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung a day earlier in protest against the “unjust and top-down” decisions by the nomination committee chaired by pro-Park Rep. Lee Hahn-koo.Kim, who leads the pack of members critical of the pro-Park group, has been openly disgruntled by the nomination picks, which are favorable toward Park loyalists.Kim has been inveighing against Lee for abusing his power to make unilateral choices in favor of pro-Park members instead of people he described as “well-performing and renowned” incumbents, such as Rep. Lee Jae-oh.Saenuri Party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung He has also taken issue with what the nomination committee has called “strategic choices” in some of the constituencies that bypass internal primaries. Bottom-up selection of candidates through primaries and opinion polls have been among Kim’s key initiatives throughout his leadership since 2014. He has been strictly against resorting to the “strategic” nominations that have often been conducted in the past. The primaries were considered the only alternative for Kim to hold sway in the party, which is dependent on Park and her solid voter support.Sparking the all-out confrontation was Wednesday’s Supreme Council meeting, which Kim adjourned as the members butted heads over the remaining nominations. He also held a press conference in the afternoon, slamming Lee Hahn-koo for making poor choices and sidestepping due process.Lee called Kim’s remarks “stupid,” and pro-Park members including floor leader Rep. Won Yoo-chul demanded the next day that Kim apologize for his behavior that they said violated the nomination committee’s right to autonomy.Immediately, Kim retorted that there was “nothing to apologize for.” He then called a closed-door meeting with members of his faction and said it was the duty of the party chairman to uphold the party constitution and regulations. Kim only laughed when asked by the press if he would consider refusing to put his chairman’s stamp on the final nomination list, the last formal procedure required in nominations.Saenuri nomination committee chief Rep. Lee Hahn-koo Some other non-Park members also spoke out against the nomination committee. The committee meeting in the afternoon was suspended as some of members walked out in protest of chairman Kim’s remarks against them, demanding an apology. One of the non-Park members, Rep. Chin Young announced he would leave the party and said he was contemplating running as an independent. “Chairman Lee is acting as if he is the law, completely ignoring the nomination rules,” said Rep. Cho Hae-jin, who was dropped from the nominations.The confrontation among Kim, Lee and their cohorts was widely anticipated from the beginning. Kim had opposed Lee to head the nomination committee last month, but was pressured to accept the choice, which was strongly backed by the pro-Park members at the Supreme Council.Kim, a politician by profession since the 1980s when he was an aide to former President Kim Young-sam, has often clashed with four-term lawmaker Lee Hahn-koo, a former economist, over the party’s key policies and power struggles in the past.The tipping point of the ongoing feud is expected to be the nomination committee’s delayed decision on former floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min. Yoo, who represents one of the party’s stronghold constituencies in Daegu, is one of the members conspicuously disapproved of by President Park. Park had singled him out as “betraying” her policy initiatives last year, which eventually led to his resignation from the post. The committee has been holding back its decision on Yoo in apparent fear of a public backlash.Some observers also suggested the growing strife may lead to a mass defection of the non-Park members to form their own political group, as pro-Park members did in 2008 in protest to nomination selections made by the leadership loyal to then-President Lee Myung-bak.By Yeo Jun-suk","2008 in protest to nomination ,election next month thursday morning ,an all out factional battle ,clashed with four term lawmaker ,in protest to nomination selections","['Saenuri Party', 'Supreme Council', 'Park Geun', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'pro - park', 'Lee Hahn - koo', 'Kim', 'Park', 'Kim', 'Lee', 'Lee Jae - oh', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Kim ’s', 'Kim', 'Supreme Council', 'Kim', 'Lee Hahn - koo', 'Lee', 'Kim', 'Won Yoo', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Saenuri', 'Lee Hahn - koo', 'non - park', 'Kim ’s', 'Chin Young', 'Lee', 'Cho Hae - jin', 'Kim', 'Lee', 'Kim', 'Lee', 'the Supreme Council', 'Kim', 'Kim Young - sam', 'Lee Hahn - koo', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Daegu', 'Yoo', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54551917  0.12219809

YonhapIt is the opposition’s complaint that the president’s moves may constitute a breach of Clause 9 of the Public Election Act, which forbids all public officials from exerting influence on elections.Cheong Wa Dae, in response to rising criticism, repeatedly asserted that the president’s regional city trips were to encourage the creative economy, short of any political implication.This was the third of such visits, following her earlier trip to the Daegu center last Thursday and to the Daejeon center on Feb. 25, marking three years in the presidential office for Park.While in Busan, the president attended the first anniversary celebration of the Busan Center for Creative Economy and Innovation, one of the 17 branches nationwide.Park also stopped by a marine product processing complex to look into the value-adding project of the local fisheries industry and a senior welfare center to check on the efficacy of government policies for senior citizens.Park’s earlier presence in her home city Daegu coincided with the Saenuri Party’s feud-ridden candidate nomination for the April race.Earlier this week, following Park’s Daegu schedule, the party announced its choice of candidates for the Daegu and North Gyeongsang regions.The results, which mostly turned out to be unfavorable for those in conflict with President Park, led to mumblings that each candidate’s electoral luck depended entirely on his or her intimacy with Cheong Wa Dae.Conspicuous among the dropouts were those considered close aides to Rep. Yoo Seong-min, the third-termer in Daegu who stepped down from his post as party floor leader last July amid outright clashes with the president.Rep. Yoo, who was once considered a key pro-Park aide, lost the president’s favor over recent years after he stood against her welfare policies and led negotiations with the main opposition party to pass a parliamentary revision bill.“This most undemocratic candidate nomination clearly carries a tone of retaliation,” said Rep. Cho Hae-jin, who has been denied the chance to run in his incumbent constituency in South Gyeongsang Province.In contrast, former high-ranking government officials managed to survive the nomination battle with relative ease.Former Interior Minister Chong Jong-sup and former chief for government policy coordination Choo Kyung-ho, with whom the president exchanged a friendly greeting during her Daegu trip, won their unrivaled candidacy to run in the city.Meanwhile, the ruling party has yet to make its final decision on Rep. Yoo himself.“Rep. Yoo’s issue requires much political consideration,” said the party’s nomination chief Rep. Lee Hahn-koo on Wednesday, suggesting the putting off of judgment.It wasn’t just Rep. Yoo’s group that cried foul at the party’s nomination.Party chief Rep. Kim Moo-sung, who has long stood at odds with the pro-Park group, blamed the nomination committee for its arbitrary selection of candidates.“It is a serious problem that competent current lawmakers should be ruled out without a decent reason,” Kim said.He thus called for a reappraisal for Reps. Joo Ho-young and Lee Jae-oh, both non-Park figures who were denied candidacy.By Bae Hyun-jung","conservative votes president park abruptly ,looming controversy over the president ,president park abruptly paid visit ,foul at the party nomination ,votes president park abruptly","['Park Geun - hye', 'Busan', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Park', 'Busan', 'pro - Parks', 'non - Parks', 'Busan', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Park Geun', 'Busan', 'YonhapIt', 'Daegu', 'Park', 'Busan', 'Daegu', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'Park ’s', 'Daegu', 'Daegu', 'North Gyeongsang', 'Park', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Daegu', 'Yoo', 'pro - park', 'Cho Hae - jin', 'South Gyeongsang Province', 'Interior', 'Chong Jong - sup', 'Choo Kyung - ho', 'Daegu', 'Yoo', 'Lee Hahn - koo', 'Yoo', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Kim', 'Joo Ho - young', 'Lee Jae - oh', 'non - park', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45544085  0.07537981

Seoul's spy agency said the party event is expected to be held on May 7.""The North is likely to make provocations between late April and early May,"" Chung said, adding that it is more likely to conduct the fifth nuke test.Others like Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies, said that the North may launch an intermediate-range missile right before the party congress, rather than choose another nuclear test.""It won't be easy for the North to carry out another nuke test as I think that Pyongyang would want to reserve it as a bargaining chip for possible talks with a new U.S. government,"" Yang said.But experts also said that if the North does not make high-profile provocations before the party event, it may try to utilize its nuclear weapons as a card for dialogue.The North detonated three nuclear devices in 2006, 2009 and 2013, and followed with a fourth test in January.","korea may conduct another nuclear ,another nuclear test it won ,wednesday north korea said tuesday ,pyongyang may make more nuclear ,congress in may to maximize","['North Korea', 'North Korea', 'United Nations Security Council', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'Chung Sung - yoon', 'the Korea Institute for National Unification', 'Kim Il - sung', 'Kim Jong - un', ""Workers ' Party of Korea"", 'Seoul', 'North', 'Chung', 'Yang Moo - jin', 'the University of North Korean Studies', 'Pyongyang', 'U.S.', 'Yang']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56154245  0.68271267

The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles on the candidate agendas, election trends and notable runners leading up to the race. This is the sixth installment. --EdPark Jong-ung, a chief publicist for Korea’s Labor Party, stood with his coworkers at the front gate of the National Assembly on Tuesday to hold a press conference urging lawmakers to abandon the controversial counterterrorism bill.“It is one of the agenda items that we are pushing forward,” Park told The Korea Herald, referring to the much-disputed legislation that cleared the Assembly earlier this month.” ""Though we don’t have any elected lawmakers, we are trying to add different voices to the legislative process,” he added. Korea’s Labor Party, which was established in 2013, is one of several minor political groups aiming to have their own candidates elected as representatives to National Assembly in the April general election. As of Tuesday, the nation’s election watchdog has registered 23 groups as political parties and another 19 as preparation committees for creating new parties -- meaning that 38 new political groups, beyond the four already holding seats, are seeking to make inroads in the 296-member Assembly.The parliamentary seats are divided among the four major parties, with the ruling Saenuri Party and main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea having 129 and 86, respectively. The Peoples’ Party and the Justice Party claim 19 and 1, respectively. Caption: Prominent same-sex marriage activist Kim Jo Kwang-soo and fellow members of the Green Party Korea hold a press conference in downtown Seoul to protest against the court’s refusal to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Yonhap As with the Labor Party, which plans to send 10 candidates out on the campaign trail, groups outside the legislative process seek to emerge as relevant political parties by gaining at least one parliamentary seat. Green Party Korea, for instance, nominated five candidates for local constituencies and proportional representation, respectively. The 4-year-old party’s political platform is to advocate the right for minorities such as women, homosexuals and immigrants. Jung Soo-yeon, 28, who announced her bid as a candidate for the Peoples’ Union Party said, “We will make sure that voices of the young people are heard in the Assembly.” Established in February, the progressive party vows to address youth unemployment and improve labor workers’ lives. But the minor parties’ path to the Assembly appears to be a narrow one as they have never passed the electoral hurdle. To win parliamentary seats, the parties should either outperform mainstream parties in local elections or attract more than 3 percent of votes nationwide.Since the former is unlikely due to the current single-constituency system, the minor parties have strived to pass the 3-percent threshold. The Green Party and Labor Party earned 1.25 and 0.84 percent, respectively, in the 2014 by-elections.Peoples’ Union Party chairman Lee Seung-jae announces his bid to run in the April 14 general election at the National Assembly. YonhapFaced with such challenges, some minor political groups said that gaining seats in the upcoming election is not their priority. They instead focus on promoting their political agenda to the general public during the election season when attention to politics is relatively high. Pyeji Party, a political group that roughly translates to a party to cancel government policies, did not bother to register itself as a political party. The group’s officials said that instead, it would use the election as an opportunity to urge the government to overhaul policies for the disabled. Choi Yong-sang, who represents a political group that aims to provide assistance to Korean women forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese military, said, “Our party focuses more on helping the surviving family members than earning seats in the elections.” There are also some minor groups that are capitalizing on the popularity of political heavyweights and former mainstream parties. Four groups have named their parties after United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The names of former ruling parties such as Democratic Party and Grand National Party are also now being used by minor political groups.  By Yeo Jun-suk","tuesday the nation election watchdog ,downtown seoul to protest ,hold press conference urging lawmakers ,tuesday to hold press conference ,in downtown seoul to protest","['South Korea', 'National Assembly', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea ’s Labor Party', 'the National Assembly', 'Park', 'the Korea Herald', 'Assembly', 'Korea ’s Labor Party', 'National Assembly', 'Assembly', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'the Peoples ’ Party', 'the Justice Party', 'Kim Jo Kwang - soo', 'the Green Party Korea', 'Seoul', 'the Labor Party', 'Green Party Korea', 'Jung Soo - yeon', 'the Peoples ’ Union Party', 'Assembly', 'Assembly', 'the Green Party', 'Labor Party', 'Peoples ’ Union Party', 'Lee Seung - jae', 'the National Assembly', 'Pyeji Party', 'Choi Yong - sang', 'korean', 'japanese', 'United Nations', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Democratic Party', 'Grand National Party', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.30777165  0.19376321

In February 2015, there were 16 political parties in the country. Except for the four parties currently holding seats in the National Assembly -- the ruling Saenuri Party, the main opposition Minjoo Party, the People's Party and the Justice Party -- 19 are extra-parliamentary, according to the commission.Another 19 organizations have enrolled preparatory committees to establish political parties, the NEC said.In South Korea, a political party can be registered when it has at least five municipal branches with more than 1,000 members enrolled at each one.In February, the People's Union Party, a coalition of parties comprised of young adults, farmers and laborers, held an inauguration ceremony. It has over 20,000 members, according to its spokesman Song Young-woo.The party promised to solve the issues of youth unemployment and non-regular employees.""Our goal is to make inroads into the parliament by winning votes in the polls,"" Song said.Some other parties are formed with an aim to voice their interests and enhance publicity without going through an official register process.A group of disabled people formed an organization under the name of a political party but did not enroll it with the election committee nor register it with a preparatory committee.Other unique parties include a group supporting the U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon or a group calling for compensation to wartime forced laborers.""The phenomenon seems to reflect people's distrust of the existing parties,"" said Lee Nae-young, a professor at Seoul's Korea University. He said such parties are being formed because people want to better voice their views and push forward certain agendas. Related to the increase in the number of parties, the election commission said the newly created parties must meet certain requirements, such as registering candidates in local elections, to keep their formal status.On April 6, 2012, a total of 25 parties were registered with the national election commission. The number shrank to seven right after the 2012 general elections took place on April 11, the commission said.","election watchdog said tuesday sign ,country election watchdog said tuesday ,election watchdog said tuesday ,upcoming parliamentary race the country ,race the country election watchdog","['the National Election Commission', 'the National Assembly', 'Saenuri Party', 'Minjoo Party', ""the People 's Party"", 'the Justice Party', 'NEC', 'South Korea', ""the People 's Union Party"", 'Song Young', 'song', 'U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Lee Nae - young', 'Seoul', 'Korea University']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64672327  0.16631202

So to pat himself on the back for surviving a difficult day or week, he occasionally heads to restaurants and bars -- alone.    ""It's like a self-comforting, self-healing moment of solace for me,"" he said. ""No need to keep up with the conversation with office co-workers, which usually end up being about work, anyway.""Lucky for Park, 35, more eateries and drinking places are opening up for customers like him. He was happy to recently discover a perfect place not far from his home in western Seoul where he can grab a bottle of beer with side dishes served in manageable single-person portions.  A common choice for solo consumers like Park would have been takeout to eat at home while watching television. But there are more people wanting to venture out to public places to eat and drink alone and not be embarrassed or feel sad about it.""I am not married. I have the evenings all to myself. I want to relish the time, and eating what I want there and then is very satisfying,"" Park said. ""If I had my way, every restaurant would have seating arrangements to accommodate people coming to eat alone.""  Shin Min-young, 29, works for an online shopping mall. She is practically on the phone all day, dealing with customers heavy with complaints. ""By the time I get off work, I have had more than my share of human interaction,"" she said. ""I need pampering. I need alone time. And I get it by treating myself to good food at a cozy restaurant from time to time.""Shin admits she is bolder than most women her age, eating at a restaurant without any companion. But there is definitely a change in perception about being and doing things alone.  Daumsoft, a data mining firm, and Innocean Worldwide, an advertising agency, put out separate reports in December last year that reflected a shift in how people view aloneness. Daumsoft counted more than 15,400 mentions in 2015 about eating and drinking alone, seven times the volume of the preceding year. Words associated with the mentions ranged from ""enjoy"" and ""tasty"" to ""awesome."" Analysis from 2011-2013 for similar mentions got reactions like ""afraid,"" ""don't like"" or ""hungry."" In the Innocean Worldwide report that analyzed the singles' consumption trend in 2015, 69 percent of office workers were highly receptive to being alone and doing things alone. Like in Daumsoft's report, words associated with ""alone"" were mostly positive -- ""tasty,"" ""enjoy,"" ""happy"" and ""healing.""Solos already have created a market. Convenience stores have increased menu options for boxed meals whose sales are now in the top rankings, outdoing alcoholic beverages that used to be the unshakable No. 1 seller. Records from Seven Eleven showed sales of boxed meals rose 90.2 percent in 2015, compared to 51 percent the year before. At CU, sales of boxed meals and other handy foods like sandwiches accounted for 11.5 percent of total sales in the first two months of this year, reaching double digits for the first time. The CU marketing team got the message. It opened a research office in Seoul to develop a wider range of products for solo eaters. Lotte Department Store earlier this month opened at one of its Seoul branches a food corner where a customer can pick the rice, soup and side dishes of his or her choice and box it. For those who want to eat in, the store has a bar nearby.    For single drinkers, retail superchain Home Plus sells select wines and traditional Korean alcoholic beverages in pouches. When they were packaged in assortments as a gift set for the Lunar New Year this year, they hit as high as 90,000 in single day sales. Lotte Chilsung Beverage Co. has been selling wine in smaller bottles, holding about two glasses, since summer last year. Complementing snacks, including cheese, are also easily found in smaller portions at supermarkets.It's no longer news that the number of one-person households is rising fast in South Korea. According to Statistics Korea and the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, there were 5.07 million such households in 2015, accounting for 27.1 percent of the total. Fifteen years ago, the percentage was 15.5 percent. Fifteen years from now, it is projected at 32.7 percent. As they grow in number, more voluntary soloists are bound to snap out of takeout and opt for mortar-and-brick restaurants.The restaurant choices for solo diners are widening, from what mostly were noodle-based or one-bowl gulp-and-go types to sit-and-savor places.One of the online jokes among lone diners is the level of bravery that roughly breaks down to nine tiers, higher the number, the harder to do it alone. The epitome of bravery is drinking alone or going to a barbecue restaurant alone. ""I have found places where I can go by myself to enjoy a glass of wine or a bottle of beer with hardly any discomfort,"" Shin said. ""The real challenge is going to a barbecue place and cooking the meat at a table that seats four people minimum.""Fret no more. ""Betjang,"" a small barbecue restaurant in western Seoul, gives you a mini grill, set up at your very seat, at a bar that takes up most of the restaurant space.       ""Older people may not feel so comfortable eating at restaurants alone,"" said Park.  They are so used to 'group culture,' having to fit into a mold and not acting differently or out of the group. But group culture is nothing but social pressure. I have friends. I go on dates. It's that sometimes, I choose to be alone.

Ahn's People's Party controls only 19 seats, one seat shy of forming a parliamentary negotiation bloc.The bill grants lawmakers the right to challenge executive enactments, such as the government's enforcement ordinance, and allows more assembly power in reviewing and modifying government legislation.The latest polls show that it will be difficult for the Saenuri Party to obtain 180 seats but it will keep its majority in the unicameral parliament.""The Saenuri Party was earlier expected to grab more than 180 seats but everything changed due to an internal feud over the nomination process,"" said Kim Choon-seok of Hankook Research.The main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea, meanwhile, is trying to reform itself by excluding scores of incumbent lawmakers deemed incompetent from being nominated for candidacy.The opposition party unveiled a list of applicants who had been screened in its so-called cutoff. The list includes high-profile lawmakers.The minor opposition People's Party, however, is still mired in an internal feud over a possible merger with the main opposition Minjoo Party ahead of the elections.Rep. Kim Han-gil, the head of the party's election planning committee, resigned from his post after he failed to persuade the party's co-chairman Ahn Cheol-soo to join forces with the Minjoo Party to win more seats in the upcoming polls.""The rival parties are still only interested in nominations when the general election is just 30 days away,"" said Lee Nae-young, a professor at Korea University, urging the parties to focus more on policy and issues related to the sluggish economy.Three potential presidential hopefuls-- Kim Moo-sung, Moon Jae-in of the Minjoo Party and Ahn -- are heating up the campaign to prove their appeal to voters.By law, Park is barred from seeking reelection after her single five-year term ends in early 2018.A poll released Friday showed 16 percent of people supported Moon in a potential presidential race, followed by Kim who received 11 percent of support. Ahn is trailing behind, receiving 10 percent of support in the poll. Political analysts forecast that Kim will mostly likely be nominated for his electorate but he still has a lot to prove to his party members due to the ongoing feud between the factions.Moon, who stepped down his chairman post earlier this year due to the strife, has not announced yet he will run for the election.Some political analysts believe that he may run for electorates usually favorable to the ruling party since a victory in the tough district may possibly put him on a direct path to declare his candidacy for president. Ahn, who has many supporters in the 20-40 age brackets, also has to focus on winning in his electoral district of Nowon in northern Seoul, where he will be running against Lee Jun-seok, a 31-year-old entrepreneur from the Saenuri Party.As presidential hopefuls prepare to drum up support in the run-up to the crucial political test, some districts have been highlighted as a battle for a bigger showdown. Oh Se-hoon, who stepped down from Seoul mayor in 2011, faces off against former veteran lawmaker Park Jin in the Jongno district in central Seoul. Another big match is expected in the Suseong district in the central city of Daegu, where former Gyeonggi Gov. Kim Moon-su, also considered a potential presidential contender from the conservative bloc, is campaigning against former lawmaker Kim Boo-kyum.","government legislation the latest polls ,economy three potential presidential hopefuls ,for tough battle the april ,election sped up the nomination ,upcoming polls the rival parties","['Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun', 'Yoon Sang - hyun', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Yoon', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'National Assembly Advancement Law', 'the Saenuri Party', 'National Assembly', 'Minjoo Party', ""People 's Party"", 'the Saenuri Party', '""The Saenuri Party', 'Kim Choon', 'Hankook Research', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', ""People 's Party"", 'Minjoo Party', 'Kim Han - gil', 'Ahn Cheol', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Lee Nae - young', 'Korea University', 'hopefuls-- Kim Moo - sung', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Park', 'Moon', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Moon', 'Nowon', 'Seoul', 'Lee Jun - seok', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Se - hoon', 'Seoul', 'Park Jin', 'Seoul', 'Suseong', 'Daegu', 'Gyeonggi', 'Kim Moon - su', 'Kim Boo - kyum']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.81716508  0.44359881

The ruling Saenuri Party and main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea have rolled out series of election manifestos targeting voters over 60 years old -- a group projected to emerge as the most influential electorate due to its high demographic volume and turnout rate. According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, the number of voters over 60 in the upcoming elections is close to 9.75 million, the biggest number of all age groups. Their turnout rate for the previous 2012 general elections was almost 70 percent, the highest among voters categorized by age.“We need an election manifesto tailored to the era in which people can live to 100 years old,” said Rep. Kim Jung-hoon, who chairs the Saenuri Party’s policy committee, on Friday. “We believe that the older generation deserves better life after retirement because they play a crucial role in modern times,” said Kim. The Saenuri Party’s leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung shakes hands with older voters at a local senior center. Yonhap.The party’s top policymaker vowed to create a new state agency to manage welfare policies for senior citizens. The new organization is expected to spearhead the efforts scattered across various government organizations, the party said. The conservative party also promised to deliver more jobs and housing to the older generation, establish more senior centers across the nation, expand efforts to take care of senior citizens living alone and reduce the burden of medical bills. The main opposition pledged to broaden the scope of senior citizens who can receive national pension, by overhauling the government’s “basic pension” system -- one of the President Park Geun-hye’s key manifestos during the 2012 election campaign. “We cannot address the deepening poverty among the older generation by giving them 200,000 won per month” said the Minjoo Party’s interim leader Kim Chong-in on Wednesday, referring to the government welfare system that he believes is inadequate in addressing the issue. Kim, who had initially engineered the government scheme while working for the President Park’s election campaign in 2002, suggested that the monthly allowance should be increased to 300,000 by 2018 and paid to all citizens aged 65 and over, regardless of their income. The interim leader also highlighted that the nation’s poverty rate among the older generation is a “record high.” According to the Statistics of Korea, South Korea’s 2014 poverty rate among the senior citizens stood at 47.4 percent, almost four times as much as the average of the OECD members.The Minjoo Party’s former leader Rep. Moon Jae-in has dinner with female volunteers at a local senior center. YonhapSome critics attacked the liberal party for lacking details on how they would pay for the initiative, and said the government cannot afford to fund the expanded pension system in a rapidly aging society with low fertility rate. “It could be a disaster for the future generations,” said Yoon Suk-myung, a senior researcher at Korea Institute for Health and Social affair, in a media interview. “Given the speed at which the nation is becoming an aging society, even the current system is unsustainable,” said Yoon. Mindful of the criticism, the interim leader highlighted that the scheme would serve as a “growth engine” for the nation’s flagging economy by increasing the older generation’s purchasing power, and noted that it had secured the money need to fund the commitment. The liberal party noted that it would fund the project -- estimated to cost 18.7 trillion won of taxpayers’ money every year -- by levying more taxes on those with high-income. Lee Yong-sup, a senior party official who manages election pledges, said the party would seek to “normalize” tax rates for the rich. The Peoples’ Party also announced its election pledges to woo senior voters. The minor party said on Thursday that it would double the amount of subsides for those looking for jobs, from 200,000 won to 400,000 won per month, while seeking to give those aged 65 and above national pension, regardless of their income.  By Yeo Jun-suk","400 000 won per month ,election manifestos targeting voters over ,pension system in rapidly aging ,election pledges to woo senior ,year by levying more taxes","['Saenuri Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'the Ministry of the Interior', 'Kim Jung - hoon', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'Kim', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Park Geun - hye ’s', 'the Minjoo Party ’s', 'Kim Chong - in', 'Kim', 'Korea', 'South Korea ’s', 'OECD', 'the Minjoo Party ’s', 'Moon Jae - in', 'yonhapsome', 'Yoon Suk - myung', 'Korea Institute for Health and social', 'Yoon', 'Lee Yong - sup', 'the Peoples ’ Party', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.2661747   0.36676556

The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles on the candidate agendas, election trends and notable runners leading up to the race. This is the fifth installment. -- EdAs evident from self-scorning buzzwords such a “hell Joseon,” the ever-widening social polarization has led to aggravating public discontent, posing a major challenge to political parties ahead of the April general elections.Their respective response has been different, depending on their stake.The ruling conservative Saenuri Party claims that such a social gap can be reduced only by promoting growth and creating new jobs. The Minjoo Party of Korea, on the other hand, underlined the importance of fair opportunities, blaming the Park Geun-hye government for unfair distribution of wealth and benefits. The Minjoo Party of Korea's interim leader Kim Jong-in  and the ruling Saenuri Party's policy committee chairman Kim Jung-hoon speak at their respective party meeting on Wednesday. Yonhap“The party’s No. 1 election campaign is the creation of new jobs,” said the Saenuri‘s policy committee chief Rep. Kim Jung-hoon last week, upon announcing the party’s election pledges.The president, too, has repeatedly called for a set of legislations to boost the employment rate.“We are all well aware that when the economy has met a growth limit, the answer is to turn attention to new industries which may create hundreds of thousands of new jobs for our youths,” Park said Tuesday in a meeting with service industry officials.She thus added pressure on the National Assembly to pass a series of pending bills on economic revitalization and labor reforms, which the opposition circles saw as infringing on workers’ rights and favoring employers’ interest.Cheong Wa Dae and Saenuri had every reason to put employment at the top of its economic agenda.The nation’s general employment rate, which the Park administration pledged to pull up to the 70 percent mark, stood in the mid-60 percent range over the past three years. Such underachievement was a key example of “economic maladministration” asserted by the opposition camp.While the presidential office and ruling party struggled to pursue their employment vision, the Minjoo Party countered that a blind pursuit of growth cannot be a universal solution to economic polarization.“Our goal is to build a virtuous circle so that the excessive profits of conglomerates may be distributed evenly to smaller firms and to households,” said the party’s election policy chief Lee Yong-sup last week.His plans included the establishment of a presidential committee to solve inequality, the gradual increase of minimum wages and strengthened regulations on conglomerates.Also, the party’s interim leader Kim Chong-in, who formerly served as the president’s economic advisor, has been focusing on pointing out the government’s economic underachievements.“The point of the April 13 elections will be to judge the economic failure of the Saenuri administration over the past eight years,” Kim said Wednesday at a party meeting.”The president, who is short of a proper understanding on economic circumstances, is continuing to mislead the people.“Kim, who drafted the idea of economic democratization back in 2012, also stressed that the key task for the South Korean economy is to create a fair distribution system, criticizing the Saenuri’s quantitative growth initiative.By Bae Hyun-jung","the candidate agendas election trends ,party meeting on wednesday yonhap ,presidential committee to solve inequality ,korea will elect new national ,agendas election trends and notable","['South Korea', 'National Assembly', 'the Korea Herald', 'Joseon', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Kim Jong - in', ""Saenuri Party 's"", 'Kim Jung - hoon', 'Saenuri‘s', 'Kim Jung - hoon', 'Park', 'the National Assembly', 'Dae', 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Lee Yong - sup', 'Kim Chong - in', 'Saenuri', 'Kim', 'south korean', 'Saenuri', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",5,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.67189556  0.41996247

In stark contrast, people over 50 reached 2,284, or more than half of the local population. Yanggam village highlights challenges South Korea has been grappling with for years: an exodus of young people from the countryside coupled with a declining number of babies being born.""The biggest problem behind the declining population in rural areas is low fertility,"" said Kim Hee-dong, who has served as a deputy principal of Choungryong Elementary School in Osan. Kim's school saw only four students graduate last month. Kim was actually transferred to another school due to lack of students.The number of primary school students in South Korea came to more than 2.71 million in 2015, down from the peak of more than 5.8 million in 1971, according to statistics of the Education Ministry posted on its website.Sachang Primary School is a case in point. In 1973, a total of 111 students graduated from the school. That was the highest number of graduates since the school was established in 1940s.Fast forward to 2016.On Feb. 18, only six students received graduation certificates at the small auditorium attended by little over 30 junior students as well as some parents and local residents.Kim Eun-seo, one of the six students, said she was satisfied with the small number of classmates as they became closer as friends and there was no bullying.Still, Kim Tae-soon, who graduated from the primary school in 1968 along with more than 80 peers, said he feels a sense of loneliness when he visits his alma mater.""When I was a student, my fellow classmates played in the schoolyard, but now there are few children,"" the 61-year-old member of the school steering committee said after attending the commencement ceremony.The schoolyard was deserted. No passersby would think the ceremony even took place if a bright pink placard had not been hung at the school's entrance to greet visitors coming to the event.Lee Byoung-chil, the principal of the primary school, said in order to breathe new life into the school, he created an orchestra for students in 2014. He said the orchestra helped foster character education and had the added bonus of attracting students.The educator said forming an orchestra was a particular challenge in a school where almost all the students have neither heard the names of musical instruments nor read musical notes.He said a cultural foundation in Hwaseong provided a conductor and other music professionals to the school under an incubator program meant to support cultural education to children in rural areas.Lee's efforts seem to be paying off.All students at the school can play the violin, the cello as well as other instruments.""At first, I thought I could not play the clarinet as I could not read music, but it was a rewarding experience that I am good at playing it now,"" said Won Gyu-ri, another of the six graduates. ""We practiced a lot so we could harmonize.""The commencement ceremony ended as the students, including the six graduates, were playing Variations on Pachelbel's Canon, Beethoven Symphony No. 5 and Shostakovich waltz No. 2 as well other popular pieces.""When I first heard the student's version of Pachelbel's Canon, I thought they had no hope,"" said Kim Jun-ho, an Italian-educated conductor who has been in charge of the school orchestra since last year.""Now, I am very happy and the students are really cool.""Lee's emphasis on the school orchestra has proven to be effective in attracting students from nearby cities.Recently, 14 students have transferred to Sachang Primary School for the March semester, mostly driven by the free-of-charge music program.Still, five senior students left Lee's school and were transferred to another school in a nearby city where they can attend cram schools as their parents want their children to focus on their studies, not music.Lee said attracting students from other areas is a way to keep his school afloat.""What scares me the most is students opting to transfer out of my school,"" the principal said.

Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland. The council's latest session opened on Feb. 29 and will end on March 24.The council has adopted a resolution, handed in by the EU and Japan, in March each year to call international attention to the North's human rights situations. This year's draft resolution has drawn particular international attention as it followed on the heels of a U.N. Security Council's sanctions resolution that aims to punish the North for its recent nuclear weapons and long-range rocket tests.The sources said that related countries including South Korea would review the resolution around next Monday when Marzuki Darusman, U.N. special rapporteur on the North Korean human rights situation, is to deliver an official report on the reclusive state.The resolution is expected to be adopted near the end of the 13th session of the council -- on March 23 or 24.An official said that this year's resolution could entail new contents potentially including the situations surrounding North Koreans working overseas under poor conditions. More than 500,000 North Koreans are thought to work aboard mostly in China and Russia, earning around $200 million per year.The insider also noted that the issue of holding perpetrators in the North Korean regime responsible for rights abuses could be dealt with in the resolution.Apart from the council's resolution, the U.N. General Assembly has also adopted a resolution on the North's human rights each year. The Assembly's resolution, adopted in 2013 and the following year, called for referring the North Korean case to the International Criminal Court.","switzerland the council latest session ,latest session opened on feb ,submission later this month ,panel government sources said tuesday ,council latest session","['the European Union', 'Japan', ""North Korea 's"", 'U.N.', 'the U.N.

Bernie Sanders won Saturday in Nebraska and Kansas in the Democratic race, while front-runner Hillary Clinton took Louisiana, another divided verdict from the American people.Cruz, a Texas senator, claimed Kansas and Maine, and declared it ""a manifestation of a real shift in momentum."" Vermont Senator and Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Bernie Sanders speaks at a news conference in Cleveland, Ohio March 5, 2016. REUTERS-YonhapTrump, still the front-runner in the hunt for delegates, took Louisiana and Kentucky.In the overall race for Republican delegates, Trump led with at least 375 and Cruz had at least 291. Rubio had 123 delegates and Kasich had 33. It takes 1,237 delegates to win the Republican nomination for president.Clinton had at least 1,117 delegates to Sanders' 477, including superdelegates -- members of Congress, governors and party officials who can support the candidate of their choice. It takes 2,383 delegates to win the Democratic nomination. There were 109 at stake on Saturday.Cruz, a favorite of the ultraconservative tea party movement, attributed his strong showing to conservatives coalescing behind his candidacy, calling it a ""manifestation of a real shift in momentum.""With the Republican race in chaos, establishment figures frantically are looking for any way to derail Trump, perhaps at a contested convention if no candidate can get enough delegates to lock up the nomination in advance. Party leaders -- including 2012 nominee Mitt Romney and 2008 nominee Sen. John McCain -- are fearful a Trump victory would lead to a disastrous November election, with losses up and down the Republican ticket.Trump, at a post-election news conference in West Palm Beach, Florida, declared himself primed for a head-on contest between himself and Cruz, and called for Rubio to drop out.""I would like to take on Ted one-on-one,"" he said, ticking off a list of big states where he said Cruz had no chance. ""That would be so much fun.""Despite the support of many elected officials in Kansas, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio came up short, raising serious questions about his viability in the race. Cruz suggested it was time for some Republican candidates to quit the race.In Maine, Cruz won by a comfortable margin over Trump. On the Democratic side, meanwhile, Sanders won by a solid margin in Nebraska and Kansas officials said he'd won the state caucuses, giving him seven victories so far in the nominating season. Clinton, who's been doing well with African-American voters, had an easy win in Louisiana.Clinton hoped that strong support among African-Americans in Louisiana would propel her to victory. Vermonter Sanders, trailing far behind Clinton in the delegate count, had higher hopes of making progress in Nebraska and Kansas, where the Democratic electorate is less diverse.With Republican front-runner Trump yet to win states by the margins he'll need in order to secure the nomination before the Republican convention, every one of the 155 Republican delegates at stake on Saturday was worth fighting for.It was anger that propelled many of Trump's voters to the polls. ""It's my opportunity to revolt,"" said Betty Nixon, a 60-year-old Trump voter in Olathe, Kansas. She said she liked the businessman because ""he's not bought and paid for.""Overall, Trump had prevailed in 10 of 15 contests heading into Saturday's voting. Rubio had one win in Minnesota.Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich both pinned their hopes on winner-take-all contests on March 15 in their home states.","voting bernie sanders won saturday ,party race for president ted ,democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders ,race for republican delegates trump ,trump at post election news","['WICHITA', 'Kansas', 'Republican Party', 'Ted Cruz', 'Donald Trump', 'Bernie Sanders', 'Nebraska', 'Kansas', 'democratic', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Louisiana', 'american', 'Cruz', 'Texas', 'Kansas', 'Maine', 'democratic', 'U.S.', 'Bernie Sanders', 'Cleveland', 'Ohio', 'Louisiana', 'Kentucky', 'republican', 'Trump', 'Cruz', 'rubio', 'Kasich', 'republican', 'Clinton', 'Sanders', 'Congress', 'democratic', 'Cruz', 'republican', 'Trump', 'Mitt Romney', 'John McCain', 'Trump', 'republican', 'Florida', 'Cruz', 'Rubio', 'Cruz', 'Kansas', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio', 'Cruz', 'republican', 'Maine', 'Cruz', 'Trump', 'democratic', 'Sanders', 'Nebraska', 'Kansas', 'Clinton', 'african - american', 'Louisiana', 'Clinton', 'African - Americans', 'Louisiana', 'Clinton', 'Nebraska', 'Kansas', 'democratic', 'republican', 'republican', 'republican', 'Trump', 'Betty Nixon', 'Olathe', 'Kansas', 'Trump', 'rubio', 'Minnesota', 'Rubio', 'Ohio', 'John Kasich']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62228805  0.36403412

In 2014, the two countries renewed their cost-sharing agreement, known as the Special Measures Agreement, with Seoul agreeing to pay 920 billion won for the upkeep of the U.S. troops per year, a 5.8 percent increase.The presence of U.S. troops in South Korea is a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, leaving the divided peninsula still technically at war. Moreover, the American military presence on the peninsula is seen as in line with U.S. national interests in a region marked by a rising China.As Trump looks increasingly likely to be the Republican nominee after the ""Super Tuesday"" primaries and caucuses earlier this week, concerns about his possible nomination have been growing stronger within the Republican Party.On Wednesday, more than 50 Republican national security leaders, including former Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick, issued an open letter saying they are united in opposition to a Trump presidency that they said would ""make America less safe"" and ""diminish our standing in the world.""""His insistence that close allies such as Japan must pay vast sums for protection is the sentiment of a racketeer, not the leader of the alliances that have served us so well since World War II,"" they said in the letter.On Thursday, former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney delivered a blistering attack on Trump, saying his domestic policies would lead to recession and his foreign policies would make America and the world less safe.""Let me put it plainly, if we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished,"" Romney said.","foreign policy troubles trump presidency ,in opposition to trump presidency ,thursday former republican presidential nominee ,opposition to trump presidency ,blistering attack on trump","['U.S.', 'republican', 'Donald Trump', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'american', 'the Washington Post', 'Trump', ""the United States '"", 'Trump', 'the United States', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'China', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'american', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'the Special Measures Agreement', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'american', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Trump', 'republican', 'the Republican Party', 'republican', 'State', 'Robert Zoellick', 'Trump', 'America', 'Japan', 'republican', 'Mitt Romney', 'Trump', 'America', 'Republicans', 'Donald Trump', 'Romney']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.6262337   0.25702524

Security Council resolution to punish North Korea for its recent provocations in a rare bipartisan move Thursday, echoing calls for the communist state to change its behavior.  The latest resolution unanimously adopted by the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday aims to punish Pyongyang for conducting its fourth nuclear test on Jan. 6 and subsequent launch of a long-range rocket on Feb. 7. The North claims the rocket was used to place a satellite into space, but most countries view it as a test to check related missile technology.Rep. Kim Young-woo, spokesman of the ruling Saenuri Party, issued a statement in which he defined the latest international sanctions imposed on Pyongyang as an ""inevitable step to be taken in response to the North's unacceptable provocations."" ""North Korea must come to grips with the gravity of the message from the international community and immediately suspend all programs for nuclear development and weapons of mass destruction,"" he said.The main opposition Minjoo Party followed suit in praising the U.N. sanctions, saying they are a ""display of the international community's firm and unified determination to deter the North from further provocations."" ""North Korea is solely responsible for the harsh international sanctions, and therefore it should not hold grudges about them,"" said Kim Sung-soo, spokesman of the Minjoo. He voiced hope that the latest sanctions could prevent the North from further advancing its nuclear and long-range rocket development and bring about stability in the region. The Saenuri and the Minjoo have often been at odds over the extent of punitive actions that should be applied to the communist state for its series of provocations.The minor opposition People's Party also expressed its support for the comprehensive sanctions.""We urge the government to take stern actions against any moves that pose a threat to the safety of the people and stability on the Korean Peninsula. The party will join hands for such efforts,"" said Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, co-chairman of the People's Party.The latest Resolution 2270 represents the harshest sanctions the UNSC has ever imposed on the North, as it requires, among other things, mandatory inspection of all cargo going in and out of the North regardless of whether by land, sea or air. It is the fifth Security Council resolution imposing sanctions on the North. The previous resolutions were adopted after the North's first nuclear test in 2006, its second nuclear test in 2009, its long-range rocket launch in late 2012 and its third nuclear test in early 2013.","fourth nuclear test on jan ,bipartisan move thursday echoing calls ,second nuclear test in 2009 ,wednesday aims to punish pyongyang ,2006 its second nuclear test","[""South Korea 's"", 'the U.N.

The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles on the candidate agendas, election trends and notable runners leading up to the race. This is the fourth installment. -- EdWhen former Samsung Electronics executive Yang Hyang-ja announced in January that she would enter politics as a candidate for the main opposition party, the high-school graduate tried not to hype up her past achievements in breaking the glass ceiling.“I don’t want to say to those who want to succeed that working like me will bring them success,” said the 49-year-old mother of two children. “We must build a society in which hard work is reciprocated by appropriate rewards and success,” she said. . Yang, who became the first female executive in the nation’s biggest conglomerate in 2012, is one of the potential candidates aiming to bring diversity to the stereotypical occupation profile of the established parties -- professional politicians with academic or legal backgrounds.“It is common to see that lawmakers coming from certain professions represent their interests. So it is fair to say that the more diverse the National Assembly becomes, the better it can represent diverse groups’ interest,” said Kim Min-jeon, a political science professor at Kyung Hee University The National Election Committee’s data shows that out of 300 lawmakers elected in previous 2012 general election, some 70 percent were those that have been making a trade of politics, followed by 8 percent of those with academic background and about 6 percent of those with legal career. A similar trend is expected to unfold in the upcoming elections. The election watchdog statistics showed last week that among 1,460 potential candidates, some 36 percent were professional politicians, followed by 9 percent and 8 percent of those with legal and academic background, respectively.The mainstream parties’ incumbents are also heavily lopsided toward members with legal expertise.Aside from professional politicians, former legal professionals are the most common occupations held by the members of the ruling Saenuri Party and the second most common jobs in the main opposition. The lawyers constituted 15 and 20 percent of the ruling and opposition party, respectively. “Our party’s chronic problem is that we have so many members with legal backgrounds,” said Rep. Lee No-keun of the Saenuri Party. “I am afraid that it would undermine the party’s efforts to achieve diversity and keep up with changes,” he said.Favored occupation has also varied slightly among the mainstream parties. While lawyers have been dubbed the most desirable professionals to join the conservative parties, liberal blocs have had their own favorite: civil activists who led the pro-democracy movements. The National Assembly saw a massive inflow of pro-democracy activists since 1992 when Korea held its general election after toppling the authoritarian government. The trend reached its peak in 2004 when the late President Roh Moo-hyun was in power. The number of activists who took the seats surged to 70, about seven times as many as those elected in previous elections.Yang Hyang-ja One of the most common ways to improve diversity is the proportional representative system. In the 2012 elections, 52 were elected through proportional representation and their job profile ranged from poet to naturalized immigrant.But those with unique backgrounds have struggled to join mainstream politics, mainly because they are first-termers with little say in legislative affairs. The main parties’ regulations mandate that proportional representation seats should only be given to those who have never been elected as a way of providing opportunity to fresh faces.Some of them, like Rep. Lee Jasmine of the Saenuri Party has constantly faced hurdles of racial and cultural discrimination in Korean politics and society which remains largely exclusive.Her legislative efforts, such as making laws to protect the education of illegal immigrants’ children have been ostracized by conservatives as an “attempt to help lawbreakers,” with some not hesitating to use insulting slurs against the minority politician.The parties’ dubious selection process of the proportional representatives have also shed light on the negative aspect of the decades-old system. In the 2008 election, a 30-year-old lawmaker elected through proportional representation lost her seat after being convicted of giving money to then fifth-term lawmaker Seo Chung-won. “One of the system’s biggest problems is that it fails to bring diversity. When it comes to choosing the candidates, the parties consider political calculations and factional interest, not the expertise the potential lawmakers could bring,” said Hyun Taek-soo, sociology professor at Korea University.Aware of the challenges, the political parties have been moving to compensate the shortfall with separate recruiting efforts to expand their political spectrum. The Saenuri Party and the Minjoo Party of Korea have lately competed to announce new faces with unique backgrounds. The Minjoo Party, for instance, recruited political aspirants whose job profile does not traditionally fit with the liberal party. Aside from former Samsung executive Yang, they brought in video company Webzen chairman Kim Byung-kwan and Hanwha Investment & Securities CEO Chu Jin-hyung. Its recruitment of current interim leader Kim Jong-in, a conservative economist and former campaign strategist for President Park Geun-hye, has also been perceived as the party’s fresh attempt to highlight economy, although the decision was also criticized both in and outside of the party for running counter to its liberal identity.The Saenuri Party is also trying to recruit high-profile figures to join the race to spruce up its image, although their efforts so far have been mediocre in the face of escalating in-house power struggles over nomination. They include 9-dan professional Go player Cho Hun-hyun, climber Um Hong-gil, and former labor union chief of Ssangyong Motor Kim Kyu-han. All three have reportedly turned the offer down.“I understand it won’t be easy, but the parties should have a system to train high-profile figures and teach them about politics. Those who are good at their jobs are not necessarily good at politics,” said Yoon Tae-gon, a senior political analyst at Moa Agenda Strategy.Lee Jasmine While acknowledging the outreach efforts, experts pointed out that lawyers would continue to be the most sought-after background for those who pursue political career due to their professional expertise and job flexibility. “Above all, the Assembly is the place where people make laws. The expertise from those with legal backgrounds can be put to a great use when they gather to propose, revise and enact the bills,” the Minjoo Party’s former lawmaker Choe Jae-chun wrote in an op-ed. Professor Kim Min-jeon noted that the widespread job transition from a legal professional to politician also reflects the reality of the Korean politics.“In South Korea, it is hard for politicians to return to their jobs if they lose elections. Since lawyers are relatively less worried about losing their livelihood, they are more likely to take the risk and enter politics than other professionals,” said Kim.By Yeo Jun-suk","upcoming elections the election watchdog ,campaign strategist for president ,the candidate agendas election trends ,korea will elect new national ,hee university the national election","['South Korea', 'National Assembly', 'the Korea Herald', 'Samsung Electronics', 'Yang Hyang -', 'Yang', 'the National Assembly', 'Kim Min - jeon', 'Kyung Hee University the National Election Committee ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee No - keun', 'the Saenuri Party', 'the National Assembly', 'Korea', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Yang Hyang - ja', 'Lee Jasmine', 'the Saenuri Party', 'korean', 'Seo Chung - win', 'Hyun Taek', 'Korea University', 'the Saenuri Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Samsung', 'Yang', 'Webzen', 'Kim Byung - kwan', 'Hanwha Investment & Securities', 'Chu Jin - hyung', 'Kim Jong - in', 'Park Geun - hye', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Cho Hun - hyun', 'Ssangyong Motor', 'Kim Kyu - han', 'Yoon Tae - gon', 'Moa Agenda Strategy', 'Lee Jasmine \xa0 while', 'Assembly', 'the Minjoo Party ’s', 'Kim Min - jeon', 'korean', 'South Korea', 'Kim', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47720832  0.40164119

Current military rules stipulate that soldiers insulting a superior can be punished by up to three years in jail. This is heavier than similar charges for civilians, which can be punished by up to one year in jail or a fine of 2 million won .He had claimed that the concept of “superior” was ambiguous and too broad, and that it excessively breaches the freedom of speech.The court, however, ruled that the president is his superior with the right to command.“The Constitution clearly stipulates that the president is the commander-in-chief, and the military commanding law also specifies that the president and soldiers are in a relationship of command and obedience,” the verdict said. The court also recognized the necessity of a separate penalty rule for soldiers, noting: “In criminal cases, the punishment is impossible once the complaint is withdrawn.  this can lead to indiscipline risk for the military command system, thereby putting national safety at risk.”The two dissenting judges said the regulation breaches the freedom of speech, as the scope of “insulting” in the rule is too comprehensive and, therefore, limits the chances to fairly settle community problems.

Filibusterers, many of them within the hawkish wing of The Minjoo Party of Korea, urged the party’s whip Rep. Lee Jong-kul to rethink his decision to halt the marathon speech against counterterrorism bills they believe have gained popularity among liberal voters and moderates. “Though we started the filibuster, it is not up to us ,” Rep. Eun soo-mi said on her Twitter account. The first-term lawmaker had set the record for the longest-ever address in the National Assembly before fellow member Rep. Jung Chung-rae broke it. Rep. Kim Kwang-jin, who was the first debater for the filibuster that began on Feb. 23, also asked, “What are we supposed to tell the people now, after spending 150 hours describing how the bill poses problems?”The opposition’s dilemma over the filibuster was expected. While it consolidated its supporters and received praise for offering an encouraging alternative from confrontational policies, it also failed to dramatically spike support ratings, especially with pressure building to pass urgent bills such as for the new electoral map.Late Monday night, the party’s interim leader Kim Jong-in reportedly tried to persuade Lee Jong-kul for hours that the suspension of the filibuster is the way to go to prevent it from backfiring into an ideological fight, inviting blame for causing further election delays. Lee was the first to propose and push the filibuster as a way to block the majority ruling party from endorsing the controversial bills designed to give stronger surveillance power to the National Intelligence Service and fortify preventive measures against terrorist attacks.Lee consequently planned a press conference at 9 a.m. on Tuesday to declare the end of the filibuster, though it was delayed at the last minute.The party planned a general assembly later in the evening to further discuss their options.“We delayed the  in order to hear from the members who oppose the decision ... the decision to suspend it will not be overturned,” said chief deputy floor leader Rep. Lee Choon-suak.The ruling Saenuri Party, meanwhile, welcomed the decision, perceived as a triumph for the party in the drawn-out tug-of-war over the controversial counterterrorism bills.“While it is extremely regretful when we think about the hours wasted at the National Assembly through the filibuster, it is a relief that the Minjoo Party came to such decision,” said Saenuri’s chief spokesman Rep. Kim Young-woo.Saenuri floor leader Rep. Won Yoo-chul reiterated that no changes will be made to the counterterrorism bills that the opposition claims will seriously damage civil rights.“After the opposition’s filibuster is suspended, we will be voting on the antiterrorism bills tomorrow. ... There will be no further revision to the bills as we have reflected the demands from them over the past three months.” By Yeo Jun-suk","filibuster tuesday sparked intense pushback ,marathon speech against counterterrorism bills ,intense pushback from the party ,breaking filibuster tuesday sparked intense ,to halt the marathon speech","['the National Assembly', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Lee Jong - kul', 'Eun', 'the National Assembly', 'Jung Chung - rae', 'Kim Kwang - jin', 'Kim Jong - in', 'Lee Jong - kul', 'Lee', 'the National Intelligence Service', 'Lee', 'Lee Choon', 'Saenuri Party', 'the National Assembly', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Young - woo', 'Saenuri', 'Won Yoo', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27421248  0.41407835

Security Council is pushing for what officials have called “the strongest sanctions in the past 20 years” against North Korea, which will be included in the upcoming resolution expected to be adopted this week. According to government sources, the U.N. resolution is expected to be adopted as early as Monday. It was initially expected to be adopted Saturday, before Russia requested more time to study the resolution interdepartmentally. The draft resolution on North Korea includes a binding comprehensive arms embargo and freezing assets of any state or ruling party-related organizations involved in banned activities, and also suggests sanctions on all supplies of jet and rocket fuel. All U.N. member states will be mandated to conduct inspections on all shipments passing through their waters to or from North Korea to search for illicit items, and North Korean banks would be blocked from opening branches abroad or hosting offices in U.N. member states‘ financial institutions.Mineral exports by the North would be banned, except for “livelihood purposes.” China -- whose nod last week gave a boost to talks for sanctions -- said that the sanctions should not affect the livelihoods of North Koreans, as did Russia. Russia’s TASS news agency, citing the country‘s deputy permanent representative to the U.N. Pyotr Ilyichev, reported that delegations from Moscow will be ready to vote this week. The diplomat also said that Moscow has announced its agreement to an “adequate” resolution in response to Pyongyang’s recent nuclear test and long-range rocket launch. Some local observers have raised the possibility that Russia may be stalling the talks to reaffirm its global influence, taking issue with the U.S. and China seemingly leading the sanctions against the communist country.But government sources have said that they expect Russia will ultimately join the sanctions, adding that it will reflect a “resolute will by 15 members of the Security Council to punish the North.”U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power called the sanctions the “strongest imposed by the Security Council in more than two decades,” while South Korean officials have called it the “strongest nonmilitary sanctions ever” by the U.N.South Korea‘s Foreign Affairs Ministry said Sunday the finance ministers of Seoul and Washington met during the Group of 20 finance ministers meeting in Shanghai, China and agreed to boost bilateral cooperation on sanctions against North Korea. Chief six-party talks negotiators Hwang Joon-kook of South Korea  and Wu Dawei of China meet for their meeting in Seoul on Sunday. China’s top nuclear negotiator Wu Dawei visited South Korea on Sunday to discuss the countries’ responses to recent actions by North Korea. He met his South Korean counterpart Hwang Joon-kook later in the day, and was to hold a dialogue with Seoul‘s Foreign Minister Yun Byung-seo the next day.“I believe we  can discuss any kind of issue upon mutual respect,” Wu said upon entering the country. Hwang said he thought highly of China’s role during the process of negotiating for the U.N. resolution, and hoped that the two countries would continue “strategic communication” related to North Korea and its nuclear program.South Korean President Park Geun-hye has taken a hard-line approach toward North Korea, which has included a mention of the collapse of Kim Jong-un’s regime, while Beijing has called for holding peace treaty discussions in tandem with the North’s denuclearization talks.During the visit, Wu is also expected to discuss the possible deployment of the U.S.’ Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile system here against Pyongyang’s threats, which Beijing has openly opposed.

The National Election Commission has been pressed for time to revise the map for electoral districts as April 13, the day of the general elections, is approaching.After wrangling over the issue for months, the rival parties reached a deal on the remapping last week. The election agency then ironed out the details and sent the new map to the National Assembly for approval earlier in the day.Under the remapping, Seoul has one more parliamentary seat and the increasingly populous Gyeonggi Province has eight more slots.Incheon and two other regional cities each have one additional seat.Five seats were withdrawn from the Gangwon, Jeolla and Gyeongsang provinces. The total number of parliamentary seats will remain unchanged at 300 after the rival parties agreed to replace five proportional representation seats with elected ones.The previous electoral map became invalid at the end of 2015 after the Constitutional Court said the former map does not properly represent the distribution of local populations.The delay has crippled pre-election campaigns and candidate registry with the parliamentary elections only 45 days away as of Sunday.The National Assembly plans to pass the bill through a subcommittee that deals with administrative affairs and also through a plenary assembly on Monday.But the prospect of the bill's early passage is murky because the main opposition Minjoo Party is filibustering against the ruling Saenuri Party's one-sided attempt to pass the anti-terrorism bill, which the opposition bloc denounces as detrimental to citizens' privacy rights.","remapping last week the election ,parliament approval sunday but rival ,delay has crippled pre election ,agency submitted redrawn electoral map ,last week the election agency","['the National Election Commission', 'the National Assembly', 'Seoul', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Gangwon', 'Jeolla', 'Gyeongsang', 'the Constitutional Court', 'the National Assembly', 'Minjoo Party', ""Saenuri Party 's""]",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62612361  0.13697459

Under the bill, provision two of the article nine, the NIS will be capable of tapping into phone conversations as well.   The opposition has demanded that the article be taken out of the law, citing possible power abuse by the NIS to suppress political dissidents.   To persuade the opposition, the Saenuri made some changes in the bill, requiring the NIS to report to the Prime Minister's Office before or after it exercises its power of pursuit.    The revision also stipulates that the anti-terrorism center have one human rights official to monitor for possible breach of such rights during the process of pursuit.    The Minjoo Party, however, disapproves of the revised bill and insists that Article 9 be discarded while the Saenuri says taking out Article 9 neutralizes the anti-terror capabilities intended by the law.  Technically, the opposition lawmakers can continue the delaying tactics until March 22, when the session is scheduled to wrap up.   Political analysts, however, say that the filibuster is likely to end on Friday when the rival parties agree to put an electoral map for April's general elections to a vote.   If the anti-terrorism bill were put to a vote following the end of filibuster, it is most likely to pass as the Saenuri controls 157 seats in the 293-member National Assembly.","opposition lawmakers staged marathon filibuster ,floor for vote late tuesday ,as opposition lawmakers staged marathon ,delaying tactics of several lawmakers ,opposition lawmakers staged marathon","['Minjoo Party', 'the National Assembly', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'South Korea', ""North Korea 's"", 'the National Intelligence Service', 'NIS', 'NIS', ""South Korea 's"", 'NIS', 'NIS', 'Saenuri', 'NIS', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Saenuri', 'Saenuri', 'National Assembly']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53344989  0.05185168

Rep. Eun Soo-mi of the Minjoo Party began giving her address before a largely empty National Assembly at 2:30 a.m. and got off the podium at 12:48 p.m., replacing the record set more than 40 years ago. The previous record was set by Park Han-sang in 1969, a then-opposition lawmaker, who gave a 10 hour and 15 minute address against the constitutional amendment drive by the Park Chung-hee government.On the podium Eun reiterated the opposition's concerns over a potential abuse of power by the National Intelligence Service , South Korea's top spy agency.""I feel pain in many parts of my body including the back and legs,"" Eun told reporters after her filibuster. The first-term lawmaker said she tried to make her points clear why the anti-terrorism law entailed problems during her address.The filibuster rule allows a lawmaker to speak endlessly in order to delay a bill.The filibuster session by the Minjoo Party followed National Assembly Speaker Chung Ui-hwa's decision a day before to take the bill to the floor for a vote by invoking his authority. The anti-terrorism law has been stalled for more than a decade. Since the first draft was filed with the National Assembly following the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001 to effectively combat terrorism, no major progress has been made. The bill's passage has gained urgency following North Korea's nuclear test and long-range rocket launch early this year. Under the bill, an anti-terrorism center will be set up under the Prime Minister's Office, but the NIS will have the power to gather the relevant information on possible terrorists and attacks. President Park Geun-hye criticized the Minjoo's attempt to derail the pending bill and asked whether the opposition will pass it only after people suffer through terrorist attacks.  ""I think we are witnessing a nonsense situation not seen in any other countries,"" lamented Park of the ongoing gridlock. The ruling Saenuri Party slammed the Minjoo Party for its filibuster to thwart the bill's passage and urged it to end the ongoing discussion on the floor. ""The opposition's filibuster to block the anti-terrorism law at a time of heightened tensions is an act of terror against the safety of the people,"" said Saenuri floor leader Won Yoo-chul during a party meeting. Won also called on the opposition to act in a bipartisan manner to ensure national security by voting on the long-stalled law.Calls among ruling party lawmakers for the bill's swift passage have become more acute after North Korea threatened to strike Cheong Wa Dae, South Korea's presidential office, on Tuesday night in its usual harsh rhetoric. While the rival parties continue to lock horns over the contentious bill, police arrested two civic activists on charges of violating the law on assembly and demonstration Wednesday. The police said the two, identified only by their surnames Kim and Yoon, picketed and chanted in protest of the law in front of the National Assembly at around 3:15 a.m. The two were released hours later after questioning.","filibuster in korean history wednesday ,korean history wednesday delivering 10 ,korea presidential office on tuesday ,longest filibuster in korean history ,the contentious bill police arrested","['korean', 'Eun Soo - mi', 'the Minjoo Party', 'National Assembly', 'Park Han', 'Eun', 'the National Intelligence Service', ""South Korea 's"", 'Eun', 'the Minjoo Party', 'National Assembly', ""Chung Ui - hwa 's"", 'the National Assembly', ""North Korea 's"", 'NIS', 'Park Geun', 'Minjoo', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Saenuri', 'Won Yoo', 'Won', 'North Korea', 'Cheong', ""South Korea 's"", 'Kim', 'Yoon', 'the National Assembly']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35521907  0.56487256

Kim Kwang-jin of The Minjoo Party of Korea stole the limelight, cracking the record for the longest filibuster, going five hours and 32 minutes. At 34, the 19th National Assembly’s youngest member took the podium at around 7:07 p.m., criticizing the bill at length before stepping down at 12:39 a.m. Until then, the title had been held by late President Kim Dae-jung, who laid out a speech for five hours and 19 minutes in 1964.Though Rep. Kim’s mark was soon topped by lawmaker Rep. Eun Soo-mi, also of the main opposition party, who managed to speak for 10 hours and 18 minutes until 12:48 p.m., Kim Kwang-jin was credited as the first microphone holder and for his calm and poised manner.  Rep. Kim Kwang-jin filibusters at the National Assembly on Tuesday. He spent a great deal of time highlighting the public’s widespread mistrust of the bill that the opposition believes is aimed at enforcing the surveillance power of the National Intelligence Service, while reading the entire 15-page text of the state antiterrorism activity guidance. The bill is designed to enable the NIS to collect private communications and financial transactions of potential terrorists.When his pace quickened at times, some Minjoo Party colleagues chanted, “Take it slow, take it slow!” But Kim insisted on carrying on. When deputy speaker Rep. Lee Seok-hyun asked after four hours if he was okay and wanted to turn over to the next speaker. “Many Koreans still harbor distrust of the NIS,” Kim said. “Though its director and his predecessor who is now the presidential chief of staff argue that they have forgotten the word “political intervention,” the agency had not shown any self-examination nor taken internal or legal steps at all to punish those responsible for past wrongdoings and prevent a relapse.” The NIS has frequently been embroiled in political scandals, most recently last year over suspicion of using illegal surveillance software. Its former director Won Sei-hoon was indicted for involvement in an online smear campaign in favor of then-candidate President Park Geun-hye during the presidential race. He was found guilty, but the Supreme Court has sent the case back to the high court.A spate of bills have been proposed since the 9/11 attacks in the U.S. in 2001 involving measures to ward off physical and cyberterrorist acts and trail the potential perpetrators’ money trail and network. But they have never been put to a floor vote in the face of resistance by the opposition camp, which has voiced concerns that it would make way for the scandal-ridden NIS to ramp up its spying activities on civilians and political maneuvering in particular during election seasons. The currently pending bill calls for the launch of an antiterrorism center under the Prime Minister’s Office. But the NIS will be given the authority to gather information on potential terrorists and attacks.Cheong Wa Dae and the ruling Saenuri Party have accelerated the legislative push since the surge of the Islamic State group and especially the jihadists’ brazen attacks in Paris last November and more recently Jakarta, Istanbul and elsewhere, as well as North Korea’s latest nuclear and missile tests. While most Saenuri lawmakers exited the session shortly after Kim began his speech, speaker Rep. Chung Ui-hwa, who invoked his authority to put the bill to a vote, listened with his eyes closed for about one hour. As of 6 p.m., Rep. Park Won-suk of the minor opposition Justice Party was continuing to filibuster after taking over for Eun, with several others awaiting their turns. The protracted debate, however, also poses risks to the opposition, giving the impression that it tends to overlook security concerns due to partisan backbiting despite growing terrorist threats.

Regarding the economic sector, the president remains optimistic.“The global economic downturn and the recent military provocations from North Korea have posed challenges to our domestic market and national security,” Park said at a state seminar on Tuesday.“It is especially in these difficult situations that we should place focus on revitalizing the economy and creating jobs for the people.”But key economic indicators have been sending out warning signals during her time in office.South Korea’s total household debt hit a record of 1,207 trillion won  as of the end of last year, up 11.2 percent from the previous year, the central Bank of Korea showed Thursday.This obviously ran against Park’s election pledges back in 2012, when she had promised to “reduce household debt and revive ordinary people’s happiness.”The administration has also seen a steady rise in state debts, which soared to 595 trillion won as of the end of last year compared to 425 trillion back in 2012.This increased financial burden was mostly due to the extra budget allocation used in responding to the Sewol ferry sinking in 2014 and the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2015.The labor sector has also performed below expectations.One of the key policy slogans fielded by the Park government was to revamp the nation’s economic structure and to create jobs. It aimed to pull up the general employment rate to the 70 percent mark.Amid a sluggish global economy and increasing external threats, the youth unemployment rate here peaked at 9.2 percent last year, according to the Ministry of Employment and Labor.Cheong Wa Dae and the ruling Saenuri Party repeatedly claim that such circumstances are part of the reason why the pending labor reform bills should be approved. The opposition parties, however, say the government’s plan only focuses on boosting the number of jobs instead of improving the quality of the labor market.One positive aspect was that global credit rating agency Moody’s adjusted South Korea’s sovereign credit rating from “Aa3” to “Aa2” last December -- the highest-ever rate that the country has received from an international rating agency -- giving credit to the government’s structural reform efforts.By Bae Hyun-jung","its third anniversary in office ,third anniversary in office ,it celebrates its third anniversary ,third anniversary in office on ,aa2 last december the highest","['Japan', 'inter - korean', 'Gaeseong', 'North Korea', 'Park Geun', 'North Korea', 'Park', 'South Korea ’s', 'Bank of Korea', 'Park ’s', 'the Ministry of Employment and Labor', 'Saenuri Party', 'Moody ’s', 'South Korea ’s', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52451611  0.32746804

In a plenary session in which a filibuster rule was first applied since its abolishment in 1973 and reinstatement in 2012, liberal lawmakers from The Minjoo Party of Korea and other minor opposition parties have taken to the podium since Tuesday evening to block the bill from reaching the floor for a vote.The move came after National Assembly speaker Rep. Chung Ui-hwa decided to invoke his authority to bring up the bill to a plenary vote without sending it for parliamentary committees’ approval. The speaker noted that failure to pass the bill constitutes a national crisis in which he can use his power.  Teary-eyed Rep. Eun Soo-mi of The Minjoo Party of Korea is embraced by fellow lawmakers after setting the record of delivering a speech for over 10 hours at the National Assembly on Wednesday. While the Saenuri Party asserted that the bill is crucial to prevent potential terrorism, the main opposition countered that it would grant the National Intelligence Service greater authority to collect financial statements and phone records of those who the agency views as terror suspects, without a warrant signed by the court.“The filibuster is our last card in fighting the tyranny of majority by the ruling party,” said the Minjoo Party’s whip Rep. Lee Jong-kul, indicating the fact that the majority Saenuri Party, who holds 157 seats in the 293-strong Assembly, fall 19 seats short of the 176 threshold to break a filibuster. According to the Assembly law, a filibuster can be shut off only when there is approval from three-fifths of the lawmakers attending the session, when there are no lawmakers applying for the filibuster, or when the plenary session ends on March 11 – after which the bill is required to be put to a vote in the next session. With all of Minjoo Party’s lawmakers, totaling 108, having pledged to join the filibuster, the standoff is likely to continue until at least this Friday when the Saenuri and the Minjoo party hold a plenary session to pass a bill aimed at finalizing electoral rules for the April general election. “Both the ruling party and the main opposition need to pass the election bill on Friday. I think they will end the filibuster and finalize the bill,” said the Saenuri Party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung. “ my hands are tied. There is nothing we can do,” Kim said. Some Saenuri lawmakers dismissed their counterparts’ participation in filibustering as a political gimmick to gain an upper hand over the nomination battle in the upcoming elections. The Saenuri whip Rep. Won Yu-chul claimed the vocal lawmakers were campaigning for their next election through their filibusters. Most of the ruling party members‘ seats remain vacant as Rep. Park Won-suk of the minor Justice Party sets out as the fourth opposition member to deliver the marathon speech at the National Assembly on Wednesday. President Park Geun-hye weighed in on the legislative showdown, criticizing the opposition for delaying the bill that she said would prevent the nation from terrorism, such as those from Islamic States and North Korea, amid heightened cross-border tension following Pyongyang’s nuclear test and rocket launch.“ are unprecedented ones that no other countries have ever witnessed,” Park said on Wednesday at a meeting with economic policy makers. “ how the economy would prosper when people live in a society where terror attacks could happen,” she said. By Yeo Jun-suk","wednesday as opposition lawmakers scrambled ,opposition lawmakers scrambled to filibuster ,on wednesday as opposition lawmakers ,wednesday as opposition lawmakers ,to deliver the marathon speech","['the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'National Assembly', 'Chung Ui - hwa', 'Eun Soo - mi', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'the National Assembly', 'the Saenuri Party', 'the National Intelligence Service', 'the Minjoo Party ’s', 'Lee Jong - kul', 'Saenuri Party', 'Assembly', 'Assembly', 'Minjoo Party ’s', 'Saenuri', 'Minjoo', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Kim', 'Saenuri', 'Saenuri', 'Won Yu - chul', 'Park Won - suk', 'Justice Party', 'the National Assembly', 'Park Geun', 'Islamic States', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Park']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45978305  0.48751768

The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles on the candidate agendas, election trends and notable runners leading up to the race. This is the third installment. -- EdIn the weeks following North Korea’s long-range ballistic missile launch, national security has been on top of the agenda for all political parties here, overshadowing all other pending issues.But now, with less than two months left to the general elections, the opposition camp appears to be watering down the national security frame and focusing more on other bread-and-butter economic issues.The opposition bloc, mostly The Minjoo Party of Korea, have every reason to do so as the North’s repeated military provocations and growing tensions in the Korean Peninsula have given the conservatives an edge.According to a survey conducted by local pollster Realmeter on Monday, the ruling Saenuri Party’s approval rating stood at 41.7 percent last week, up 2 percentage points from the previous week. That of President Park Geun-hye, too, rose by 3.7 percentage points to 45.9 percent, data showed.“The national security situation has pushed conservative supporters to gain influence in the face of a potential crisis,” the pollster said in an analysis. The Minjoo Party of Korea’s leader Kim Jong-in  and floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul  survey the readiness posture near the border in Paju, Gyeonggi Province, on Feb. 9.YonhapTraditionally, the pacifist approach of the opposition camp during security crises -- that prioritizes peace and dialogue before pressure and sanctions -- has not worked in their favor, especially in times of major elections.Back in December 2012, with only a week remaining for the 18th presidential election, North Korea launched a long-range rocket, which heightened tension and drew voters to the Saenuri camp.The opposition’s counterclaim that the rival is using the cross-border tension politically has failed to persuade the majority of conservatives and centrists, instead turning into a worn-out ideological dispute before fizzling out.Apparently having learnt its lesson, the opposition party appears this time to be acting quickly to shift its policy focus away from security agenda to economic issues.“The forced closure of the Gaesong industrial complex will adversely affect the economy,” said floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul in a parliamentary speech last Wednesday. The floor leader’s speech is usually considered an outline of the party’s policies.“ should refrain from expanding the current national security crisis into the diplomatic and economic sectors as well,” he said. The joint industrial park in the North Korean city was shut down on Feb. 10 in response to Pyongyang’s Feb. 7 long-range rocket launch.Rep. Lee spent most of his speech proposing the party’s economic blueprint.“For the past eight years, conservative administrations have built up a debt-dependent economic model which now needs to be drastically corrected,” he said.The party’s policy committee, too, announced a set of key election slogans the following day, focusing on fair growth and adding momentum to the economic drive.Adding to the list of reasons for the Minjoo Party to avoid highlighting the security agenda is the disputed position of some of its members, including its current leader, over North Korean affairs. “I believe that the North Korean regime will one day collapse and that the Korean Peninsula will be unified,” said the party’s interim chief Kim Jong-in during his visit to an army division days after the recent rocket launch.His comments, which clearly contradicted the party’s identity which is largely based on its former leaders’ “Sunshine Policy” and the vision for inter-Korean engagement and dialogue, triggered immediate criticism, even giving room for the rookie People’s Party to cut in.“The president, the ruling party and even some of the opposition party members speak of the collapse of the North Korean regime, but this stance is of no help to promoting national security or to building peace in the peninsula,” said party chief Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo.As speculation mounted over the Minjoo Party’s security platform, former leader Rep. Moon Jae-in attempted to water it down.“From North Korea’s nuclear and missile , to the shutdown of Gaesong industrial park, it all comes down to a complete failure of the Park Geun-hye administration’s North Korean policies … But these defeated people are showing a bold front and blaming it all on the past governments,” Moon tweeted on Feb. 19. “Now with even some of the opposition members following the trend blindly by talking about reassessing the  of the sunshine policy, it is incredibly regretful.”In response to reporters’ questions about how he viewed Kim Jong-in’s remarks that were critical of the engagement policy, Moon shrugged, saying, “People do not have to see eye-to-eye all the time.”Meanwhile, the ruling Saenuri Party continues to capitalize on the North Korean issue, using it to rekindle its national security election agenda and to criticize the opposition camp.“The Minjoo Party acted as though it would for once take a firm stance against North Korean provocations, but its move turned out to be no more than a pretense to win support ahead of elections,” said the Saenuri floor leader Rep. Won Yoo-chul.“Its way of blaming the government over the recent situation reflects its lack of awareness and capacity when it comes to national security.”By Bae Hyun-jung","18th presidential election north korea ,presidential election north korea launched ,parliamentary speech last wednesday ,general election on april 13 ,presidential election north korea","['South Korea', 'National Assembly', 'the Korea Herald', 'EdIn', 'North Korea ’s', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'realmeter', 'Saenuri Party ’s', 'Park Geun - hye', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Kim Jong - in', 'Lee Jong - kul', 'Paju', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'North Korea', 'Saenuri', 'Gaesong', 'Lee Jong - kul', 'north korean', 'Pyongyang', 'Lee', 'the Minjoo Party', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - in', 'inter - korean', 'People ’s Party', 'north korean', 'Ahn Cheol', 'the Minjoo Party ’s', 'Moon Jae - in', 'North Korea ’s', 'Gaesong', 'north korean', 'Moon', 'Kim Jong - in', 'Moon', 'Saenuri Party', 'north korean', '“the Minjoo Party', 'north korean', 'Saenuri', 'Won Yoo', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51934534  0.62528419

Despite this, tattoos have been growing in popularity among some young people. ""I have lived as a tattoo artist for nearly a decade ...

Park Il-dong, a shoeshiner, has also registered his independent candidacy for Gwangju, a small city on the outskirts of Seoul. The 50-year-old man has gained attention for his campaign pledge that he would shine the shoes of his constituents to better listen to their voices if elected.Lee and Park are among more than 1,520 people who have registered their candidacies for the parliamentary election set for April.Of them, 792 have registered as ruling Saenuri Party runners while 337 seek to run on the ticket of the main opposition Minjoo Party. The rest have registered under the banners of the People's Party, Justice Party and other splinter parties.Kim Hyun-woo, a 34-year-old non-regular worker in the auto parts industry for more than a decade, is running in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province, as an independent on the platform that he will represent workers on temporary employment contracts.The issue of non-regular workers has become a key agenda of the government and management as some companies shun recruitment and instead rely on non-regular workers, who can be let go more easily.Under last year's landmark labor deal, the tripartite committee composed of labor, management and the government agreed to push for measures to improve non-regular workers' work conditions and increase the flexibility of the labor market.The unemployment rate for those between 15 and 29 jumped to a seven-month high of 9.5 percent in January from 8.4 percent tallied in December, according to government data.Kim Doo-sup, who is running in Gimpo, just west of Seoul, stands as the oldest candidate. The 86-year-old holds a record for running in the general election 15 times since 1960. Kim's decades-long endeavor for a parliamentary seat paid off in 1992 when he was elected. But ever since, he has failed to make it to a second term.""I have in-depth experience and know-how for the development of Gimpo,"" said the former lawmaker in his pledge statement.On the other end of the spectrum, Woo Min-ji, 24, is the youngest candidate and is running in Yangsan, South Gyeongsang Province as an independent.Cho Eun-bi, a 26-year-old college student, has gained attention on the Internet for her young and stylish appearance, earning her the reputation as the best-looking candidate. She is seeking to run as a candidate of the ruling Saenuri Party.She found herself at the center of growing questions over whether she has what it takes after a video was aired in which she fumbled to answer a question on labor reform.Political analysts say that candidates with colorful and unusual backgrounds are unlikely to make it into the National Assembly against all the odds.""It will be a high challenge for them to compete with established party members who have spent years trying to cement their support base on the local level,"" said Yoon Hee-woong, a senior analyst at the political consulting firm Opinion Live.","the upcoming parliamentary election lee ,tattoo business which is illegal ,42 year old tattoo artist ,attention for his campaign pledge ,medical doctor despite this tattoos","['Lee Rang', 'Seoul', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Park Il - dong', 'Seoul', 'Lee', 'Park', 'Saenuri Party', 'Minjoo Party', ""the People 's Party"", 'Justice Party', 'Kim Hyun - woo', 'Suwon', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Kim Doo - sup', 'Gimpo', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'Gimpo', 'Woo Min - ji', 'Cho Eun - bi', 'Saenuri Party', 'the National Assembly', 'Yoon Hee - woong']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32264629  0.36925495

Seoul’s U.N. representative Oh Joon brought up the issue at a UNSC meeting on Feb. 15, saying Pyongyang has shown “contempt and disregard for the functions and powers” of the top decision-making body through four rounds of atomic experiments and six long-range rocket firings which led to four resolutions. The point was reiterated one day later by Lee Ja-hyung, a counselor at the South Korean mission there, at a meeting of the Special Committee on the Charter of the U.N. and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization. “Twenty-five years ago, the DPRK solemnly pledged to comply with the obligations of the U.N. Charter as a new member, but during the past decade, it has persistently violated all Security Council resolutions on the DPRK,” Oh said, calling North Korea by its official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.“This is not only a direct challenge to the authority of the UNSC, but also a contradiction to both the letter and spirit of the pledge it made. This breach of obligation by the DPRK calls into question its qualification as a member of the United Nations.” South Korean Ambassador to U.N. Oh Joon In a media interview last Friday, Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se went further, saying it is “considerably noticeable that such talks are beginning to emerge,” though he cautioned against “over interpreting a claim raised by very few nations.” Though primarily intended to ratchet up pressure on Pyongyang and emphasize the need for much more powerful punishment this time given the ongoing UNSC discussions, the remarks sparked skepticism over the idea’s efficacy and use.  Any expulsion of a member state requires a recommendation of the council, which in the case of North Korea is extremely unlikely given the predicted opposition of China and Russia, the veto-wielding permanent powers and Pyongyang’s staunch backers. Even if they did agree to eject the North, it would do little, if anything, to resolve the nuclear issues, as the international community will virtually lose the means to punish the regime in future events, critics say. “Not only is it practically undoable, the idea would have no significance except to put North Korea to shame,” a senior Foreign Ministry official said, asking anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.  As controversy intensified, another senior official sought to dilute the U.N. diplomats’ comments on Monday, saying they were made in line with the context and purpose of the sessions and not aimed at calling for action. “It was not meant to urge any serious action and was born out of frustration and disappointment at the North’s persistent violations of UNSC resolutions,” the official told reporters on customary condition of anonymity. “Other countries also raised issue during the meeting with the ongoing charter breaches in similar contexts.” But others appeared more serious about the notion. Katharine Moon, the SK-Korea Foundation Chair in Korea studies at the Brookings Center for East Asia policy studies, even proposed ""throwing North Korea out of the U.N. membership"" in an op-ed published on the think tank’s website shortly before the U.N. gatherings.“Chapter II, Articles 5 and 6 of the U.N.

The rival parties have agreed that they will finalize the rule before the Assembly plenary session Tuesday, a day before overseas Koreans start their voter registration. “If we fail to reach an agreement before Tuesday, we may have to postpone the general elections slated for April 13,” said Assembly Speaker Rep. Chung Ui-hwa on Friday. In Korea, general elections have never been postponed, although a delay was once discussed during the Syngman Rhee administration in the 1950s. The extraordinary session ends March 10. Officials stick identification hologram stickers onto ballot boxes at the election commission office in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province, Sunday. YonhapWhile the ruling Saenuri Party has raised the possibility of arranging another plenary session before the end of the month if the negotiation protracts, the election commission officials have warned that further delay could make it physically impossible to hold the election in time.Rookie politicians planning to run in the race have also been calling for a postponement as they say that the invalid electoral map and consequent delays in partisan nomination will hurt their competiveness against incumbents.While the parties have reached a broad compromise on election rules, its passage has been withheld on being sidetracked by other contentious bills related to business and security matters. This includes bills designed to boost government efforts to pursue counter-terrorism measures, overhaul labor market, relax business regulations on service industry and address North Korea’s human rights abuse.  The Minjoo Party has demanded the Assembly passes the election bill first before dealing with other pending legislations, but the Saenuri Party insists that it will not finalize the election bill unless the main opposition cooperates in passing business and security bills.Observers warned that if the 19th Assembly fails to redraw constituencies promptly, it will end up earning itself the infamous title of being the most late to finalize election rules in Korean history. Lawmakers have often been blamed for determining electoral rules at the last minute. The 18th Assembly passed the election bill 44 days before elections. The worst case was the 16th assembly which enacted the bill just 37 days prior to elections. By Yeo Jun-suk","new electoral maps this week ,friday in korea general elections ,late to finalize election rules ,negotiations over new electoral maps ,monday to hammer out agreements","['Saenuri Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Assembly', 'Koreans', 'Assembly', 'Chung Ui - hwa', 'Korea', 'Syngman Rhee', 'Suwon', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'YonhapWhile', 'Saenuri Party', 'Rookie', 'North Korea ’s', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Assembly', 'Saenuri Party', 'Assembly', 'korean', 'the 18th Assembly']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47191307  0.79200858

The three will be comprised of a single-justice panel, a group panel and an appeals panel.The move has been taken to reflect the growing societal concerns over violence against children, the court said.The number of child abuse cases in the country nearly doubled over the past 10 years, according to the Korea Institute of Criminology. In 2004, there were 6,998 cases of violence against children. In 2013, the number soared to 13,076 cases. Over the past decade, an average 15 cases of child abuse were reported every day.The Seoul court isn't technically the first South Korean court to create a panel dedicated to child abuse cases. In June, the Incheon District Court in Incheon, Gyeonggi Province, created a single-justice panel for child abuse trials, but it hasn't made a group panel, which handles more violent cases, or an appeals panel, like its counterpart in Seoul.Meanwhile, the National Police Agency  said Sunday they will create a special investigations unit for child abuse in a joint effort with the government to combat this nagging social problem.The unit will be housed under the division that manages violence against women and adolescents in the Public Security Bureau, the NPA said.The government and the police have said elementary and middle school-aged children who aren't enrolled in school or have been absent for an extended period of time will be checked in on regularly because these kinds of children are most vulnerable to abuse.The NPA will also add 350 more officials specializing in the investigation of domestic violence cases, including violence against children and senior citizens, and aims to have about 1,000 of them by next year.","child abuse cases starting monday ,abuse cases starting monday ,child abuse cases in june ,seoul district court said sunday ,abuse cases starting monday the","['Seoul', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'the Korea Institute of Criminology', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'the Incheon District Court', 'Incheon', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Seoul', 'the National Police Agency', 'the Public Security Bureau', 'NPA']",2,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.35905704  0.78847736

She was 89.   A spokeswoman for Harper Collins in New York said Lee passed away peacefully late Thursday. The Pulitzer-winning author shunned the spotlight and spent her final years living in seclusion in Monroeville, Alabama, where she was born.   ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is considered one of the great classics of 20th century American literature, and is standard reading in classrooms across the world.   Published in 1960 and drawn from Lee's own experiences as a child, it came to define racial injustice in the Depression-era South.    It tells the story of a black man wrongly accused of raping a white woman and the courageous lawyer, Atticus Finch, who defies his community to defend him.   The novel sold 30 million copies and earned huge critical acclaim, winning Lee a Pulitzer prize in 1961 and thrusting her into an avalanche of publicity.   Her fame was sealed when the novel was adapted into a Hollywood film that won three Academy Awards in 1963, including an Oscar for Gregory Peck for his portrayal of Finch, one of the best-loved characters in American fiction.   Former US president George W. Bush, who awarded Lee the Presidential Medal of Freedom, America's highest civil honor in 2007, mourned the loss of ""a legendary novelist and lovely lady.""   ""Harper Lee was ahead of her time, and her masterpiece 'To Kill A Mockingbird' prodded America to catch up with her,"" he said.   ""Laura and I are grateful for Harper Lee and her matchless contributions to humanity and to the character of our country,"" he said of his wife. Harper Lee. AP-YONHAP   - Wit sharp as ever -   Harper Collins said Lee was not only a brilliant writer, but ""an extraordinary woman of great joyfulness, humility and kindness,"" who lived as she wanted -- ""in private -- surrounded by books and the people who loved her.""   In a rare insight, the novelist admitted in 1964 she had been completely caught off guard by being catapulted into the nation's consciousness by her novel.   ""I hoped for a little, but I got rather a whole lot and in some ways this was just about as frightening as the quick, merciful death I'd expected,"" she said, joking about her expectation the novel would be a critical flop.   For decades she stayed out of the public eye, claiming to have said all she wanted in ""Mockingbird"" and vowing never to publish another book.    But in 2015, she upended the literary world by publishing the unedited manuscript of ""Go Set a Watchman"" -- her first novel written in the 1950s which was essentially a first draft of ""Mockingbird.""   The manuscript was an instant popular bestseller but it was mauled by critics, and its release sparked torrid speculation that the author, who suffered a stroke in 2007, was not of sound mind.   ""When I saw her just six weeks ago, she was full of life, her mind and mischievous wit as sharp as ever,"" said Lee's agent Andrew Nurnberg on Friday. ""We have lost a great writer, a great friend and a beacon of integrity.""   Born Nelle Harper Lee in April 1926, she was the youngest of four children. Her father was a lawyer and a direct descendant of Civil War general Robert E. Lee.   Lee grew up during the Great Depression in a remote village where the few available books provided the only entertainment. She never married, and books remained forever her first love.   Known as a tomboy as a child, she counted author Truman Capote among her childhood friends -- and often stood up for him when he was picked on as a sissy. She would later work as an assistant on Capote's novel ""In Cold Blood,"" which examined a multiple killing in Kansas, and was dedicated to Lee.   - Summer backlash -   A precocious child, Lee learned to read early and had devoured all kinds of literature by the time she started school. She also showed an early flair for writing even though her family hoped she would follow her father into law.   After a spell as an exchange student at Oxford University in England, she quit law school at The University of Alabama and headed for New York in 1949 to follow her dream of being a writer.   She worked for a while as an airline reservation clerk, until one Christmas when friends gave her enough money to live for a year without working so she could concentrate on writing.   Completed before ""Mockingbird,"" the draft she released last year as ""Watchman"" tells a similar tale of small-town racism but recounted from a different perspective.   While her famous novel is told through the eyes of Finch's young daughter, Scout, ""Watchman"" is narrated from the perspective of a grown-up Scout living in New York and coming home to the South for a troubled visit.   But critics pointed to a number of troubling inconsistencies between the two -- most notably that the hero Finch is portrayed in the manuscript as a man who harbors racist opinions.   The manuscript's release sparked a furious backlash -- partly because so little was known of Lee, who lived in a nursing home with a strictly controlled visitor list and who refused any request for interviews.   She did however quietly attend annual award ceremonies held by The University of Alabama for a writing contest inspired by her work.   Her sister, Alice, who was her gatekeeper until she died two years ago aged 103, explained in 2002 why her sister never seemed to make headway with a new work.   ""I'll put it this way. When you have hit the pinnacle, how would you feel about writing more? Would you feel like you're competing with yourself?""","thursday the pulitzer winning author ,died her publisher said friday ,late thursday the pulitzer winning ,america most celebrated novelists whose ,thursday the pulitzer winning","['NEW YORK', 'Harper Lee', 'America', 'Harper Collins', 'New York', 'Lee', 'Pulitzer', 'Monroeville', 'Alabama', 'american', 'Lee', 'Atticus Finch', 'Lee', 'Hollywood', 'Academy Awards', 'Oscar', 'Finch', 'american', 'US', 'George W.

665,665,U.S. enacts strongest standalone N.K. sanctions,"The United States on Thursday put in place a package of its strongest, most comprehensive standalone sanctions yet against North Korea in punishment for its fresh nuclear and long-range missile tests, also targeting cybercrimes, human rights violations and other illicit activities. President Barack Obama signed the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act into law, the White House said. The House of Represent...","The United States on Thursday put in place a package of its strongest, most comprehensive standalone sanctions yet against North Korea in punishment for its fresh nuclear and long-range missile tests, also targeting cybercrimes, human rights violations and other illicit activities. President Barack Obama signed the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act into law, the White House said. The House of Representatives initially voted nearly unanimously to pass the bill about a week after the Jan. 6 underground blast and gave final approval on Feb. 12 following slight changes in line with the Senate’s endorsement. The legislation, H.R. 757, is designed to make way for the administration to tighten sanctions on individuals and entities engaging in transactions related to Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs, cyberattacks, arms, narcotics and cash smuggling, human rights breaches, luxury goods buys, misuse of the global financial system and other illegitimate acts. “The Congress seeks, through this legislation, to use nonmilitary means to address this crisis, to provide diplomatic leverage to negotiate necessary changes in North Korea’s conduct and to ease the suffering of the people of North Korea,” the text reads.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  speaks to reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington on Feb. 9 following a closed-door policy meeting, saying the chamber will consider legislation to hit North Korea with more stringent sanctions in the wake of its recent missile launch.The goal of the measures is to “serve to increase pressure,” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said before the signing, adding that the administration is “deeply concerned” about North Korea’s recent actions and provocations. Seoul welcomed its ratification, saying it attests to Washington’s concrete resolve to take stern action against the latest provocations and will help reinforce the international community’s united response. “As the world’s first systematic, standalone North Korea sanctions law built on bipartisan support, the legislation is expected to provide the foundation for the U.S. administration to take strong, effective steps,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Cho June-hyuck said at a news conference Friday. “Our government, together with the international community, will take all possible measures to make North Korea abandon nuclear weapons and change itself.” The bill was introduced by Rep. Ed Royce, chairman of the House foreign relations committee, in February 2015 in the wake of the North’s computer network hack of Sony Pictures, but had not been put up for a vote since. While focusing chiefly on ways to deny the Kim Jong-un regime access to funds for its military programs, the act mandates the imposition of penalties on those involved in illicit business with North Korea unless a presidential waiver is given. It also requires sanctions to be levied on North Korea’s key industrial inputs, such as coal and precious minerals, if found to have been diverted for banned military uses. Many of the ideas appear to be rooted in the steps enforced against Iran until 2013, which enabled the U.S. to sanction third-party companies and individuals for their illegal dealings with Tehran. The latest act thus in effect carries veiled warnings mainly to China, the North’s top trading partner and economic patron, though whether Washington will actually punish Chinese entities remains to be seen. “It is here that any new North Korea sanctions endeavor will potentially founder: how far to push North Korea’s trading and financial partners, most of whom are Chinese,” Richard Nephew, director of economic statecraft, sanctions and energy markets at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs, wrote on the 38 North blog run by the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. “The U.S. may be prepared to have some amount of economic and political contretemps with China over North Korea, but it is doubtful that any but the most myopic of sanctions advocates would be prepared to sacrifice U.S.-China relations on the altar of North Korea sanctions, and there are many different issues that require U.S. and Chinese engagement.” The new law stresses the need for follow-up steps, requiring the president to brief the congressional committee on the regime’s principal foreign assets and sources of foreign income, and to provide a list of designated persons for their contribution to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, arms and luxury goods trade, censorship and other “prohibited conducts,” as well as a summary of diplomatic efforts to sanction and block the assets of banned North Korean banks -- all within 180 days of its effectuation and regularly afterward. In light of the dismal living conditions in the communist state, the act calls on the secretary of state to present “specific findings with respect to the responsibility for serious human rights abuses and censorship” of Kim and other top military and ruling Workers’ Party officials. The law also authorizes $50 million over the next five years to transmit radio broadcasts into the reclusive country, purchase communications equipment and support humanitarian aid programs.“This new law is critically important because for the first time it sets out that the U.S. government will sanction leaders in North Korea because they abuse human rights,” Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in an email interview with The Korea Herald. “This law contributes to a new reality where human rights concerns will not get pushed off the table when there is a crisis on security issues or nuclear proliferation in North Korea, and that‘s a huge step forward.”  In this Sept. 11, 2015 photo, commuters ride on a crowded city trolley bus in Pyongyang. The measures came as the U.S. and China are struggling to narrow the differences in their stances over the forthcoming U.N. Security Council sanctions. While Seoul calls for a “terminating resolution” and the U.S. seeks much stricter bans, such as those directed at Pyongyang’s banking and finance, China remains reluctant, apparently wary of a possible breakdown of the North Korean economy.The sanctions discussions have unprecedentedly been drawn out for more than 40 days. The UNSC took 18 and 23 days before unveiling the final texts following the North’s second and third tests in 2009 and 2013, respectively.Amid the heated debate, the legislation will force Kim to “make a decision of whether they want to face economic collapse or engage in real compromise,” Royce said during a forum in Irvine, California, upon its ratification. Sen. Cory Gardner, chairman of the Senate foreign relations subcommittee on East Asia and Pacific affairs and a related bill’s author, also lauded Obama’s signing as a “major shift” in his North Korea policy. “It is the Obama administration’s recognition that their strategic patience policy has failed and we need a new direction to stop North Korea's increasing belligerence,” he said in a statement. “My bill provides that new policy of strength, and I’m proud that Congress put politics aside and came together to approve mandatory sanctions designed to stop the Forgotten Maniac in Pyongyang. Today, we’ve given our allies a reason to trust us, and our enemies a reason to fear us.”By Shin Hyon-hee","news conference friday our government ,author also lauded obama signing ,obama signed the north korea ,obama signing as major shift ,punishment for its fresh nuclear","['the United States', 'North Korea', 'Barack Obama', 'the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act', 'the White House', 'the House of Representatives', 'Senate', 'H.R. 757', 'Pyongyang', 'Congress', 'North Korea ’s', 'North Korea', 'Senate', 'Mitch McConnell', 'Capitol Hill', 'Washington', 'North Korea', 'White House', 'Josh Earnest', 'North Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'Foreign Ministry', 'Cho June - hyuck', 'North Korea', 'Ed Royce', 'House', 'North ’s', 'Sony Pictures', 'Kim Jong - un', 'North Korea', 'North Korea ’s', 'Iran', 'U.S.', 'Tehran', 'China', 'the North ’s', 'Washington', 'chinese', 'North Korea', 'North Korea ’s', 'chinese', 'Richard Nephew', 'Columbia University ’s School of International and Public Affairs', 'the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies', 'U.S.', 'China', 'North Korea', 'u.s.-china', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'chinese', 'north korean', 'Kim', 'Workers ’ Party', 'U.S.', 'North Korea', 'Phil Robertson', 'Human Rights Watch', 'the Korea Herald', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'U.S.', 'China', 'U.N.

Lee Hahn-koo, insisted on a public survey system that has been said to favor rookie politicians.The “non-Park” members led by party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung, saw this rule not only as an unfair swipe at incumbent lawmakers, but also as an attempt of the “pro-Park” faction to corner key constituencies.“As a party leader, I have the duty to deter the nomination committee from deviating from basic regulations of the party,” said Rep. Kim at the Supreme Council meeting Thursday.“I will not tolerate a nomination system that favors some and cuts off others.”Rep. Suh Chung-won, speaking for the pro-president group, immediately rebuked Kim for making “inappropriate” comments in public.“Such comments  are precisely what we should not tolerate,” he said.While the meeting turned into a verbal duel, Rep. Kim Tae-ho blamed both sides for losing dignity in front of people and left the room.The Saenuri bigwigs have been playing tug-of-war with the nomination process, most recently shaken up by the nomination committee chief Lee’s recent nomination system. Saenuri chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung attends a plenary session at the National Assembly on Thursday. Lee had said Tuesday that the committee would designate one to three priority constituencies in each of the 17 metropolitan cities and provinces.According to the plan, should multiple aspirants in the given district fail to reach an agreement, there would be a public survey, short of a vote by party members.This open survey system is seen to favor rookie candidates, especially those with a high media profile, such as former Interior Minister Chong Jong-sup and former chief presidential press secretary Yoon Doo-hyun.Incumbent lawmakers have been favoring a mixed system, combining 70 percent of the public survey with a 30 percent party members’ vote.“ is not about a factional dispute, but a conflict between those who wish to implement reforms and those who prefer to defend vested interests,” Lee said at the committee meeting held after the Supreme Council.As of Wednesday, a total of 822 party members had filed for the party’s nomination.

We have had ongoing discussions with the Chinese in New York. President Obama has spoken to President Xi. I think these discussions are progressing,"" National Security Advisor Susan Rice said at a briefing Monday night, according to a pool report.For more than a month, since the North's nuclear test, the Security Council has been struggling in negotiations to come up with a new sanctions resolution on the North because China has been reluctant to impose harsh measures on Pyongyang.Amid the deadlock, the North flouted the Security Council again with a banned missile launch on Feb. 7.Beijing has condemned the North's nuclear and missile tests but has been lukewarm about calls for a stern response. Analysts have long said Beijing fears that pushing Pyongyang too hard could lead to its collapse, instability on its border with China and ultimately the emergence of a pro-U.S. nation. Chinese cooperation is key to any meaningful punishment as it is one of the five veto-holding permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and the main provider of food and fuel aid to the impoverished North. ""I think it unlikely that China wants to be seen by the international community as the protector of North Korea, given its recent outrageous behavior in violation of international law and U.N.

Police officials from South Gyeongsang Province, who have been investigating the case, requested late Monday that the National Forensics Service check the body for the exact cause of death. The girl’s body was found earlier in the day, after her 42-year-old mother, surnamed Park, had confessed to tying up her then 7-year-old child and beating her to death in October 2011. Police exhumed the body in a mountain in Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province, where the woman had buried her daughter with the help of three accomplices. One of the accomplices who helped the mother bury the young girl is taken in for questioning at Goseong Police Station on Tuesday. Two of them have been arrested on the charge of helping to discard the body. The third was booked without detention. Investigators expect that determining the cause of death could take from three weeks up to a month. Police will conduct an on-the-spot inspection of the scene at the mountain where the body was buried and at the crime scene of Park’s apartment in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province.Officials will hold a briefing on the case at Goseong Police Station on Thursday.The investigators found Park in the midst of a nationwide search for the whereabouts and statuses of students who have been reported absent from school for a long time, or those who have never been admitted to school. The move was launched as part of the government’s efforts to curb child abuse amid a series of high-profile cases involving children.","october 2011 police exhumed the ,woman had buried her daughter ,tuesday carried out an autopsy ,2011 police exhumed the body ,in october 2011 police exhumed","['South Gyeongsang Province', 'the National Forensics Service', 'Park', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Goseong Police Station', 'Park ’s', 'Yongin', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Goseong Police Station', 'Park']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.30135688  0.38779464

The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles on the candidate agendas, election trends and notable runners leading up to the race. This is the second installment. -- EdLee Dong-hak was 23 years old when he first got a taste of politics. He had enrolled in the then-ruling Uri Party, a precursor to The Minjoo Party of Korea, as a part-timer for a party event in 2003. Now, the 33-year-old is running in the April election as the main opposition party’s candidate to compete against the liberal heavyweight Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo in Nowon-gu, Seoul.“I want to add diversity to the politics dominated by the older generation,” Lee told The Korea Herald. He served on the party’s reform committee in recent years.“Even though there are many decisions being made that could impact the younger generation in the future, young people don’t have enough say in the process. I want to create a table where different generation sit down together and make political decision collectively,” he said. Lee and 11 other preliminary candidates for the Minjoo Party in their 20s and 30s announced their bid to run on Feb. 3. Young preliminary candidates of The Minjoo Party of Korea including Lee Dong-hak  hold a press conference announcing their bids at the National Assembly on Feb. 3. Lee is one of the younger candidates seeking to reverse Korea’s political climate, where young voters have remained indifferent to politics, frustrated by the old establishment’s failure to address their agenda post-election.According to statistics from the National Election Commission, the number of candidates in their 20s and 30s has been decreasing since reaching its peak of 206 in the 1996 elections. The 2004, 2008 and 2012 elections saw 160, 148 and 33 young candidates, respectively. The same is true for the number of young voters. The election watchdog’s data showed that the turnout among those in their 20s at the 2004 and 2008 elections were about 45 and 28 percent, respectively. The 2012 elections’ turnout was 40 percent, the lowest in all age groups. “It creates a vicious circle of political indifference among young people,” said Lee Nae-young, professor of comparative politics at Korea University. “As Korea’s aging society and older generation dominates politics, young people feel less likely to engage in the politics and cast their ballots,” he said. Rise and fall of activists-turned-politicians There was a time when the legislative branch was significantly populated with fresh-faced lawmakers. The 2004 general election saw a total of 187 first-termers in the 299-strong National Assembly. Of them, 129 were in their 30s and 40s and only 49 lawmakers were in their 60s or older. Most of those young lawmakers had built their reputations after spearheading college students’ democratic movements in the 1980s. However, as these activists-turned-politicians lost touch with average voters, the younger lawmakers did not constitute a new mainstream in politics. For instance, among the 108 first-term lawmakers with the progressive Uri Party, 73 lost their seats in the 2008 election.“Values coming from the student-led democratic campaigns of the past are less likely to resonate with young voters. Since the current generation didn’t go through that movement, they have become indifferent to the ideological agenda,” Lee said. The lack of youth participation in politics and decision-making has long been a common problem.“No one is born a good citizen, no nation is born a democracy. Rather, both are processes that continue to evolve over a lifetime. Young people must be included from birth. A society that cuts itself off from its youth severs its lifeline,” Kofi Annan, former U.N. secretary-general, had said.In the 2013 U.N. Development Program Report, it points out that young people between the ages of 15 and 25 constitute a fifth of the world’s population, and yet, while they are often involved in informal political processes, they are not formally represented in national political institutions, thereby hurting the quality of democratic governance.The report suggests considering youth as agents of change instead of a problem to be resolved by others. It also recommends that the young should not considered a homogenous block but should be viewed based on their social aspects, such as gender and background. Political participation of young people should extend across the electoral cycle such as by consistently developing young candidates’ capacity beyond the one-off election event, it said.Opening doors for the youthSouth Korea’s major parties have also been taking steps to galvanize young voters and political aspirants.The ruling Saenuri Party decided to give extra points to the young candidates when the party select candidates for the election. The candidates must be under the age of 45 and have no record of having run in past elections.The conservative party had brought in young politicians to put them in charge of reforming the party and competing against liberal heavyweights in key constituencies. Political rookie Son Su-jo, then 27, ran against former presidential candidate Rep. Moon Jae-in in the 2012 general election in Busan. Although her challenge failed, the relatively close race was considered a blow to the political heavyweight.The Saenuri Party’s Lee Jun-seok, 31, will also be going up against Lee Dong-hak and Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo in the Nowon constituency. Lee, the former chief of the party’s Innovation Committee, had spearheaded efforts to win young votes for then presidential-candidate Park Geun-hye’s presidential campaign in 2012. He has since built on his reputation as TV personality. The Saenuri Party’s Lee Jun-seok gets ready to announce his bid to run in the April 13 elections at the National Assembly on Jan. 24. “It is now time for the citizens, the true owner of this country, to lay the basis on which we can achieve generation change, before any  attempt to change the administration. … Although there are those who say I am too young, please pay attention to things that I can do because I am young,” he said on Jan. 24 while announcing his bid.The main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea, for its part, has been pushing to lower the voting age from 19 to 18. The country had lowered the age from 20 to 19 in 2005.The Minjoo Party asserts that the scheme would allow more young people to exercise their constitutional right to participate in politics. The Saenuri Party opposes the plan, dismissing it as being politically-motivated, in apparent fear of younger voters bolstering the progressive opposition camp.And their concerns are justified by the growing anti-government movement among the younger demographics, particularly upon the government’s repeated slipshod measures against recent crises including the 2014 Sewol ferry disaster and the 2015 MERS outbreak. Students have also taken to the street since last month over the Dec. 28 Korea-Japan agreement on World War II sex slavery.Among 34 countries from Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, South Korea and Poland are the only two countries with voting ages above 18 -- at 19 and 21, respectively. But experts remain skeptical of the major parties’ attempt to win back young voters, highlighting that the parties are still crowded with politicians who are reluctant to clear the table to let the youth in, particularly in the nomination process.“I don’t think there is a significant inflow of young politicians,” said Kim Min-jeon, a political science professor at Kyung Hee University. “The average age of incumbent lawmakers is 58 and the parties’ designated age limit of allocating proportional seats is 39. That explains a lot,” she said. “In order to encourage young generation to join the politics, the parties have to give them incentives. Given that young people are not on an equal footing with old establishment politicians, the parties could provide them with more benefits regarding their nomination process and financial support,” Kim said.By Yeo Jun-suk","after spearheading college students democratic ,running in the april election ,young votes for then presidential ,27 ran against former presidential ,the student led democratic campaigns","['South Korea', 'National Assembly', 'the Korea Herald', 'EdLee Dong - hak', 'Uri Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Seoul', 'Lee', 'the Korea Herald', 'Lee', 'the Minjoo Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Lee Dong - hak', 'the National Assembly', 'Lee', 'Korea', 'the National Election Commission', 'Lee Nae - young', 'Korea University', 'National Assembly', 'Uri Party', 'Lee', 'Kofi Annan', 'U.N.', 'U.N.

The committee, in turn, is expected to propose sanctions to the council in early March, the sources said.The Security Council swiftly condemned the North's Jan. 6 nuclear test and has since been working on a new sanctions resolution. Adding to the international outrage, the North unveiled its plan this week to conduct a banned long-range rocket launch.The Radio Free Asia has reported the panel of experts plans to recommend sanctions against two main agencies responsible for the North's nuclear and missile programs -- the Munitions Industry Department of the North's ruling Workers' Party and the State Space Development Bureau.The panel is also expected to recommend sanctions against senior North Korean officials, such as Pak To-chun, a former secretary of the Munitions Industry Department; Ri Man-gon, director of the department; and Ri Pyong-chol, a deputy director of the department, the report said.So far, the Security Council has adopted six resolutions, six presidential statements and two press statements with regard to the North's nuclear and missile programs. Of the six resolutions, four included sanctions against the isolated nation. Chinese cooperation is key to putting together and implementing any meaningful sanctions resolution, as it is one of the five veto-holding permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and the main provider of food and fuel for the impoverished North.Beijing has condemned the North's nuclear test, but has been lukewarm about calls for stern responses. Analysts have long said Beijing fears that pushing Pyongyang too hard could lead to its collapse, instability on its border with China and the untimely emergence of a pro-U.S. nation.","security council committee next week ,fresh sanctions against north korea ,next week sources said thursday ,council committee next week sources ,condemned the north nuclear test","['U.N.', 'North Korea', 'Security Council', 'the Security Council', 'Pyongyang', 'Security Council', 'the Radio Free Asia', 'the Munitions Industry Department', ""Workers ' Party"", 'the State Space Development Bureau', 'north korean', 'Pak To - chun', 'the Munitions Industry Department', 'Ri Man - gon', 'Ri Pyong - chol', 'the Security Council', 'chinese', 'the U.N.

The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles on the candidate agendas, election trends and notable runners leading up to the race. This is the first installment. -- EdLeading a campaign based on welfare measures is certainly a tempting strategy for political parties in an election season.Progressive parties have used the strategy to distinguish themselves from conservatives and criticize excessive capitalist growth drives. The conservative camp, on the other hand, adopts welfare plans to prove a balanced policy portfolio.But in either case, such buoyant promises come with a critical question: How will these costly social support programs be financed?Indeed, several of the welfare pledges that have successfully won votes in recent years have boomeranged against the initiating party, mostly due to a lack of funds. Voters, too, have grown skeptical over the rosy promises of free child care, school meals and pension benefits.These side effects may explain why welfare agenda have been swept aside this year, as the nation heads toward a general election to pick National Assembly members for the next four years.Welfare, key election determinant in 2010-2012In the elections from 2010-2012, political parties had every reason to prioritize welfare in their campaigns in response to growing demands for stronger social protection.The education superintendent election in 2010, the Seoul mayoral by-election in 2011, the parliamentary elections and the presidential election in 2012 were all won by the party or candidate who took the lead in welfare issues.As progressive candidates swept the 2010-2011 elections with pledges of free school meals and halving college tuition fees, the ruling Grand National Party decided to undercut the liberal drive by taking the initiative.After replacing its supreme council with an emergency committee led by then-Rep. Park Geun-hye and changing its longtime name to the current Saenuri Party, the conservatives made the unconventional move to announce an extensive child care program, called the “Nuri” curriculum.Not only did it revise the infant care act to increase the state subsidies for child care, but it also pledged to expand the free child care beneficiaries to 3-year-olds, and eventually to all age groups.This was a drastic expansion of the original plan devised by the former Lee Myung-bak administration benefitting 5-year-olds before gradually moving on to younger age groups.These groundbreaking welfare policies caused a stir, as well as scornful counterattacks from the opposition, but they had their intended effect -- the Saenuri Party secured its majority in the assembly in 2012.  Park Geun-hye, the then-candidate for the ruling Saenuri Party, delivers her state-funded child care pledges to the audience during the presidential election campaign in November 2012. Leader Park Geun-hye, too, earned credit for saving the party from crisis and for redirecting the party’s interest toward people’s livelihoods. Her presidential campaign mantra was based on two key terms -- “economic democratization” and “welfare” -- which later contributed to her victory.Policy boomerangBut over recent years, the financial consequences of these generous welfare programs have gone out of control, with the government and ruling party are struggling to patch them up.The greatest problem for the ruling bloc is the strife between the central government and local education superintendents over the state-initiated Nuri curriculum.Due to the Park Geun-hye administration’s low-taxation stance, the program soon came to face a lack of funding, which then led to a standoff over who was to take financial responsibility.The central government claims local offices should allocate their share of the budget, as stated in the ordinance. But superintendents argue that child care centers are classified as nurseries, and thus supervised by the Welfare Ministry instead of the Education Ministry.This child care dispute brought criticism against the president for pushing ahead with an extensive welfare blueprint without a matching funding plan or sufficient consultation with local governments.A standout example of the trouble for the ruling camp is the ongoing war with progressive welfare-driven Seongnam Mayor Lee Jae-myeong.Late last year, the local assembly of Seongnam passed a series of welfare bills, providing free postnatal care for new mothers, free uniforms for middle school freshmen and special subsidies for young job seekers.The mayor claimed the measures were within legal boundaries, citing the duty of the central or local government to improve citizens’ welfare. But his bold actions have rubbed the presidential office and the ruling party up the wrong way. The administration, which once touted grand welfare pledges as a prerequisite responsibility of the state, started branding it as populism.“When a local government runs  businesses that it cannot afford, the  consequences will be borne by the state,” said President Park last month, as she also labeled Mayor Lee’s welfare policies “populist.”The president also passed through the Cabinet meeting an ordinance to cut back on the subsidy for local governments that introduced a social security system without consulting the central government in advance.“These populist policies that abuse people’s taxes for the sake of the mayor’s personal interest are like a sweet poison, leading the country and the people to breakdown,” were the words of Saenuri chief Kim Moo-sung.But Mayor Lee refuted, saying his actions would have been in line if only the president and ruling party had not reversed their earlier pledges for people’s welfare.“ promised welfare without extra taxation, which turned out to be a lie,” Lee said in a radio interview Monday.“President Park, too, spoke of a basic pension for all those aged 65 or above, but now she is taking back her words.”The ruling party made its rebuttal, but the dispute over welfare served as a reminder to voters that several of the party’s welfare vows remain unfulfilled.Parties dodge welfare talk in generalThe Saenuri chief may be known for his outspokenness, but his offense against the Seongnam Mayor’s welfare plans was by no means his personal opinion. It reflected the party’s growing reluctance to prioritize welfare amid limited financial resources and prolonged slow growth.A report by the party’s think tank the Youido Institute last year said that as a means to exit the low growth phase, the government should “increase the level of economic freedom and reduce welfare.”Quoting the cases of Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom, the report claimed that most advanced countries were held back in terms of economic development due to their “excessive welfare systems.”It is not just the ruling conservatives that have shied away from the welfare agenda. The progressive main opposition party, too, has toned down its stance.The New Politics Alliance for Democracy, which is now The Minjoo Party of Korea, issued an election strategy report last year and fingered “tolerant growth” rather than “universal welfare” as the top policy goal.Even former chief Rep. Moon Jae-in has been reiterating the concept of “income-led growth,” placing growth over welfare.This has led to suspicion that the opposition party has lost some of the progressive color it claimed to have, but some experts point out that welfare should not be considered a yardstick of progressiveness.According to the late Harvard historian Sydney Fay, the very concept of state welfare dates from German chancellor Otto von Bismarck and French Emperor Napoleon III in the 1870s. Both highly conservative rulers came up with insurance systems for the socially disadvantaged class so as to discourage them from turning to socialism.Libertarian economist Richard McKenzie, too, pointed out that “the welfare state is necessary for the continued collective acceptance of the free market system.” Without a soothing mechanism, workers may end up resisting a free economy, which will then cost more in terms of growth than in welfare costs, he explained in his book “Fairness of the Market.”“What really counts in welfare is the existence of a sustainable system,” said Ahn Sang-hoon, professor for social policy studies at Seoul National University.“We should pay more attention to whether welfare is forming a virtuous circle with the nation’s economy or whether the level of benefits is in line with the people’s tax burden, instead of disputing individual policy contents.”By Bae Hyun-jung","interview monday president park too ,her presidential campaign mantra ,the seoul mayoral by election ,new 20th national assembly members ,her presidential campaign mantra was","['South Korea', 'National Assembly', 'the Korea Herald', 'National Assembly', 'Seoul', 'Grand National Party', 'Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Nuri', 'the Welfare Ministry', 'the Education Ministry', 'Seongnam Mayor', 'Lee Jae - myeong', 'Park', 'Lee', 'Cabinet', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Park', 'Saenuri', 'the Youido Institute', 'Germany', 'Sweden', 'the United Kingdom', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Harvard', 'Sydney Fay', 'german', 'Otto von Bismarck', 'French', 'libertarian', 'Richard McKenzie', 'Ahn Sang - hoon', 'Seoul National University', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53020394  0.54594636

The waters off the coast of Jindo, South Jeolla Province -- where the ill-fated vessel lies -- contain strong, volatile currents and murky water which hindered rescue efforts after the ship’s sinking on April 16, 2014. Divers from China’s Shanghai Salavage Co. and workers dispatched for the salvage operations of the Sewol ferry work on a barge off the coast of Jindo, South Jeolla Province, on Jan. 13. YonhapThe Sewol’s sinking left 304 dead or missing, most of whom were students of Danwon High School in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province, who were traveling to Jejudo Island for a field trip.“We are not yet sure when the salvage operations will conclude, but we are hoping to complete it before the storm season ,” said a ministry official.Officials said the time needed for the underwater investigation of the vessel alone was prolonged by nearly four weeks, as divers from the Chinese state-run Shanghai Salvage Co. -- which leads the consortium for raising the sunken ferry -- needed time to adjust to the strong currents.It also took nearly double the expected time to remove the residual oil, and triple the time to install the netting on the windows and doors of the ferry to ensure that the contents of the ship -- which may include nine bodies that remain unaccounted for -- do not get lost.The bereaved families of Sewol victims have strongly urged the government to salvage the ship and recover the bodies of those missing.

The association held an extraordinary general meeting on Jan. 13 to approve his dismissal. Under the plan, the ministry will push for legislation that allows it to sack or suspend the organization’s future heads, separate revenue-making projects from its operations and revise the existing election customs that require chairperson candidates to deposit 50 million won and let them bribe voters. Cho was also found to have doled out some 1 billion won to around 200 electors during his campaign.To that end, the ministry is set to launch an emergency planning committee on Thursday, which will be led by the vice minister and some 15 internal and external legal, accounting, management and military experts and advisors. “Our task going forward is to craft steps to address the controversy over the profit activities and personnel management and establish an election scheme that could tackle the issues that were brought up in the run up to and after Cho’s win. We will also reinforce our supervisory authority with which we had until now been unable to do anything, even if there was a problem with the association,” Vice Minister Choi Wan-geun said at a news conference. “Though some people have been calling for an early vote for the next chairman, we think that in order to put the organization back on track, reform measures must come first.”  Members of the Korean Veterans Association attend a general assembly on Jan. 13 during which they voted in favor of ousting corruption-ridden chairman Cho Nam-poong, the first such case in the organization's history. YonhapAfter a string of irregularity allegations surfaced over Cho, the ministry sought last year to stop his term and urged his resignation. Besides the formal charges, he is accused of causing the entity’s debt to snowball to nearly 600 billion won. Yet the unfazed chairman defied the demands, continuing to flaunt his power and undertake lavish, unfocused overseas business trips even as a parliamentary audit was just around the corner in September.Though the chairman post is unpaid and largely honorary, it has enticed many retired generals and other military and defense industry officials who set their sights on the dozen affiliates running funeral services and other revenue earning businesses under its command. As a result, the race often triggers overheated campaigns overrun with unqualified nominees, and a host of officials have been embroiled in corruption scandals. Since Cho's removal, the fraternity of veterans has formed a group tasked with its “normalization” and vowed to formulate measures to improve the election system for its part, but continues to be reeling from in-house power struggles. “The envisaged plan is primarily aimed at blocking the leadership from abusing power,” a ministry official said. “As a supervisory institution, we think that the association cannot be normalized without fundamental refurbishment.” By Shin Hyon-hee","corruption scandals since cho removal ,500 million won in bribes ,following series of corruption scandals ,embroiled in corruption scandals since ,overhaul the country largest veterans","['Seoul', 'the Ministry of Patriots and Veteran Affairs', 'the Korean Veterans Association', 'Cho Nam', 'Army', 'chinese', 'Cho', 'Cho ’s', 'Choi Wan - geun', 'the Korean Veterans Association', 'Cho Nam', 'Cho', 'Cho', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34354055  0.08089732

The system, which has long been considered a symbol of the nation’s dictatorial rule, will be officially scrapped Monday, when a legal revision comes into effect, the National Police Agency said. The riot police have gradually been replaced by police conscripts, who choose to serve their mandatory national service in the police rather than in the military, and whose role is not officially linked to North Korea. The riot police system was established in 1971 under the military-backed Park Chung-hee administration, officially to combat demonstrations led by North Korean spies. The riot police were randomly selected among military conscripts by the Defense Ministry.Amid the widespread anti-dictatorship sentiment, the riot police played a central role in cracking down on rallies in the name of maintaining public order. Their job also included managing traffic and guarding important facilities. The continued use of riot police, which runs as a paramilitary organization, to confront protestors with shields, clubs and tear gas has sparked criticism from activists. Amid the criticism and shrinking population, the National Police Agency set up a new scheme to recruit police conscripts upon application in 1983 to gradually replace the riot police system. The Defense Ministry stopped recruiting riot police in January 2012 and the last batch of riot police were discharged in September 2013. According to the police, the total number of riot police who completed their service stands at nearly 33,000. In South Korea, all the able-bodied men are required to serve the around two-year mandatory military service as the country technically remains at war with North Korea since the 1950-53 Korean War.By Ock Hyun-ju","ministry stopped recruiting riot police ,defense ministry stopped recruiting riot ,stopped recruiting riot police ,last batch of riot police ,stopped recruiting riot police in","['the Defense Ministry', 'the National Police Agency', 'North Korea', 'Park Chung - hee', 'north korean', 'the Defense Ministry', 'the National Police Agency', 'the Defense Ministry', 'South Korea', 'North Korea']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51844192  0.23245476

In response, the government has pushed forward with the full introduction of a system to encourage competition among public servants since it has so far been applied only to the heads of some public agencies.""The government will now push ahead with the performance-based salary system in government offices after reflecting the situation, such as the agreement among labor, management and the government,""said a high-ranking government official who requested anonymity.The government plans to make the final decision based on an evaluation process of some 300 public agencies by the first quarter of this year and adopt the system before the end of this year.Performance-based salaries are usually calculated and granted based on the volume of work and achievements made by individual workers. The decision is seen as the government's determination to push for reform in the labor sector intended to make the market more flexible and help revitalize the sagging economy.The Federation of Korean Trade Unions, the country's major umbrella labor union that represented labor in the trilateral talks, said Tuesday it has decided to break the trilateral deal on labor reform, accusing the government of unilaterally releasing reform measures.The union also said it will not participate in future talks with management and the government to address major labor issues.","government sources said thursday public ,government of unilaterally releasing reform ,encourage competition among public servants ,thursday public companies and government ,government to address major labor",['the Federation of Korean Trade Unions'],2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32791543  0.4515515

FKTU chairman Kim Dong-man speaks at a news conference on Tuesday. Yonhap“The government and the ruling party have trampled on the Sept. 15 trilateral agreement, making it null,” FKTU chairman Kim Dong-man said in a press conference.“We will henceforth renounce all efforts of negotiation and boycott the tripartite committee meeting.”With the FKTU’s declaration, the confrontation surrounding the labor-related bills is expected to escalate as the presidential office and the ruling party brace for an all-out war against the labor unions and the opposition camp.The Sept. 15 deal, or the “grand compromise,” refers to the trilateral deal signed last year by the labor, management and government representatives to come up with long-term measures to improve the nation’s labor market. They include allowing companies to change employment guidelines and adopting a “peak wage” system upon further consultation. Despite the epochal agreement, follow-up consultations have not run smoothly, with the labor side delaying discussion and the government unilaterally releasing measures.The union chairman pledged to file an injunction or an unconstitutionality suit against the government’s labor guidelines and to conduct campaigns against ruling party candidates in the upcoming April parliamentary elections.The union will thus join the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, a more progressive labor organization which has all along been protesting against the disputed labor bills.“The FKTU, by announcing its withdrawal from the trilateral deal, has declared to fight back the government’s retrogressive labor policies,” said KCTU spokesperson Park Seong-sik.“It seems that the two unions may possibly join forces and form a solidarity.”At the face of the disintegration of the three-way agreement, President Park Geun-hye reiterated her calls for the passage of the controversial labor bills.“Companies, whether conglomerates or small and medium-sized enterprises, have repeatedly appealed for the passage of the pending bills, but the National Assembly has neglected their needs,” Park said at the Cabinet meeting.She thereby urged the nation to participate in a petition campaign led by economic organizations, which she referred to as a last resort to save the economy and boost employment.“Would these businessmen and people have rushed out to the streets on this severe winter day  if not for these pressing situations?”The president joined the petition campaign Monday after receiving the annual business reports and before delivering her New Year’s greeting to the Korea Federation of SMEs. The Minjoo Party of Korea denounced the president for detouring due legislative procedure and siding with the conglomerates by joining their initiative.“The president is entitled to extensive legal power, yet Park decided to sign a petition instead of communicating and debating the issue,” said the main opposition party’s policy committee chief Rep. Rhee Mok-hee.“We hope that such a bewildering situation will not happen again during Park’s remaining two years in office.”The ruling Saenuri Party echoed the president’s comments.“The petition would never have been necessary if the National Assembly performed its role in the first place,” floor leader Rep. Won Yoo-chul told reporters Tuesday.“Our party, too, is to be held responsible just as much as the opposition party.”The presidential office shrugged off the opposition camp’s criticism.“Signing the petition was a gesture of participating in the people’s initiative, not an act of disregard toward the legislature,” Cheong Wa Dae spokesperson Jeong Yeon-guk told reporters.Meanwhile, the government, the presidential house and the ruling party agreed Tuesday to make utmost efforts to pass the pending labor bills through parliament within January.“The opposition camp is deterring key economic and labor reform bills by adding unessential requests,” said Saenuri floor leader Won at the policy adjustment meeting held at the prime minister’s office.By Bae Hyun-jung","korean trade unions said tuesday ,president for detouring due legislative ,korea denounced the president for ,denounced the president for detouring ,tuesday declared its withdrawal from","['the Federation of Korean Trade Unions', 'Kim Dong - man', 'Kim Dong - man', 'the korean Confederation of Trade Unions', 'KCTU', 'Park Seong - sik', 'Park Geun', 'the National Assembly', 'Park', 'Cabinet', 'the Korea Federation', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Rhee Mok - hee', 'Saenuri Party', 'the National Assembly', 'Won Yoo', 'Jeong Yeon - guk', 'Saenuri', 'Won', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.58276981  0.31743386

Moon Jae-in.Kim Min-young, former secretary-general of liberal civic group People’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, and Oh Sung-kyu, former director of Seoul Facilities Management Corporation, both worked in Park’s camp in the 2011 by-election.  Yang Hyang-jaThe entrance of the two Park allies alluded to a mutual understanding between party chief Moon and the Seoul Mayor that the opposition camp should stand united ahead of the April parliamentary elections. Kim Min-young and Oh Sung-kyu“I hope that more good-hearted people join the party to lead reform from the inside,” Kim quoted the Seoul mayor as having said, when he conveyed in advance his upcoming party entry.So far, the Minjoo Party’s attempts to turn the game around by reshuffling have personnel has largely gained positive responses.Forensic psychologist and political debater Pyo Chang-won was the first to come to the party's rescue. The crime expert immediately caught the public’s attention with righteous image and shrewd arguments, especially over disputed issues such as the government's much-critisized deal with Japan on wartime sex slavery. Pyo Chang-wonSelf-made business figures such as video game company Webzen chairman Kim Byung-kwan and former Samsung Electronics executive Yang Hyang-ja fit in with the party’s policy to create employment opportunities. These compatible new figures not only contributed to expanding the party’s human resource pool but also brought compliments upon party chairman Moon for his good judgment and swift action.A survey by local pollster Realmeter showed Monday that the approval rating for the Minjoo Party stood at 22.5 percent in the second week of January, up 2.2 percent from the previous week.With the party’s polls on a rebounding trend, Moon is said to announce his resignation within the week, as early as Tuesday, and to hand over all power to the election committee led by economic strategist Kim Jong-in.Ahn's camp, in contrast, has remained low key over recruitment after a series of moral controversies. The People’s Party had recently announced that it will recruit five new figures including a former senior prosecutor but called off the decision within hours due to allegations that some of them were invovled in bribery charges. “We will in the future focus on thorough verification, instead of rushing into decisions,” Ahn said in apology.But as the newborn party is also pressed to mark its presence before the elections, it is also working to induce big shot figures -- such as the Minjoo Party’s former floor leader and emergency committee chief Rep. Park Young-sun.By Bae Hyun-jung","party rescue the crime expert ,seoul mayor that the opposition ,monday two civic activists who ,close aides to seoul mayor ,party polls on rebounding trend","['Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Kim Min - young', 'People ’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy', 'oh Sung - kyu', 'Seoul Facilities Management Corporation', 'Park ’s', 'Yang Hyang -', 'Park', 'Moon', 'Kim Min - young', 'oh Sung - kyu“I', 'Kim', 'Seoul', 'the Minjoo Party ’s', 'Pyo Chang - won', 'Japan', 'Pyo Chang - wonself', 'Webzen', 'Kim Byung - kwan', 'Samsung Electronics', 'Yang Hyang -', 'Moon', 'Realmeter', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Moon', 'Kim Jong - in', 'ahn', 'the People ’s Party', 'the Minjoo Party ’s', 'Park Young', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60200804  0.46699485

Chung Sye-kyun and Noh Woong-rae, respectively.    Ahn Dae-hee “I stand here, reminding myself of how I felt as a young middle school student from Busan who had just moved to Seoul,” Ahn said at a press briefing. “Mapo was the stepping-stone for my life and will now be the new beginning for me.” Having considered running in his hometown Busan, Ahn decided to run from Mapo being persuaded by party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung. The former prime minister-designate noted Mapo was a “special place” as he attended middle school there. Oh, on the other hand, said he decided to stick to his original plan of running in Jongno with sturdy conservative votes, despite chairman Kim’s repeated offer for him to run in a constituency unpopular among conservative voters to compete with liberal bigwigs such as former main opposition leader Rep. Kim Han-gil.  Oh Se-hoon “When I returned to politics in April, I set up three principles -- contributing to the party’s election victory, refusing to seek an easy win and running for a significant place. I think Jongno is the place that best serves my principles,” said the former mayor in a press conference.Ahn’s potential rival Chung is a veteran fifth-term lawmaker and had served as chairman of the Minjoo Party’s forerunner Uri Party. Oh's prospective contender Noh is the second-term lawmaker and incumbent representative of his constituency.The election bids, meanwhile, caused a backlash from other prospective candidates Park Jin and Kang Seung-kyu, the former lawmakers who had previously been elected from Jongno and Mapo, respectively. Park and Kang are expected to challenge the two bigwigs during the in-house nomination contest. Kang’s supporters attended Ahn’s press conference, shouting protests against his decision. Kang also held his own press briefing, accusing Ahn of choosing the easy way out by running on his turf and demanding the party leadership hold a strict internal primary to pick the candidate. Park, who has been elected from Jongno three times, dismissed the former mayor’s bid as a scheme to reinforce his status as a presidential hopeful and denounced Oh for making zero contribution to the constituents. Mindful of escalating tit-for-tat among the party’s election candidates, the party leader Kim reiterated his rule on the nomination. He promised to forgo his authority to nominate the election candidates and allow voters themselves to determine the candidates.“I respect each candidate’s decision. The Saenuri Party will nominate candidates for the elections in accordance with the nomination rule and a fair and transparent competition among candidates,” said Kim in a text message sent to reporters.By Yeo Jun-suk","two political heavyweights sunday announced ,party two political heavyweights sunday ,political heavyweights sunday announced their ,two political heavyweights sunday ,political heavyweights sunday announced","['Saenuri Party ’s', 'Supreme Court', 'Ahn Dae - hee', 'Seoul', 'Se - hoon', 'Seoul', 'Jongno', 'mapo', 'Minjoo Party', 'Chung sye - kyun', 'Noh Woong - rae', 'Busan', 'Seoul', 'Mapo', 'Mapo', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Mapo', 'Jongno', 'Kim ’s', 'Kim Han - gil', 'Se - hoon', 'Jongno', 'ahn ’s', 'Chung', 'the Minjoo Party ’s', 'Uri Party', 'Kang Seung - kyu', 'Jongno', 'Mapo', 'Kang', 'Kang ’s', 'Ahn ’s', 'Kang', 'Kim', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Kim', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.73695606  0.58838588

Moon Jae-in Moon and Ahn failed to work out differences over how to reform their party, which led to Ahn’s departure.Moon has since changed the name of the main opposition party to the Minjoo Party of Korea in an apparent move to improve its image before the general elections in April.Ahn, who is seeking to create a new political party, is trailing behind by receiving 13 percent of support in the poll while Kim Moo-sung, head of the ruling Saenuri Party, received 12 percent of support.The survey was conducted on 1,005 adults between Tuesday and Thursday and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.","party in potential presidential race ,poll since may last year ,front runner in poll since ,moon is recruiting new figures ,friday poll released by polling","['Gallup Korea', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Minjoo Party', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Ahn Cheol', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Moon', 'Ahn ’s', 'Moon', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Saenuri Party']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.75775915  0.42579833

Kim Jong-in The entry of the distinguished public figure was also seen to indicate the party’s resolve to rise above the recent chain defections of senior party members and the growing competition with Ahn Cheol-soo’s new political party.“The party that will gain people’s support in the upcoming general elections is one that can solve inequality and realize economic democratization,” said Kim Jong-in, announcing his acceptance to take the party’s election committee chairman post.“People are already well aware of the harmful consequences of vague growth visions and irresponsible pump-priming policies.”Kim, chair-professor of economics at Konkuk University and former four-term lawmaker, is best known for designing “economic democratization,” a policy aimed at lessening the wide gap among different economic classes.The term was adopted as the top slogan by then-candidate Park Geun-hye, who struggled to build an image of reform and win over swing votes ahead of the 2012 presidential election.However, soon after taking office Park switched her economic keyword to “creative economy” and reduced the progressive tone from her policies. This led to conflicts between Kim and the leadership which ended with him leaving the party in late 2013.Kim had also led the enactment of Article 119 Clause 2 of the Constitutional Law in 1987, which obligates the state to maintain a balanced economic growth and to prevent the abuse of economic power.“The top priority for our nation is to resolve one of the world’s worst income inequality and Kim, a symbol of economic democratization, will play a crucial role in following such a goal,” said party leader Moon Jae-in on Thursday.Though the Park administration has given up on the idea, the concept of economic democratization should be carried forward, Moon claimed.By underlining this relatively progressive economic vision once again, the Minjoo Party posed a clear challenge against the conservative camp. The ruling Saenuri Party and Cheong Wa Dae have been pushing ahead with a set of labor bills, which the Minjoo Party denounced as “aggravating the current employment inequality.”The move also suggests that the main opposition party wishes to follow a progressive policy line, separating itself from the People’s Party, a forthcoming centrist party led by independent Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo.The ruling camp was taken by surprise but feigned indifference.“Having lost some half of its members, the opposition party should be in a rush to bring in outside figures by any means but we have no such need,” party chief Rep. Kim Moo-sung told reporters on Friday.Party spokesperson Rep. Shin Eui-jin also issued a statement, accusing Kim of political inconsistency and the Minjoo Party of playing shallow political games ahead of elections.Vice floor leader Rep. Cho Won-jin argued that the Minjoo Party has no say in economic policies as it has been holding back the pending reform and economic bills at the National Assembly.Meanwhile, the arrival of the former Park aide received varied responses from within the Minjoo camp as well.Back in 2014, then-floor leader and emergency council chief Rep. Park Young-sun attempted to recruit Chung-Ang University professor Lee Sang-don as economic strategist but was faced with a backlash due to Lee’s former affiliation with the Saenuri Party.Even for those who see no objection to Kim’s title as the Minjoo election campaign chief, his scope of authority is still uncertain.“I have consented on the precondition that I will be the sole and only head of the election committee,” Kim said.His comments seemingly contradicted party leader Moon’s earlier statement that a cochairmanship is under consideration. Moon later added that the issue is Kim’s decision to make.By Bae Hyun-jung","keyword economic democratization kim jong ,political games ahead of elections ,friday party spokesperson rep shin ,top policy keyword economic democratization ,economic strategist as its election","['Park Geun', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Kim Jong - in', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Kim Jong - in', 'Konkuk University', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Moon', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Saenuri Party', 'Cheong', 'the Minjoo Party', 'the People ’s Party', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Shin Eui - jin', 'Kim', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Cho Won - jin', 'the Minjoo Party', 'the National Assembly', 'Park', 'Minjoo', 'Park Young', 'Chung - Ang University', 'Lee Sang - don', 'Lee', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Kim', 'Minjoo', 'Kim', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Kim', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55597919  0.63980162

It was anticipated that Obama would touch on Pyongyang’s fourth nuclear test, given that his speech was delivered just a week after the surprise test and when the U.S. and its allies are pushing to adopt a U.N. Security Council resolution entailing tougher and “meaningful” sanctions.Rhodes still called North Korea-related issues a “top priority” to the U.S. president. But he stressed that “strength should not be defined by provocations.”“The way in which you show strength in the world should not be defined by the occasional provocative launch or test of a device while your own people are starving. We don’t seek to elevate him, personally. So, that was our thinking in that regard,” he said.He also underscored the need for the U.S. to strengthen missile defense in close coordination with the South and Japan to better cope with the evolving nuclear and missile threats from the unpredictable regime.Following Pyongyang’s latest nuclear test, the U.S. was expected to step up efforts to persuade Seoul to beef up missile defense by installing the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system in the South.President Park Geun-hye said during her New Year’s press conference that Seoul would review the possibility of the THAAD deployment here based strictly on national security interests. Her remarks were interpreted as her raising pressure on Beijing to exert more influence to stop the growth of Pyongyang’s nuclear program.By Song Sang-ho","president barack obama intentionally avoided ,barack obama intentionally avoided mentioning ,obama intentionally avoided mentioning north ,barack obama intentionally avoided ,obama intentionally avoided mentioning","['U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'North Korea', 'Washington', 'North Korea', 'the State of the Union', 'Ben Rhodes', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'Congress', 'Capitol Hill', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'U.S.', 'U.N.

The Defense Acquisition Program Administration, the country’s weapons procurement agency, picked Uconsystem in 2013 as the provider of small drones for a project to boost reconnaissance and preemptive strike capabilities of the Army and Marine Corps. The accident took place on Dec. 7-9 at five frontline divisions during a test aimed at improving the operators’ skills, inflicting damages on the drones’ wings and propellers, the officials said. Uconsystem's Remoeye Produced in September last year, the UAVs dubbed “Remoeye” were initially stationed at some frontline battalions two months later and scheduled to be gradually deployed in other areas by 2018. The devices, measuring 1.4 meters by 1.8 meters and weighing 3.6 kilograms, can fly as fast as 80 kilometers per hour. Operators should fly them by hand and then use the remote control, and landing takes place as a built-in air bag explodes and absorbs the shock on impact. The series of accidents spurned concerns that it may hamper the scheduled deployment. After an investigation, DAPA, the Defense Agency for Technology and Quality, and the Army have concluded that the main cause of the crash of five units was the soldiers’ inexperience and the other a defect in the equipment.“We’ve suspended the use of the drones and are trying to come up with measures to prevent another accident,” a military official said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issueBy Shin Hyon-hee","test last month raising concerns ,drones for project to boost ,deployment military officials said thursday ,crashed while landing during an ,operational test last month raising","['south korean Army', 'the Defense Acquisition Program Administration', 'Uconsystem', 'Army', 'Marine Corps', ""Uconsystem 's remoeye produce"", 'uav', 'DAPA', 'the Defense Agency for Technology', 'Army', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42178246  0.42402592

While seated, her job consists of taking phone calls and writing reports at the same time.

While seated, her job consists of taking phone calls and writing reports at the same time. About six months ago, Han worked in a different division which required her to stand most of the time greeting clients.“I don’t know which is better -- sitting too much or standing too much,” the 28-year-old told The Korea Herald. “But ever since I moved to my current division, I’ve been experiencing frequent indigestion and bloating. And I’ve also been gaining weight, especially around my belly.”Han’s experience reflects what’s been released in the nation’s latest government data Monday, which claimed Koreans spend too much time sitting down while making little efforts to exercise at the same time.  A single Korean person spends 7.5 hours each day sitting, according to statistics released by the Health and Welfare Ministry and the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.This, according to a 2009 study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, causes harmful health effects that even a 30-minute workout can’t counteract. However, the report showed that only 41.3 percent of Koreans walked more than 30 minutes a day at least five days weekly. Much research has linked sitting for long periods of time to a number of health concerns, including metabolic syndrome, excess body fat around the waist, obesity and abnormal cholesterol levels. It is also known to increase one’s risk of developing an inflexible spine, muscle degeneration and even heart disease and colon cancer.The report showed that Koreans who live in the cities, who are high-income earners and those in their 20s spent the most hours sitting down. Those aged 19-29 spent 8.7 hours each day sitting, while those in their 30s spent 7.6 hours daily, and those in their 60s spent 7.1 hours. Also, those in cities spent 7.7 hours each day sitting, whereas those in the country spent 6.8 hours sitting daily. In terms of income levels, those who belonged to the wealthiest 25 percent spent the longest -- 7.9 hours -- sitting each day, while those who belonged to the poorest 25 percent spent the least time -- 7.1 hours -- sitting daily.Meanwhile, a single Korean person on average slept 6.8 hours a night as of 2014, among the lowest of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations. South Korea is notorious for long work hours. In 2014, South Koreans worked the second-longest hours among the OECD nations, -- a total of 2,124 hours, according to OECD data. It was 354 hours more than the OECD average, which was 1,770 hours. Along with sitting too long, sleep deprivation is also linked to many health concerns, including obesity. Those who are consistently sleep deprived -- getting less than seven to eight hours a night -- are known to have a higher risk for depression, Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and obesity. As of 2014, 31.5 percent of all adult Koreans were obese, according to the government report.

Ahn Cheol-soo announced Friday that his new party would be named People’s Party , as preparations for the launch gained momentum.Earlier in the day, two cochairmen for the preparatory committee were named. Yoon Yeo-joon, a former health minister and senior conservative lawmaker, became the latest to join Ahn’s faction after accepting his request to head the preparation committee for a new opposition party to be launched early next month. Yoon, who has held various roles in both conservative and progressive parties for the past years, had refused to accept Ahn’s offer repeatedly citing his frail health, but finally accepted due to Ahn’s persistence, Ahn’s aide told reporters.  Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo , professor Han Sang-jin and Rep. Kim Han-gil attend a meeting in Seoul on Friday. YonhapYoon will cochair the preparation committee, which will be officially launched Sunday, with Han Sang-jin, professor emeritus at Seoul National University. The left-wing scholar reportedly accepted Ahn’s offer on Thursday over lunch. Earlier in the day, Ahn and other former members of the main opposition party including Rep. Kim Han-gil, Moon Byung-ho, Kim Dong-chul and Hwang Joo-hong gathered in central Seoul for their first meeting since leaving the party, to discuss their plans. Recruitment of new faces also continued as Ahn stepped up work to establish a third political party with floor negotiating power by next month. “The biggest problem facing Korea is that the nation’s top talents are not in the position to solve the nation’s crisis. I will try to change the current structure in which respectable figures are missing opportunities to serve the public in the face of the existing political force,” Ahn said in the meeting. Han, a cochair of the committee, also said that the most crucial task is to bring an era of cooperation and reconciliation in the society riddled with political strife and hostility.With Ahn’s camp picking up the pace, the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea was scrambling to contain the fallout following a series of defections by its lawmakers. Since Ahn left the Minjoo on Dec. 13, 10 other lawmakers including party cofounder Rep. Kim Han-gil have followed suit, reducing its number of parliamentary seats to 117 in a 300-member Assembly. The latest to join Ahn’s faction was Rep. Kim Young-hwan. “The Minjoo Party has lost its hope of change of the government for too long. I am leaving the party in accordance with my conscience,” he said Friday.In a survey by pollster Gallup of 1,021 adults nationwide on Jan. 5-7, the Ahn’s new party in-the-making took lead in the opposition bloc. It received a 21 percent approval rating, ahead of the Minjoo Party’s 19 percent. The ruling Saenuri party scored 35 percent, a drop of 4 percentage points.","friday that his new party ,announced friday that his new ,meeting in seoul on friday ,friday in survey by pollster ,dec 13 10 other lawmakers","['Ahn Cheol', 'People ’s Party', 'Yoon Yeo - joon', 'Ahn ’s', 'Yoon', 'Ahn ’s', 'Ahn ’s', 'Ahn ’s', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Han Sang - jin', 'Kim Han - gil', 'Seoul', 'YonhapYoon', 'Han Sang - jin', 'Seoul National University', 'Ahn ’s', 'Ahn', 'Kim Han - gil', 'Moon Byung - ho', 'Kim Dong - chul', 'Hwang Joo - hong', 'Seoul', 'Ahn', 'Korea', 'Han', 'Ahn ’s', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Ahn', 'Minjoo', 'Kim Han - gil', 'Assembly', 'Ahn ’s', 'Kim Young - hwan', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Gallup', 'the Minjoo Party ’s', 'Saenuri']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67557079  0.57605892

I absolve you, all,” uttered Antonio Salieri in the 1984 film “Amadeus,” loosely based on the real life of the Italian classical composer and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.As Mozart’s less-capable archrival, the movie version of Salieri was forced to shudder in jealousy, marvel with wonder, and bear witness to the immortal genius of a man many consider to be one of the greatest musical talents of all time. Throughout history, tales of those with exceptional capacity of intellect and ability have sparked the awe of the general public, if not as fatal.In Korea, a country famous for its education fever, such longing for God-given talent is usually manifested in the form of education. Since 2000, the government had been promoting “the education for the gifted” in a bid to maximize the potential of child prodigies who demonstrate extraordinary abilities. There are currently over 2,500 classes for the gifted, with some 110,000 students receiving specialized educations.Standout youngsters have been labeled “prodigy” and became darlings of the media; Kim Ung-yong in the 1960s grabbed nationwide fame after solving differential equations on a Japanese TV show, and such fever was repeated decades later in the 2000s when science wiz teen Song Yoo-geun had emerged.The flip side to such adoration, however, is the pressure and even contempt for their failure to meet sky-high expectations of the public. When Kim returned to Korea with no visible accomplishments and entered a local college as a 21-year-old, the general public and the media were quick to label him a “failure.”Song got the short end of the stick of media attention when his was embroiled recently in a highly publicized plagiarism scandal. He has also said that being touted as a child genius was “lonely,” being singled out from everyone else.Experts have pointed out that heavy competition based on students’ academic achievement may be responsible for the “fall” of geniuses.Lee Sang-kyu, a psychiatrist from Hallym University Medical Center, pointed out that Korean society tends to only label students who excel in schoolwork as gifted.Parents tend to think that their children doing well in school is a task that affects the entire family. They say, ‘why can’t my child be a prodigy?’” said Lee, an expert in depression, child and adolescence issues. “A gifted individual is one in thousands, which means not all children are gifted. But in Korea, if you’re not a standout, you are a loser.”“Not all geniuses are perfect in every way. The problem is that some parents are trying to ‘create’ geniuses that do well in everything, when even the academic circles are uncertain of what defines a genius,” he said. A recent revelation by Song, who urged people not to praise him based on talent alone, demonstrates how being labeled “a genius” may be both a blessing and a curse.“People call me ‘a boy prodigy’ and it’s been somewhat of a pressure.

723,723,Korean Gender Minister nominee blasted for views on sex slavery deal,South Korea's Gender Equality Minister nominee Kang Eun-hee was lambasted by opposition lawmakers for her views on the recent ROK-Japan sex slavery settlement during her confirmation hearing at the National Assembly on Thursday.　The former IT businesswoman and Saenuri Party lawmaker described the settlement between the two nations as “an outcome that came out as a result of South Korean government’s utmost efforts...,"South Korea's Gender Equality Minister nominee Kang Eun-hee was lambasted by opposition lawmakers for her views on the recent ROK-Japan sex slavery settlement during her confirmation hearing at the National Assembly on Thursday.The former IT businesswoman and Saenuri Party lawmaker described the settlement between the two nations as “an outcome that came out as a result of South Korean government’s utmost efforts” during the session. The agreement has been criticized for not clearly admitting Tokyo’s legal responsibility for the institutionalized sex slavery of women during World War II.  Gender Minister nominee Kang Eun-hee speaks during her confirmation hearing at the National Assembly in Seoul on Thursday. Yonhap“I understand that not everyone may be satisfied with the settlement,” she said, when she was asked by Rep. Nam In-soon of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea if she agreed with the government that women’s rights in Korea took a “major step forward” with the settlement.“Considering that Tokyo admitted the military’s involvement in the slavery, and that Japan offered its state funds for the establishment of a foundation to support victims, I think the settlement is a great step forward.”Earlier this week, the main opposition party demanded the Seoul government to renegotiate last month’s agreement with Tokyo, criticizing the Park administration for not discussing the matter with the victims before finalizing the deal. During the session, Kang said it was also important to “understand Japan’s position in the situation,” and that President Park Geun-hye has accomplished something “very brave” through the settlement. Kang also described the agreement as something that could not have been achieved by any previous South Korean government.To this, Rep. Lim Su-kyung said Kang’s views on the settlement prove that she has failed to empathize with the victims. “If the Gender Equality Minister cannot empathize with the victims of sex slavery and their pain, what can she really do for any women in this country?” she said.Kang has also supported Park’s controversial plan to replace middle and high school history textbooks with a single state-authored option in 2017. She has been serving on the Saenuri Party’s special committee to implement the textbook reform. During the confirmation hearing, Kang was asked by Rep. Nam In-soon if she planned to describe the recent settlement as an achievement that took a major step forward for justice and human rights. “I will have to see if Tokyo properly follows through on its promises,” Kang said.A graduate of Kyungpook University’s physical education program, Kang worked as a school teacher before founding her IT venture, Winitech, in Daegu in the late 1990s. She served as the CEO of the company for more than 10 years, and is currently the company’s biggest shareholder. Opposition lawmakers asked Kang to submit documents showing the company’s performance on gender equality, such as how many women workers had been hired and how many had been granted paternity or maternity leave. However, Kang had refused to submit the documents until Thursday morning, claiming they were confidential. She agreed to give the requested information during the morning session of the hearing, when lawmakers called her irresponsible for not cooperating with their requests. Meanwhile, Lee Joon-sik, who has been nominated as Education Minister and Deputy Prime Minister for Social Affairs, also attended a confirmation hearing on Thursday. Lee, a former professor at Seoul National University’s School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, also said the recent settlement on sex slavery was an “outcome that came out as a result of the South Korean government’s utmost efforts.” The former professor also said he thinks positively of the state history textbooks written during late President Park Chung-hee’s military regime, claiming the books “successfully combined research findings by historians and nationalistic values and perspectives.”During the session it was revealed that his second daughter, a former dual U.S.-South Korean citizen born in California in 1985, borrowed interest-free loans from Korean government entities for her university tuition even after giving up her Korean citizenship in 2007. Lee apologized during the hearing and explained that, as a dual citizen, his daughter automatically lost her Korean citizenship when she became 22. He said his daughter was willing to give up her U.S. citizenship and retrieve her Korean one.He was also asked about how her daughter, who was only 29 years old last year, purchased an apartment in Seoul that cost about 1 billion won , when she had only worked as a resident at a general hospital for a few years. Lee was accused of purchasing the property under his daughter’s name as a gift and evading gift tax in doing so. The nominee denied the accusations, claiming that both his daughter and her husband, who are both currently based in Hong Kong, have been employed as a physician and a banker for quite a while.

Less than a week later, the situation has reversed. Pyongyang declared it successfully carried out a hydrogen bomb test Wednesday, catching everyone off guard ― not just Seoul and Washington, but also Beijing, the communist country’s top political and economic patron. The fourth test marks the latest in a series of dogmatic and perplexing behavior by the young leader. Kim Jong-un. YonhapThe state media said the decision was made by Kim, who signed the order on Dec. 15, shortly after the Moranbong Band canceled a much-hyped sold-out concert in Beijing at the last minute without giving a reason, sparking international criticism and extensive rumors.Military officials here have said the North is ready to conduct nuclear tests at any time once it takes such a “political choice,” and related evidence can be detected up to one month ahead. But this time, there were no imminent signs of a test ― such as setting up a measuring device and screen fence or refilling the tunnel ― indicating the preparations were made in a highly clandestine manner. Covert preparations aside, the timing was unusual, defying the longstanding pattern of a long-range missile test leading to international sanctions followed by a new atomic test. Pyongyang’s provocations are chiefly aimed at nuclear talks with the U.S., and have in the past come at times of leadership transition or major political events. This time, however, it did not have much incentive, given that the Barack Obama administration has displayed little, if any, willingness to forsake its “strategic patience” approach and return to disarmament-for-aid negotiations, and the presidential election isn’t scheduled until November. On the cross-border front, the latest test will inevitably complicate Seoul’s calculations over Pyongyang’s demand for a restart of stalled tours to a North Korean mountain resort and lifting of bans on bilateral exchanges. With Kim’s birthday falling on Friday, the test could have been designed to elevate the occasion as a new major anniversary alongside those of his deceased father and grandfather, while consolidating the ruler’s legacy ahead of the ruling Workers’ Party’s first congress in 36 years slated for May, some observers say. They also called for the Park Geun-hye administration to refine its North Korea approach instead of shifting all the blame to the unpredictable leader, citing Kim’s claim last month of having developed a hydrogen bomb, which Seoul dismissed as a “rhetoric.” “Though Kim is mocked globally, I’m not sure if he is controlling the entire situation under a thoroughly crafted scenario, and when everyone undermines his remarks as a bluff, he strikes back with a surprising provocation contrary to widespread expectations,” a Seoul official said on customary condition of anonymity.

The size, type and location of outdoor ads had been strictly restricted prior. The revised rules have been promulgated Wednesday and will start going into effect from July, the officials said.In the ad zone, buildings will be able to be covered in wrapping ads or digital screens. The eased rules will also allow digital signage -- a new ad form that allows interaction between ads and viewers through digital technology. For example, one of the Times Square ads in New York had a perfume commercial on billboards that sprayed the perfume whenever pedestrians approached and touched the screen. While the digital technology for ads has developed for years, no digital signage has been introduced in Seoul due mainly to regulations. Pillar-shape video billboards called “Medial Poll” were once installed around Gangnam Station in 2009, but it was allowed as a type of “video installment,” not as an “outdoor digital ad.” The exact locations for the upcoming ad zone have not yet been determined. The ministry will receive applications from municipalities and screen them in the second half of the year. “Considering the light pollution, the new ad zones will likely be opened in commercial districts such as Myeong-dong or the Coex area,” the Seoul Metropolitan Government officials said. While easing billboard regulations, the government has strengthened the crackdown on illegal ads, the authorities said. Any illegal ads, such as placards or balloons placed without permission and that pose a risk of dislocating or dropping, will be removed without prior notice. Each district office will be given the authority to be in charge of the crackdown.The penalty against obscene ads will also be toughened to a sentence of two years in prison or fine of up to 20 million won . Those distributing or posting lewd ads had previously faced either a one-year jail term or a fine up to 1 million won.By Lee Hyun-jeong","this week lifted ad regulations ,ad regulations to create korean ,week lifted ad regulations ,easing billboard regulations the government ,light pollution the new ad","['korean', 'New York City ’s', 'the Interior Ministry', 'New York', 'Seoul', 'Gangnam Station', 'Myeong - dong', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.01302528  0.68426359

The Obama administration's stance on Russia, Syria, and especially Iran have sent a clear message to dictators and despots around theworld: if you act badly enough, for long enough, this administration will reward your behavior,"" Gardner said in a statement.The senator also said that the testing of a hydrogen bomb would serve as a reminder of the danger posed to the world by ""this often-forgotten maniac who leads a government that grips to power by fear, intimidation, and murder,"" he said.Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump said the North's nuclear program should be shut down before it's too late.""You have this mad man over there who probably would use it and nobody talks to him, other than, of course, Dennis Rodman talked to him.

Unless China cooperates, the U.S. should make trade very difficult with China, Trump said.Republican presidential hopeful and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina also slammed the U.S. policy on the North as failure.""Of course North Korea would conduct a nuclear test after watching Iran willfully violate an agreement they just made without consequence of any kind from this administration,"" she said in a Facebook message.

And we have major problems, because you have other people that would be very fast on that. You look at North Korea, you look at some of these countries, I don't think they would hesitate to use it if they really had it in a proper manner,"" Trump said on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday.Trump has repeatedly called North Korean leader Kim Jong-un a ""madman"" with nuclear bombs, accusing the administration of President Barack Obama of ignoring the North Korean nuclear issue and not even talking about the issue. Trump said that using nuclear weapons should remain ""an absolute last stance.""""We have to be somewhat unpredictable in this whole thing.Nuclear, though, has to be absolute last stance. Don't forget, I was against the war in Iraq. I'm not a fast trigger,"" he said Sunday. ""You have guys that you would think are very low-key. They would be faster than me. I would be a very slow trigger with nuclear.""North Korea has conducted three underground nuclear tests so far, in 2006, 2009 and 2013. The country has also conducted a series of long-range missile or rocket launches since 1998. In its most recent launch in late 2012, the North succeeded in putting a satellite into orbit.Analysts have warned that it is only a matter of time until the North develops nuclear-tipped missiles. Some experts have recently warned that the communist nation's nuclear arsenal could expand to as many as 100 bombs by 2020.The six-party talks aimed at resolving the North Korean standoff have been stalled since late 2008. North Korea demands the unconditional resumption of negotiations, while the U.S. says that Pyongyang must first take concrete steps demonstrating its denuclearization commitments.","madman with nuclear bombs accusing ,presidential front runner donald trump ,nuclear bombs accusing the administration ,weapons nuclear is major problem ,madman with nuclear bombs","['republican', 'Donald Trump', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'trump', 'CBS', 'trump', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Barack Obama', 'north korean', 'Trump', 'Iraq', 'Korea', 'north korean', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'Pyongyang']",12,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.20498824  1.1064142

730,730,Ahn vows to move forward as 3rd political force,"Independent Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo reiterated Monday that his new party proposed to be launched next month would distance itself from the main opposition party, vowing to transform the decades-old two-party political system into a multiparty system.“It is an outdated mentality that the opposition must align to do well in the general elections.

Ahn Cheol-soo reiterated Monday that his new party proposed to be launched next month would distance itself from the main opposition party, vowing to transform the decades-old two-party political system into a multiparty system.“It is an outdated mentality that the opposition must align to do well in the general elections. It seems to suggest that we should maintain the vested interests of the main two parties,” Ahn said in a radio interview with local station CBS. “We must prepare to fight squarely in a three-way format.” Ahn Cheon-sooHis remarks echoed that of former cochairman and latest Minjoo Party of Korea defector Rep. Kim Han-gil, who said Sunday, “We must tear down the hostile yet symbiotic relationship between the two parties, a political system that has run its course.”Kim is the ninth former Minjoo Party lawmaker to bolt, and he is widely expected to be followed by at least 10 more, including the party’s veteran Rep. Park Jie-won sometime this week.If at least 20 Assembly members join under Ahn before the party’s slated launch Feb. 2, the party will gain floor negotiation power ― legally wedging the party into the bipartisan landscape occupied by the conservative and progressive forces originating from Gyeongsang Province and Jeolla Province.This of course, is premised on the assumption that Ahn’s party will succeed in maintaining the momentum, given that in Korea’s modern political history a third force has often became an auxiliary force of the major party with a limited support base.One of the imminent challenges is approaching in the parliamentary race, where the new party must cast its lineup of candidates ― a process that has often been the pitfall of factional competition.Ahn’s provisional party, meanwhile, received mixed approval ratings in polls released Monday.A survey by pollster Realmeter of 2,135 adults nationwide on Dec. 28-31 showed that 23.6 percent were in support of the Minjoo Party, 1.2 percentage points higher than the week before. Ahn’s party received 17.3 percent, marking a decline of 1.7 percentage points. The ruling Saenuri Party scored 35.2 percent, a drop of 2 percentage points.“The so-called ‘convention effect’ that persisted for about two weeks after Ahn’s defection is slowing down. ... It also appears to reflect a lower level of attention paid toward  due to the newly created conflict between the ruling and opposition parties following the government’s Dec. 28 deal with Japan over sexual slavery,” Realmeter said in its report.The ratings for Ahn’s party are still likely to rebound when more Minjoo Party lawmakers leave this week, it said.Of the potential presidential candidates, Minjoo Party’s chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in has maintained the top spot for two consecutive weeks at 19.6 percent, followed by Saenuri leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung with 18.6 percent. Ahn came in at third with 15.2 percent. Others included Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon , former Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon  and former Saenuri floor leader Rep. Yoo Seung-min .In another survey conducted by Hankook Research on 1,000 voters nationwide on Dec. 28-29, 15.1 percent said they would vote for candidates coming from Ahn’s party in the April election, more than those who picked the Minjoo Party at 12.4 percent. Another 23.4 percent said they would vote for a Saenuri Party candidate.The Saenuri Party seized the top spots in all regions except for the Jeolla provinces, as well as among those aged 50 and over.The Minjoo Party came in after both the Saenuri Party and Ahn’s new party in all categories except for among those in their 20s and those that identified as progressives.In the survey, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was the most popular presidential candidate with 21.9 percent, followed by Moon Jae-in , Kim Moo-sung , Ahn Cheol-soo  and Park Won-soon .From news reports","released monday survey by pollster ,party lawmakers leave this week ,monday that his new party ,polls released monday survey by ,polls released monday survey","['Ahn Cheol', 'CBS', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Kim Han - gil', 'Minjoo Party', 'Park Jie - win', 'Assembly', 'Ahn', 'Gyeongsang Province', 'Jeolla Province', 'Ahn ’s', 'Korea', 'ahn ’s', 'the Minjoo Party', 'ahn ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'Ahn ’s', 'Japan', 'Ahn ’s', 'Minjoo Party', 'Minjoo Party ’s', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Seoul', 'Se - hoon', 'Saenuri', 'Yoo Seung - min', 'Hankook Research', 'Ahn ’s', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Jeolla', 'the Minjoo Party', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Ahn ’s', 'U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Park Won - soon']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47989699  0.34005129

The Constitution has often been at the center of political discourse, especially near the end of a presidential term, since South Korea last changed it in 1987.While Cheong Wa Dae has yet to announce that it will seek to change the law anytime soon, some senior lawmakers began to float the idea that the 20-year-old law should be replaced with a new one that reflects the postdemocratization political landscape.“We could not reform politics unless we address the power structure. And the only way to change the power structure is to revise the Constitution. Through this, we should make up for the shortcomings and flaws that the current Constitution has,” said National Assembly Speaker Rep. Chung Ui-hwa last Wednesday. Lawmakers attend the last plenary session of the National Assembly of 2015 on Dec. 31. Historically, the idea of revising the Constitution to change the single five-year presidency term has been broached by opposition figures seeking to seize the next administration. Former President Kim Dae-jung, while head of the Democratic Peace Party, suggested amending the law to introduce a system similar to a run-off vote. Another political heavyweight Kim Jong-pil, the former chairman of the United Liberal Democrats, pushed for a presidential system to be amended to a cabinet system. The “DJP  union” between then-President Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong-pil from the 1997 election was also based on the premise of revising the Constitution. Each time, however, the debate was toppled by radically changing political interests.The same occurred when then-President Roh Moo-hyun proposed the “one-point revision” during his tenure of 2003-2008. He proposed to allow presidents to seek reelection, while limiting theirs terms to four years, mirroring the U.S.’ presidential terms. However, he was turned down by the opposition Grand National Party, the predecessor to the Saenuri Party.The debate was rekindled by the Lee Myung-bak administration, which also called for changes on other items such as inter-Korean relations and climate change.But his efforts fizzled and they faced backlash from opposition lawmakers who criticized the move as a political gimmick to prevent a lame duck presidency and consolidate his post-presidency power. To rule out any such political calculations, it was perceived to be most appropriate to start the talks at the beginning of an administration.Rival parties had likewise pledged to change the Constitution during the 2012 presidential election, and the parties had even agreed to set up a parliamentary body to discuss the revision, the first of its kind at the National Assembly. The pledge has yet to materialize, as politicians weigh the pros and cons.President Park Geun-hye, after having pledged on the campaign trail to pursue a constitutional amendment, dismissed the idea of constitutional reform and even rebuked ruling Saenuri party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung for suggesting the idea in 2014. Since then, the debate has been phased out.But observers forecast that 2016 will play out differently for those seeking a revision. They highlighted that the move would gain momentum, signaled by how close aides to President Park began to speak out about the need for change and outlined specified alternatives to the current single five-term presidency recently.“ found it extremely hard to stay consistent in their policy during their single five-term presidency,” said Rep. Choi Kyung-hwan in November when he served as deputy prime minister. Choi’s remark was seen as an endorsement for two-term four-year presidential limits.Rep. Hong Moon-jong, a vocal pro-Park member of the Saenuri Party, said in November that the nation should seek to change the current presidential structure into a semipresidential system, a power-sharing structure where a president manages foreign affairs and a prime minister oversees internal issues at home.Notching up the level of contention, Hong said it was “feasible” that the president and the ruling party would seek to place a politician close to President Park as the new prime minister and United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as the next president when his term ends in December 2016.Cheong Wa Dae and the Saenuri Party’s mainstream lawmakers dismissed the plan as an individual opinion that came out of nowhere. The main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea denounced it, saying it revealed their “ulterior motive.”“I don’t think that we can change the Constitution before the 2016 general elections. If the Saenuri Party wants to amend the Constitution, it should propose the plan as part of its election pledges. Given this, I cannot help but question the intention of Hong’s remarks,” The Minjoo Party chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in said at the time.The Minjoo Party suspects that the scheme is being devised to sustain President Park’s political dominance even after her term. The party argues that Hong’s version of a semipresidential system might create a political landscape in favor of the ruling conservative party.Demographically speaking, a system where the prime minister is picked through an election who would then form the Cabinet under semipresidential rule is more likely to land a victory to the conservative party, because voters residing in the conservative southeastern constituencies outnumber those living in the opposition stronghold in the southwest.Analysts have said that the 2016 April election would determine the fate of the amendment talks. They noted that the presidential office and the ruling party would seek to change the law if they secured more than 200 seats, a mark required for the ruling party to push through the move despite the opposition of rival parties. It would only be a matter of time before Park toys with the idea as well, although she remains hesitant as a full-fledged debate on the Constitution would most likely dwarf all other pending policies and agenda items.By law, a constitutional amendment requires proposal from a president or half of lawmakers in the 300-strong National Assembly. Then, the motion needs to be approved by more than two-thirds of lawmakers. Lastly, the people must cast a vote on the amendment in a special referendum.“The only impediment to the amendment is President Park’s opposition. It means that the amendment plan will become viable when Park agrees to the constitutional change. I believe that the president would OK the plan after the elections,” Lee Cheol-hee, director of the Dumun Political Strategy Institute, wrote in a media column.The Constitution has been revised nine times since it was first promulgated in 1948. The first revision came in 1952. The revisions have often taken place when authoritarian leaders sought to extend their tenure, or the people wanted to overthrow a despotic president.By Yeo Jun-suk","presidents to seek reelection while ,hwa last wednesday lawmakers attend ,revising the constitution to change ,liberal democrats pushed for presidential ,lawmakers attend the last plenary","['South Korea', 'Dae', 'National Assembly', 'Chung Ui - hwa', 'the National Assembly of 2015', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'the Democratic Peace Party', 'Kim Jong - pil', 'the United Liberal', 'Democrats', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'Kim Jong - pil', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'U.S.', 'Grand National Party', 'the Saenuri Party', 'the Lee Myung - bak', 'inter - korean', 'the National Assembly', 'Park Geun', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'Park', 'Choi Kyung - hwan', 'Choi ’s', 'Hong Moon', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Hong', 'Park', 'United Nations', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Hong ’s', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Hong', 'Cabinet', 'National Assembly', 'Park', 'Lee Cheol - hee', 'the Dumun Political Strategy Institute', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.6240468   0.56770712

732,732, Park’s lame duck deadline looms,"The political clock is ticking for President Park Geun-hye.With the next presidential race two years away, the incumbent state leader would normally have more time on her hands before entering her lame-duck period.But in reality, Park is under pressure to come up with impressive achievements by April’s general election.

If not, she might lose the spotlight to potential presidential candidates and their campaigns.President Park Geun-hye The president’s advantage is that she has successfully allocated her close aides in key government posts while maintaining a sizable grip on the ruling party through a number of her bigwig associates. Also, her average approval rating has held firm in the 40 percent range despite several setbacks, reflecting an unwavering base of support.Her weakness, however, is that very few of her key campaigns on social and economic reform have produced tangible results. Her economic reform initiatives, touted as the only option to save the economy, have been dragged into political debate, with a challenging outlook for their implementation.The public backlash against her chief accomplishments last year, including the reinstatement of state-authored history textbooks and the recent deal with Japan on wartime sex slavery, are also boosting anti-Park sentiment.In her New Year address, Park underscored that she would dedicate this year to revitalizing the economy by boosting domestic demand and creating jobs.“I will achieve reforms in the labor, financial, education and public sectors and also complete the three-year economic innovation plan,” the president said.The first chance to build momentum is the last plenary session of the National Assembly’s extraordinary session Friday, by which time the administration and the ruling party had been pushing to pass the related bills. With negative external economic factors threatening to dent the economy, which is largely dependent on exports, Park emphasized the need for a contingency plan to prevent crisis.In a Cabinet reshuffle in late December, Park nominated former Land Minister Rep. Yoo Il-ho of the ruling Saenuri Party as finance minister and vice prime minister. Former head of the Korea Institute of Public Finance, Yoo is an expert in tax and financial affairs, but this was not the only reason for his nomination.He is also a close aide to Park, and therefore a predictable successor to Choi Kyung-hwan, who will soon step down from his current post and return to his parliamentary seat.“For the sake of consistency, I will mostly uphold Choi’s key policies,” Yoo said, implying that he, too, will act as guardian and executor of the president’s economic reform plans.But the task ahead of Park and her men appears more grueling than they would like, as Assembly strife means that passing the bills will not be straightforward.Another hurdle for Park is the public’s growing resistance toward the government following the recent deal with Japan on the surviving former sex slaves. In a “final and irreversible” agreement, Japan agreed to pay 1 billion yen  for Seoul to establish a fund for the victims, prompting angry opposition from victims and progressives, who said the agreement was made without their consent or consultation. In a Realmeter survey, 50.8 percent of surveyed adults nationwide disapproved of the agreement, while 43.2 percent approved, with the response varying dramatically by age and region. Meanwhile, Park’s approval rating has continued to remain steady, showing an unwavering level of support from her home city of Daegu and from elderly voters.Surveys by local pollsters Gallup Korea and Realmeter respectively showed Park’s rating at 43 percent and 42.1 percent, as of the end of 2015.On the diplomatic front, Park is expected to engage in bilateral exchanges with Japan and Russia this year. Both are countries to which Park is yet to make a summit visit. She held talks with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in November 2013, and with Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last November. Park had been withholding her visit to Moscow over the Ukraine conflict. News reports have predicted that Park may be participating in the 2nd Eastern Economic Forum to be held in September in Vladivostok.There is some speculation that Park will visit Tokyo around May, when Japan is hosting the G7 summit.By Bae Hyun-jung","next presidential race two years ,next presidential race two ,presidential race two years away ,next presidential race ,the next presidential race two","['Park Geun - hye', 'Park', 'Park Geun', 'Japan', 'anti - park', 'Park', 'the National Assembly ’s', 'Park', 'Cabinet', 'Park', 'Yoo Il - ho', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Korea Institute of Public Finance', 'Yoo', 'Park', 'Choi Kyung - hwan', 'Choi ’s', 'Yoo', 'Assembly', 'Park', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Park ’s', 'Daegu', 'Gallup Korea', 'Realmeter', 'Park ’s', 'Park', 'Japan', 'Russia', 'Park', 'russian', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Japan', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Moscow', 'Ukraine', 'Park', 'Vladivostok', 'Park', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'G7', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.78129172  0.18776602
